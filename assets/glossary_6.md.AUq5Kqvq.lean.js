The warrior doesn't fumble over his declarations of love. Neither of them is searching for someone to make them whole. This kind of parity isn't seen often enough in life, let alone in romantic fiction.Oh, one more little thing: The story happens to be wonderfully written, with a subtle command of the language that makes the book fast-paced without being rushed."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"A friend of mine loaned me separate copies of Shards of Honor and Barrayar, then ended up buying me the two-in-one edition because I was so reluctant to give them back. Since then I have re-read it until it is falling apart. There's no higher praise I can give a book than that. Cordelia's Honor is one of those books that alters your worldview, changes your life, and sits on your top shelf forevermore. It's a love story but it's a lot more than that. It's the story of how two determined people from very different backgrounds meet, fall in love and go on to change their worlds for the better. Cordelia and Aral become like real people you actually know--better still, they become your friends. If you haven't read this story, you don't know what you're missing--it is INCREDIBLE."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Captain Cordelia Naismith is a strong female hero, and the second part of this two-novel repackaging is particularly noteworthy in giving us a science fiction adventure with a pregnant hero. I first read this book when I didn't realize I was pregnant, and it was the perfect way to start into that great 9-month adventure.The first novel in the volume, Shards of Honor, is a space-adventure-romance which might be described as military science fiction as it might have been written by Jane Austen: two mature, intelligent, and principled characters overcoming differences (rooted in complex social situations) to find a way to be together without compromising their sense of honor.In the second novel, Barrayar, the pregnant Cordelia must use all her courage and ingenuity to bring her baby, the future Lord Miles Vorkosigan, through a planetary civil war alive. She concludes that the only thing to do is to change the world to make it fit for her child -- and all children. I recommend this book (and Cordelia's conclusion) to fans of romantic science fiction &amp; female action heroes. Especially if they happen to be pregnant!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"By Ed BurkheadShards of Honor: This book tells about how two really capable people met, fell in love, &quot;fought&quot; on oposite sides of a war, and handled the end of the war. As is obvious from the title, honor and doing one's duty is high in the theme of the book. But it also includes a lot of humor, pathos, struggle, etc. You will begin to really like the characters in these stories.Barrayar: The couple, now married and pregnant, have assumed the job of being regents for the planet's child emperor. The child's emperor's vulnerability tempts a rebellion which must be overcome.Bujold has created fictional characters I care about. If only they were real I would dearly love to move in with them and be part of their family. In spite of their faults, or more often because of them, their accomplishments approach super-human -- as they fall on their faces.Though most all of the story in both books included in this volume is really engaging, let me summarize with this: near the end of Barrayar, stoic me both leaked actual tears then laughed out loud while reading a single page.These, followed by &quot;Warrior's Apprentice,&quot; and the rest of Bujold's books are now my 1st choice to recommend to anyone. Shards of Honor and Barrayar are chronologically 1st and 2nd in the lives of the characters. Feel free to read Warrior's Apprentice first if you choose."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Perhaps it's just the books I've been grabbing lately, but I've had a hard time finding lead female characters I like. They're either whiny, weak, and wishy washy or they're buttkicking Alpha females that make Demi Moore's GI Jane look like a pushover (I don't know many people like that in real life, and the ones I do... I can't stand. I'm not sure why there are so many proliferating the pages of fiction).Cordelia is a strong competent character without being able to beat the snot out of platoons of men single-handedly. She's smart and likable and I wish there had been more books written through her eyes.Shards of Honor 3.5 starsThis is the first adventure and our introduction to Cordelia and Aral. I enjoyed the characters from the first pages (this is the most important thing for me as a reader) but I could tell it was the author's first book. There's less complexity than many of those that follow in the series, and some parts dragged (like when Cordelia is back home dealing with the family and therapist). I did like the \\"shards of honor\\" theme though and the issues Aral was wrestling with. He's probably a little too perfect of a male lead but this gave him depth and made me cheer for these characters to get together. By the end of the novel, I definitely wanted to read on. Which was easy to do since the next book started on the next page!Barrayar 5+ starsBarrayar is the one that won the Hugo and I can see why. It deals with a lot of issues you just don't see much in SF. Like the protagonist being pregnant, for one. Cordelia's mission in this one is to keep her unborn son safe, and thanks to the unstable political situation she really has to fight to achieve it. The victory is hard won, and I will read this again just to get to the spot with the shopping bag delivery (fellow readers will know what I'm talking about).A wonderfully original story, a strong supporting cast, and a satisfying conclusion. 5 stars.*In response to the reviewers who gave these books low ratings because it was more romance than science fiction, I'd actually agree (not that this diminished my enjoyment of the book). I recommend this series for people who like fantasy adventures and space opera such as Star Trek. It doesn't hurt if you like romance (there's nothing bigger than a kiss on the page but Shards of Honor, in particular, is first and foremost about two characters falling in love)."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"The covers do not do this series justice.I could kick myself for smirking at these books in the bookstore because the covers looked, well er, lame. 20 years later I am very glad to have discovered the series and hope you will too. Cordelia's Honor is the first book of the 12 book series that is still ongoing. I discovered all this by accident when I got a free copy of one of the books. I very quickly realized this was going to be one of the best science fiction series out there and went and bought them all. I got my brother hooked a short time later. In short, the series is what good books *should* be . . . Suspense, great characters that grow and change, incredible realistic descriptions of the future universe that is very plausible. You might even lose sleep reading on until the end. I haven't had books keep me up at night in ages . . . The stories themselves are so tightly written as to make them compulsively readable.

I'd love a digit version of Cordelia's Honor and wish Bujold had written more about Cordelia. The glimpses we get of her in later books shows that Barrayar doesn't change her character, her toughness, and her compassion. Great, great \\"space opera\\" it is really a character driven work that explores many issues--the effect of environment and technology on national character, the roles of women, and the nature of love. This belongs in anyone's \\"keeper\\" pile and can be read and re-read time and again. A true classic of SF it can tempt romance fans into reading SF or prove to SF fans that romance is readable.

Perfect book for comfort reading. I have read it so many times that my old copy fell apart. A book which has everything - it has action, it has moral dilemmas, it has suspense, it has romance (but not of a syrupy cliche kind), it has good writing, and it has a strong but not man-hating heroine."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I whipped through this book (actually 2 books) in no time. From the first scene in Shards of Honor I was hooked. The interplay between purported enemies was instantly intriguing. I really need to get back to these and read the Miles Vorkosigan books. I have heard that Bujold's wrir\\\\ting only gets better as the series goes on. If so, I am in for a real treat because these first two books were very entertaining. Good mix of intrigue, action, and romance. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Lois McMaster Bujold is one of the best writers out there today, period. She's not afraid to put her characters into tough situations and she's not afraid to take risks.Every time I read her books I am impressed all over again by how well she draws the reader into the universe where Cordelia and Aral live. I especially love all of Cordelia's comments about the barbarous Barrayaran society she's chosen to live in.I have recommended this book to several people and all have enjoyed it. Others in the series that blew me away with their intensity were Memory and Komarr (her two latest about Cordelia and Aral's son, Miles.)"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This book is a compilation containing, _Shards of Honor_ and _Barrayar_. Militaristic societies just aren't my thing and I wouldn't normally read books that focus on military heroes and war time exploits. So what got me to read these books? Cordelia. She's intelligent, independent, and in charge.Cordelia is captain of a Betan expeditiary force exploring a new planet. Most of her crew are killed and she and her remaining crewmember, who is seriously injured, are taken prison by Aral Vorkosigan.In their journey across the planet, Cordelia and Aral come to admire and trust each other. When next they met, they are on opposite sides of a nasty war. Honor and duty. These two strong characters must each in their own way come to terms with their committment to their subordinates, their governments, and themselves.Cordelia is a strong character. One that I enjoyed meeting. Her honesty and integrity helped get me involved in this series."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"As said in many previous reviews, Cordelia's Honor is actually two books (Shards of Honor and Barryar) combined to one. These tell the story of Cordeila Naismith and the circumstances that led her marriage to Aral Vorkorsigan and the birth of Miles Vorkorsigan.Both of these books are excellent examples of Bujold's strength: superb characters and character development combined with thoughtfull and clever politcal plots. Her writing is strong for the genre and fast paced enough to be universal for most readers. Her characters are lovable, intersting, and fully fleshed out in their flaws and emotions. Cordelia is not as amazing and epic character as Miles turns out to be but her story in interesting enought to warrant two books. It's not coincidence that Bujold has won and been nominated for more Hugo Awards over the last 15 years than anyone else....(although some might not be deserved).For those of thinking about getting into the large undertaking that is the Vorkorsigan I highly recommend starting here AND reading the books in chronoligical order (not the order they were written in). Besides being a good story these two books introduce you to the somewhat politically complicated universe the series takes place in. This series has some minor adult themes and violence but I would say it's appropriate for anyone of high school age up.In 1991 Barrayar (the second story in this book) won the Hugo Award and was nominated for a Nebula. As far as the Hugo goes, it was generally considered a weak year, as evident by fantastically horrific and dissapointing Xenocide even being nominated. Needless to say I would rank Barrayar at the top of the bottom 1/3 of Hugo winners....still worth reading for sure.Bottom Line: A must read for anyone looking to get into the Vorkorsigan series or fans of charcter driven sci fi operas."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Let's all agree on this right up front: the covers of the Vorkosigan Saga books are horrible. Just plain awful. The cover art for anything published by Baen is pretty bad, enough to make even the proud nerds of today cringe and place the book face-down whenever possible to avoid being snickered at. But these covers in particular, with their dramatic poses and odd retro fonts, seem to house a strange breed of quasi-historical space pulp that embodies everything that \\"serious readers\\" should avoid. And that's a damned shame, because Bujold writes fantastic, accessible science fiction. Were I to browse this by cover instead of trying out a no-frills ebook version, I may well have never discovered it.I'll try to stick to well-known details, but there are a few mild spoilers here if you want to fly completely blind. Cordelia's Honor is an omnibus, comprising two separately published novels: Shards of Honor and Barrayar. These two books represent the first chronological stories in the sprawling Vorkosigan Saga, and begin a generation before the introduction of that saga's hero, Miles. Shards of Honor begins with Betan explorer Captain Cordelia Naismith, attempting to chart a new, unclaimed world. Her party is surprised and attacked by a squad of the warlike Barryarans, and she barely escapes with her life. She finds herself lost on an unfamiliar planet, and thanks to a mutiny within the Barryaran ranks, she is forced to rely on a gruff Barrayaran outcast named Aral Vorkosigan, better known to her people as the Butcher of Komarr. She comes to know him better than she would ever have guessed during their ordeal in the wild, and their understanding of one another becomes crucial when they meet again, once the reason for the Barrayarans' presence on the untouched world becomes clear and their respective peoples stand on the brink of a brutal war.The second book, Barrayar, picks up on the titular planet. Having forsaken her homeworld of Beta Colony after her unpleasant homecoming, Cordelia attempts to build a peaceful life with her new husband and the eventual birth of their son. However, after the Barrayaran emperor dies, Aral Vorkosigan finds himself manipulated into being the regent for the child heir, and thus a prime target for those lusting after the child heir's power. An attempted assassination has dire consequences for Cordelia's unborn child, and before she and Aral can gain their balance, a Barrayaran noble launches an insurrection and attempts to seize control of the empire through force. Cordelia, loath to accept the responsibilities placed on her by political momentum, must decide how far she is willing to go to rescue her fledgling family, and how much she should compromise her personal ethics in order to do so.This is the second collected omnibus of sequential novels that I've read in the past year (third if you count graphic novels), and I'm starting to notice a distinct feeling that the novels contained within such volumes work a lot better together than they do apart. I can't decide whether that's a psychosomatic thing that's brought on by there being so many pages left after getting through one book; I finished Shards of Honor feeling like more should have happened, and glad that I had a second half to move on to. In retrospect, I think that has everything to do with Bujold's writing style, and I'm pretty sure I would have liked each book on its own, had I approached them that way. These books are referred to as a \\"saga,\\" and that's an appropriate label. This is the first entry in a space opera that spans great distances, unravels intricate political intrigues, and narrates epic battles, but it's immediately clear that the books are first and foremost about the characters. The saga follows the rise and fall of its players, and the landmark events in the plot provide the catalyst and backdrop for the landmark changes in the character arcs. This is what makes these books transcend pulp sci-fi and confirms them as a great choice for anyone who wants to read a good story.There are a couple of snags, though. The characters are pitch-perfect, but their dialogue can get a little awkward from time to time. The narration is also a little odd, as well, especially in Shards of Honor. Bujold tends to get a little informal with the narrative voice, occasionally letting Cordelia's sardonic humor bleed into the exposition and narration. Compounding this problem is the lack of italics or any other device to differentiate character thoughts in the first book, making the whole story feel a little slapdash. There was apparently a fair amount of time between the publication of the first book of this story arc and the second, and it definitely shows; Barrayar is much more tightly plotted, better paced, and efficiently narrated than Shards of Honor, displaying Bujold's evolution as an author between the two stories. Standing as a testament to her talent, however, the joining of the actual story is seamless and natural.I am to understand that the Vorkosigan books don't really get going until we get into the exploits of Miles Vorkosigan, but as a newcomer to the series, I found this book to be a wonderful introduction to this particular world(s) and set of characters. It gives insight into the politics and technology of two distinct planets without seeming either contrived or confusing, leaving plenty of room to get to know wonderfully nuanced characters like Cordelia, Aral, Droushnakovi, and my favorite, Bothari. This gets a solid recommendation to any science fiction reader that puts a premium on good characters."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is a wonderful sci-fi book written by a female author featuring a strong female main character. This compendium of two books follows the path of Cordelia Naismith through the story of how she meets her husband and how her son, Miles comes to be. It is a wonderful tale filled with difficult situations, confronted by a (mostly) wonderfully intelligent main character. What is so enjoyable about this story is the human reasoning that the author brings the reader through in each of the characters. Throughout the two books in this story, the characters are faced with tremendously difficult moral and social choices, each of which could be potentially real. In almost all of the instances we get to see the main characters struggle and reason with their choices and their consequences. The characters are wonderfully well sculpted and the stories here are a nice snapshot look at the development of politics, war and relationships on the two worlds we explored. Cultures clash to an extent here and we seem them clash on a interpersonal level. I am guess that these are perhaps passing remarks towards Earth's society, which is briefly hinted at in the book, but never explained.Nothing comes easy to Cordelia and her husband Aral in these stories, but we are painted a striking picture of their tremendous character. It is not very often that we get to read a book, let a lone a sci-fi book with a fully competent female lead such as this one as well as a male lead who is struggling with his own inner demons and the politics of his planet. There is only one lapse in the overall character narrative that takes place at the end of this book which forced me to \\"suspend by disbelief\\" as Cordelia goes on a full on suicide mission behind enemy lines to rescue her son. Other than that though this book is wonderfully well written and shows a great relationship and character development between the two main characters as they fight through mutiny, love, rebellion and personal friendship. ."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"It was a good book overall. It was a little slow at times but it was worth it. I think it's almost essential to read this book before the next book \\"Young Miles\\" which includes The Warriors Apprentice, The Mountains of Mourning, and The Vor Game. There are 20 books in all in the series with 8 omnibus books."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"\\"Cordelia's Honor\\" (an omnibus edition of the two books \\"Shards of Honor\\" and \\"Barrayar\\") is the introduction to Lois McMaster Bujold's critically acclaimed and fantastically successful Vorkosigan series; she's written 16 books in the series (with a 17th in progress), and I'd say each is better than the last if it weren't clearly impossible to top the Awesome that is Cordelia Naismith's story. Cordelia has informed a lot of my own ideas about female heroines who can be kickass without being pseudo-men; about male heroes who can be both romantic leads and fiercely compelling protagonists in their own right; about happily-ever-afters, and how the story never ends there. All this amid interstellar exploration, interplanetary war, assassinations, a coup, a civil war, subterfuge, sabotage, escapes, elopements, and shopping.Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan are both older characters--thirty-three and forty-four when they first meet, respectively--and as such they've a wealth of life experiences behind them. But they're still learning, which is something I really, really love. They challenge the prejudices and assumptions of their own and each others' cultures. They struggle with the terrible conflict between staying true to themselves and betraying each other. Cordelia, an astrocartographer from a society built on rationality and civility, is both drawn to and repulsed by warrior aristocrat Aral's culture of honor and blood. Their witty banter makes my heart sing, while some moments can still, on the ninth rereading, move me nearly to tears.Bujold's books are about characters, first and foremost; her afterword to \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" gives her oft-quoted rule for finding plots about character-centered novels, \\"which is to ask 'So what's the worst possible thing I can do to this guy?' And then do it.\\" So her characters are fascinatingly well-drawn, with depths to even the minor guys, like the crippled lieutenant striving desperately to pull himself together in a military-mad society terrified of physical infirmities, or the rigidly self-contained princess who will do anything to ensure her young son's survival. The themes are character-centric as well. Bujold writes in the afterword that the book is ultimately \\"about the price of becoming a parent, particularly but not exclusively a mother,\\" and the fearsome self-transformation parenthood requires. It's about courage, sacrifice, integrity, loyalty, all the things that tie up into the complex concept we call \\"honor\\"--and about the betrayal of it, too. It's the kind of book you can fall in love with on the first reading, and still find something new on the ninth.And it's funny, too.(As a side-note, Barrayar won the 1992 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year, so it's not just me!)"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"If you've never read any of these books, this is part of a space opera series, written by the always excellent Bujold. I love her world building, so interesting and thought provoking, and I love her characters. This is an excellent book, the start of a long and complex series, go read it, it's well worth it!Below is the spoiler, if you are not familiar with the series, don't read just buy the book!I'd read quite of few of the Miles Vorkosigan novels before I came across this one, which is about his parents and how they met, and then the circumstances of his birth.

I felt for all the characters but this is definitely Cordelia's book(s) even though Aral, her love, Miles' father, is a huge part too.

A fun, stirring journey to barrayar, a worthy for anyone's shelf."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Cordelia's Honor is two books written years apart about the same characters. The story is driven by the characters rather than the science. If you like stories that are plot driven and about people you would like to know this is for you. If you want science driven stories you will probably not like it. That said, the first part of the book Shards of Honor has been one of my favorites since I first read it over 20 years ago. Even as an early work by Ms. McMasters it is well written with good character development. It shows that human motivation is the same no matter where you are. Part two continues Cordelia's story within months of the first. Both books show a woman who is basically peaceful in the middle of a war then a civil war. She is also patriotic to her homeland and loyal to her husband. While peaceful co-existantace is always her first choice do not push her. She is militarily trained and will push back, sometimes fatally if needed. She moves from an advanced social society into a more repressed male dominated world and makes a place for herself where she ends up as the female guardian of the next ruler. The male leaders, other than her husband, do not realize how much power she has been given to shape the next generation of social reform.There were several years between the publications of the two books. Ms. McMasters wrote other stories about Cordelia's son in between. Her writing was good and only got better. This is more space opera than hard science but since I like both I would recommend it. I would buy anything by this author."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is a combined edition of Shards of Honor and Barrayar.Barrayar was the first Bujold book I read. Though I managed to finish it, I wasn't impressed by it. Later I read Shards of Honor. Wasn't impressed by it either, although I was already hooked by the Miles books so it was a filled a gap.Upon reading both of these books again for the second time, they are more funny and wholesome than on the first readings. But Mirror Dance surpasses both of these books, so give it a shot even if you didn't like this book (and try to at least get to the part where Miles gets cryo-frozen)."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I love this story. The book is actually a combination of Shards of Honor and Barrayar. Lois Bujold's series is wonderful. Her writing gets better and better, but Barrayar is really my favorite of the series. Please note that the synopsis they're listing is totally wrong. The marriage is neither forced nor unwanted, he's not her arch enemy, and the heir to the throne is not an infant! Ignore the synopsis, but definitely read the book, and the rest of Bujold's work as well."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I know that Lois McMaster Bujold has many fans and nothing I can say here would remotely change their opinion. \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" is a trade paperback combo of her books \\"Shards of Honor\\" ('86) and \\"Barrayar\\" ('91); the latter being a Hugo Award winner.Of the two books, \\"Shards of Honor\\" is considerably better although both books are badly flawed. For readers under 40, it's helpful to know than in the late 70s/early 80s, there was a real push for more feminism in Sci Fi, women starship captains, active women characters, political correctness...all of which was needed to counteract the old Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s which was written by, for and about men. And don't think I wasn't in favor of all this...I was as rabid on this issue as a Women's Studies professor at Berkeley, LOL! But most books that came out of this political/feminist agenda are just not very good and these two by Lois Bujold are an excellent example of why.For starters, this just barely qualifies as Sci Fi due to the presence of other planets, starships, faster than light travel and so on. Clearly the thrust of the books is the conflict between the modern sterile society of Beta Colony (Cordelia's home planet -- read as \\"USA\\") and the backwards, violant society of Barrayar (Vorkosigan's home planet -- read as Russia, pre-Soviet). There is next to nothing about other worlds in this imaginary universe or even how far in the future it is supposed to be taking place. Ms. Bujold is stolidly uninterested in sci fi technology, science or gadgetry (even though Cordelia is nominally a scientist), so there is virtually nothing here that is speculative about a possible future society. In fact, the whole thing reads as more of a New World/Old World clash, and by that I don't mean planets, I mean the words as they define America vs. Europe.Barrayar is impossible to see as anything but a conventional, Old World European society (circa pre-WWI), what with its Emperor, castles, courtiers, and nobility. The WORST thing I feel Ms. Bujold does in this whole series is the adaptation of the pre-fix \\"Vor\\" to all the noble Barrayaran surnames. It is all too painfully obvious that this reads as the word \\"War\\" as pronounced by someone with a very heavy Eastern European accent -- you know, someone who prounces all the \\"w's\\" like \\"v's\\". It's just plain embarassing. Furthermore, it makes sorting out the characters -- at least half have \\"Vor-\\" names -- unusally difficult.While a good love story in a Sci Fi setting would be very welcome, and Cordelia and Vorkosigan are appealingly written, their romance comes off as a standard Harlequin model. Vorkosigan in particular seems cut from a very familar bolt of cloth...the one marked \\"Mr. Rochester (Jane Eyre\\". He's gruff but deeply romantic, and falls in love with the heroine (who is a plain Jane) almost instantly, asking for her hand in marriage before they ever make love or even kiss. Don't forget his flashing grey eyes because they are mentioned every few chapters.While the first book is so clean and non-sexual (with one exception I will get to later) it is suitable for 12 year old readers, in the second book Ms. Bujold attempts to tackle more adult relationships with very weak results. The worst of it is a romance between two servants, called improbably Drou (DROO) and Kou (KOO)...just try saying that aloud. It's full of all kinds of cute misunderstandings right out of a TV sitcom. (And ends happily in a wedding of course.)The descriptions of artificial wombs -- very critical to the plot -- is handled so poorly that you can hardly imagine how they work...and how would you end up having something that sophisticated in a universe where the 33 year old heroine is seriously worried about having a baby because she feels she's \\"getting too old\\"? Lots of reproductive tech on one hand...none on the other.That brings me to the factor that annoyed me the most. Ms. Bujold, working in every hip, PC plot thread she could, has the hero Vorkosigan being bisexual...sort of. He has an early arranged marriage, and when his wife cheats on him with two lovers, he challenges the two lovers to duels and kills them. Subsequently, his wife commits suicide (?). But then, very inexplicably, he enters into a long term homosexual relationship with an older, powerful man. Because of his grief over his wife's suicide or his upset over her infidelity or both. Then when he meets the heroine, it's back to heterosexuality for him, without a look back!I can only think that the author felt she was being very cool, sophisticated and up-to-the-minute (in '86) with this detail. It's referenced once in each book and then not really gone into, although I think in REAL LIFE, this would be AWFULLY important. Trust me, people who flip back and forth between sexual preferences are usually confused and very troubled. And there is nothing romantic about that. We hear nothing at all to explain why Vorkosigan wanted a male lover, or what the heck made him decide he liked women better after all (besides how terrific Cordelia is). It also plays into a dangerous and untrue stereotype that homosexuality isn't \\"real\\" and all it takes it the \\"right\\" woman to put a guy back on the track. Just very, very disturbing and I see that none of the other reviewers here even mention it.Beyond that, despite some decent adventure scenes, you are in familar territory here that has been well mined (one might say \\"strip mined) by Star Trek, Star Wars, etc. Lots of ball gowns, dinner dances, horseback riding, swords that sounds like light sabers and gibberish about politics. Whenever anyone in any Sci Fi starts talking about \\"emperors\\" or \\"high council meetings\\", my eyelids get very heavy.I find these books just terribly overrated. There are some good stories still to be told about strong women in Sci Fi -- and these are NOT them. In a couple of decades, this kind of writing will be very dated to the 80s period because of the tired references and sexual attitudes."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This book may have won a Hugo award but that doesn't mean its good. This book is actually a romance novel."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I guess I'm in the minority, but I was very disappointed with the second half of this book, the award-winning Barrayar. Shards of Honor was good, although sometimes my suspension of disbelief was challenged, and there were some pretty glaringly amateur areas--the question/answer chapters.But Barrayar was full of cliched characters and plot. Predictable, nauseating. Cordelia is not the same woman she was in Shards of Honor. She is now a self-righteous foreigner who belittles the existing society of Barrayar, and Aral is reduced to a cardboard \\"Yes Dear\\" cutout. That really saddened me--he was the best part of Shards. Bujold seems to have expanded her overly-zealous mad-feminist and mommy-hood theme (which made me gag), reveling in pregnancy and birth (I've been there, done that, and can't say I find her story believable). Was it just the milleu of the '80s? It felt anachronistic to me."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is a reprint of two books I have read.

This is one really good writer giving you a look at humanity from several viewpoints."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Definitely not hard sci-fi a la Vernor Vinge or even Larry Niven, but still a good space opera. It's a refreshing change to have strong women in science fiction novels, and Cordelia qualifies as an exceptionally strong and sympathetic protagonist.Bujold also confronts the issues of rape and torture that inhabit war's dark underbelly. She does so indirectly and without resorting to graphic scenes of voyeuristic torture, but it is nice to see these issues dealt with soberly rather than ignored as they are in many of the sci-fi and fantasy novels I've read.One downside of reading too much anthropology is that I get annoyed when sci-fi shows and novels reduce all the civilizations of an entire planet to a few simple characteristics (Klingons are warlike, Vulcans are logical, Endor is a \\"forest\\" moon that evidently doesn't have any other ecosystems, etc). This novel is guilty of this, although Barrayar, the civilization that the reader gets the closest look at, is fairly interesting."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I know this series has been out for a while but, I just had to do this one-size-fits-all review of Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan saga. First of all, if you haven't read this series, clear your calendar and just do it. Don't worry about reading it in any particular order either (by chronology or publication date). The first one of these books to find its way into your hands is the first one you should read. The only exception to this rule would be \\"A Civil Campaign,\\" because of the gathering of all the old characters and extensive references to past events, you should save this one for the last. (How does she keep track of all this stuff?)Miles Vorkosigan is the most unlikely hero you will ever meet. The deck was stacked against him before he was born. He's not big, or fast, or strong. His body is bent and his bones are weak thanks to a poison gas attack on his mother while she carried him. All he has is his brain. But what a brain! His brain is a hyperactive trouble magnet with an uncanny ability to land him directly in the center of every whirlwind of danger he comes across. Fortunately this remarkable brain is smart enough to get him out of trouble time and again as well.Set in mankind's distant future where space fairing is routine and bio-technology has produced many wonders, Miles Vorkosigan engages valiantly in the struggle to protect his home world of Barrayar and its imperium from the plots of its neighboring planetary systems. Born into the Vor aristocracy of Barrayar, Mile is an outcast on his home world due to his deformities. Nonetheless, he manages to rise to the occasion and find a place for himself and his talents in the highest levels of the empire.The combination of high tech space adventure and old world political intrigue makes this series stand out. The characters are at once deeply human and vividly rendered in a writing style that envelopes the reader. As I have said before, you don't read one of Lois McMaster Bujold's books; you enter her world (worlds in this case). Each and every one of the books in this series is witty, emotionally deep, sexy, and mildly disturbing. In other words, perfect. If you haven't read this series yet you are in for a big treat. It gets my highest recommendation. Go ahead ... spoil yourself.Reviewed by Hugh Mannfield at [...]"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Before I picked up the two novels comprising this book (Shards of Honor and Barrayar), I somehow managed to completely miss the Lois Bujold phenomenon known as the Miles Vorkosigan series. Something about some love affair between a captain and a naive astrocartographer just didn't seem like my idea of good SF, whatever the rave reviews... Boy, was I ever wrong.Don't take these two novels as just a prequel to the Miles Vorkosigan stories. Frankly, they're totally awesome in their own right. Cordelia is a fantastic protagonist, working both as a naive narrator, amazed at the workings of a militaristic empire as much as the readers, but she also comes from a fascinating society in her own right, which is far removed from our world, it seems, as Barrayar is.Cordelia, truth be told, is a breath of fresh air in today's SF. Yes, we've seen heroines before, but most of the times, they are clumsily written by men who seem to only grasp their way of thinking on the surface. Cordelia is a living, breathing woman, feminine in outlook yet incredibly brave and strong by men's standards, and she somehow manages to keep her own self intact in the face of a dramatically patriarcal and militaristic society.That's what Cordelia's Honor is, at the heart: the story of a woman's survival in a patriarcal society, and the way she inevitably changes it, and changes herself. By the end of the second novel, I was stunned at the significance of Miles' birth... How he is, for better or for worse, the product of this clash of cultures, and how scarred he has been by the clash even before he was born. Cordelia's first words to him are so terribly poignant in that regard.As I move on to read the story of Miles himself, I mourn the disappearance of a cherished SF character. I already miss Cordelia's -voice-, her mesmerizing insight into the society of men she was transplanted in. My hat is off to Mrs. Bujold, for one of SF's most human yet memorable characters."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Good ole Lois - for those of you sci/fi and fantasy fans who care more about the quality of the writing and characterization than how the spaceship engines work: Just grab anything; and I mean anything, written by this author. I don't care if she titles it \\"What I Did On My Summer Vacation\\", it'll be a completely absorbing and terrifically entertaining book. This one is a great place to start your addiction to the Bujold universe - it kicks off the Miles Vorkosigan series, and carries quite a kick of its own!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Cordelia's Honor starts off fast-paced; the story of Cordelia Naismith who's on a survey expedition on a new planet. When her crew and equipment are destroyed, she quickly realises that there is danger and she and an ensign escape. Until, they are attacked by Barrayarans. Cordelia falls of a cliff and is knocked unconscious - upon awakening, she realises she has become the captive of an enemy of hers who's also known as the Butcher of Komarr.Whilst in his company, Cordelia learns that he's not a butcher at all, but a rather sensitive man in his forties who has enemies among Cordelia's enemies. Cordelia begins to learn of the political intricacies that surround Barrayara, and also realises that she has fallen in love with her captor, a Lord Vorkosigan - next in line to the emperor.In the first part of the book, Cordelia still feels a tug of returning &quot;home&quot; to her own planet, and sets herself free of Vorkosigan whilst eliminating a large part of his enemies. The second book starst with Cordelia's home-coming - a terrifying ordeal which requires her to undergo severe psychological counseling. Unfortunately, her actions and thoughts are misinterpreted, and she realises that &quot;home&quot; is no longer that for her.Cordelia decides to join her love and runs away to the enemy planet. There, she becomes Lady Vorkosigan, and eventually a very powerful figure within the political intricacies of the world.A stunning book, with powerful emotion and beautifully written. In her afterwrod, the author says she had trouble putting this prequel to the Vorkosigan series together. At times, we feel her struggle, but the book is never boring, and sets the stage for the story of Miles - the handicapped son of the Vorkosigans."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"It's fun to follow a series you enjoy from the publishing of the first novel, where you can feel your enjoyment grows with the evolution of the series - I feel like I'm in on the secret of how good the series is from the start. But what a joy it is to find an established series and gorge yourself on it to repletion. This is what I have found with the reading of this the first 2 books combined into one volume of the multi Hugo award winning series Vorkosigan Series. It is densely written, full of emotions, politics (yes, Bjuold is able to successfully merge the two), military manoeuvrings and to some extent science. Something for every reader of both science fantasy, and I think also science fiction.These 2 books (Shards of Honor and Barrayar) are well paired together. They feature the story of how Cordelia Naismith, eventually Mile's mother, comes to meet Lord Aral Vorkosigan. In Shards of Honor the two \`enemies' come to find each other, to survive physical hardship together, and to conquer their emotional pain and fear together. Literally from different worlds, they must play the star crossed pair for most of the book, and Bjuold describes well the pain and loss that Cordelia feels, as the book is told entirely from her viewpoint. Although at first she decides to return to her own \`side' in the interplanetary war, ultimately she joins Aral in Barrayar - there is no doubt of the joy they find in each other. Her leaving her home is not without cost, but the scene in the pavilion where she and Aral come together at last is the most touching of the book.Barrayar extends from that start, showing Aral and Cordelia's new life together on Barrayar. The feelings of homesickness she undergoes, and regret for the loss of the superior facilities - especially medical - of her own planet are a running theme of the book, as they would be in real life. The politics are less complicated here - I sometimes got lost in \`Shards of Honor' on this point - but nonetheless the foundation of the plot line. Aral is now Regent to the young emperor, and the political intrigues that job brings touches on all aspects of their lives. Aral and Cordelia have to find their feet in a slippery political sphere, and it is not without cost that they do so. Cost to innocents. There are more players here, and if you can work your way past the many \`Vor' prefixes (ruling caste) to sort out the individual players, in this book I found I got to know them more than in \`Shards of Honor' - particularly Sergeant Bothari, so badly damaged and strange (a unique relationship with Cordelia), Kou and Drou. Bjuold is not afraid to have characters come to an untimely end, as many military stories must, and even - or maybe especially - those on \`the right side'.I loved these 2 stories, and the series promises to be a fantastic one."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is an interesting book to read early on if you are just getting into the Vorkosigan books. I came to CORDELIA'S HONOR, with some prodding from my wife, after finishing the most recent entry, A CIVIL CAMPAIGN, and it provides some much needed background to the history of the troubled planet Barrayar.Focusing on Cordelia Naismith, this dual-novel covers her introduction to/capture by &quot;The Butcher of Komarr,&quot; Aral Vorkosigan. Aral may have a terrible reputation, only partially deserved, but he sees the strength and intelligence in his prisoner, and they ally against his formidable internal enemies.The first novel follows Aral and Cordelia as they meet and separate repeatedly. It isn't paced especially well, but the conclusion exemplifies the devious but draconian nature of the political world facing our heroes. The second book concludes Cordelia's saga as more Barrayaran turmoil threatens the new family that she is trying to build.Cordelia is a joy to read about because the reader is allowed to see everything in her that Aral does. Though Bujold does put her through the wringer, her weary triumph is moving and hopeful. Wry humor punctuates even some of the most grim and horrific events, making this a read that is easy to swallow.This is a political novel, with very little to interest those interested in hard scientific speculation. Intrigues abound, personalities and agendas drive the plot. Some of the situations are a little clich&eacute;d, or preposterous (including a near-rape by an arch-villain, sort of), but each are given a melancholy touch. Triumphs rarely lack their collateral damage in these stories.My chief regret about Cordelia, though, is that for all the differences between her and her son Miles (the focus of the other Vorkosigan books), they both speak from the same voice. I was hoping for something a bit more distinct. Still, this flaw does very little to detract from the fun."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"What a concept! What I personally look for in books is a character-driven plot, combined with the author's ability to string words together in a comprehensible, yet elegant way. And Bujold *definitely* fulfills these requirements. Her language is accessible to just about everyone, and her characters are well fleshed out and three dimensional.It is really easy to love this book, because it's really easy to love the characters. Cordelia is the epitome of a genre strong woman (imagine a scifi version of Mercedes Lackey/Tanya Huff/Laurell K Hamilton heroines), and Aral makes a wonderful counterpoint in this story.Despite my rather strong inclinations towards fantasy rather than scifi, this book hooked me in, and continues to keep a firm hold on me. One of those books you start reading, and before you know it, it's 5am and you have to get up in two hours for work. *sigh*.Definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Cordelia's Honor is basically the prequel to the Vorkosigan Saga. It looks at the life and times of Miles Vorkosigan's parents, Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan, 2 warriors from rival empires who are forced together by chance and treachory, as well as complicated internal and external politics, into a real love affair that leads to the birth of Miles Vorkosigan. Book one is Shards of Honor, Ms. Bujolds first novel, and book 2 is Barrayar, the Vorkosigans' home world and Ms. Bujolds first of 4 Hugo Award winning novels. Barrayar deserves it Hugo award, and Shards of Honor is one of the best debut novels I have ever read. Heinlen wishes his first novel was half as good, and he is the grandfather of SF and the author of Stranger In A Strange Land, the most popular SF novel of all time. Normally I read a book a day it took me 4 days to read these 2 novels, not because they are bad but because the details and background are so fascinating that you have to read slower to fully apreciate all of the naunces in the stories. Military life is fully explored in both a fully integrated society and a fully paternal society. I really would like to see a a prequel to these 2 books that explores why Barrayar is so masculine a society and how they were reintroduced back to civilised society, I think Bujold would make it a very fascinating exploration of macro and micro-biology, as well as a look at the dynamics of politics and culture that are driven by those needs.These 2 books are going to make me read all of Lois McMaster Bujold's other books, especially since she is one of the most decorated SF authors of all time. 4 of her first 8 novels won a Hugo Best Novell Award and she has won at least one Nebula. Barrayar is her second real novel, 3rd published but started at the same time as Shards of Honor. Her afterward is best read after reading the 2 novels and includes a Vorkosigian timeline through all of her Vorkosigian Saga books. By the way, both books are worth a 5 star review. Bujold is also one of the best authors at exploring politics in her novels, David Weber is only slightly better."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"When I first happened to buy this book I was desperatly seeking a book that was not boring. Considering that I have read hundreds of books my choices were limited. From start to finish of this book I could not put it down! For a long time I have always searched for books with this amount of humor,romance,and adventure. There were actual times I had to put this book down and take a breather from all the adrenaline running through my system.

You didn't maybe read the book? For pity's sake, the whole of &quot;Shards of Honor&quot; is about the love that Cordelia and Aral learn--no way was she forced into a marriage. How about trying that one again."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Not impressed. It's a quick read and I would not recommend it to hard sci-fi or space opera fans because it lacks high tech imagery and multiple plot lines. It is a wholesome love story between two heroic characters who must fight the odds to be together."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Once, a long time ago on another continent, I was sitting on a dark grey rock over a cold lake on an autumn day. The sky was overcast and I looked down onto the water, and watched the wind blow the clouds along in the lake's surface; and the lake looked as deep as the sky.This series made me feel the same way: the words are a reflection, as deep as the sky."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This book was a disappointment. Billed as a sci-fi, the reader is immediately fooled into expecting some swashbuckling futuristic action in the first few pages. This quickly falls apart, however, as the book finds its own in talking about character relationships on a planet that resembles present-day Earth in every way. Prepare for endless pages on horseback riding, formal events, romance, balls, feminism, and a wedding. Dozens of pages are devoted to each topic.And the book does well with its stride. Characters have some depth to them, the world presented feels real enough. The storyline is consistent and well-presented. Were this billed as a present-day (or even knights or fantasy) story, it would have been a hit with its target audience. As it stands here, \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" just doesn't cut it as science fiction."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"OMG - Barrayar is literally the worst book I've ever read. Halfway through Shards of Honor, I suspected the author was a woman. Halfway through Barrayar, I was convinced the author was a sexist man writing what he thought would be a woman's perspective. I mean, if I were to write a book mocking the 'stereotypical woman,' I would basically write Barrayar. The protagonist sits in a house all day long every day and really only gets involved in the exciting events of the outside world by going from room to room asking the actual participants how they are feeling. When not playing therapist, she spends her time waxing maternal, playing matchmaker, and noticing her husband's flashing eyes. I'm not making this up.I'm on book 7 of the Vorkosigan Saga. It has its ups and its downs, this is definitely a down. Unfortunately, it's basically required reading for the next book."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I was really expecting more after seeing Bujold was a Hugo Winner and reading all the gushing ratings here. The story, dialogue and characters simply did not move me.When I look back to other Hugo winners such as Robinson, Brin, Gibson, Card, Simmons and Vinge, I remember books that are real page turners (All of which I would give 5 stars). The plots are compelling, the environments fantastic, mysterious or intriguing and the characters are developed in ways that make you care-for or despise them.Cordelia's plot moves as slow as molasses or develops in ways that just simply are not that compelling. With about 130 pages to go in Barrayar, I was ready to put the book down and move on. But, seeing as I had already invested time in the first 85 percent of the saga, I finished out of a sense of obligation. I thought that perhaps this book ends in a way that justifies all the hoopla. Well I finished it and there was one bright side. The last 130 pages made good practice material for speed reading.Other reviews have spoken of great relationships and emotional development. This aspect of the book felt as if I were reading an abridged version of a possibly great and sweeping romance. As I was reading, I kept thinking that I could care less if any of these characters died and what the impact might be on other characters. On the other hand, well developed characters and relationships will bring a tear to even this 31 year old male when tragedy strikes.Finally, one part of the book that really bothered me in the characters development and believability department was the &quot;rape&quot;. Due to an injury, one of the male characters never knew if he'd be able to father children due to some male erectile dysfunction problems. The woman he is attracted to enters the room and his problem is solved. In a fit of passion, the two strip down and &quot;do the deed&quot;. In the aftermath, the woman was quite happy with the course of events, but the man is devastated because he believes he raped the woman. Huh?!?!?!Perhaps my rating is harsh, but I just really expect more from a Hugo winner."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This isn't a science-fiction novel- this is a Harlequin romance! If you like ornate costumes and Grand Royal in space then you'll love this book- everyone is so dashing and suave. Bujold seems obsessed with vain trivialities. Does Cordelia have bags under her eyes this morning?...What is the lordly lord wearing today? Oh, what a lovely ball, too bad there are assassins everywhere...No wonder Cordelia spends the entire book worrying and complaining. As for real science fiction? Forget it. Nothing of interest here. Her make-believe world is silly, shallow and implausible. It's all in the characters, and they'd make Barbara Cartland blush."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Bujold has a strong following among sci fi readers for good writing and Cordelia's Honor demonstrates why. The writing is strong, the characters, if sometimes more carictures than characters are distinctive.Unfortunately, the sci fi is missing. Yes, there is a gloss of other worlds, disruptor rays and stunners and faster-than-light travel, but these elements are incidental to both books. Take them away, put Barrayar and Beta on two continents on opposite sides of the world (or, rename them Sparta and Athens) and you can write the same book.Classify this work as a political thriller with a sci fi gloss. Worth a solid 3 stars for the writing, but only 1-2 stars as a work of sci fi."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I love the characters that she creates and I will buy anything she writes. She is a fabulous tale spinner."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Unlike some reviewers, I recommend that you read this AFTER reading 'The Warrior's Apprentice' and 'The Vor Game.' (collected in 'Young Miles') There are some events described in this book that demystify some things in those books, but I believe it enhances the experience to be just as unaware of Cordelia's history as Miles is when he sets out on his journey into life. After you've read those, come back and read this.It contains two complete novels:'Shards of Honor' is almost like reading a fanfiction novel of the Vorkosigan universe. It's Lois Bujold's FIRST novel, and it has huge structural flaws that show deeply within it. However, it has loads of important details on the back stories of Cordelia, Lord Aral Vorkosigan, and Sergeant Bothari that will help you appreciate what you've read in 'Young Miles.' It also helps to characterize Cordelia, which will help you understand her when you're reading 'Barrayar,' the second novel in this omnibus. Get through 'Shards of Honor' as fast as you can, but don't skip it, either. Trust me; when you get to Barrayar, things will get much better. 'Shards of Honor' is the only reason I didn't give this five stars.'Barrayar' is a fantastic book where a strong female character plays a critical role in some serious space opera regency intrigue. There's a plot to destabilize an Empire, assassination attempts, and a structure and writing style that are just a pleasure to read. It's great, and you'll have lots of fun. It's almost as if 'Barrayar' is Lois Bujold showing Frank Herbert how you REALLY write space feudalism. It's diverting, escapist adventure with just the right dose of maturity to make it great."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I missed this volume when I first discovered Ms. Bujold's delightful combination of psychology, character development, humor, and complex political/military plots. Miles is a terrific and terrifically complex character. Had I read this book before I plowed into the others, I might have understood the motivations and thought processes a little more, but it is wonderful to find it now. Devoured every page, and look forward to reading all the books in sequence again and again.

Why make things more difficult for myself in figuring out what came before? The first novel listed in the multiple-award-winning \\"Miles Vorkosigan\\" saga, _The Warrior's Apprentice,_ though the first published, and which I read a couple months ago, turns out not to have been the first written, nor the first by internal chronology. This present volume includes _Shards of Honor_ (1986) and _Barrayar_ (1991), which tell the story of Miles's mother, Cordelia Naismith, her introduction under very strange circumstances to Capt. Aral Vorkosigan, and their courtship and marriage. And, since the second book begins immediately after the end of the first one, you can treat it all as just a single long novel. And I found it better written, actually, and more exciting than the volume I had read first.Cordelia is the head of a Betan planetary survey party, investigating a new world at the other end of a recently discovered wormhole. Unknown to her, the Barrayarans are also interested; the planet is nicely situated as a supply depot and staging point for yet a third world which Barrayar covets. Her scientific party is attacked and partly escapes, but she's unavoidably left behind and is captured by Vorkosigan, who used to be a very young admiral but was demoted for personally executing one of his officers. They have to trek a couple hundred kilometers to the supply depot, which allows them to become thoroughly acquainted -- and for the captain to decide, somehow, that this is the woman he wants to marry. Barrayar is an interesting world, cut off for centuries from the rest of galactic civilization -- the Time of Isolation -- and having evolved a semi-feudal, heavily military society. Beta, on the other hand, being very poor in resources (especially water), is heavily controlled and socialized and very technologically advanced. Barrayar may be more \\"free\\" in certain ways, the way the author paints it, but Beta is far more civilized. And Cordelia and Vorkosigan are each very much the products of their worlds, a disparity that threads itself all through the narrative.The second book continues the story of Cordelia and Aral with their marriage, and then with the Admiral's selection as Regent for the four-year-old emperor, when his grandfather finally dies (his appallingly dissolute father having been carefully disposed of in the first book), and suddenly Cordelia has a whole set of new responsibilities. And then there's the assassination attempt with a military chemical weapon which affects their unborn son, whom no one is sure, now, will even survive. But he does, having been transferred to a uterine replicator -- and shortly afterward becoming a hostage in a civil war staged by one of the aristocracy who wants to be emperor. The second half of the second book, in fact, is the story of this unwanted war, and the last hundred pages, in which Cordelia herself undertakes a rescue mission to save her son. This is some of most exciting writing I've read in quite some time and you won't want to stop until you come to the end of the adventure.These two books are space opera of a superior type (as is the whole series, in fact), which I found strongly reminiscent of Carolyn Cherryh's Union/Alliance books -- heavy on politics and psychology, with a leavening of military tactics and controlled violence, and with very deeply developed characters, even the spear-carriers. Sgt. Bothari, especially, is a fascinating study in pathology under restraint; having read the next volume in the series, I already know what the future holds for him. Although I enjoyed _The Warrior's Apprentice,_ I wasn't exceptionally impressed by it, nor did I entirely appreciate the rabid fan base the series has accrued. I'm beginning to understand it now."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"lois opend up a hole new world with this book i so many way,s to new world,s and new thought,s where you accualy find yourself if i had a daughter like his i would be a trualy proud father \\\\ however as i said for a young female sci fi fan or a smart young man i highley recomend the whol book listing by lois"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Enemies have to join sides to save themselves and everything dear to them. This is a book full of adventure, love, politics, war, relationships, and wonderful characters. The writing style is easy to read, enjoyable and clever. I just read this one again. My 6th time, yet I still had to stay up all night to finish. I love it. Cordelia is my favorite character not just in science fiction but in all fiction. I love seeing how she thinks and what she does. That is why I've read these books so many times. She is strong and smart and empathetic and feminine and resourceful. I can relate to her and want to be her."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"\\"Cordelia's Honor\\" was my second foray into Lois McMaster Bujold's universe. I was greatly impressed by her first work that I read (\\"Young Miles\\"), and I was equally impressed with this. Bujold is possibly one of the best space opera writers around. Spoilers follow.\\"Cordelia's Honor\\" is actually an omnibus edition of two books: \\"Shards of Honor\\" and \\"Barrayar.\\" I personally enjoyed reading them as one big story arch, but they could also work very well as stand-alone novels. Each book has its own complete story and develops its characters in a satisfying manner. Unlike with most doulogies or trilogy, each book in the omnibus wraps itself up very well, meaning you could read just one book and be completely satisfied with the plot and characters. Though I certainly think it's better to read both.\\"Shards of Honor\\" is the story of how Cordelia Naismith, a scientist from Beta Colony, and Aral Vorkosigan, a captain in Barrayar's navy meet and eventually fall in love. While conducting research on a distant planet, Cordelia's team is attacked and massacred by Barrayaran troops. She meets Aral Vorkosigan, who has recently fallen victim to mutiny, and the two fight for survival on the undeveloped planet, bonding over their trying experiences. They eventually make it off the planet and go their separate ways, but it becomes obvious that there is something between them.Not long after, Barrayar and Beta Colony find themselves in a war against one another. On her first command, Cordelia captains a small ship on a mission to destroy the enemy armada. She is captured, tortured, and nearly raped at the command of Vorrutyer. In a fateful moment, Vorrutyer is killed by his henchman, Bothari, and Cordelia and Aral are once again united. Again, the pair work together to get out of a tough situation and again, they are separated. After realizing that Beta Colony has grown cold toward her and recognizing her feelings for Aral, Cordelia leaves her home and travels to Barrayar, where she is reunited with Aral and they wed.\\"Barrayar\\" tells of Cordelia's adjustment to life on a patriarchal, bureaucracy-driven planet. With the death of the emperor, Aral has been named regent, his new duties leaving Cordelia alone a majority of the time to cope with Barrayar's unfamiliar society and her pregnancy alone. Family life and politics cross, however, when a political opponent throws a chemical bomb into the Vorkosigans' bedroom, threatening Cordelia's baby and forcing her to put her child in a uterine replicator and allow experiments to be done on him to counteract the bomb's effects on his bone growth. Things become further complicated when the political opponent takes over the government, holding the princess hostage and taking Cordelia's uterine replicator in the process. Cordelia and a few loyal companions take it upon themselves to rescue future baby Miles (despite Aral's father's protests) and restore Barrayar to what it once was. The story ends with the birth of Miles (who, due to the gas bomb, has brittle bones and other similar problems).McMaster Bujold tells an intriguing story rife with personal challenges and plot twists. There was never a dull moment and the pacing was good. The author's great writing also contributes to the greatness of the story; she manages to tell enough to accurately describe what's going on without bogging down the story with purple prose. She clearly knows what she's doing and how to work with words.The real joy of \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" is the characters. Cordelia is a fascinating, flawed main character with numerous amusing, insightful, honest, and sometimes selfish thoughts regarding her experiences. She comes off as a real, believable person and not simply a character. The story is told through her perspective, and she has a very distinct voice. I personally appreciate that all of Bujold's characters have noticeable character flaws and not-so-wonderful pasts (not in terms of angst, but in terms of mistakes and the foolishness that sometimes comes with learning and growing up). Aral, Cordelia, Bothari, and even more minor characters (Drou and Koudelka) are a true pleasure to read; all are unique, all come off as being believable, all add to the story experience.What surprised me further was how much I enjoyed the romance. Typically, I despise romance as it is portrayed in novels. Here, however, it comes off as being very genuine and realistic. As I mentioned before, the characters have flaws and very distinct personalities; seeing Aral and Cordelia work together and appreciating one another for their differences was a breath of fresh air. I also must bring emphasis to the fact that the romance is based on personality and shared experiences, not appearance. In fact, the characters are described very few times (only once or twice); personality and quirks are emphasized, as are similarities. They face challenges together and they overcome them together. Cordelia and Aral's relationship is one of the most realistic I've read.Moving away from the characters, McMaster Bujold handled the societies of Beta Colony and Barrayar very well. I have often become fed up with the treatment of opposing cultures and government in space opera; one is always portrayed positively and one negatively. Here, however, it is made clear that both societies have their flaws (and they're big ones) and their positives. The author leaves it up to us to decide which one (if either) is superior. The nuanced perspective was much appreciated.Overall, \\"Cordelia's Honor\\" is a prime example of good space opera. The characters are very believable and realistically flawed, the romance is based on something deeper than appearances, the writing is great, the intriguing plot (both in the individual book and the duology as a whole), and the author's nuanced look at things that are often painted in black and white make this a wonderful, refreshing read. Five very solid, well-earned stars. A must read for any space opera fan."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I'm writing this review here because Cordelia's Honor is the beginning. But I'm really writing about the entire, superb Vorkosigan series.These novels are much more about the characters and how they handle life than about science fiction. The characters are among the most believable I've encountered in any literature. Note that the characters are also exceptional people - way above the norm in intelligence and character. Which, I think, makes their \\"realness\\" even more impressive.I rarely read a book twice. I've read this series twice in the last 6 years and I'm about to start again.I read one review that said of Bujold and this series: \\"She makes me laugh, she makes me cry\\". I agree totally; get out the hanky at times, burst out laughing at times, also bite nails at times. But I would add to that something unique in my reading of fiction: I finish them wanting to be a better person. Her main characters have so much integrity they are inspirational. Further, when one of the characters says something that is supposed to be wise, it is. E.g., Cordelia says of her unafraid young companion in a very dangerous situation: \\"He was too young to realize there is death after life\\".One specifc on this particular book: If the climatic scene in Barrayar (second part of Cordelia's Honor) doesn't raise the hairs on the back of your neck, call 911 before it's too late.Backrgound: I read widely, fiction, non-fiction. I've worked through many classics, e.g.,enjoyed \\"Portrait of an Artist\\" by James Joyce before I knew his reputation. I've read and loved Sci-Fi since high school (a long time ago)."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"... Standing alone, each of the two stories in this book are very good. Together, they're excellent. The first book (Shards of Honor) deals strictly with the meeting and getting together of Cordelia Naismith and Aral Vorkosigan (Miles' parents). As such, it ends right smack in the middle of the story. The second book (Barrayar) picks up from there and continues through Miles' birth (with a bit of later stuff thrown in). Thus, taken together, the two books in this compilation form one complete story and justify their issuance as a compilation. This book (or its two components) are essential to the series and are wonderful to read. Read them."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"For those of you just starting out on Bujold, or looking for new books, be forewarned that this is an omnibus of 'Shards of Honor' and &quot;Barryar&quot;. However, other than that fact, this book is great stuff. Even if you aren't a &quot;sci-fi&quot; fan, the characterization is amazing. The people are strong and interesting, but at the same time flawed and human. They have problems that Bujold allows for. Even the hero can't have everything his/her way. And knowing Miles' parents makes for a better appreciation of Miles and the rest of the Vorkosgian series."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"For every ADULT who wishes a great read. This is how a space heroine should be portrayed. There is no better story worth reading and it kicks off one of the greatest series of all times. Buy it."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I became a fan of Bujold when I was in high school, and for a while now all of the Vorkosigan books have been some of my favorite comfort rereads. Cordelia's Honor ranks high among that number. Know that Cordelia's Honor is an onmibus of two novels that were originally published separately.In Shards of Honor, we meet Cordelia, who is an intelligent and resourceful captain of a planetary survey team. While studying a planet, they run into a team from another planet - one who has just mutinied against their captain, the famous (perhaps infamous) tactician and starship battle commander, Aral Vorkosigan. They end up working together and growing feelings between them as they travel through the wilderness of this unsettled world and take back Aral's ship.In Barrayar, the newly married couple face the worst kind of political upheaval on Barrayar. A failed assassination attempt severely damages their unborn baby, but Cordelia insists that they use uterine replicators, a technology painfully new to Barrayar, to save their child's life. Cordelia is further wrapped up in the course of events as first she is put in charge of the five year old emperor and later as she finds that her child's uterine replicator has been taken hostage. Since everyone else sees the damaged fetus as expendable, it is up to Cordelia to fix this mess and save her baby.While technically not Bujold's best books, these are still fantastic. Cordelia is witty. She is a fabulous reluctant hero. She really is only doing things because something needs to be done and there's no one else around to do it. Bujold states in one of her afterwards that she writes books by making a character and then putting them in the worst set of circumstances and then watches and records as they dig their way out. While the Miles book are a better example of this method of creating plot, you can see it here as well. Both books have a great balance of character development and action - and plenty of each. They have elements of military science fiction, space opera, action-adventure, spy novels, you name it, this book has it. In general, this book and this series are fairly accessible to people who do not normally read science fiction.It is certainly a must for anyone who has read the Miles books - it puts his life in perspective. We also get Barrayar at very strange state socially and technologically - the planet is already a galactic power, and yet it is still clawing its way out of a dark age. Here more than anywhere else we get hints about the Cetagandan war in which Piotr fought - I'd personally love to hear more about that.I recommend this book to be read after Young Miles so that in Warrior's Apprentice you have a chance to develop a soft spot for Bothari before you find out that he really is a psychopath. I also recommend that this book be read before Memory, so you can see what Simon was like before he becomes head of Imperial Security. In general, I recommend that this be read earlier rather than later since it explains Escobar and Gregor's ascension to the throne rather well."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"***** Shards of Honor.Commander Cordelia Naismith of the Beta Colony is on a scientific expedition on an alien planet when she and an ensign return to find their camp destroyed and the crew that didn't escape to their ship killed by the Barrayarans. They're attacked, Cordelia falls into a ravine, and wakes up to find herself a prisoner of \\"the Butcher of Komarr,\\" Captain Aral Vorkosigan.Turns out, he's not the bloodthirsty villain he's been portrayed as, and he's in as much danger from at least some of his own people as she is.They get to know each other--and fall in love--as they work together to bury the dead, care for the ensign (who'd been hit with a nerve disruptor), survive in unfamiliar terrain, and eventually recover his command.I didn't entirely believe the romance, but had to take it as given. I did, however, believe the respect and admiration between them, and that was enough.Shards of Honor was appropriately titled, as so much of the conflict for both of them has to do with honor. They're a wonderful couple of star-crossed lovers, both strong and honorable, and in impossible situations.There are intriguing characters and hair-raising adventures, as well as painful and emotional decisions. I was very pleased with my introduction to All Things Bujold.***** Barrayar.This book comes next chronologically, but was published several years after Shards of Honor, and after other books in the same series.Cordelia and Aral are now married, living on Barrayar, and expecting their first child. All is well, despite some culture shock on Cordelia's part, until the emperor dies and Aral is named Regent for the child emperor, and they're plunged into political intrigue and danger.An attempt to poison them affects the growth of their unborn child and leaves Aral sterile. Cordelia opts to use the Betan technology left behind--a uterine replicator--to continue the pregnancy outside her body, and hires a medical scientist to perform experimental treatments on the baby, now named Miles, to save him.The rest of the story is one page-turning adventure after another, as a pretender attempts to sieze the throne, kill Aral, and kill or kidnap the young emperor. But when Miles in his uterine replicator is taken and held hostage, Cordelia can't afford to play politics any longer.All the great characters from Shards of Honor are back, and there's a lovely secondary romance--not a simple or easy one, of course. There's more worldbuilding, in the form of Cordelia's complaints and observations about the differences between Barrayar and the Beta Colony. Mostly, though, it's just en engrossing story full of adventure and characters I cared about."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Lois McMaster Bujold is one of my favorite authors along with Elizabeth Moon, David Weber, Georgette Heyer and Sharon Lee/Steve Miller. I have read this compendium over and over again, which is why I had to order it again - my old copy was falling apart! Cordelia's Honor contains Shards of Honor and Barrayar, two separate books in the space opera/sci fi genre. Every time I reread one of her stories I find more nuances and am left with a bittersweet feeling because the story has ended. Bujold is a profound writer - she creates believable worlds, exciting plots and strong characterizations. What I like best about her is that she tells a sci fi story that is not overpowered by technology. Her science is credible, but never takes over the story. In Cordelia's Honor the prequel to the great Miles Vorkosigan series, she tells the story of two people who come together despite cultural barriers and the shattering of youthful dreams. Aral and Cordelia's love story is not sentimentalized, so if you are afraid that this is \\"just\\" a \\"romance\\" novel,don't worry. There is nothing trite about their story and if you don't love it, well, it takes all kinds and not everybody shares the same tastes. However, if you do like it, make sure that you read all about their son Miles, starting with Warrior's Apprentice! You will never regret it."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"A wonderful read, and a great framework to start a discussion of how the choices we make about ethics, morality, politics, power, and money, influence our lives.I have given the first part ( Shards of Honor ) to peoplesince 1993(?) as a framework to discuss personal and workrelated issues.

I don't. If you do you'll miss going &quot;Oh so thats what he meant&quot; and &quot;So thats what really happened...&quot;. This was the best part of leaving these books for last for me. You'll also miss a cameo appearance of a character from Miles' time, someone you'll never suspect. ( I'll give you a hint he appears only in Warrior's Apprentice, but is mentioned in later books) His cameo in got me thinking about how his actions greatly affected Cordelias' and Miles' life(and thus the life of all the main characters) and he is not the least bit important in the book universe. It feels as if Bujold meant for me to find out this way, it kinda left me in awe. its kinda hard to explain but if you read the books in the order I did I think you would get it."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Once in the Betan Expeditionary ForceCordelia Naismith, ship commander, laid a brand new courseThey landed on a planet they thought uninhabitedUntil an ambush left some crewmen deadThe planet had been found before by men from BarrayarTheir leader was Vorkosigan, the &quot;Butcher of Komarr&quot;But his ship had betrayed him, and hers had left the groundThey helped each other out and then they foundIf you cross a Betan with a Barrayaran VorOne of them knows science and the other one knows warEnemies they are but you can't tear the two apartThe Barrayaran steals the Betan's heartNext time they meet is in an interstellar warThe Barrayarans make a grab to capture EscobarCordelia's ship is captured by Vorkosigan's, and thenThey help each other out once againIf you cross a Betan with a Barrayaran VorOne of them knows science and the other one knows warEnemies they are but you can't tear the two apartThe Betan steals the Barrayaran's heart"},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 7: Blockbuster","review":"Wow. There have been lots of changes in the Ultimate version of the Marvel Universe, but one constant has been the back story on Wolverine. He remains a mutant with extraordinary healing capabilities and claws popping out of his hands whose skeleton has been coated with the unbreakable metal adamantium by a covert military group called Weapon X. In the process of creating the ultimate living weapon they also wiped clean his memory. Once known as Logan he is now called Wolverine and has been trying to be a member of the X-Men.But now two things have happened. First, Professor X has discovered a wedding ring that belonged to Wolverine in the government's Weapon X files. The ring bears the inscription: &quot;To James, with all my love.&quot; This leads us to wonder if James is Wolverine's real name and who was he married to? Second, since his feelings for Jean Grey led him to leave Cyclops behind on a mission to die, he has left Charles Xavier's school. When &quot;Ultimate X-Men Volume 7: Blockbuster&quot; begins Wolverine is just trying to enjoy a cup of coffee and a sandwich. That is before a hail of automatic gunfire rips him to shreds.&quot;Blockbuster&quot; collects together issues #34-39 of &quot;Ultimate X-Men,&quot; written by Brian Michael Bendis and illustrated by David Finch. The story arc follows the pursuit of Wolverine by a strange strike force armed with sophisticated military technology that includes a way of tracking Logan and adamantium bullets. Unwilling to ask the X-Men for help after the initial assault Logan ends up hiding out in the basement of none other than Peter Parker. When the battle moves to Hell's Kitchen that means not only Spider-Man but now Daredevil is also involved in Wolverine's problems. Eventually Nick Fury and Shield as well as Professor X and the X-Men become involved as some more clues regarding Logan's past are revealed.Throughout this storyline Bendis and Finch take full advantage of Wolverine's powers of recuperation to really put him through the wringer. This is especially true of Chapter 3, that begins with Logan being driven through a series of buildings by a rocket and reaches a crescendo when he has an up close and personal encounter with the psychotic blonde heading the team that is trying to kill him. She clearly knows who he is but Logan has no memory of her whatsoever and if you think this might be the woman who gave him that wedding ring you will not be alone.Although this is a very personal storyline in terms of Wolverine there are significant implications for the X-Men as well. Bendis continues to expand the idea of mutants being a divisive political problem as the modern equivalent of the slavery issue while the X-Men's role in the &quot;real&quot; world continues to be restricted by the order of the government. But more importantly, in the short-term, it is not Wolverine but another X-Men who takes a fateful step over the line.With &quot;Blockbuster&quot; we basically have a giant chase story. These people are out to get Wolverine and to take him down hard. Throughout the entire story they are chasing him, but there are also times when he is trying to turn the tables on them as well. The appearances by both Spider-Man and Daredevil are well integrated into the story and as much as this is an action driven story there are plenty of character driven moments; the exchanges between Wolverine and Spider-Man are especially good, but those between Logan and Xavier are clearly more important. Consequently, &quot;Blockbuster&quot; lives up to its title because it not only stands on its own as a great action story but because it advances a couple of key plotlines for &quot;Ultimate X-Men.&quot; To be continued..."},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men, Vol. 7: Blockbuster","review":"Spiderman and Wolverine, these two characters are awesome together no matter what universe they are in.

I know that I can always open the book to any page and find an interesting story ahead."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"This is a fascinating look at a fascinating and complex woman. Jenkins's theories as to why Queen Elizabeth never married are interesting and feel much more plausible than the idea that the Queen was continually frustrated in her attempts to marry. That she had a deep-seated fear of marriage and never intended to marry feels more \\"on the mark,\\" given Elizabeth's experiences as a child and teenager. By the time Elizabeth was eight, she had already attended two executions, and her mother and first stepmother were both beheaded long before Elizabeth was grown.Jenkins does gloss over or barely mention some important historical events, but she explains why in her preface: she wanted to focus on the world immediately surrounding Elizabeth. As a result we get a lively account of a woman who ruled England with a velvet fist. Jenkins also does an artful job of bringing alive the people who advised Queen Elizabeth, and the motives of both the Queen and the people who surrounded her are shown fully. Her romantic yet platonic love affair with Robert Dudley is dwelt upon a great deal, and - despite Dudley's shortcomings - it made me sad they never married and bore children together.I did have a little trouble following some events. After Dudley is made Earl of Lieceister, this is the way Jenkins refers to him. She changes the names of other characters also as they move up in rank in the military or become Earls. She also occasionally goes into great detail about an event without reference to what event it actually is (or makes the reference in passing), and I had to read certain paragraphs a couple of times to understand what she was referring to.But the challenge of that doesn't detract from the writing; the book reads like good fiction. The intrigue, negotiating, and secret plots are more complex and better than any novel, because the peril to Elizabeth's life was real. Jenkins also presents a stellar bibliography; it's evident she researched the subject matter thoroughly. I can't wait to read more by Jenkins."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"once i began reading this book,i could not put it down. it is so very fascinating to read the life of elizabeth as written by elizabeth jenkins. this author is brilliant!i think what makes this book so special is,the author's eloquence with her words and her description of history. this biography is rich,full,and rounded. this book is A MUST for anyone interested in queen elizabeth the first. do not pass up this book!!!"},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"This excellent book paints an unforgettable portrait of Elizabeth I, &quot;Good Queen Bess&quot; to her loving subjects.

This is the most readable biography of Elizabeth I that I have read."},{"Title":"Elizabeth the Great","review":"After reading &quot;Feast In The Morning&quot;, I found I was hooked on these real people and this era. I just had to know what happened after the death of Elizabeth's brother. This biography covers the entire lifetime of Elizabeth, at times it is very difficult to follow. As a persons name and place names were often the same, and in many cases the author would be talking about Lord Robert Dunley, then later she may refer to him as the Protector or as the Earl of Leicester, or as Leicester or The Earl. As you can see this can get confusing to follow who is who.This book really gives you the feel of the Queen and her times. Her nemisis Mary Queen of Scots was present throughout Elizabeth's lifetime and had a big influnence on her. Many times I wondered what I would do if faced with Elizabeth's problems, she was very creative.Many importaint parts of history may have been left out or hardly mentioned, while other unimportaint events were exponded on.It was interesting to read about the Earl of Oxford and his relationship with the Queen, as now there seems to be a camp of people who believe that he was really Shakespear. The author was recounting their relationship without the knowledge of this controversity."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"This is an astounding work. Viola speaks to the church with a broken heart. It is heavily endowed with rich biblical and supplemental scholarship. His presentation is not wooden theology but life-giving substance for those seeking a greater experience with Christ in a corporate NT church setting.He argues that a paradigm shift ought to occur in the church if real fruit will be produced in the lives of believers. Viola also warns against house movements that have simply become glorified bible studies, bless me clubs, special interest groups and so on.As with any good Christian writer he points the believer to Christ and not himself. After reading this book you feel liberated to seek more of God!Get this book and be changed in a deep and permanent way.It is a tremendous tribute and asset to the kingdom of God."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"Based on the title, I was hoping this book would talk about the nuts and bolts of starting a house church.

I share the author's opinion that a bible study is not a house church and that there is more than going through the forms of church to become one."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"I was so moved by this book that I contacted the author. Although I haven't yet agreed with 100% of his views, I can say without reservation that Frank Viola has written the most balanced book regarding God's purpose and direction for the church that I have read. If you are considering any book regarding the 'house church' I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"This is the most thorough work on church planting that I have ever read. The insights are wonderful and it is very well written. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"I have been so indoctrinated in the institutional church's version of history, the bible, and my role in the church that I didn't know I was off base. The hippie in me knew there was more, but as I grew older, I lost my way in the church program. This book helped me rise above the fog, find my bearings, and set my new course. Honor the old, search for the new. Turns out, I feel ashamed of the new and now search for the old. Great book for perspective and vision."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"I first read this in 2006, and I must say, the author understands the pitfalls and difficulties that plague many house churches. He also has a compelling and enthusiastic vision for local expressions of church. A reader can expect great truths herein, as well as persuasive arguments for why healthy house churches need an extra-local itinerant leader to avoid certain pitfalls. The latter can be the dangerous part, as pursuing this route has its own risks that are not discussed here.The author manages to categorize almost every type of house church other than his own as something unhealthy by stating over generalizations and half truths about them (although probably fully true in the author's own experience), and the reader is left to think that the author and his band of apostles are the only people doing it right. One section of the book is an edited reprint that appeared in the vitriolic book, House Church Movements in 2001, a book that was widely known for its arrogance, elitism, and toxicity. The reader should be careful to realize that no human has the omniscience to put that many expressions of church into a box. This struck me as odd at the time, but being a new guy to organic church their vision was compelling and their help seemed like the best option I had to experience organic church as a non-leader.The fact is that many of the authors' own churches have been disastrous, while others have had both good and difficulties, just like many other churches. After reading this, one feels as though why bother with organic church if you can't do it the way he describes, missing that the way they are proposing is not necessarily without its own problems. The glorious picture painted has many times not been the reality.If you want to become an apostle like Paul, this book will help you understand that to a degree. But understand that not all apostles, even in Paul's day, were like Paul. The 72 and 500 went out for short times to start fellowships in homes that would receive them. It seems they moved on once a healthy church was going, but otherwise stayed there until then and did not move house to house.If you want to find healthy organic church, there are other resources than the ideas presented here.Just as House Church Movements was replaced by this book, this book was replaced by Finding Organic Church. Each one gets a little nicer and more persuasive. Should they come plant with you, be prepared to hear about how most the rest of Christianity is eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, while they are giving fruit from the tree of life. All the body hears from the Head to varying degrees, and we should not be so quick to dismiss any part of the body.Champagne only needs a tiny bit of poison for the whole drink to be poisonous. The truth in the book is champagne but can become poisonous with the adamant case for needing an extra local worker, who will not necessarily help a church be better off than the alternatives they dismiss herein. This idea can be just as enslaving as any other enslaving form of Christianity. But if a reader can lay this idea aside, there are some other great concepts in this book."},{"Title":"So You Want to Start a House Church?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today","review":"Although it is obvious that the author is really seeking God with a pure heart and has brought up some points that are rarely seen in Christian literature, he is missing a few key points.First, although you will often see mentioned in the New Testament \\"the church that meets at\\" a particular brother's or sister's house, the only time a church is ever mentioned by name is by the city in which it is located...the Church in Philadelphia, the Church in Smyrna, etc. Paul even criticizes the brothers and sisters who go around saying \\"I am of Paul\\" and \\"I am of Silas\\". They are all of Christ, and none other. The above-defined ground of the church keeps, in practicality, the genuine oneness of the church both locally and universally (Eph. 4:3), without any division. This is the only way to avoid today's situation of division and confusion among the members of Christ. The local churches should be the many expressions in many localities of the one Body of Christ. A concaphony of many different networks of Christians meeting in various homes, as pure of heart as those Christians may be, is just not part of God's eternal purpose.In summary, this is a good first read for someone transitioning out of denominational thinking. However, I highly recommend \\"The Normal Christian Church Life\\" by Watchman Nee for further thought on the big picture and God's real desire - the believers expressing Christ for the building up of the Church.

There we find Heidegger's best sustained discussion of Leibniz. To be sure, there are other discussions of Leibniz scattered throughout Heidegger's work (most notably in &quot;The Principle of Reason&quot;) but here we find him attempting to elucidate Leibniz's metaphysics, not discuss aspects of Leibniz's work in connection with a broader theme. Heidegger's style of reading makes for excellent introductions to the thinkers he discusses. It's ironic that a writer who has a reputation for obtuseness and impenetrability can produce vividly clear discussions of other thinkers. It should be noted that Heidegger's &quot;Die Frage nach dem Ding&quot; (the English translation, long and sadly out of print, went by the name &quot;What is a Thing?&quot;) is one of the best introductory books on Kant in any language. But Heidegger's approach: cut straight to the &quot;question of Being&quot; and show how the rest of a philosopher's work fits in with his basic metaphysical position, makes for a clear and striking interpretation, even if Leibniz scholars might find it a little over-aggressive in some details."},{"Title":"The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic (Studies in Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy)","review":"This is an essential series of lectures to understand the importance of science and specifically of Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason in Heidegger's later thought.

My two year old loves them.

Some are mere two- or three-page sketches---good for a plot outline if you're ever in the mood to write a ghost story.Elliott O'Donnell was born in Bristol in 1872, a parson's son like M. R. James but there the similarity ends. Antiquarian and Cambridge scholar M.R. James's ghost stories have been republished and reread, and have been frightening new generations of readers for over a century. His stories, except perhaps for &quot;A Vignette&quot; are fiction. He wrote them to entertain his friends and was never involved in spiritualism or ghost-hunting.On the other hand Elliott O'Donnell made a career out of the supernatural, beginning at the turn of the last century, and it shows in his stories. Those told in the first person singular are especially breathless, loaded with clich&eacute;s like &quot;the wind moaned and sighed and rattled&quot; or &quot;stiff and lifeless&quot; or &quot;nothing would induce them to stay another hour in the house.&quot; All of the stories are told as true, and this sometimes leads the reader to chuckle rather than shiver while the author is racing through his vast collection of adverbs and adjectives.Sprinkle a bit of salt on these tales, wait for a dark and stormy night, turn up the gas-light and enjoy. Here are some of my favorites:&quot;The Nun of Digby Court&quot;--A deceased nun in horrible smelling wool causes the new owners of Digby Court to abandon their mansion to &quot;cobwebs, stillness and ghosts.&quot;&quot;The Haunting of St. Giles&quot;--A hospital ward is haunted by a wicked anesthesiologist, who murdered his rival in love.&quot;The Phantom Trumpeter of Fyvie&quot;--Lord Fyvie, Earl of Dunfermline is cursed by a dying trumpeter. Always before the death of a Gordon of Fyvie, &quot;his trumpet would be heard either within or immediately without the castle walls.&quot; O'Donnell tells stories about other harbingers of death, including a phantom drummer, a phantom rider, a phantom clock, and an assortment of banshees. One sometimes wonders why bassoonists or sackbut players never seem or return after death to haunt their former clients.&quot;Will-O'-The-Wisp and Corpse Candles&quot;--This isn't really a story, just the author's commentary on various electrical and gaseous phenomena. He is firm in his belief that electricity is not the sole explanation for St. Elmo's Fire.&quot;The Fatal Phantom of Eringle Truagh&quot;--A kissing phantom lures young men and women to their doom.&quot;A Haunted Hampstead House&quot;--While the author is investigating a haunted house, he drops his flashlight. Something picks it up and hands it back to him."},{"Title":"My Guardian Angel","review":"Each story is slightly different all with the theme of the guardian angel.

Much more cataclysmic was the wave of opprobrium generated by the English language media and academics in Left-Marxist bastions that tried to sweep the BJP and its parent organization, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) into the dustbin of history. Ten years later, and despite hundreds of scholarly treatises berating the \\"fascist\\" and \\"communal\\" \\"Hindu nationalists\\", and warning of doom if the BJP came to power, the BJP is heading a 25-party coalition government in India, and the RSS is playing an important role in shaping social, religious, and political debate in that billion-strong nation that is still a vibrant democracy.Among the many scholarly tomes on the nature of the communal (religious) conflicts in India, mostly between the 800 million majority Hindus and the sizeable minority of a 150 million Muslims, and the threat posed by Hindu nationalists to a secular, multicultural India it is difficult to find much more than the predictable and the often trite analyses blaming Hindu nationalists for spoiling the game of the multicultural, internationalist, secular-humanists who made and kept India a beacon of democracy and secularism since India gained independence from the British in 1947.Rajagopal's book too, despite its theoretical sophistication, indulges in the now de rigueur criticism of the BJP and its parent organization, the RSS. His book has elicited a lot of praise for its \\"brilliant theoretical acuity and empirical richness,\\" and for helping readers \\"understand how globalism and localism intersect,\\" but none of those who shower praise on Rajagopal note the predictability of the trajectories of such theses.In brief, the thesis Rajagopal presents is that between January 1987 and September 1990, during the rule of the \\"secular\\" Congress Party, the Indian state-run television, Doordarshan, began broadcasting the Hindu epic Ramayana, in serial form on Sundays. This supposedly violated a taboo on religious partisanship, and it influenced the BJP in its mobilization of disgruntled and frustrated Hindus, culminating in the destruction of the Babri mosque. The author argues that the media, especially television, reshapes the \\"context in which politics is conceived, enacted, and understood\\", and cautions that he is not proposing a simple cause-effect relationship between the broadcast of the epic on television and the destruction of the disused mosque.A big part of the mobilization of Hindus, Rajagopal claims was through the BJP leader Advani's rathyatra (campaign through the country in a Toyota land-cruiser decked up as a chariot of the Hindu God Rama) in 1990 to reclaim the land for Hindus on which the Babri mosque was built. Advani's 4000-mile campaign across the country was one of the largest political campaigns in post-independent India, built around the symbol of Lord Rama. Rajagopal claims that Advani's campaign changed the complexion of Indian politics. This ignores the fact that religion and politics has always been a potent mix in India, including the fact that Gandhi himself used Rama as a symbol of righteousness and goodness, that distribution of \\"tickets\\" to run for political office has often been made on religion and caste-based identities, and that huge cardboard figures of politicians during election time hark back to God-like figures from the Hindu past.Rajagopal, analyzing the series of events, from the broadcast of the epic serial to the rise of the BJP as a national party, claims that while television audiences may have thought they were harking back to an epic golden age, Hindu nationalist leaders like Advani were embracing the prospects of neo-liberalism and globalization. Television was the device that hinged these movements together, \\"appealing to authoritarian rather than democratic values\\". He says that there was no causal relation between economic reforms and Hindutva (Hindu nationalism), nor did the two share any inherent logic. But politics, anywhere in the world, is the art of the possible, and that the BJP used certain circumstances to its advantage is neither strange nor quixotic.For Rajagopal, the economic liberalization that the Congress government had begun to undertake, and which the BJP was supporting, demanded more authoritarian control than needed for state-controlled economic enterprise. We now know that under the Nehruvian, mostly Soviet inspired socialist dispensation, Indian state-controlled enterprises devoured enormous wealth while producing not much more than the sloth of government employees and the corruption of politicians under what was known as the licence-raj. We have seen in the past year the BJP-led government has been able to sell huge, loss-incurring public enterprises to private entrepreneurs who have within a year turned around those industries into profit-generating ones, with the workers themselves enjoying more salaries and benefits. Of course, privatization, liberalization and free market capitalism are not painless or infallible cures for sick economies, and the BJP has never presented them as such. And it seems the irony is lost on those praising Rajagopal's thesis about the appropriateness of Nehru's socialism for India is written sitting at the bastion of free market capitalism - the United States of America!Rajagopal also ignores or minimizes the nature of the 1100-year old Hindu-Muslim divide, about India's two Muslim neighbors -- Pakistan and Bangladesh -- from where the Hindu minority has been systematically driven out, and the problem of Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley from where 400,000 Hindus have escaped to tent cities outside Delhi because of the threat to their lives and property from Muslim terrorists. Instead, he pins the blame solely on the BJP and the RSS for instigating \\"communal riots to polarize society and to define the Hindu-Muslim axis as a life or death question\\". This is unfortunate because there are a number of writers like Shourie, Elst, Goel, and Ram Swarup who have carefully studied Hindu-Muslim conflict and challenged the Marxist analyses of India's past and present. It is no surprise that Rajagopal does not refer to their works as India's Marxist-dominated academe and its supporters in the West do not countenance contrarian analyses of India's religious conflict, history, and society."},{"Title":"Politics after Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India","review":"Extremely well written book on how television has played a key role in redefining politics and culture in India."},{"Title":"Sleepy Bears","review":"Beautifully written and richly illustrated, Sleepy Bears is a delight!

By the time the third bear fell asleep he was yawning so much that it was all I could do to not start laughing. By the time the fourth bear fell asleep, he kept having to jerk his head up because he was nodding off. By the time the last bear fell asleep, he had fallen over, face first into the book. I had to lift him up and lay him backwards, scared that I was going to wake him up....but he was OUT. And at that point I was ready for a nap myself. I don't know who yawned more....him or me.

Mother Bear says goodnight to each of her cubs and suggests what she thinks each of them will dream about.Kerry Argent has beautifully illustrated the bears so that they look fuzzy enough to touch. The textured artwork of the \\"real\\" world is different from that of the dreams. The scenery and objects illustrated in the bear cubs' dreams is flatter looking, with little shading or color gradient.Argent has included a blue stuffed elephant in each non-dream illustration. It is on the title page, and then is held by one or another of the bear cubs throughout the book until the final page. Once everyone has fallen asleep, the stuffed elephant blows out the candle. This book is a perfect read-before-bed story, with it's peaceful illustrations and repetition of the line \\"Now who's the sleepiest?

Still, one wonders about the author's (her sister, Geraldine's) credibility since much of the text is presented in a negative light that highlights Barr's faults. The passages on Barr's accusations of childhood sexual abuse are intriguing and raise skepticism; but overall, the book has a whiney, defensive tone coming from a sister who was suprisingly and, in her view, unjustly fired as Barr's agent/promoter. More info about the development and execution of the popular \\"Roseanne\\" television show would have been interesting. In my opinion, the writing in this book is much too padded and reads a bit like a gossip tabloid."},{"Title":"My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold","review":"I have read a lot of books trying to figure out the comedic genius of Roseanne Barr and this one did not assist me in my goal. It was well-written but lacked that certain something that you feel when you are being told the truth. I also read Roseanne Barr's book and felt the same way. My suspicion is that the two of them wrote Roseanne's act together UNLIKE each of them taking full credit in their books."},{"Title":"My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold","review":"What do you get when you combine one of the most talented TV stars of the early '90s (not to mention, one of the most controversial and attention-hungry), a heroic and underestimated and unappreciated sister and an otherwise true story that has never been told until now? A fascinating book that like its authoress (Geraldine Barr) and subject (sister, Roseanne) is both fascinating and eye-opening.I have always been enamored with Roseanne because her TV show was one of the only true depictions of a realistic American family. Like many of her fans, I followed her through all of her countless \\"revelations\\" and hairball claims during the '90s when she made up story after story for more fame, attention and money.It wasn't until I read \\"My Sister Roseanne\\" that I really learned about this complex and sad woman, Roseanne Barr. But this book is so much more than a typical celebrity biography. It's just as much Geraldine's story as it is Roseanne's. And like her big sister, Geraldine is an intriguing and complex woman and talented in her own right.Even if this book wasn't about one of my favorite TV stars I still would have enjoyed it though. That's because Geraldine rips the veil of secrecy off of all of Hollywood while she discusses things that have rarely made it into mainstream popular books up until now. She talks about money, contracts, the love of attention and the proverbial fame game years before any other top star had the courage or the will to talk about these things. Her writing is not only factual, but also inspiring and revealing.\\"My Sister Roseanne\\" was published 15 years ago, in 1994 when Roseanne was at her most powerful and most successful (at the time this book came out her show was number-1) and perhaps with all the clout that fame brings a woman who achieves a hit sitcom, Roseanne was able to collectively get this book blackballed. The same critics that panned this book as poultry and subversive were the same ones that praised Roseanne's book that came out 6 months prior to this; yet no one called Roseanne money-motivated or greedy, even though her second autobiography was published less than 5 years after her first.My main reason for reading this book is because I always like to hear the \\"back story\\" or \\"inside story\\" or the story that the media doesn't pick up because it's not shocking or scandalous. Instead, this book is a truthful depiction of Geraldine's life and association with her sister, Roseanne.Geraldine discusses in intimate detail how she was Roseanne's chief writer and business manager for over a decade only to be callously fired in a matter of seconds because Roseanne simply didn't want her in her life anymore. Geraldine also writes about how Roseanne became drunk and inebriated on her own fame and would say and do things for no other reason than to get attention and to stay in the spotlight.My second reason for reading this book is because I strongly believe that Mr. and Mrs. Barr (Geraldine's parents) got a really bad rap by their ungrateful and dishonest daughter, Roseanne. Geraldine writes about how Roseanne's false claims of incest nearly killed her parents (I honestly cannot imagine anything worse for a parent to go through). In detail she even takes the time to describe how her entire family was affected and afflicted by Roseanne's malicious and deceitful claims.Perhaps what was least surprising was how Geraldine took the time to even go into specifics concerning her parents' innocence regarding these hateful claims. Yet, this is just one more thing that the media never talks about. It is sad that when someone gets famous their words are held up like concrete that causes the masses to believe anything that is said.The book also includes several pictures (however none of them are new or unpublished). Although the picture on the cover was a cute picture of Geraldine and Roseanne (I included a scan of it because the 18 people selling it on Amazon didn't bother to put up a picture).Since the book has been published Geraldine has been vindicated. Roseanne reconciled with her estranged family about 10 years ago and has since recanted all of the hateful and notorious statements that were made, such as being an incest survivor at the hands of her innocent parents. Yet there wasn't a big press conference to state this.I have a lot of respect and admiration for Geraldine because she told the story that no one really wanted to hear. It's ironic in a way, isn't it? I mean she was really ahead of her time with this book. For its time period it was rather groundbreaking because it came out during a time period when many celebrities (everyone from La Toya Jackson to Patty Duke) were (falsely?) claiming to be victims of abuse. Yet if Geraldine had written the book now it likely would never have been published or seen the light of day. The story is very dated and only people who really want to search out the truth would probably pick it up. Nevertheless it's a fantastic book."},{"Title":"My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold","review":"This story paints a very different portrait of Roseanne. According to Geraldine; the author and Roseanne's sister; \\"Rosanne; the domestic goddess\\" was a creative venture between the two sisters. Geraldine helped Roseanne get to the top; only to be abandoned. The entire story leads you to speculate what happened and before the end; you can pretty much figure it all out. If you wondered what happened with Roseanne and her family after she publicly described her memories of sexual molestation; this story tells you; the sad details. (no conclusion as to where the truth lies; but it literally broke the family apart) An interesting story about two sisters growing up in Utah and making a dream come true. Although Roseanne was known for her comedy; this tells the story of a very unhappy and unfunny woman and her sister. It's an interesting read; even if she wasn't famous; the story line is unique. The book flows nicely and is an easy read."},{"Title":"My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold","review":"If you were to total all the interesting parts of this book, you'd come up with about thirty pages. Mostly, it chronicles how Roseanne Barr went off her rocker when she got involved with Tom Arnold and then, with the aid of false memory syndrome, betrayed her family. If you have a lot of patience and don't mind reading the same thing over and over couched in different (yet still unlyrical) language, then it might entertain you just for the dirt it gives on a major celebrity."},{"Title":"My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold","review":"This book is an invaluable portrait of Roseanne and her family, and how her family coped with Roseanne's sexual abuse allegations against her father in the early 1990s. It is also, primarily, the story of sisters, who worked together to create a successful business (Roseanne's career) and how the relationship came apart when Roseanne became a household name. On one level the book is not without its flaws: it is overwritten and at times repetitive. However, these flaws are balanced by the author's mostly successful attempts to present all sides of the story in straight-forward prose. Geraldine Barr is as candid discussing her own shortcomings -- and those of her family -- as she is in discussing Roseanne's and, as a result, the book emerges as a cut above the average tell-all memoir. That the Barr family seemed to become a closer unit in the wake of Roseanne's abuse allegations is the real story here."},{"Title":"My Sister Roseanne: The True Story of Roseanne Barr Arnold","review":"I first read Roseanne's two books. They were barely readable. This book by Roseanne's sister, Geraldine, while definitely too wordy, was readable and sometimes even interesting. This book is low on incomprehensible rambling and high on the family history of the Barr family and the story of Roseanne's rise to fame.The author definitely wrote in order to tell her side of the story regarding her being fired by Roseanne and also regarding Roseanne accusing their parents of sexual molestation. After reading all three books, I lean toward Geraldine's version. After Roseanne's head injury as a teen, she suffered from mental problems, which hurts her credibility. Also, I don't doubt that Geraldine helped Roseanne get where she got in her career. Roseanne said that herself and later retracted it.Anyway, this feud is old news and no one probably thinks about reading these books anymore, but Roseanne has been in the limelight again. She has had her show released on DVD and also has recorded a children's DVD. Maybe she will make a comeback? The public has probably forgotten all of her 80's and 90's antics."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"Contrary to popular belief, the &quot;Dark Age,&quot; (AD 476-c.1200) was &quot;dark&quot; not because of the alleged backward nature of the time, but rather because of the lack of historical sources from the period. This biography, written by Einhard, who was a friend of the most famous monarch from the Dark Age, sheds some much-needed light into the political and military history of the period. Written soon after the death of Charlemagne in 814, Einhard tells us of his rise to power, his military campaigns, his dealings with the scheming Byzantines, his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor, and his unruly daughters. Throughout the narrative, Einhard strives to portray his King and friend in the best possible light. I highly recommend this book to any student of Medieval history, as well as to those who might have an interest in European monarchy. It is informative, easy-reading, and a great primary source for those who study the history of the period."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"Charlemagne's reign was a brief flash of light in the dark centuries that followed the collapse of the Roman empire. As king of the Franks, Charlemagne unified much of Western Europe - what today is northeastern Spain, all of France, and parts of Germany and Italy. He revived education and learning, repaired existing churches and built new ones, and helped strengthen the position of the Pope in Rome. In the year 800 Charlemagne was crowned Emperor Augustus, ruler of the new Roman empire.This new empire was short lived, but Charlemagne became legend. Einhard, a scholar in Charlemagne's court and author of this short biography, was faced with a difficult question: how does one write a balanced and honest biography of a revered king, a king that had become legendary in his own time?Einhard had few examples to follow. The religious biographies of saints were not entirely appropriate. He turned to a classical source, The Lives of the Caesars by the Roman historian Seutonius. Einhard devotes about half of his work to Charlemagne's extensive military campaigns, but his focus remains on Charlemagne the leader and Charlemagne the man, not on military tactics and strategy.The modern reader will find it helpful to read between the lines. Einhard obviously admired Charlemagne, and his criticisms are muted. Also, Einhard's writing reflects a world view very different from today.For example, Einhard in discussing the continual uprising of the Saxons says: he never allowed their faithless behavior to go unpunished, but either took the field against them in person, or sent his counts with an army to wreak vengeance and exact righteous satisfaction.Wreak vengeance? Exact righteous satisfaction? The editor's footnote explains that at the time of a revolt in 782 Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons beheaded in one day at Verden. Similarly, after a formidable conspiracy in Germany was put down, \\"all the traitors were banished, some of them without mutilation, others after their eyes had been put out\\".Einhard provides many details of Charlemagne's character and private life. Charlemagne enjoyed the exhalations from natural hot springs. He often practiced swimming; few could surpass him in this sport. Einhard carefully describes the clothing worn by Charlemagne. He apparently disliked foreign costumes, and was most comfortable in the common dress of the Frankish people.He was temperate in eating, and especially drinking. He was particularly fond of roast meat prepared on a spit and disregarded medical advice to eat only boiled meat. He could speak Latin fluently. St. Augustine's The City of God was among his favorite books. He never developed proficiency at writing, although he practiced regularly during his later years.Einhard's biography was immensely popular and more than eighty manuscripts still exist today.My copy of The Life of Charlemagne was published by Ann Arbor Paperbacks, University of Michigan Press. The foreword by historian Sidney Painter was quite helpful in establishing the historical context. My copy includes a ninth century map of Europe, footnotes, and a genealogical table for the family of Charlemagne and Hildegard."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"Einhard's depiction of Charlemagne is one portraying his private and public life. For those of you thinking that this book was only written so that Einhard could honor Charlemagne, please look again. At first glimse this book does seem to be a superficial accounting of the life and times of Charlemagne, however, it is only after you begin to peel back the layers that the truth comes out. Einhard's depiction of charlemagne humanizes the great ruler by balancing the brutal warrior persona with his private, loving father and friend, persona. It is important to note that Einhard's book would have been read before the court, so it was imperative that the content be pleasing to those in attendance. With that in mind as well as the fact that Einhard revered Charlemagne, he manages to shed light onto Charlemagne's character and it's not always flattering. This is a biography or hagiography of Charlemagne's character. Einhard depicts a man, Charlemagne, motivated by human desires, not unlike any one of us. He was guilty of wrath, lust, gluttony, and greed and gave the church huge sums of money to be exonerated from his sins. This book shows that Charlemagne loved the institution of the church,not necessarily the church itself, because it brought him wealth and power. Charlemagne wanted to unify the cultures around him, but only after he conquered the peoples and re-settled them away from their homeland did he accept them. He smoothed the edges. He only wanted cultures that had been 'watered down'. People didn't want to be near Charlemagne, he was militaristic, oppressive, and aggressive. In fact to quote from the book &quot;Have the Frank for your friend, but not for your neighbor&quot; (43). Einhard exposes many of Charlemagne's flaws in this work, so read it with a critical eye."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"With all respect to Robert Jarvis, I must say that his review is off. Charlemagne died in the year 814, and Einhard knew the great emperor personally. Einhard's biography was written in the decade following Charlemagne's death, so readers must be aware of the style and purposes ninth-century writers had when they approached their works. Einhard's work is brief indeed, as it omits details such as one will find in Roger Collins's fine work, _Charlemagne_ (U of Toronto Press, 1998), but giving the minutiae of the emperor's life was not Einhard's purpose. Instead, basing his work on that of the Roman Suetonius, who wrote lives of Roman emperors, Einhard tried to convey what kind of man and ruler Charlemagne was. We learn here what kind of father he was--that information is not found in any other primary source. We know that Charlemagne initiated a kingdom-wide reform of education, but only Einhard tells us that the king himself was familiar with Latin and struggled late in life to learn to write. Readers who want to find the &quot;In this year, this happened...&quot; type of 'facts' in writings from the period of Charlemagne's lifetime, I suggest tracking down P.D.

Although presenting an idealized version of events, the historical accuracy of most of the book's details have been largely confirmed by modern historians. The book's modern index reaffirms this conclusion by documenting less than ten minor factual errors.The biography was obviously written to honor Einhard's former patron, but the deeds and exploits chronicled in Einhard's book are nevertheless plausibly presented in a idealized manner reminiscent of patriotic middle school textbook renderings of George Washington or Theodore Roosevelt. The book's format is continuous, breaking only at the end of a four-page preface before continuing on with an unbroken string of pages which are presented without the benefit of chapter divisions. The style of Einhard's writing tends to be wooden and Spartan - the biography tells the reader of Charlemagne's accomplishments but makes scant mention of the difficulties he faced - and any criticism of Charlemagne is obviously muted by the author's attempt to balance the idealized expectations of his partisan audience with the Roman ideal of factual honesty.Einhard's biography starts with a concise outline of Charlemagne's lineage, beginning with a brief mention of his great-grandfather Pepin of Heristal, followed by three pages summarizing the exploits of grandfather Charles Martel and father Pepin the Short. Due to an admitted lack of source material, Einhard skips Charlemagne's childhood and proceeds directly to his first military undertaking; the Aqauitanian war begun by Pepin the Short. The rest of the book's sixty seven pages are essentially divided into two parts: the first half concisely presenting a chronological, episodic narration of Charlemagne's military campaigns (confining the focus to Charlemagne's motives and decisions while largely ignoring his tactics and strategy), before backtracking to conclude with a twenty seven page glimpse of the monarch's personal and family life.The author's purpose in writing the book, plainly stated by him in the book's preface, reveal an unmistakable admiration which borders on hero worship. Descriptive phrases like \\"most excellent,\\" \\"justly renowned,\\" and \\"a very great and distinguished man\\" clearly display Einhard's to write the book as tribute to the greatest man of his age. In this he succeeds; although the book's superficial and miserly accounting of its subject's exploits leave the reader hungry for more details.The book effectively chronicles the subject's glorious life and accomplishments from the point of view of a member of his court. Simultaneously, Einhard manages to shine some much-needed light onto Charlemagne's moral stature and political machinations, in addition to providing the reader with a general military history of the period."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"This chronicle was commissioned at the request of Louis the Pious one of Charlemagne's successors, was written by Einhard, a monk, historian, and a dedicated servant of Charlemagne. His Life of Charlemagne, written between 817-830 is clearly in the vein of the famous Roman historian Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars (a text that existed at the monastery where the author worked). The work is brief, to the point, and for the most part does not include tangential information, and is biased. The bias is completely understandable and the introduction to the text points out where and why. His chronicle was written to make Louis the Pious' famous father look good. For example, one of the morally stained aspects of the Charlemagne's reign were the actions of his unmoral daughters, which Einhard carefully does not tell us about. Einhard, in short, sometimes deliberately obscures the truth. However, what is so appealing about Einhard's text is the fact that his most of his information was based off of 26 years as a servant of Charlemagne and his court, and information that he includes of actions before Charlemagne's reign most likely was gathered from sources and documents which he had access to. Lastly, Einhard's attempt at stringently following the model of Suetonius Twelve Caesars makes him connect the characteristics of great emperors such as Augustus to Charlemagne, obscuring Charlemagne's actual habits, personality etc...The introduction is ok but is mostly summary, the map is good, but the notes are scanty. A MUCH better addition would be the Penguin Classics text, Two Lives of Charlemagne, that also includes the equally interesting (although vastly different) De Carlo Magno written 70 years after Charlemagne's death."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"A nice edition of a brief near contemporary biography of Charlemagne. The author, the monk Einhard, spent decades attached to Charlemagne's court. This is, not surprisingly, a very positive account of Charlemagne, stressing his considerable achievements in extending his rule over much of Europe and his support of the Church. The introduction is by the great medievalist Sidney Painter, who indicates that Einhard based his account on Suetonius' Lives of the Caesars. Einhard's biography is notable also for what it leaves out, such as the many brutal aspects of Charlemagne's campaigns."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"King Charles the Great, more commonly known as Charlemagne, was the first truly great leader of France. His reign was one of great expansion as he created a French nation that controlled nearly all of Western Europe. Charlemagne was a great military commander and one who appreciated learning, he did a great deal to promote the relearning of so much that was lost with the fall of the Roman Empire.Einhard was one of the learned people that Charlemagne sponsored, and so in this book Einhard quite naturally praises the great king. Yet, it is historically accurate and written in 830 CE, it is contemporary to the life of the great king. Einhard's direct observation of the life of Charlemagne is a historical classic, one that should be read by all students of what we now call the Dark Ages. For Charlemagne was a rare glimmer of light during those times of meager learning and education."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"I enjoyed reading this account of Charlemagne written by a contemporary of Charlemagne. What makes this book interesting is being able to see Charlemagne through the eyes of Einhard. Yes, I know Einhard was a friend of Charlemagne and might have influenced his account but all in all, still a valuable work into the life of one of the most important men of his era. Plus I am a fan of Medieval History and find it fascinating to be able to read something like this over a thousand years later. A great easy read that is informative and insightful into this period."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"I read the book through in one sitting. It was, actually, not particularly well written, as though the writer were not overly familiar with and skilled in his craft. I viewed it as a small insight, from a seemingly personal level into the life of an historical figure about whom I really did not know very much. From that increase in my knowledge, I give it a 3-star rating. But for that increase in my knowledge, the rating would have been lower."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"This is an excellent book with great information. I used it for a research paper and made an A due to the extensive areas of his life that it covered."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"I would not presume to be capable of judging this book for its historical worth as I am not a historian. I would also not be able to say what made me want this book, buy it, and read it much less review it. I wouldn't even know who to recommend it to, because why this book appeals to me is a mystery, but it definitely appeals to me. I enjoyed reading Eginhard's work, it went very fast at 31 pages, but there is a considerable amount of information for such a slim book. Eginhard tells of the history of Charlemagne as he knew it, and he also attempted to tell us something of the man that Charlemagne was. Once again, I don't know how much of it is reliable, and how much of it was just Eginhard gushing over his patron, but I found it to be quite insightful."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne","review":"When I purchased this book I failed to notice (or was not informed!) that it is scarcely 70 pages long &amp;, through the use of a central type system, even these pages are only half full. It is a wooden, lack-lustre account providing a minimum of detail about Charlemagne's reign, conquests &amp; family. It reads like a homework report! Einhard is a contemporary of the man so the account is at least probably believable. However, this is nothing more than an appetite-whetter &amp; anyone with an interest in the subject should definitely be looking for something with a little more meat. This is just not good value!"},{"Title":"Living Language Conversational French","review":"The book,(Conversational French-the Living Language)was brand new, described perfectly, at the same price as the other used ones on sale.

They also convince you of the power of the Lord and truely convict you to pray!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"For the first time I envisioned an angelic warrior by my side representative of God's ultimate protection and power over my life. Peretti demonstrates though Satan's army is definitely present, they have no control over the God of the universe. I loved these books and I pull them off the shelf every few months and read them again!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I read this book thinking I would set it down after the first chapter ot two (as I do with most books) But not with &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; God has Given This Author A wonderful way with words! every page captivated me. There was no way to set this book down. This book is a wonderful tool to show us were we stand with Christ. I would love to be labeled the &quot;the praying woman!&quot; I recomend this book to anyone seeking Christ!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I loved both of the books! The message of the books are great. Especially &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; which gives a moving account a character (I won't give it away) that comes to know Christ. It's great. I love all the characters and I deffinitely love the supernatural! I'd love to know that angels are actually out there battling the forces of evil like the books portray. Two &quot;must reads&quot;!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Although I realize this book is a work of fiction and the Bible is our only true source of information regarding spiritual warfare, this book was without a doubt, the best, most captivating book I've ever read! I found myself carrying it in the car with me and read it while in carpool or even when stopped at traffic lights. It opened my eyes to the importance of prayer in the life of a Christian."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Another great novel by Frank Peretti, a great author with a great message. A suspensful action book that keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I was totally hooked when reading this book, and it was very entertaining endeed. Even though the spiritual warfare around us daily, and the power of prayer is very real, I sure hope people dont take this book as total spiritual truth and total theological correctness. REMEMBER-- This book is a FICTION novel BASED on real spiritual facts! Do not let it confuse you in some of the details... The real guide for our lives and what you should base your beliefs in is the Holy Bible! Keep christian fiction books for what they are made for: entertainment!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Frank Peretti uses his phenominal writing style in these epic novels. Each tells of the war on three worlds- heaven, earth, and hell. Using a style of writing that picks up speed until the finale, Peretti does a wonderful job of displaying the supernatural in accordance with everyday life. Highly suspenseful and original, this book shows ordinary people what is going on in the world. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Although this book was written in fictional form the story line and the evil spirits that try to come at the lives of the characters seem so real and who really knows. . . There were never dull moments and from the point I picked up the book I found myself hurrying to get back into it's pages each free moment. Even after I finished the book I found myself wondering IF there were spiritual forces at work in my life too. I read it about 10 years ago now and still often think of the story. I loved it!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I had to erase my first response becasue of how long the listof things i hated about this book was. I'll try to keep thisshort.. like Pereti's climaxes. I am getting sick of hearing how great this book is.. I've read far more compeling themes in un-christian writings. If total servitude to God is what Pereti is telling us is the key... he coulda just said that in one sentence instead of putting us through the same old &quot;demon very strong.. but angel kill 20 demon without a flinch&quot; story. Once again Pereti greatly succeds in building up to the grand climax.. getting yet another character placed at the mercy of her enemies.. and guess what happens?.. the same thing as in This present Darkness....except worse. Did he get a 3rd grader to write the ending? i wont go into any more detail..there really isnt any. Like every book.. it has a lesson.. unlike most books.. it has nothing else. Forced to read this in Bible class...compaired to Lewis and other christian writers.. I still dont know why this book was choosen."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I've read Prophet &amp; the 2 &quot;Darkness&quot; books and I know these were great books just because of the fact that I couldnt put them down. No other books were as gripping and mind captivating. I believe in the spiritual world and I think Frank gives a great perspective on the ever present Battle between Gods Angels and satan and his demons. Im just sorry the books had to end. hey Frank, if you ever read this--my message to you is KEEP ON WRITING!!! and Fight the Good Fight!!!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I really enjoy Peretti's style of writing. He is funny, insightful, and realy knows how to draw you into the story. I found myself emersed in both of these books. I am now reading The Visitation, also an excellent read. I used to read King &amp; Koontz, but Frank Peretti is so much better. I hope these books find their way to the box office they would make a good film or two."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Awesome story! like JRR Tolken's writing, the story starts out slow but culminates into an exciting finish!

This purchase was a gift for my brother-in-law for Christmas and he read them in no time and loved them also. Both books are in one volume so it is a large book if you were to carry it around to read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I gave this to my daughter-n-law for Christmas and she is enjoying this book. She is an avid reader and likes hardback. Great price for a really great value!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book is fiction, but does a great job of covering the hiarchy of demonic powers and the struggle between good and evil in the supernatural and how it affects the natural. Of course it IS fiction, but all the same not too far off track how I have imagined the goings-on in the supernatural realm. Keeps you on the edge of your seat... you don't want to put the book down until the end!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I read these 2 books many years ago, maybe 29 years ago. My niece just mentioned them to me...so I was very pleased to find them at Amazon...and ordered it for her for Christmas...even though these 2 novels are fiction, it really gives you a very good look into what is happening all around us during the present age and how to deal with This Present Darkness...I suggest reading these 2 books to find the answers to Piercing the Darkness."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Very suspenseful and hard to put down. I have been almost late to work after staying up too late reading this. : )"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This two-in-one book is perfect because of the way these Peretti novels fit together. The price was very reasonable and the book came quickly."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I have read both these books, as well as some of Peretti's other books (Prophet, The Oath). Of them all, these two are the most definitive in Peretti's repertoire.The thrust of the books is Spiritual Warfare, including both &quot;the big picture,&quot; and how it affects individual people, and the power of prayer. The reader can see and listen to the people, demons, and angels, while the people in the story cannot see the spiritual battle going on around them, though it influences them and vice versa. In a nutshell, it brings home Eph. 6:12 (&quot;We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but... against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot;)I would definitely NOT treat either as a textbook for spiritual warface, as they ARE fiction books, so some liberties are taken. But it is a good reminder that we don't see everything going on around us, and we need to be on our toes--after we've been down on our knees.I would also not recommend the books to young readers as some parts may be scary, or the concept too overwhelming. But junior highers and up would be fine, though I'd be sure to talk with them before, during, and after they've read the book about &quot;the reality&quot; of spiritual warfare, and that it's not just a fictional concept.The difference between the two? &quot;This Present Darkness,&quot; focuses more on the actual people in the book, whereas the 2nd, &quot;Piercing the Darkness,&quot; contains more footage on the spiritual side, to the point where many of the demons and angels could be considered main characters. So if you liked the first one, and yearned for more of the spiritual side, continue reading with the 2nd. But if you're like some who felt &quot;This Present Darkness&quot; more than adequately whet your appetite for the demon/angels, you may find the &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; to be a little over the top, though I'd still give it a chance.Also, the titles reflect very accurately the contents. The first book alerts you to the spiritual warfare issue (&quot;This Present Darkness&quot;) which we sometimes neglect, while the 2nd more actively has the characters doing something about it (&quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot;)."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Two of the best selling Christian novels in history, now combined. With This Present Darkness, Peretti broke onto the scene by graphically tearing back the veil between the human and the spirit world. Descending upon the small town of Ashton, angels, demons, and strongmen engage in a vivid battle and we, the reader, see it all unfold. Ever wonder what exactly a guardian angel actually may do? Here's one possible scenerio. While Peretti's theology on the subject may not be perfect (many of his ideas are pure speculation, but that's why it's &quot;fiction&quot;), he does most definatly give us a bold reason as to why prayer is so vital. Why prayer does, in fact, move mountains and can turn the tide in unseen spiritual battles that are taking place around us (as in the book of Daniel). Both of these books are fast paced and highly entertaining with a powerful theme. Before the Left Behind series, no other Christian novels were as widely read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book literally changed my life. It is entertaining both from a Christian and a secular perspective. But, imaging the battle raging in the spiritual realm has changed my prayer life forever. I first read the book in 1988 or 89 when it first came out, but I've read it at least a half dozen times since then. Once I get started reading I can't seem to put it down -- even though I know the ending. I finish the book feeling more positive than before. I rushed out to by the second book because I enjoyed the first book so much, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. Before Frank Peretti I wasn't interested in &quot;Christian fiction&quot;. I just didn't see the point. But, I love fiction and I love the Lord. It's wonderful to be able to read, enjoy what I'm reading and learn something all at the same time."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I read these books several years ago and the experience changed my prayer life and the way I look at the spiritual world. This may be a work of fiction but it also reinforced my faith in God and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. I have more courage now because I know that through prayers I can always count on God'ss protection in whatever I do and wherever I go. Just the thought of the angels' swords blazing and them eager to fight away the evil spirits whenever I would say my prayers is a very comforting thought in a world full of unexpected dangers and temptations.Aside from its effect on my spiritual growth and prayer life, these books are also very easy to read and can give readers hours of escape. I almost didn't put the books down while reading them and was really hooked until the last pages. But I was reading these books while looking after my grandmother after her eye operation and had to check on her often.I recommend that you first read This Present Darkness to under the Piercing The Darkness better."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"...This book was truly a blessing to me. It opens your eyes to the spiritual warfare going on all around us. If you are not a praying Christian, after reading these books you will be! The Bible tells us to pray always, and believe me you will know why when you are reading these books. I haven't been this excited about a book since I was a young child. While you are reading these books you will cry, get mad at the devil, be happy during victories, say a prayer for the characters, feel joy for the Angels in battle, and shout hallelujah at the end of the book. Pray for understanding when you are reading so you can get the message. After reading the first book in this set I didn't think the second book could get any better, I was truly amazed when the second book was better than the first! What a joy it was to read this book, I look forward to reading them again in the near future."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I just finished This Present Darkness and the book is fascinating. I can honestly say it opened my eyes to a lot of concepts I've never really thought of before. This book has made me view the activities of my life and the lives around me differently. I would recommened this book to anyone who is interested in stengthening their Christianity or who is just interested in finding out more about God and the POWER OF PRAYING. Like I said, it truly changed my life and I can't wait to read the rest of his books."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"A very powerful book this is! Mr. Peretti's descriptions are bold and clear, and his strong dialogues flow from one page to the other as he takes us in a whirlwind of spiritual warfare. 'This Present Darkness' is a novel that's guaranteed to keep many a midnight flask burning. It's hard to explain how captivating this book really is, you have to read it for yourself. The story is set in the small town of Ashton, and its inhabitants are the target of an evil, spiritual kind: demons. They have one mission and that is to take over the entire town and bring new world order. Except for the prayers of a young pastor, his wife and a few firm believers of God, the others are prey to the clutches of evil, leading to demon-possessed lives. The action and description of the fight between good and evil spirits, the angels and demons, is solid, and covers detailed accounts that will keep you page turning and amazed! A must read!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I'd read these books some time back, but, just the thought of the plot gives me goose pimples. All I can say is, WOW! Spectacular! Just what people need to put things into God's perspective, after all.A friend of mine suggested that I read this book. I was skeptical at first; I mean, &quot;Hey, yeah, right, angels battling with demons? C'mon ...!&quot; But, as I got further into Peretti's captivating novels, it took no time to convince me of the spiritual battles me and thousands of other Chriatians the world over are facing right now. In spite of my (cynical) self, I was actually beginning to root on Marshall, Bernice, and the others in this &quot;Anywhere, USA&quot; town.Yes, Jesus is Lord. And, the Biblical standards in which I and my church involvment adhere to is strove for daily. But Peretti writes with a gift perhaps none of us can fathom totally. Just enjoy his work. Appreciate it for what it is, and for which God has graced him with the jewel of storytelling.I'm looking forward to a sequel to both Present and Piercing.Next read - &quot;The Visitation&quot;."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"My personal opinion stands that this was an excellent book. It was a great tale of good and evil with Christian themes. The only way it blessed me was that it reminded me that there is a God who loves me a whole stinkin' lot. But this book isn't for everyone...I've noticed that this novel got either great reviews or horrible ones. I believe it's because people treated it more as concrete theology than a work of fiction. Wherever your beliefs stand concerning the spiritual realm, this book should not mold your way of thinking, nor should you treat it as a work of heresy. If you are closed minded and have extreme issues with others' ways of life. This book may not be for you.Putiing all of the deeper meanings of the book aside, This Present Darkness was fairly written. It grabbed your attention from the first page. However, the ending I thought was rather anti-climatic. In addition, if you are a light reader, this book may not be for you as well. There are a lot of characters in the story and it to some, it may be confusing sorting them all out. My father didn't like the book because of this reason. Otherwise, the book was not too shabby."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book started out interesting, then remained that way until the very end. My schedule didn't allow me to read this book in one sitting. Once I started it, I looked forward to any opportunity to read more of it.

This one is hard to read but is my favorite by far."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"After reading this book, I became awake to the fact that everything under the sun has life in it.I saw the presence of the messengers of light shinning over a situation or in flight because, a believer has not encouraged their fight over darkness with his/her prayers.I highly recommend this book to all pastors and a must for evangelists since you break frontiers in search of souls to save.Like Angel Gabriel in the book of Daniel, there are demonic princes and captains of different regions that would be in opposition to your mission. Therefore, know them and how they operate. I could read this book over and over again.May Yahweh bless you brother Piretti.Soon you'll be getting my order for This Present Darkness and other works.Remain blessed and Sholom."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This combo was the first of Mr. Peretti's works that I ever read. I remember thinkingthat the concept sounded rather hokey . . . Seeing the events from the level of the humansand from the level of the angels and demons who were influencing them. But it reallyworked. I couldn't put the book down and really felt for the characters. They were trulycompelling and it is always interesting to see how the primary characters will give theirlives to Christ. The angels, as well as two mortal characters, return for the second story,which is easily as good as the first."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These are both great books and a very uplifting. Although the first book starts out slow, soon your caught up in the whirlwind and ready for more."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Finally, two of the most awesome Christian books ever written are in a single cover. Frank's understanding of the spiritual realm is uncanny, though somewhat sensationalistic (of course, it's &quot;fiction&quot;). His style of writing is masterful and his way of leading us into a suspenseful moment is breathtaking. This is almost a warfare guide for today's Christian."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"What can I say about these books? Frank Peretti's books are classics in the Christian fiction genre. However, if you're not up for suspense, these books may not be for you. Be prepared to see the dark side of the universe as well as some shining examples of God at work. This is an intense read. As for this particular edition, great value! Christian fiction is so expensive that any value edition is welcome."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Frank Peretti tackles one of the greatest mysteries of the Christian faith--the realm of angels and demons--with a dramatic flair and spiritual insight reminescent of the Classic Christian Apologist, C.S.

The way that Peretti bought these characters to life was truely a movement of the Spirit! They could be anyone's neighbors.

I enjoyed these so much, I've ordered all his other novels!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I don't do a lot of fiction reading, but this book was enjoyable and has permanently altered the way I view spiritual warfare. This book brings a clarity to the New Age movement that I hadn't seen before."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book was awesome and it is a must read for anybody wanting a deeper understanding of the Spirit realm. It is fiction but that doesnt matter, the writer did a wonderful job capturing the realities of Spiritual warfare."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Great fiction! it would give you an idea of how the spiritual forces work on a daily bases. I will say though, I strongly recommend the reader (especially if the reader is a girl) to finish the chapter before going to bed! When I was reading and I wouldn't finish the chapter, I found myself dreaming the end of the chapter according to my own thoughts! that was scary!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"If you've wondered about spiritual warfare and what goes on behind the scenes, this book really gets you thinking. Though it's fiction, there is truth behind it. As Christians we fight not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces in the heavenly realm."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These books will change the way you pray! While it took me a couple of chapters to really get into it, once I did there was no laying the book down. I was able to \\"see\\" the powers of darkness that we, as Christians, fight with daily. Yes, it's a fiction novel, but it is based on Scripture. My whole prayer life changed, and has become more effective."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"If you loved This Present Darkness, you'll love this sequel, too. Sequels are hard to do well. If it's too much like the original, it seems like a tired rehashing -- been there, done that. If it's too different, those who enjoyed the first story may not have the same feeling about the follow-up. Peretti does a great job of avoiding both extremes. All the action and suspense of the first book are there. Some familiar characters return, but new characters and situations are introduced so the plot seems fresh without losing the \\"feel\\" of TPD. Both books are fantastic."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This was great to have both books in a beautiful hardcover. Piercing the Darkness was recommended to me years ago, when I was a young Christian. I started reading it but honestly it scared me and I wasn't ready for it. I am older now my children are older and I wanted to read books with a purpose. I came across these books again and was completely hooked by the first page.These books are very eye openning as they take a look as to what is going on in the unseen. I enjoyed both books very much, but I have to say The Present Darkness was my favorite. Both have great story lines, but I think Piercing the Darkness moves a little slower, but just as good. These books are scary, suspensful and a thrilling ride. A must read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I do not care what anyone says, this book is totally wonderful. If you want to understand our standing in the spiritual realm, this is a good book to read. The story line and ending are wonderful. It's amazing on how he weaved this together, how everything came together like a weave. This is definately an annointed book and Frank Peretti is an annointed author by far. The circumstances on how the book came out, proves that satan did not want this book printed. It may have came out back in '88 or '89 but I can assure you it will always be a classic. But also updated for there is no other book that shows so much spiritual understanding."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These two books are the most powerful and moving books I have ever read, and are by far the best out of all of his books. They give you a real sense of hope and a knowledge that God is there and he has a plan for each and every one of us. Frank Perreti has a remarkable ability to really write the spirit of God into his books by demonstrating the battles between good and evil. I wasn't very sure about my faith before I read these books. After having read them, I can honestly say that they helped to give me back my faith and put me back in the place where I belonged."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Both these books delve into the biblical realm of spiritual warfare. A group of Christians come together with help from above to get rid of the New Agers/Satanists in the community who are out to abolish Christianity...with demons controlling them. Very descriptive stories about the battles that we have here on Earth as Christians against the many foes Satan throws our way. Imagine seeing the world through spiritual eyes! These are the first books I've read by Frank Peretti and I plan on getting his later works."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This is THE book..or is it just a book? I am truly changed. If you are a Christian, you will LOVE this experience because it is more than a book. You can imagine that this could happen. Please read it then email me (tarheelfan_98@yahoo.com) and tell me how you like it. Piercing the Darkness is next. Let me know if you've read any of his other books. I think I'm going to read &quot;Prophet&quot; next. God bless."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Both of these books by Frank Peretti really made me look at the aspect of how the supernatural affects our lives, as well as the incredible power of prayer. I guarantee these books will make you stop and think."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book cpativated my every waking moment until I finished reading it. I want so much for this representation of the spriritual war to be true because I now feel empowered to do something about the persistent evils that pervail in our world. I learned how important our prayers are and what a difference they make every day. I learned that we must ask for God's help if we are to recieve the full benefit of his glory. I believe more than ever in the power of praying in groups and defeating Satan's plans that intend to only destroy through deception and manipulation. Anyone at any level will find this story incredibly interesting and action-packed through the vivid descriptions and suspense."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I disagree with a previous review, this is very different than the left behind series. It is thought-provoking. And WAS I CHEERING in the end!! WOW Great, I'm so glad I jumped in and can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I read both of the books a few years back and trully enjoyed them. I did buy them, read them, and then lent them out, never to return. I do want to read them again. I can't remember what the next book was he wrote, but, if it is as good as these two, then everyone who reads them will trully enjoy them."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"The first few chapters of the book are kind of slow, but once you get throught them you absolutely cannot put it down!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This is a truly inspired story; it gave me an amazing reminder of the real power of God, and the very real evil in this world. The book is great; the underlying message and truth- absolutely spectacular."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book was well writen, and looked into spirtual warfare in a very Biblical way. Five stars, keep it up Frank!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Frank Peretti gives some idea to the reader about what is really taking place in the spiritual realm. Whether or not we know it, there are things going on all around us - like in the book, that need to be &quot;battled&quot; with prayer. Frank Peretti's style of writing is very attention capturing, it's very hard to put one of his books down! Thanks Mr. Peretti!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These two books are the beginning of something wonderful for Frank Peretti and also for us as readers. He is a talented, insightful person who has been anointed by God to expose the works of darkness in a medium where hopefully those who have not been exposed to this drama will have their eyes opened. Spiritual warfare does exist, and the angels and demons are ever at war for the souls of mankind. Although written in a fictional format, it could happen just as easily."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"An intense, gripping and literal tale of the battle between good and evil. Vivid descriptions and action that makes it difficult to put this book down. The sequel book is even better! Fantastic twist at the end - don't peek or you'll spoil it for yourself. You will never look at your negative emotions and struggles the same way after reading these two books!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This was a VERY good book. I'm Christian, but I don't believe everything Peretti uses in this book. However, it was a very entertaining read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I absolutely loved reading this book. I was refreshing and imaginative. A great read."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Good writing by Peretti. I enjoyed it cover to cover!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SERIES. A GREAT PERSPECTIVE ON SPIRITUAL WARFARE AND HOW OUR PRAYERS REALLY EFFECT THINGS. THE STORY LINE, SETTING, AND CHARACTERS ARE INTRIGUING WELLROUNDED AND REALISTIC. I had never read any of his stuff before this, but plan to read ALL his books now. I highly recommend this if you'd like a good book that you'll stay up all night to finish."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I loved these books. I would like to see your other books put on audio tape. There are a lot of people who travel and can listen easier than reading. Have just bought the Visitation Looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I enjoyed the book but as a Christian who cares about thebible, I was shocked by the theology of this book. It has almostnothing to do with the bible, yet people seem to take it seriously. I strongly caution Christians (especially new ones) when reading this book. I also encourage non-Christians to lean what real theologians believe."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"What's the essential difference between a drama and a fantasy? Peretti buys (and sells) the central fantasy of &quot;Christian fiction&quot;: that good and evil are psychological accidents, predispositions which are not the result of complex struggles and ambiguities. He mythologizes evil as dark angels acting in antipathy towards morally uninteresting humans. The popular sentiment is that \\"that's what demons are like,\\" but this begs the question of what evil actually _is_. It doesn't seem to infect Peretti's characters, except as a kind of benign virus for which Christ is the cure. Real evil, obliquely referred to but never described in its murderous, lusty human detail, never shakes the reader's bones. As for the character's moral struggles, the author could hardly make them less complex if he gave them white and black hats. Peretti cannot handle evil as it really is: instead his mythologizing of evil misleads the reader into living out not a drama but a fantasy devoid of psychological and spiritual truth"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"It's a little too unrealistic for me. Satan and his demons were once angels in heaven. Why does the auther deplict them as dragons of folklore and hollywood monsters? The Bible says &quot;Satan comes disguised as a messenger of light&quot; and to &quot;test the spirits&quot; so deplicting demons as monsters turned my pages closed. This would make a good &quot;Hollywood Horror Film&quot;. If your into that stuff, enjoy this book."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Not the best Christian fiction I've read and at best it is quite paranoid beyond belief to hold up to any truth today. Also the theological references at best are quite skewed from the gospel's actual message and everyone should remind themselves that the novel is FICTION designed to feed into fundamentalist paranoia and apocalyptic frenzy.Do not lose sight of Christ's true message because of a fantasy story. True Christians will not even have to contend with these so called demons because true Christians will not allow them to attack!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Mr. Peretti does now how to excite, but not how to write. Iread his book Prophet, but the characters in that book were socliche... It was like reading some harlequin book. Besides, I don't think that the word theology is apropiately used in this genre. Books like this tend to be superficial and not profound, which theology should be."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Is this guy nuts? I didn't know that Christians believed in yellow-eyed, sulfur-spewing demons! And how in the world could he depict proponents of Universal Love to be the bad guys! This is the first book that I will throw away. I won't even donate it to a thrift shop lest some poor soul will waste money on it- even at 25 cents."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This was the 3rd copy of this book that I have bought. The first 2 I misplaced when I loaned them out to friends. This is a very thought provoking book. I gave me a very different reason for praying. It puts importance to praying. As I have already lost two copies by loaning, I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book literally changed my life, and two of the best selling Christian novels in history, now combined. The battle raging in the spiritual realm has changed my prayer life forever. With this Present Darkness, Peretti broke onto the scene by graphically tearing back the veil between the human and the spirit world. Descending upon the small town of Ashton, angels, demons, and strongmen engage in a vivid battle and we, the reader, see it all unfold. Before Frank Peretti I wasn't interested in \\"Christian fiction\\". I just didn't see the point. But, I love fiction and I love the Lord. It's wonderful to be able to read, enjoy what I'm reading and learn something all at the same time."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I've read all the darkness books. He is a very gifted man. He is funny. Loves to joke around. I'm just happy and bless that every week I'm sitting in chruch praising god with this man."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This series is as relevant today as when it was written, perhaps more so. I like how it has been combined into a single volume for easy gifting to friends who need to read this work. The book arrived in pristine condition and ready for wrapping. Thank you."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I haven't had time to finish reading this book but so far it has been good. It sure makes you think and be aware of what is happening around you that is invisible to the naked eye but not to the spiritual eyes."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This Present Darkness is a timeless work of art in that it peels back the veil of a world just as real as ours that many choose to ignore. This particular book is a double treat because the reader gets to continue walking the path of enlightenment in Piercing the Darkness without having to buy a separate book. All encompassing, the two-story work is a rare gem not to be overlooked."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These have been my favorite books for years. None others even come close. If you only read once a year, pick this."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I love these books! It's great having them in one edition, and hardback at that. This was a great purchase."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I am very pleased with both the book and the service I received.I recommend the seller & the service.Thanks"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"No complaints. Received in a timely manner and the book was in great condition."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I just finished both The Present Darkness and Piercing the Darkness. These were my first Peretti books and I truly enjoyed them. I decided to pick this book up when things in my life were not going so well and everything around me seened to be falling apart. What wonderful books. Some of the scences in these books reminded me of times when I felt the fear of evil as these characters did. Reading these reminded me of Gods love for me and no matter what he will always love me all I have to do is ask. This book took me some time to read, about a month, but it was a great journey. I would definitely recommend these books to Christians and non-Christians. These books have a thrill and a suspense that all can enjoy."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I realize it's fiction. But I think Peretti, through his writing, is giving us a great deal of insight into the spirit world. His angels. His demons. His humans!It's important to me that there's more to gain here than just a good read. If entertainment is all there is to it, there are thousands of well writen secular novels already. But Peretti's novel is edifying and affirming to me as a Christian, a Christian that believes there's more out there than just the sweet by-and-by.The Bible itself shows us that angels are among us. And Peretti shows us how and what they're doing."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Without question the best I've yet read from this author. I could not put down this down. I found myself reading into the wee hours of the morning. The end of each page is a cliff-hanger for the next. Brilliant work brilliantly done."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These books were a revelation at the time they were written. Many christians &quot;woke up&quot; to how serious this battle really is. Unfortunately, like everything else, the fire died, and christians became slothful, lazy, and lost the fire. We forgot that before these books were even wrote, the holy scriptures talked about the unseen war thousands of years ago. These books were a serious wake up call to a sleeping church. Peretti, was inspired I believe to write these books. He was anointed by the Holy Spirit to give us a shot in the arm. These books did just that, at the time. Now, at this present time, in this present darkness, we are faced with a horrifying tragedy at New York City. Sadly, it took that display of raw, satanic, destruction, to unite the White House, the people of America, and the churches. To me that is REALLY sad. God bless him for writing these books, thankyou Frank, there hasn't been books like those since."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These two books are amazing. I will never look at prayer in the same way! I would suggest these books to anyone. The stories are gripping and it is hard to put these books down."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This brilliant depiction of the unseen spiritual realm is incredibly intriguing. It is disturbingly realistic, and yet comforting at the same time. A definate page-turner all the way through. Unexpected twists and turns in the plot are stunning! A must read!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I was introduced to Frank Peretti in &quot;Piercing the Darkness&quot; and then to &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;. He has a way of showing the world in two ways. The spiritual fight we go thru and the worldly fight. He has opened my eyes to a lot of things: the way we are to fight and the importance of a prayer covering. Both are excellent books and I would recommend them to anyone. In fact I have bought more and given them away to friends."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"While I understand that, people believe and interpret the scriptures differently. My experiance is, this is exactly the spiritual battle, that we as believers are in. With extremely colorful and flowery descriptions, Peretti does some of the charecters a big favor. In reality they are no where near this good looking. For all those who want to say, that this is not based on good theology, the rest of us can only pray that you would truly have a spiritual awakening! If you can last past the fifth or sixth chapter. I promise you won't be able to put it down. It not only will change the way you pray, it will give you an awareness of a discernment you had all along, but maybe weren't aware of. Pray &quot;Lord let me see things as you see them.&quot; Peretti does back this up with solid scripture. And always remember who won!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I enjoyed both books. With the 2 being in one, sometimes the arms get quite a workout, if you read it for too long! Frank Peretti is right up there with Ted Dekker. I've heard Frank speak, and he is one of a kind. If you are looking for an author who writes about spiritual warfare, just head for Peretti, because he is the best in the business! He will make you think about eternity in a whole new perspective. Frank isn't a new author, and he won't go away. He will be known as an inspiration for generations.Join Tal and Guilo and other angels as they take on demons and the powers of darkness in the fight for souls! Frank Peretti digs deep into the soul. He also shows a very human side of life, teaching you and making it quite interesting and at times humorous. He has to be one of the biggest experts on spiritual warfare. As I said above, if you don't believe that, listen to him. The man does his homework. Now, if this isn't telling you what you need to know, you need to get one of his books. If he doesn't suit you, there's always Dr. Suess!He's one of the best, and he will always be one of the best. What's more, he has our Heavenly Father on his side. An annointed man with awesome stuff. All for the glory of God! Can't ask for too much more. Check it out!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I read a referral to these novels by a reviewer of one of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series books. It and other customer's reviews of these stories made them sound compelling, and they really were!Frank Peretti has written these &quot;end-times themed&quot; novels from a perspective quite different than the usual. He has chosen to focus on the unseen forces that surround people in these end-times, and how there is a battle being waged that is both the cause, and effect, of positive and negative influences and behavior in life during these times.If you're a Christian, these novels are going to change the way you think about your own life's trials and tribulations, and make you wonder about what's going on with other people too. I guarantee it's going to change the way you pray. If you're a non-Christian, you are going to be challenged to take on a different perspective of this world, and to think about the how and why of things that have happened in your own life.If you are tired of waiting around for the next installment in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, and want to read something else along that same theme that is truly thought provoking, I would recommend you read these novels."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This Present Darkness is one of those books you just can't put down. The writing is easy to read, the story is compelling, and it builds the drama and tension better than any movie to come along in a long time. The characters are believable, and Frank &quot;fleshes out&quot; the demons and angels so well you can picture them in your head."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These two books a compelling page-turners, but also teach the reader a lot about demonic warfare and how to fight in the Heavenly battle. I read them both in a matter of days."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"It is confusing at first, but I was quickly sucked into this tale of demons, angels and the power of prayer.

Peretti is one of the most gifted authors in modern Christian literature."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"In reference to the individuals who have written scathing remarks regarding the theology of these books, remember that these books are sold as fiction not as theological texts. Though I doubt a &quot;non-believer&quot; would take the events and descriptions of the spiritual world as fact, it would be wise for Mr. Peretti to write an introduction to these books to clarify its fictional nature to impressionable readers (some later printings may have this?). These can be inspiring books for those who have a firm understanding of scripture and can glean the truth from the fiction."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This book will give you a new insight into spiritual warfare, and will indeed change your views on prayer. Takes a while to get into, but just try and put it down in the last 200+ pages."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"When my aunt gave me this book several years ago, I put it in a drawer. It took me a long time to actually read it. Once I finally started, I could not put it down. IT was the most amazing book I have ever read. Everyone that I have given a copy of this book felt the same way. No one could ever put it down. If you only read one book this year... make it this one. And you will never see this world with the same eyes again. :)"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Frank Peretti has been blessed by God with the ability to open our eyes to the probabilities of the goings on around us. He compells you to take less and less as &quot;chance&quot;! I have read most of his books at least twice"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These are real pageturners! Peretti's descriptions of the demons and angels are so vivid, you can almost feel them in the room with you. Believers love these books because God's power is awesomely depicted. If you like a good thriller check these out. You might want to keep all the lights on while you're at it."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Fantasic books. The story is fictional or is it? The reader is kept in the story so much that you are looking behind trees for the demons that are there and depending on the angel warriors there to protect."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These books are a revelation of God, as many things mentioned in these books are very similar to things that happened to me when Jesus became my Lord. I sincerely believe that the Holy Spirit guided the author to write and show us the spiritual battle in the invisible world. When we open our spiritual eyes, we can see the great power of God and the angry of Satan against those who loves Jesus, with the whole heart."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"These books are a revelation of God, as many things mentioned in these books are very similar to things that happened to me when Jesus became my Lord.

The plot is ongoing and moving and leaves one finding it difficult to close upon reading. You will lose yourself in the lives of the characters. This Present Darkness and Piercing The Darkness have left an indelible mark on me as the Christian I am today and as the Christian I am growing up to be tomorrow."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This is a very good book that I find opens up a door to theology very wide. It shows new concepts of Spiritual Warfare that I never realized MAY BE TRUE. He has very good insight and I very highly recommend it. It is a book for a thrilling read that will be very hard to put down."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Peretti captures your imagination. Your not quite sure what's unfolding within your mind. Then it becomes crystal clear, and you can't get enough. I'm not a bible scholar, but the holy spirit is the power of God, not an individual. The only thing I fear from a movie version is Hollywood's liberal spin, and mocking attitude toward Christians."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I greatly enjoyed both books. While written as Christian fiction, they show the constant battle of good and evil that go on in this world on a daily basis. They also illistrate how we can easily and innocently become entangled in evil. The power of prayer is brilliantly illistrated. It really got me looking at my prayer life. While bringing out all of these points, these books also appeal to non Christians as well. I have lent my copies out to so many people, that I now need to purchase more.Shirley Moo"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I picked up this book when a friend of mine said that I might be pretty interested in it. So I bought this edition and I started to read it and it really is a great read. It may be a work of fiction but the fact of the prayers being able to move mountains or shift the tide in an unforseen battle between good in evil is interesting. It starts in the town of Aston and then the second book is a little bit more spread out in different towns and sort of has this grand battle which was very interesting when it had the religion part coming into it. The only real problem that I have with this comes with a little slant towards the Christian religion and does not shed a good light on Buddhism or Hinduism."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"A phenomenal read! While starting out poorly written, the book grows quite well into a gripping portrayal of the battle between good and evil. A rude awakening to the realities of angels and demons. The sequel was better, but almost impossible to understand without the first one. Read this, and then get &quot;Piercing the darkness&quot; for an even better read. Frank Peretti may not be the greatest author ever, but he's definetely one of them."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I purchased this book as &#34;new&#34;. The book that was shipped to me appeared to be used or, at least had been handled very rough. The cover was scratched, had a small tear, and had something dirty smeared on the front and on the spine. One corner of the book was bent as if it had been dropped. Since I was purchasing a new book, I returned it to Amazon without any problems.I owned these books before and loaned them to someone that didn't return them. I am a Peretti fan and especially liked these two books and wanted them in my library. That's why I was purchasing this combination book. I will buy them soon, but not from Amazon."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Of all of Frank Peretti's novels, these two remain my favorites. I purchased this book to replace the originals that I bought years ago. My wife and have read and re-read them, Frank has found the way to bridge the gap between Christian and non-Christian readers. The storyline is riveting and compelling. I can't tell you how many times I've lent these books to friends who had questions about nmy faith. The questions are answered in a powerful way. I can only say, \\"Thanks, Frank!!! Your unique storytelling is a true blessing!!!\\" I highly recommend these books. Very entertaining and enlightening."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I've read these book many years ago and always wanted to own them.

And I don't use that word unless I really mean it. They are extremely popular. After you read the first chapter you'll know why! If you're looking for an exciting Christian thriller, with suspense in every chapter and a radical perspective on spiritual warfare, LOOK NO FURTHER!!! You won't want to put it down, I promise! Angels are widely speculated about, with not many people having actually seen them, (or have they?) but these stories make you THINK. And believe. And have faith in the Lord, Whom the angels serve!And what adds to the appeal of this particular product is: It's a two-in-one deal. So you get the first one AND the sequel!

A whole new way to see conflict, and if you don't believe in spiritual things now..........you will."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I must be honest, I have not brought these books but have read some extracts. My main pleasure from these two stories have come in the listening to the abridge, audio versions. There, the trouble has been that, as always, they are never as good as the books. Lots of action and fighting to be found in these two volumes with the interactions of the human and spiritual realms never so complicated that you lose the plots. That is where I believe Frank has done a superb job. There are two sub-plots within both these stories (Individuals vs Authorities &amp; Angels vs Demons)blended together but never confusing you as they get thicker and more intense as they lead you towards a dramatic climax. Though there may be more in heaven and earth that can be dreamt of in Horatio's (or Frank's) philosiphy, these stories remind us that the prophet was right to say that &quot;There are more for us than against us!&quot; Oh how I wish I could see the Hosts of Heaven more often; and I wonder if 'Tal' would fancy a drink down the pub with me some time?"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"Peretti has done what few authors have proven capable- producing a Christian novel that is not sub-standard in the writting department. All too often, Christian novels place preaching above prose. I'm not putting down preaching, but if someone is trying to communicate something about God in a fictional book, then it's important the the quality of writing be up to the task. Most times, it is not. Peretti has not fallen into that trap. Both Darkness novels are every bit as good as the best fiction writers. They work first as good literature and second as good Christian novels. That's important, because if the novel is poorly written, then nobody is going to get to important messages contained therin. The only other Christian novel I've read that matches Pereti is We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell. It is perhaps the best written Christian novel I have ever read and I would strongly recomend it, as well as Peretti's books to any Christian who also happens to be a lover of great literature."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I realize it's fiction. But I think Peretti, through his writing, is giving us a great deal of insight into the spirit world. His angels. His demons. His humans!It's important to me that there's more to gain here than just a good read. If entertainment is all there is to it, there are thousands of well writen secular novels already. But Peretti's novel is edifying and affirming to me as a Christian, a Christian that believes there's more out there than just the sweet by-and-by.The Bible itself shows us that angels are among us. And Peretti shows us how and what they're doing."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and have since been passing it along to my now grown sons to read. It makes you think of the spritual world in a whole new light. It's great story telling and you don't have to be a christian to enjoy anything Peretti writes. I have read all of his fiction books, and look forward to more."},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"This is an awesome book.

Mr. Peretti does an great job at making his characters come to life. My only wish is that someone would make a movie out of it. Thank You!"},{"Title":"This Present Darkness/Piercing the Darkness: Piercing the Darkness","review":"For years students asked me what I think about Frank E. Peretti's popular novels, This Present Darkness (Wheaton: Crossway Books, c. 1986), and its sequel, Piercing the Darkness (Westchester, IL: Crossway Books, c. 1989), so I read them during the recent Christmas vacation. The title of the first books comes from Ephesians 6:12: \\"For we are not contending against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this present darkness . . .\\" (RSV). That of the second comes from John 1:5: \\"The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it\\" (RSV). Spiritual warfare, an enduring conflict between demonic and angelic beings which becomes localized in human beings and activities, is both books' central theme.This Present Darkness takes place in a small American town, Ashton, which is targeted for takeover by demonic powers. An evil multinational empire, Omni Corporation, has gained control of much of the town and is poised to purchase Whitworth College, its most significant institution. A fundamentalist preacher, Hank Busche, and a few praying folks, plus a courageous newspaper editor, Marshall Hogan (who finds Christ as his personal Savior toward the end) thwart the plot--with the direct and dramatic assistance of multiplied scores of angelic warriors under the skilled military direction of Tal. The second work, Piercing the Darkness, shares with the first a few common characters (namely Marshall Hogan) and many characteristics: a small town, Bacon's Corner; a corrupt policeman; a fundamentalist church (whose school is at the center of the plot; a college, Bentwood, which allows demonic influences to flourish; and a central figure, Sally Roe, who through assorted adventures finally finds the Lord. It has some new wrinkles as well: a witches' coven, satanic rituals, and a generally hostile judicial system.I'll not deny you the pleasure of enjoying the books' suspense and adventure, both of which keep the pages turning, by divulging further details, but I think I've indicated the general drift of the two stories. So let me evaluate them. First some positive notes. The books read well. Peretti knows how to tell a good story, full of suspense and action. Though not necessarily the mark of great literature, I applaud those books which I'm compelled to finish quickly just because I've been drawn into the plot and want to follow its unfolding--and I found myself anxious to resume reading these books until I'd finished them. While Peretti's novels will never be critically acclaimed for their literary artistry, they are, in my opinion, well-crafted mystery stories which are clearly superior to much \\"Christian\\" fiction, which too often turns to preaching rather than engaging the imagination.Secondly, I generally like the portraits Peretti presents of contemporary believers. They're up-front about their faith, yet they're not locked into some of the petty legalisms which sometimes serve as stereotypes of true believers. They're not super-saints, but they're admirable, credible folks. While I found the books' plots more engaging than the characters, which lack the psychological or spiritual depth a Dostoevsky would provide, the main characters are credible and easily elicit the reader's affection and concern.Thirdly, I applaud Peretti's effort to take seriously the reality of spiritual warfare, clearly a biblical teaching--and, incidentally, one central to the monastic movement of the Early Church, where monks like St Anthony went to the desert to do battle with the forces of evil. Though few writers can bring it off as did Milton in Paradise Lost or C.S. Lewis in The Screwtape Letters, the presence and power of angels and demons deserve our attention.On these three counts I applaud Peretti's novels. They're good fiction--readable, instructive, far better evening fare than most TV programs, even the \\"Christian\\" variety. Reasonably mature, theologically balanced believers, will find them enjoyable. Yet I can't fully endorse the books. For one thing, they include a sustained (if often muted) judgmentalism, a polemical predisposition which has marred so many of the fundamentalist-modernist battles which have raged within American Protestantism for the past century. Peretti's \\"true believers\\" in This Present Darkness seem localized in the Ashton Community Church; those in Piercing the Darkness in the Good Shepherd Church. Both are independent, fundamentalist, Bible churches. Those attending the Ashton United Christian Church, a clearly \\"liberal\\" denominational congregation, whose pastor is part of Omni Corporation's machinations, appear less than bona fide believers. Those who truly know God, it seems, are magnetically drawn to the \\"remnant\\" joined with Pastor Hank Busche and thereby aligned with the angels. Though it's not a major theme, it's a judgmental message clearly articulated: only those who share Peretti's worldview (fundamentalistic; separatistic) deserve to be labeled \\"Christian.\\" This message doesn't appear in Piercing the Darkness, however, since no churches other than The Good Shepherd Community Church play any role in the action.Both books, however, clearly portray colleges and universities as fertile fields, virtual hothouses, for demonic activities. They both feature professors who are deeply involved in New Age/occult activities and who adversely influence some of the protagonists. To a degree, I share Peretti's concern here, for institutions of higher learning, encouraging as they do an elitism which easily degenerates into intellectual pride, certainly cultivate the \\"secular humanism\\" and \\"ethical relativism\\" which tend to subvert Christian doctrines and standards. Yet I doubt, all things considered, that educational institutions are any more demonic than corporate board rooms or athletic locker rooms . . . or local church board meetings, for that matter! Still more, one could gather from Peretti that anyone interested in non-Christian religions or concerned with ecological ethics is automatically hand-in-glove with demonic powers. I'll grant that some occult activities do seem rooted in Oriental religions; some environmentalists have reverted to a pagan reverence for Mother Earth. But consistently linking environmental sensitivity with demonic possession not only strains this reader's patience but runs counter one of the most basic Christian beliefs: God made and sustains the world He called \\"good.\\"Beyond my discontent with Peretti's judgmentalism, the second area which concerns me is doctrinal. I'm no authority on \\"demonology\\" (a subject discussed in a host of new books, such as Peter Wagner's Engaging the Enemy: How to Fight and Defeat Territorial Spirits, which apparently argues specific demons have been assigned specific geographical sites, and Wrestling with Dark Angels). But I recently read George Mallone's Arming for Spiritual Warfare (IVP, 1991), and reacted somewhat the same I did to Peretti.Despite my lack of either personal experience with or in-depth reading about the subject, Peretti's lengthy passages describing the various spirit beings and their constant combat, along with a clear portrayal of demonic possession and angelic assistance, leaves me wondering where in Scripture or Church tradition Peretti finds his ideas. To assert such human maladies as \\"Despair,\\" \\"Fear,\\" \\"Gossip, \\"Adultery,\\" or \\"Deception\\" are in fact demons must be challenged. Without question we're tempted to do evil things. There's a demonic dimension to all temptation and sin. But to explicitly equate human weaknesses and sins with specific demons cannot, in my opinion, be allowed. There's a certain Manichaeism, a certain Gnosticism, a certain metaphysical dualism, which seeps into such presentations. Down through the centuries orthodox Christians have had to continually struggle to maintain the central affirmations of the Faith: God is good; creation is good; the Incarnation really shows that God entered into this very physical world and assumed a very real human nature.The very notion that a demon, or demons, can fully enter into and possess a person (as, for example, \\"Stongman\\" possesses the main villain, Kaseph, in This Present Darkness, or Amethyst possesses Amber in Piercing the Darkness) runs counter to much traditional theology. For as one of the great spiritual masters, Francisco de Osuna, insists, \\"in the spiritual nothing except God can penetrate and infuse the essence of something else. Like a light the pierces glass or very clear water, God penetrates and infuses the essence of the soul, or an angel, in such a way that even the soul thus affected does not know how this is accomplished, only that it is done\\" (The Third Spiritual Alphabet, p. 185). If only God can spiritually indwell the essence of a person, no demon, not even Satan himself, can fully possess a human being. Evil beings may tempt, or influence, but since they are not God they cannot rival his power. Now Osuna himself asserts: \\"If you wish to be spiritual you must regard yourself as a spiritual warrior,\\" (ibid., 202), so he knows the reality of spiritual warfare. He understands that the demonic powers attack us from without, not by entering into our very being. Still more, \\"As Saint Bernard says, our enemy is weak and can vanquish only the people who wish defeat\\" (ibid., 203).In defense of Peretti, Jesus did cast out a multitude of demons from the demoniac on the shores of Lake Galilee. But that seems to me to be an exception, not the rule, both in Jesus' ministry and in the record of the Early Church. Just as some Christians err by disbelieving or disregarding Satan and his subordinates, so too others err in believing too much, or too readily, in them. Peretti's constant references to spirit beings, whose actions regularly impact the very physical world we humans indwell, claim too much, far too much. In time, quite frankly, I just skimmed through the sections detailing the discussions and activities of the two contending spiritual \\"armies.\\" To have written as subtly about demonic and angelic activities as they seem to actually be would have made the \\"supernatural\\" sections of the book much less dramatically evident--and their treatment more believable.Rightly read, by folks who allow Peretti latitude to range far afield in his imagination, the \\"spiritual warfare\\" passages may be tolerable, if less than artistically satisfying. But some readers--young readers especially--may, in fact, take Peretti as literally as they take Scripture. Thus they're tempted to see devils in every human failing, demonic possession in every chemical or emotional addiction, and God somehow impotent (except insofar as his saints pray and thus empower angelic beings to slaughter their adversaries). Still more: whereas C.S. Lewis' demons, either invisible or appearing as well-manicured stock-broker types, prove credible, Peretti's, sometimes described as reptiles, insects, or other nefarious animals, sometimes smelling up the place they occupy, removes them to the land of unreality (for this reader, at least).Those who need to consider the reality of angels and demons, unfortunately, will rarely read this book. Many who do, equally unfortunately, already pin demonic labels on diseases and discouragements, on assorted human failures, and short change both our ability to freely function and God's prevenient grace, everywhere efficacious in restraining evil and illuminating good.# # #"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"I love this book and have purchased several copies over the years to give away.

She is a true Christian and I love her encouragement. She helps resolve issues of everyday life and helps to teach me solutions through God's Word."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"Preachers and Bible scholars state that all of mankinds' problems have an answer within the pages of the Bible. Unfortunately, it is a book composed of 66 individual books, and rarely does one know right where to look for advice on a certain problem or topic.Joyce Meyer's book, \\"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word\\" addresses the specifics of where to find answers to topical concerns. Got a problem with worry, or lack of faith? Meyers lists appropriate Bible verses and promises that speak to these concerns. Meyers lists many different problems involving life, faith, doubt, fear, and then gives the Bible verse that speaks to these issues.Meyers emphasizes the power of the spoken word, believing that when one speaks the appropriate verses out loud, they help to create the conditions and attitudes you speak. Essentially, she believes they have more power spoken out loud. I don't necessarily buy into the spoken word concept; rather, I have used these topical studies of verses to immerse my mind in God's word so as to meditate and allow the concepts sink in.The key to using a book like this is actually believing that the verses listed have the power to change one's attitude and situation. Since the verses come from God's inspired word, one must have a solid faith in God for these verses to have any lasting effect on one's mind. You can say a verse out loud a dozen times, but the words are empty if the speaker does not have faith in the words. Conversely, if one is worried or afraid, and Christ states in his word: \\"Don't be afraid, it is I, I am with you always\\", the person who believes in the risen Lord can use this verse to meditate on when he is anxious or afraid, and draw confidence from it. One's faith in the verse is only as strong as one's faith in the person who said the verse. In order for the mind to be changed, the idea or concept needs to have validity behind it to be accepted and acted upon. This book benefitted me, for I believe in the words and promises of Christ, so the words have power to change false beliefs and attitudes in my mind.Even so, speaking or memorizing these verses is a discipline, and not a one time through and you're done concept. The topical verses cited here are to be meditated on daily until they become part of one's thought process. Constant repetition, plus faith in the words and person of Christ is the formula for success in adapting the very mind of Christ.Certainly recommended for the person of faith who needs help or reassurance in several areas. On the contrary, this book perhaps holds no benefit for those who doubt the living existance of Christ, or doubt the words themselves.Recommended for those who believe in the risen Lord and believe in his love and power.konedog"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"This little book is a handy reference; I keep it where I study and have given away several; it's a great gift for someone who is needing to find particular scripture and isn't sure where to look~or even has a need but doesn't know what scripture would apply~or just to thumb through for inspiration; well worth it's price!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"This Book is a powerful book and very effective to use when praying.

It will give you encouragement through every situation you may face. Joyce briefly explains in the first few pages what the secret power of speaking God's word is all about. We learn that it is the spoken word of God that has the power to defeat the enemy. She talks about spiritual discipline, the pattern, holding fast to our confessions, & that God's word does not return to him void. Then she shows you how to get the most out of the book.The rest of the book is divided up into sections, alphabetically starting with anger & ending with worship. For example; If I am feeling discouraged I can look up scriptures that will encourage me. She takes several bible verses & turns the verses around so that they apply to you. For example Proverbs 13:12 says; Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when the desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. She personalizes it by putting you in the situation and saying; Hope deferred makes my heart sick, but when my desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life.I've given this book as a gift and I've heard many say it's like a certain credit card, they won't leave home without it!

The purpose was to make certain scripture dealing with certain situations easily accessible to the believer and this book does just that. When I am going through I whip out this book and look up the situation I am facing or the characteristic that I want to develop in my life at that time and just read the scriptures to myself or outloud. When you are going through, your mind is frazzled sometimes and you really aren't in the mindset to flip back and forth through the bible or concordance saying, \\"Now where is that scripture on faith again??\\" Joyce has categorized it for you. The word of God says that death and life are in the power of the tongue...we must speak life into our destinies or death into the attacks of the enemy. This book is so awesome that I've been buying it and giving it away and that is why I am on Amazon now so that I can buy more.

Book arrived in great condition and on time! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look up a scripture according to whatever is going on in life at that particular time. A great little book to carry in your purse. If you get angry, go to anger in the table of contents, and claim a scripture about anger which will get your mind off the problem and back on The Word of God. A great book to use after reading Battlefield of The Mind by the same author."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"The awesome power of God in your everyday trials and joys just by saying His Word out loud!If you need power to overcome, please get this little book and start speaking it out right away!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"I've used this book over and over again, have shared it with others, and have bought several for friends and acquaintances because they tried to take mine.

I recently went through something very difficult and my Christian family told me to speak the Word over it. I didn't understand until now. When we speak the Word over our situation we not only speak God's will and Power because Jesus is the Word. We also release angels because when angels hear His Word given voice, they respond! (Psalm 103:20, Daniel 10:12, Psalm 91:10) God's Word doesn't come back void. Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof. (Proverbs 18:21).Joyce has put this book together nicely. It is divided into sections that most people will need to speak the Word over like grief, fear, hearing God's voice, worry, etc. She starts the book with a little introduction as to why we need the scriptures and why we need to speak them out of our mouths.It is nice to have a little book I can pick up that has a scripture for almost every circumstance I come across in life. I just have to memorize them now. :)"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"This little book is organized & packed with scriptures that are easy to read and utter out loud to renew our minds and keep us focused.

In fact, I have purchased numerous copies, because I end up giving them to someone who needs it. You just look up whatever may be oppressing you, and Joyce gives you scriptures - God's promises - that can help you through anything, i.e. depression, anxiety, fear, etc. My friends and I call it the little purple book. It's AWESOME! You will not regret buying it."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"As believers, we overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, and the Word of our confession. Let the Word of God dwell in you richly by speaking it out of your mouth!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"This book is excellent. It has many Bible scriptures on several subjects, any of which you may be dealing with at a particular time. Often, the scriptures are written in the first person so that that you can personalize them and make them daily confessions. For those of us that believe that speaking God's word is necessary, and is the essence of prayer, this book gives us quick access to spiritual nuggets in every imaginable area. It is a \\"God send,\\" literally."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"As always Joyce Meyer brings us a good word in due season that encourages you in the study and carrying out of Gods' Word"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"Speaking God's words out loud has been the most powerful thing I have ever done for my family and for myself.

I pull out my book find the appropriate scriptures, say them out load (that's the key) and immediately feel the peace of God."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"When I first received this book, I was a little disappointed because it wasn't what I expected. It has turned out to be even better than I expected. This book has become my pocket reference for POWERFUL scriptures. I carried it one day to a business seminar, during one of the breaks my co-worker learned some disappointing news. I could see her spirit was down and she needed some encouragement. I started to quote some of the powerful scriptures on faith from the book. She asked to see the book, she read over the scriptures and began meditating on them. Her spirit quickly became uplifted.The size of the book is perfect, you can discretly pull it out and look up a scripture for whatever you may be dealing with at the time. There are scriptures on, insecurity, patience, favor, wisdom, courage, and depression to name a few."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"This is a wonderful little book my husband and I are using to help encourage us in our walk with God. As we battle spiritually the enemy, this book helps give us practical verses to cling to from the Bible to help in our feelings so we can claim and SPEAK the Word of God outloud.I like in the beginning of her book where she says the Bible is a double edged sword: one edge cuts the enemy and the other cuts open the blessings of heaven. What a neat illustration.I'm finding in my daily walk those verses very helpful for the often tough situations I am in. It helps me in my faith. God bless Mrs. Meyer."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"Joyce Meyers has continued to show how much she truly is a child of the King by the fruit she continues to bear.This book was a page turner for me.I keep it with me and I also believe as Joyce does that we must confess these scriptures outloud instead of confessing what our circumstances are.I did as Joyce stated in the book and I compiled a confessions list.My life has not been the same since my discovery of such awesome truth.Joyce's continued obedience to do the things of God is such a blessing and inspiration to the body of Christ.If more people would take the truths in this book and apply them to their lives we would have so much more Victory in our lives.It is time for the body of Christ to get in agreement with God's word(not the world)As Joyce states in her book to confess them daily over our circumstances.We must be doers of the word not merely hearers only.(Romans 12:2).All I can say is....Devil look out!!!!!! Joyce is at it again.Thanks Joyce!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"I am a Christian and have been most of my life. I have read the Bible off and on but ever since I have picked up this book I have been encouraged to pick up the Bible much more often!

It's a great springboard to start reading the Bible if you've not seen changes before. I more than highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"Want to change your life? For the better? The purple book is small enough to take with you.

In understanding how much power God's Word possesses and also how much power we have in speaking His Word out loud, we become grounded and centered in the promises of the Lord. This book also helps to understand our role in our relationship with Him; read His Word, meditate on His Word, believe His Word, speak His Word, Obey His Word."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"This is not a read from front to back book. It is a wonderful reference that you can use to look up problems that you may be having and access God's Word about what he has proclaimed regarding the problem. Then you use those scriptures in prayer over the problems. They are powerful tools as well as healing and peace giving words from God. This is a MUST have book especially for people with high stress and multiple problems. It is also a MUST have for those who are helping people to understand God's heart. I have bought 7 already and can't seem to keep one full time for myself. Everyone I have given them to raved about them finding out keys of God's heart that they never knew or understanded before."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"Awesome little book that fits in purse.

It's divided into sections like anger, anxiety,control, courage, etc. Each section gives specific Bible verses that are applicable to the situation. You'll find that when you read these verses out loud, you become much more positive as you focus on God and not your situation. I reread parts of this book over and over, and find it so very helpful. I've given it as gifts to many others because I like it so much."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word by Joyce Meyer is a wonderful help for dealing with life from God's prospective. So many times we become negative when faced with problems. This book gives us the assurance that through the power of Scripture we can bring positive results out of negative. Each subject outlined in the book has Scripture references given to speak to the issue at hand. Jesus addressed each lie Satan tempted Him with by quoting Scripture. This book is a powerful tool in the hands of a believer!"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"I think this is a really good book for those who don't necessary have alot of time to sit down and read the word. You can pick one scripture and focus on it all day. It's really compact so you can put it in your pocketbook or bookbag or whatever and read it on the train or bus on your way to work. The only thing I don't like about this book is, she uses more than one type of Bible. I think she needs to stick to the (King James Version), I know it might be difficult for some people to understand, but it's the version that has not been changed."},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"Speaking God's Word is powerful and the work has already been done for you in this book.Just speak or read it out loud and walk in your God given authority"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"there are many topics in this resource that will have a impact on your life as it has mine.you will find yourself being renewed because of this resource"},{"Title":"The Secret Power of Speaking God's Word","review":"An easy and powerful way of learning to speak God's Word.

I really enjoys this book and have given it as gifts."},{"Title":"Your New Baby (Healthcare S.)","review":"I got this book from the library and found it to be so helpful that I decided to buy a copy of my own. The instructions are clear and very simple, and also the book shows you what to do using pictures. It goes into how to breast and/or bottle feed without the huge lectures and guilt trips for mothers who decide to bottle feed. It doesn't include every aspect of child care but it's gives the new mom a very good start. It also helps that the book is short and very inexpensive. Makes a great shower gift, especially for the giver who is short on cash."},{"Title":"Your New Baby (Healthcare S.)","review":"I was surprised to find no reviews of this book. After the birth of our first child, we received this as a gift and although this reference was a small paperback, it was so full of information I referred to it frequently. The photographs are terrific and this book is an excellent primer for any new parent who wants more information on how to manage the newborn phase of life. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Last Barrier: A Universal Search for Self Discovery","review":"After reading so many books about spirituality and the quest for 'self discovery', this book shone out from amongst them and dazzled me with it's brilliance. Although it approaches the divine from the Middle Eastern tradition of Islam, it is not dogmatic and rather stresses the truths within all religions (which is the Sufi way, being the path along which the author travels).It is an account of a journey, an adventure, right into the heart of 'God' - in whatever way you choose to understand that term. It has been a true inspiration to me, and I count myself blessed at having had the chance to have read it."},{"Title":"The Last Barrier: A Universal Search for Self Discovery","review":"I was very excited to find a book that is so simple and so deep. I am interested in the Sufis and especially in Rummy's teaching and this book teaches me a lot about the way to enlightenment. Each chapter starts with notes from Sufi teachers that will stay in your mind for a long time. I was very identified with the struggle of Reshad to leave all he knows behind and start the real work. A book that will make you laugh, cry and pray at the same time."},{"Title":"The Last Barrier: A Universal Search for Self Discovery","review":"This book is great! I read it over a year ago and much of the imagery is still right here with me, partly due to Feild's descriptive prose, but partly due to his strong beautiful message and captivating story. The spiritual truths revealed in this novel of a man's spiritual search in the land of the Sufis can be an inspiration to the seeker of today, in whatever culture he or she happens to be. Great reading!"},{"Title":"The Last Barrier: A Universal Search for Self Discovery","review":"I found this book fascinating, and read it three times before feeling like I really \\"got it\\" --- it is a simple narrative with deep, multiple levels of meaning. Although the word is never used, this book is a witness to the validity of gnosticism, the idea that it is possible for a human to directly experience God, or Allah, and the truth of Divine Love --- and that the path to such experience does not necessarily lead through a particular religion. The story demonstrates skillfully the relationship of \\"faith\\" and \\"trust\\" and \\"knowing\\" --- that ultimately each is a level of aligning more and more closely with the Divine."},{"Title":"The Last Barrier: A Universal Search for Self Discovery","review":"If you like spirit books and would like to discover your self and the Sufism world, read this book.This book will put its footprints on your soul for ever after.Where ever you are and what ever you do, you'll feel a strong power by your side which keeps you warm, gives you hope and Strength to continue your life and make the right decisions."},{"Title":"The Last Barrier: A Universal Search for Self Discovery","review":"I enjoyed this read. It stayed with me for a time and kept working me, in a thoughtful and transformative way."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"This is a somewhat tepid book by this award winning author. Perhaps because her other novels are so terrific, this one pales in comparison. While well written, it moves along at a ponderous pace, a lull before the storm that never quite arrives.The author weaves two stories in one. One is about a turn of the century actress, Celia Sands, who mysteriously disappeared, during a torrid affair with her wealthy, married Italian lover, who wrote a play for her. She never had an opportunity to perform the leading role in her lover's masterpiece, however, due to her untimely disappearance. The main story line is about a present day actress of the same name, though no relation, who is called upon to play the role the first Celia Sands was unable to play.For this role, Ms. Sands is brought to a villa in Italy, which was once the home of the playwright and now belongs to his grandson, Alex. While there, Celia realizes that there are some strange goings on, but does not know why. All soon becomes clear, though it takes many pages for everything to fall into place. There is really nothing too mysterious in this mildly suspenseful novel.Those who have read the author's other novels may be mildly disappointed. Newcomers to this author may enjoy it more. Nonetheless, it is still a well written, though somewhat tepid and belabored, novel."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"If you like Mary Stewart, and you have been disappointed by her last few books, then SEASON OF STORMS by Susanna Kearsley should be a delight. It sends you back to the early Stewart works of THIS ROUGH MAGIC and THE MOON SPINNERS. The reserved relationship between Alex and Celia, and the limited physicality of it, limited to polite kisses, were so much like Stewart, I was tempted to check the author's bio again. Even the subtle mystery, based on theft and smuggling, was signiture Stewart. It was a delicious trip into one of my favorite authors, and recalled my first romances. This is a must have."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I've read several of Kearsley's books and this one is now my favorite, even though I love the other ones too. Kearsley did an excellent job of weaving past and present(both were very closely paralleled). The setting and descriptions made me wish that I could go to Italy. In addition, all of the main characters and their relationships with each another were well developed, so much that I felt like I knew them personally. This book was suspenseful and kept me turning the pages. I spent all of my spare time reading this book until I was finished with it. Kearsley also added some supernatural elements to this novel, which were a nice touch. The only drawback was that the ending was somewhat predictable; however, this was minor compared to all of the good points of this book. Overall, it was very well written. Susanna Kearsley is one of the best authors of the romantic suspense genre!"},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"As with all of Kearsley's books, each one has a different theme and something for everyone. Mystery, exotic locations, romance and always a strong female protagonist. She often tosses in a little fantasy (ghosts, ESP, etc.). As with every Kearsley book, I read from cover to cover in a few sittings...just can't put them down. This book set in Italy revolves around an unsolved mystery three generations old about the disappearance of the actress/mistress (Celia) of the builder of the estate, Galeazzo D'Ascanio . Currently under restoration, the \\"villa\\" becomes the location for staging a play written expressly for Celia. It is also the swan song for London Director, Rupert, who will use it to showcase his \\"ward\\", also named Celia. Lots of twists and turns before it ends. MaryAnn"},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I really love reading her books but I just finished reading Season of Storms last evening and I felt that the book seemed to drag all the way through and she was not really enthusiastic about writing this book except to add pages instead of plot. Not enough depth to it unlike her other books!"},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"If you like Susanna Kearsley, then read this book. She paints such wonderful pictures and brings every character off the page with baited breath. It amazes me how much she shows without actually showing the reader. She does dive a bit too much into the scenery in this book, but her location is rich and lush.Kearsley's approach to the past is completely different from what I expected since I'd read so many of her other books, but it still helps explain the connection to all of the secrets possessed by the family.Enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"After just finishing Season of Storms I'm surprised by some of the less than glorious reviews this book has received. I almost didn't read it for this reason, but I'm so glad I did, having read all of Kearsley's other books in the past few months since I first discovered her in The Winter Sea. I absolutely loved the gothic suspense of this book with its hints of ghosts, and 500 pages flew by in little more than a day. That being said, Season of Storms is a close second to my favorite Susanna Kearsley book, The Shadowy Horses. If you like one, you simply have to read the other."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"This was very readable. For most that sounds like a C grade, but since I have not been able to read much of anything recently that is a very good thing. The language flows and the characters are rounded, they each have a personality and a true character, ie the author shows us who they are and stays with it.The only thing I had against this book is that the description gave me the impression that this would be a historical, perhaps 50s or 60s but not modern day. This book does take place in the modern era.Finally, regarding the love story. It is hte perfect gothic pace. Little interactions set them up, and you really don't know right away where if anywhere it's going."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I didn't think I'd ever meet a Kearsley book that I didn't much like, but sadly, \\"Season of Storms\\" was it. Don't get me wrong, it was well written like all Kearsley books, and highly evocative of Mary Stewart with lovely place descriptions. The characters were ok, and the ending had a twist that I wasn't expecting, which was nice.But I wasn't very interested in the plot involving a young stage actress reprising the main lead in a play written for another young stage actress (with the exact same name) over 70 years earlier, and who had mysteriously disappeared. Acting, plays and theater productions aren't very interesting to me, so it fell flat. In addition, Kearsley's wonderful use of supernatural elements to advance the story was sadly lacking in Season of Storms. I kept waiting for them to play a wider role then they ended up doing, as the attempt was sporatic and dull and never developed into anything significant. Kearsley should have just left them out completely.Not Kearsley's best to date (read \\"Mariana\\" for that), but certainly not awful - just weak."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I read this book while I had a bad cold and needed a good, comforting read to carry me over. Season of Storms was just the kind of book that got me through that. The historical element of this book is not as strong as in, say Mariana or Sophia's Secret, and the \\"mystery\\" that takes place in the past is a little predictable, but the modern-day story more than made up for that. There's a mystery and some ghosts in the modern-day story, and I really enjoyed the suspense and the hint of something supernatural that seems to haunt the second Celia. The characters of this book are also well-formed and fully realized, although the second Celia seemed a lot older than her twenty-two years sometimes.I was also fully able to appreciate the setting of this novel, too--I went to Italy in 2004, and one of the places I visited was Lake Garda and the town of Sirmione. Both are just as beautiful in real life as they're described in this novel."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"Although I am a big fan of Ms. Kearsley and her books, this one just didn't grab me the way the others have. I plowed through it anyway, simply because I wanted to give the book a chance. When I had finally finished it, I was happy because the chore was done! Kearsley's other books are much better, especially her first, &quot;Marianna&quot;."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I stumbled onto this book by accident, and I'm glad. This is my first SK book. I took to it right away, but my sister did not. While it was a little different from most action/romances I've read, I fell in love with it so quickly! Alex was one of the best characters ever! Wow! What a great job SK did making this guy irrisistable. Celia was adorable, too.Part of what sets this book apart from others is that when we meet a character, we're never 100% sure what they're about, who they are, what they stand for.Celia's friends were absolutely terrific.This wonderful book proves that you don't have to have graphic love scenes to imagine Alex and Celia falling in love. They were true soulmates."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"the latest novel from susanna kearsley is just wonderful. i have read everything that she has written , and i found the narration to be tight, smooth and extremely enjoyable. her mix of the paranormal, mystery, romance and suspense in other hands might come across as &quot;cheesy&quot;, but ms. kearsley deftly weaves a spell that enchanted me from beginning to end. it is easy to see the amount of research she does for a novel, and the end result is a story that will make you stay up until all hours finishing it, as i did last night!"},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"The premise of the novel is this: almost a century ago, the aging poet Galeazzo D'Ascanio penned The Price, a supernatural tragedy, for his muse and mistress, Celia Sands. But the beautiful, youthful Celia who held the lead role disappeared on the night before the premier of the play. Now, Alessandro D'Ascanio intends to restage his grandfather's play: he will build a new outdoors theatre on his lavish, Italian estate, and gather together an ecclectic but outstanding group of theatre people to realize his dream. But for the lead role, he will choose an untried and obscure young actress because of her name, Celia Sands.Canadian author Susanna Kearsley doesn't write as fast as some of the other novelists, but her novels-when they finally get out-are very fine creations. The quality of the writing tends to slowly creep upon you; soon enough, a particularly poignant scene will wring your heart, a ghostly one, create a hollow feeling in your stomach. I did enjoyed the theatrical setting, the intelligent heroine, and I was mesmerized by the rarified italicized chapters which told the true story of the first D'Ascanio and his Celia. In retrospect, being freed from Kearsley's mesmerizing prose, I can see some plotholes, a few non sequitors, and the slightly rushed ending. Still, Season of Storms was eminently readable.My favourites by her now stand thusly: Marianna (her first novel and still her best, IMO), The Shadowy Horses, Season of Storms, The Splendor Falls, and Named of the Dragon."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"pages and pages that hint of a depth that is never realized. one of those plow-thru novels that concludes suddenly in a two-page rush,a predictable two-page rush."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"In 1920's Italy, Galeazzo D'Ascanio was unable to see the performance of his wonderful play, Il Prezzo. Celia Sands, his beautiful English mistress and star of the play, vanished without a trace the night before the opening performance.Now, some eighty years later, Alessandro 'Alex' D'Ascanio, grandson of Galeazzo, has contacted Celia Sands, a struggling young English actress, asking that she perform the lead in Il Prezzo, a never performed play. The Forlani Trust is restoring Il Piacere, Galeazzo's magnificent villa on Lake Garda, and the play will be performed at an outdoor theater there.Celia isn't certain that she should take this role, since it appears that she is desired merely because she possesses the same name as the original Celia. But her mentor, pseudo-guardian and director Rupert does his best to quietly persuade Celia to take this part. And Celia ventures off to Italy and the disquiet of Il Piacere. The maid thinks that Celia's room has ghosts of its own even as Celia seems drawn to Alex whose comings and goings lend an air of mystery to the place. Add to the mix Daniela Forlani, whose possessiveness of Alex alludes to Francesca, Galeazzo's wife, who was jealous of his relationship with Celia.Written in the first person, SEASON OF STORMS is a top-notch suspenseful novel that evolves into a truly riveting read. The mystery is not in the form of cliffhangers but a more slow-paced discovery of clues that will fall into place like the pieces of a puzzle. Rich with evocatively descriptive language, SEASON OF STORMS will transport you to another place, where murder and ghosts are a distinct probability."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"In 1921 Italy, playwright Galeazzo D'Ascanio writes what turns out to be his last play. Since his beloved mistress Celia Sands provides him with the needed inspiration, he bestows on her the honor of starring on opening night in the theater on his estate Il Piacere. However, Celia vanishes on the eve of her opportunity to attain stardom. The show never went on and whether he lost his inspiration or his soul that night, Galeazzo never wrote another playGaleazzo's grandson decides to direct that play at the same theater that it was to first debut. He selects English actress Celia Sands, no relationship, because of her name. When she arrives at Il Piacere the modern day Celia feels an immediate affinity to her namesake especially at night. Unable to let the past stay buried, she obsessively begins to investigate what happened on that fatal night one day before this play was to first be performed.Known for her background descriptions that feel like panoramic murals that enhance her starring charcaters, Susanna Kearsley paints a multi-layered vista. The Poe-like past counterbalances with the vivid energy of the present so that the reader is hooked in such a way that they feel they are on the grounds of the Italian estate in the now and in 1921. The modern day Sara is quite a card, as she knows that it is better to leave the past alone but cannot do it. Her compulsion turns SEASON OF STORMS into a somber Gothic like novel that verifies why Susanna Kearsley is an award-winning author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"Kearsley's uncanny technique of molding coincidences of the past with happenstances of the present is explored again with great success in her latest offering &quot;Season of Storms&quot;. Here fledgling actress, Celia Sands bears the same name as the infamous lover of famous Italian lake district playwright Galeazzo D'Ascanio of the early 1900s. . . and now seemingly serendipitiously she is chosen by the deliciously understated Alessandro D'Ascanio, grandson of the famous playwright, to actually perform the lead in a recently discovered but unknown and unperformed masterpiece written by his grandfather especially for that first Celia. Upon arriving at Il Piacere in Italy, our heroine is initially fraught with many emotions, many of which stem from her fear of failure in the distinguished company of other cast and crew members. She must cope with the bald fact that legendary actress Madeleine Hedrick is playing one of the other leads and that the selfish actions of her own actress mother caused Hedrick's marital breakup. With regret, she notices that Hedrick's newest relationship with a younger man, the third actor, eerily parallels the action of the play itself-- the older woman thrown aside for a younger lover. And this is not the only coincidence, for as the actors prepare for that first performance, other mysterious incidents surrounding the play come under the scrutiny of a light from the past which floods the future of the inhabitants of Il Piacere, placing them in the wake of imminent danger.Kearsley seems to have discovered that knack for combining a luscious setting, a questioning damsel in distress, and a contained mystery with a smorgasbord of tasty male morsels to create a tantalizing reading experience in the worthy tradition of Mary Stewart."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"Susanna Kearsley never fails to satisfy. I have read each of her books, and cannot wait to read the new one soon to come out. When purchasing her books, be careful to note that some books released in the US have a different title than the title given the same book in the UK. Reading a review (back cover, perhaps) will keep you from ordering duplicates. She is an excellent historian, and writes wonderful stories with romance and the paranormal. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I recently discovered Susanna Kearsley, and this was only my second book by her. I am glad that it wasn't my first, or I am sure I wouldn't have fallen quite so in love with this new-to-me-author.Susanna Kearsley is an immensely enjoyable writer who writes fun-to-read books reminiscent of Mary Stewart; a blend of suspense and romance, finely written and set in a beautifully-depicted locale.There are several reasons why I didn't enjoy this book as much as The Shadowy Horses (my first Susanna Kearsley read). First, she included several elements in the plot that don't appeal to me (tarot reading, seances, and homosexuality) that I feel the book would have been just as good without. Secondly, although I like Kearsley's understated handling of romance, in Season of Storms it was SO understated it practically needed CPR. The heroine's love interest was blah and almost boring. Thirdly, the dialogue in Season of Storms lacked the sparkle and wit of The Shadowy Horses. I understand she was creating a slightly different mood in this book, but still I missed the \\"fun\\" dialogue. Fourth, in places the plot felt clunky and forced; namely in the heroine's repeated sightings of people in Venice and Sirmione who just happened to be nefarous characters that she would run into later on the villa. This happened so much that it felt Nancy Drew-ish; waaay too coincidental, to the point of being contrived.One thing I did like better about Season of Storms was the setting. Kearsley did such a fine job of evoking the beauty of an Italian villa on a remote lake that I wanted to pack my bags and go there NOW! Also, she attempted to make the \\"mystery\\" a bit stronger in Season of Storms, even throwing a twist at the end. However, the twist really wasn't a surprise, since she had thrown out plenty of hints along the way. I think mild, almost non-existent suspense is just a trademark of Kearsley, but I am ok with that. Her writing is good enough otherwise to make up for whatever spine tingling may be lacking.I particularly liked the heroine in Season of Storms, who came from a very disjointed and dysfunctional upbringing but who was incredibly well-adjusted. Her mother a famous actress who really didn't have time for a daughter (and who had allowed herself to get pregnant only because she thought it would enhance her image) and her father some one of her mother's many lovers (she says that she doesn't think her mother even knows which one was her father), Celia was essentially raised by a gay couple who were friends of her mother through the theater industry. Although neither of them particularly cared for Celia's mother, they loved Celia and doted on her like two mother hens. And though she is only 22, Celia is amazingly stable with no hang-ups. Although she doesn't care much for her mother she isn't full of hate or bitterness and seems to have calmly accepted the fact that she will probably never know who her father is.One thing I like about books narrated in the first person such as Kearsley's is that (usually) the narrator doesn't tell us much about her appearance or personality. Although it's implied that she must be very attractive (since there is always a handsome hero who falls for her), it's never expressly stated or described. This allows the reader to draw their own picture of the main character, even to fit themselves into her place, which makes these types of books easier to \\"lose\\" yourself in.If you haven't read anything yet by Susanna Kearsley, I would recommend not starting with this one; save it until you have read some of her others, first. Although I was slightly disappointed with this one, I am still hopeful that I will enjoy Kearsley's other books as much as I enjoyed The Shadowy Horses and look forward to reading more by this talented author."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I started with Kearsley'sThe Winter Seaand now can't seem to stop. Only availability and used book prices are keeping me from sweeping up all things written by Susanna Kearsley/Emma Cole. If you were a big fan of Mary Stewart some years ago, as I was, Kearsley's books will appeal to you very much. Exotic settings, young/\\"youngish\\" heroines, mysteries with a hint of the paranormal, reincarnation and flashbacks to the past, slow-developing romances with a handsome male, it's all there in her books.In this one, modern-day aspiring London actress Celia Sands is recruited to act in a play in Italy, a play written in the early 1900s by playwright Galeazzo D'Ascanio for his much younger actress love and muse by the name of Celia Sands (no relation to our modern-day heroine). But just before the play was to open in 1921 or thereabouts, the first Celia mysteriously disappeared. Did she run away or was she murdered?Our modern-day Celia is asked by the playwright's grandson, Alessandro D'Ascanio, to play the leading role in the first-ever presentation of the play, to be put on at the theater on the grounds of the D'Ascanio estate of Il Piacere. Once Celia is in Italy, she has quite an adventure waiting for her, involving a huge cast of characters, both Italians, Brits and one American. There's skulduggery concerning priceless artefacts at the estate dating from ancient times, lots of romantic intrigue involving any number of characters, interesting tidbits about how one sets about putting on a play, possible ghosts and mysterious happenings, and it's just an all-around good read for fans of romantic suspense."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"This is a somewhat tepid book by this award winning author. Perhaps because her other novels are so terrific, this one pales in comparison. While well written, it moves along at a ponderous pace, a lull before the storm that never quite arrives.The author weaves two stories in one. One is about a turn of the century actress, Celia Sands, who mysteriously disappeared, during a torrid affair with her wealthy, married Italian lover, who wrote a play for her. She never had an opportunity to perform the leading role in her lover's masterpiece, however, due to her untimely disappearance. The main story line is about a present day actress of the same name, though no relation, who is called upon to play the role the first Celia Sands was unable to play.For this role, Ms. Sands is brought to a villa in Italy, which was once the home of the playwright and now belongs to his grandson, Alex. While there, Celia realizes that there are some strange goings on, but does not know why. All soon becomes clear, though it takes many pages for everything to fall into place. There is really nothing too mysterious in this mildly suspenseful novel.Those who have read the author's other novels may be mildly disappointed. Newcomers to this author may enjoy it more. Nonetheless, it is still a well written, though somewhat tepid and belabored, novel."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"I love Susanna Kearsley's books and this one is no exception. She truly writes the best modern day gothic novels with a touch of paranormal and wonderful settings. She has been compared to Mary Stewart and I think that is a fair comparison even though Ms. Kearsley does have her own style.Season of Storms develops slowly but the pace is steady and the reader is treated to two parallel stories. Celia Sands is chosen to play the lead in a play written some 80 years before by a famous Italian poet and playwright. The play was never performed because the lead actress (also named Celia Sand--no relation) and mistress of the playwright disappeared on the eve of the opening. Now his grandson Alessandro D'Ascanio is producing it at the theater on his family estate where it was to have been done originally.Three mysteries and some paranormal elements give the story depth and provide suspense. All of the characters are compelling as are the relationships between Celia and several of the other characters. The setting is lovely--the Lake Garda area of Italy--and Susanna does such a good job that the reader feels as though she is there. The ending is somewhat predictable but still satisfying. I would highly recommend this book and any of Ms. Kearsley's books. There are not that many of them so they are worth reading and savoring."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"Typical Susanna Kearsley - an interesting and emotionally rewarding read. She always does her homework, and that diligent research pays off in believability of plot and characters. Think I have read all of her work to date, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every book. My favorite is Marianna, but all are worth the investment of time."},{"Title":"Season of Storms","review":"Susanna Kearsley writes much like Barbara Michaels- her novels feature highly developed characters, a beautiful sense of atmosphere and an air of ghostly mystery that draw the reader in. If you enjoy the work of Barbara Michael's, Susanna Kearsley will not be a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Kleptomania: The Compulsion to Steal - What Can Be Done?","review":"This book about Kleptomania is an excellent book. I was looking for books on this subject, but I found a lot of books that were written in the 80's. This book was published in 1998 and is a great book for anyone dealing with Kleptomania. This book is also good for family members and employers who are dealing with someone who is stealing. I feel that every employer should read this book.This book is an easy to read and understand book. Great for teens who \`might' think that they have a problem and for older people who also after getting in trouble with the law find that they have a problem with stealing. Kleptomania is not people who steal everything; people with kleptomania steal things that are useless to them. This book tells you the signs of a person who might be kleptomania. Taking objects on impulse, without planning ahead; repeatedly taking items that are of no value or need for personal use; feeling increased tension right before the theft, and then feeling relief and pressure at the time of the theft and people with kleptomania steal without feelings of anger or revenge.Kleptomania is a rare condition. Many people do not come to seek help when they are stealing, unless the courts have told them to. I started therapy on my own because I realized that I did have a problem. This book helped me to see that this is a rare problem and that I can be helped and so can anyone dealing with this condition. I would recommend this book to anyone who might think that they have a problem with stealing."},{"Title":"Kleptomania: The Compulsion to Steal - What Can Be Done?","review":"I started looking for a book on the subject since the media hit with the Winona case. I saw Dr. Goldman on Larry King Live, have read quotes from him in recent Time and People magazines and decided to go out and read this compelling book. It touches all the issues I suffer from. It is a compassionate yet straight talking book about a disorder so secretive yet so destructive. Most people simply don't understand the torment and anguish. The book clears up misconceptions and helps the reader grab ahold of themselves. Dr. Goldman, thanks for pointing me in the right direction."},{"Title":"Home schooling children with special needs: Turning challenges into opportunities","review":"This book is especially suited for the person with limited home-schooling experience, but wants to begin home schooling their special needs child. For those parents it will be a big confidence builder, and help them deal with issues such as grief and anger. For the veteran home-schooler meeting the needs of one or two special needs children the book still offers help in writing an individualized education plan and having some really good curriculum reviews. Additionally there are some ideas on modifying programs that the family already has used with other children. I wish it was still in print because I borrowed a copy and would like to own it for a reference."},{"Title":"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 32nd Edition","review":"It goes without saying that Overstreet is the best of the reference guides for pricing comics.

I would also say that it is completely comprehensive, except that I noticed that the 1967 copy of Captain Johner and the Aliens published by Gold Key seems to be missing from some editions....One important thing to keep in mind is that the guides themselves become collectibles. I always used to discard my old \\"obsolete\\" copy when I got a more recent one- now I see that some of the older editions that I threw out are worth big bucks.

In this edition, boasting nearly a thousand pages, you get feature articles (this time out on Superman, Spider-Man and Archie), a market report, the exhaustive price guide listings (erudite essays by leading experts preface each \\"age\\" of comics) and everything you need to know about the care and feeding of comics: grading, collecting, preservation and storage, buying and selling, and so on. The guide's famous cover gallery - thirty-six sumptuous pages of four-color masterpieces - by itself justifies the purchase price.My collecting years well behind me, I picked up this edition of the OPG for the express purpose of appraising a few duplicate comics I wanted to sell on eBay. Soon, however, my on again, off again love affair with comics was passionately rekindled, and I was deep in the throes of browsing mania. The OPG is insidiously addictive, whether your interest in comics is based on collecting, investing, pop culture or just plain old nostalgia. My modest collection of mainly Silver Age Marvels has priceless sentimental value, and only utter financial ruin could induce me to sell it. Still, it's fun to check values periodically and to enjoy the purely masochistic thrill of looking up key issues I wish I had been savvy enough to buy way back when. (Such as the Holy Grail of Spidey-philes like me, \\"Amazing Fantasy\\" #15, whose sinfully high current value in near mint condition assures that I will never own it now!)The OPG is like a politically incorrect clubhouse for boys of all ages and a \\"no girls allowed\\" sign is not so subtly implied. The book is pre-occupied with and gleefully celebrates the stuff that boys and men love: action and more action, gore and more gore, and girls, girls, girls. Archaic references to \\"headlights\\" and \\"Good Girl Art\\" abound in the price listings. In the cover gallery, feminine pulchritude rules. The hobby has female fans and the OPG does acknowledge them, but it's safe to say comicdom will forever remain a mighty bastion of manly ideals. (Yeah, baby!)The book's market report points up some disturbing trends. Once a boys club admitting anyone with a pocketful of change, comic book fandom is looking more like a very exclusive Rich Boys Club these days. According to the report, somebody paid $350,000 in 2001 for a high grade copy of the legendary Golden Age \\"Marvel Comics\\" #1 - the most ever paid for a single comic. Likewise, key Silver Age comics are fetching house mortgage-sized figures. Investors with very deep pockets dominate the ad pages of the OPG, offering vast amounts of cash for key books or whole collections. Such high-rolling doesn't bode well for a hobby that should be all about fun, not trophies and greed.It's also chic these days for a collector to have his valuable comic graded by a company of super-experts, who proceed to encase the book in an archival plastic holder with a score on the front. The result is a comic book preserved for eternity, but nobody can enjoy it ever again. You can have your trophies - I'm fine with my stained, spine-rolled, subscription-creased Spideys with my name scrawled all over the covers. Poor, but fine."},{"Title":"Scott 1997 Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue: Countries of the World J-O (Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue Vol 4 Countries J-O)","review":"We can always rely on the editors at Scott to provide the best in indexing stamps in their catalogue Volumes, even though we may not always agree with their catalogue values.

The problem with this book is that as of now a lot of the earlier story arcs that made the series compelling have been completed. Eve and Roarke got together and are usually blissfully happy, Eve and Sommerset don't get along but no longer have that major tension, Peabody has made detective, Peabody and McNab are together, Roarke has resolved his family issues, Mavis has become more of a side show than an interesting character, and even Crack has outlived his usefulness.... Basically, all the side tales that made the series interesting are no longer there, so the books have to stand on the mystery and this one just doesn't have it. As another reviewer stated, Eve doesn't care about this one, so its hard for the reader to care."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I have been a fan of the 'In Death' series from nearly the beginning. One of the consistent strengths of the series is the level of detail we have of the characters - their relationships, their history (together and separate), their personal motivations. Another strength is often the complexity of the \\"murder mystery\\" aspect of each novel. This was an adequate entry into the series, but I don't feel that it did much to move things forward with regards to character development - except for giving more detail about Eve after she went into foster care, obviously.This was a change of pace for the \\"In Death\\" series because there was only a single murder victim. There was also very little threat posed for Eve, Roarke, Peabody, or any close friends. So, because of that, the way the story was told had to be different.But, it would have been a far better story if the killer hadn't been so glaringly obvious from the start. Normally, I can 'guess' the killer from the mid-point of the book, but this time the only challenge was determining how the killer and the victim were connected (and even that was laid out pretty early, too).Memory in Death is still worth a read because of the new aspects of Eve's history that are learned and because it gives another opportunity to see Eve settle into her marriage to Roarke. But, I personally would recommend borrowing it from the library or waiting for the paperback (which is my SOP now that the books are hardback new releases)."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I don't think I've read a Nora Roberts book in about 15 years. For a while I had read so many 'love' stories I just dont think I could have stomached another, not just from her, from anyone. I had no idea she'd been writing under the name JD Robb or that this book wasn't the first in a series, or that it was not a 'love' story.As I began reading, I did quickly realize this was not the first book with these characters. It wasn't because she kept flashing back as most writers tend to do with returning characters, say for example like the Kay Scarpetta series by Patricia Cornwell. It was more of a familiarity and a comfortableness with the characters and their world that's achieved only after writing about them before, like King with some of his characters from Derry. In fact, I now can't wait to read every one in this series, not just because of the 2 main characters that return in them all, but because she doesn't go back over everything trying to make it a stand alone book. It can be read out of series and it doesn't take away from the story. That lack of monotony in each should be refreshing for any avid reader. I was worried I wouldn't be able to identify with the characters without knowing more of their background but she gives just enough to make you 'get' them.The setting for this book would have drawn me to it no matter the writer. I love reading about how people think things will be in the future. 2059 isn't exactly far enough into the future to have any extreme changes in the world, but I wanted to see where she'd take it. She's very subtle in this book regarding futuristic lingo, dropping it here and there just enough to remind you this isn't the 2000's anymore. 'Links are the future phones (and PC's?) and personal 'links were most like cell phones, they have video all the time, when you answer your link you are staring at the person calling you and they see you and everyone can hear whatever is going on around you. She doesn't overwhelm you with the futuristic stuff, it's very subtle as I said. It's casually dropped into every day conversation such as 'Wanna watch some 'screen later?', it's immediately understood they'll watch t.v. There are also 'droids, they replace workers in areas such as hotel clerking and other instances I'm sure.In this book we see inside a cop's (Eve) world and into a time of her childhood she'd forgotten. Out of the blue a woman shows up in her office and she's traumatized by the memories of the abuse she suffered at the hands of this woman that she'd repressed for so many years. When the woman is brutally murdured while trying to reestablish a relationship with Eve by blackmailing her, she feels compelled to find out why, for herself and for the woman's son, who once helped her but who could also be a suspect. Nothing is given away, you discover all the details when she does, and you're not left knowing who the killer is faster than the character. I look forward to reading the rest of the 'In Death' series."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This book was a huge let down. I have been a long time fan who eagerly awaits any JD Robb title. I think this book is the worst in the series so far. There isn't any suspense in this book at all. Nothing was exciting, surprising or unpredictable. In my opinion, the best thing that can be said about this book is that it does provide some background information on Eve and serves as a transitionary story that will lead to hopefully better releases in the future!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Thanks...this was exactly as advertised and arrived in good time and good repair.

Eve has developed into a character who is learning how to react to emotional situations in a way other than shutting off and avoiding, and I found it fascinating. In the early books, Roarke has to coax every emotion out of her. This one shows that she really is \\"getting the hang of it\\" but yet was so moving in scenes like the one where she apologizes to Roarke for being jealous of his family. I also really enjoyed Eve letting go to enjoy Christmas with him (and who wouldn't?). There is some interesting irony in this one--where she and Peabody go to court to make sure Celina (\\"Visions in Death\\") pays for not taking action. Eve has a moment in this one where she remembers not stepping forward during an epsode at Trudy's house when she was a little girl. Roarke tells her that she was a child, and scared, and shouldn't blame herself. Interesting, though, that neither bring up Nixie (\\"Survivor In Death) who was also a little girl, but stepped up. It seems that \\"Survivor\\" is sort of a forgotten chapter in this series since neither this one, nor \\"Origins\\" refer to that book. All in all, I really enjoyed this one. It's fun to read the early books again after this one, and see how the characters of both Even and Roarke have developed...which is the way humans should work!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, treats us to another installment in her Death series, a scant six months after ORIGIN IN DEATH. This series is properly considered to be \\"futuristic suspense\\" --- the books take place in the mid-21st century --- but such a classification ignores the strong elements of mystery, police procedure, and romance that inform each of the titles. Readers familiar with the series have witnessed the evolution of Eve Dallas, a believably difficult NYPD Homicide Detective who's married to the mysterious, charming and wealthy Roarke.Eve's past, always a shadowy presence in her life, comes back to haunt her when Trudy Lombard, her former foster mother, abruptly appears in her office. This has a dramatic and profoundly detrimental effect upon Eve due to the physical and emotional abuse Trudy heaped upon Eve while she was in her care. Trudy's intent is soon made clear. Attracted to Eve by Roarke's numerous and apparently bottomless pockets, she threatens to blackmail him and Eve with revelations about events that took place during Eve's childhood --- events that, it turns out, were engineered by Trudy. Roarke, who suffers neither fools nor thieves, quickly sends her packing. A few days later, however, Trudy is found brutally murdered in her hotel room.Robb wisely avoids the classic plot vehicle of having either Eve or Roarke appear to be responsible for her death and then having to work to clear themselves. Rather, the focus is on the locked door (with open window) mystery that is the heart of the book. Eve does not lack for plausible suspects, given that she was far from the only foster child who Trudy abused or who would have ample simmering motive for revenge as adults. There is also, of course, Trudy's son and daughter-in-law, who were staying in the same hotel just a few doors away from her, and the mysterious, shadowy figure who was Trudy's partner in crime.Veteran fans of the mystery genre --- even those without the resources of a Roarke in their life --- may well discern the culprit's identity ahead of Eve. Whether that is the case for you or not, however, the enjoyment of the novel is derived in large part from watching Eve, with invaluable assistance from Roarke, ferret out the clues and put them all together. What makes MEMORY IN DEATH unique from its predecessors is Eve's intimate though painfully acquired knowledge of Trudy's personality and motivation, a key factor in solving this particular crime.Fans of the science fiction genre who rarely venture into the mystery section of their bookstore should enjoy MEMORY IN DEATH due to the futuristic setting of the novel specifically and the Eve Dallas series in general. The speculative touches that Robb furnishes are just heavy enough to make the series special and just light enough that we in 2006 can almost see them coming. And given the quality invested in MEMORY IN DEATH, this long-running series should continue to have a bright future indeed.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I read Memory in Death over the weekend and enjoyed it very much. The investigation aspect of the book focused on just one killing this time, which seemed like a refreshing (and more realistic) change from some of the other books, which often have Eve chasing after a serial killer. So she wasn't up to her kneecaps in blood in this one. I also felt that the relationship between Eve and Roarke had a more substantial presence in this book. There's always some glimpse of their personal lives, and Roarke is always a key player in a new In Death book, but often his role is that of \\"Consultant, Civilian\\" and he's aiding in her investigation. While there was some of that in this book as well, we also got to see a lot more of their private lives. The cast of secondary characters is not as heavily featured as in past books, which is probably how and why we're able to have a more substantial visit with Eve and Roarke as a couple. (And it was nice to be a fly on the wall during their Christmas celebration, which was quite calm and homey and sweet.) I found myself missing some of the Usual Suspects a bit -- I would have enjoyed having more scenes with Peabody and McNab and Feeney and Commander Whitney and all the rest (although we got some time with Baxter and Trueheart, and that's always a good thing). My one real complaint about the \\"crime investigation\\" was that I didn't buy into the idea that Trudy's son seemed so oblivious to her real character.

She is already plagued with memories of her father, and his demise at her hands. So imagine her surprise when her foster mother, Trudy Lombard shows up, full of fake motherly love, just to see how she is doing.Trudy, who is visiting New York days before Christmas(with a son and daughter-in-law in tow), claims that she has traveled from Texas because she saw Eve on the news talking about the Icove case. Of course it is obvious from the start that Trudy is only back to try to blackmail Eve or her insanely rich husband, Roarke. Would Roarke pay to hide what Trudy knows from being released to the media? If anyone knows Roarke from the series they already know the answer, and it is not because Roarke believes \\"his cop\\" is not worth $2 million dollars! For him, she is worth that and a lot more. So the adventure and discovery into the truth occurs hours later when after meeting with and being threatened by Roarke, Trudy shows up dead.The usual characters from the series appear and dazzle us as usual. Mavis (who is in her last stages of pregnancy), Summerset (who decides that they will call it quits for the holidays), Peabody & McNabb, Feeney, Nadine,Trueheart, Baxter, Commander Whitney, and a couple others (including the cat, Galahad).

Robb's very successful ... IN DEATH series featuring Lt. Eve Dallas. However, I would guess that those readers who are already devotees of the series and familiar with the background of many of the recurring characters will appreciate more fully the further development of the many familiar relationships which occur during the course of this Christmas season. Of course, Eve's husband Roarke plays a central role in this story; as usual her partner Peabody (whose Christmas celebration with McNab is potentially a source of great tension) and Feeney also both play significant roles during the course of this story, as do both Captain Whitney, and Dr.Mira as well (complemented this time by a crucial role played by her husband Dennis ).Despite the approach of Christmas and the festive appearance of NYC in December of 2059, \\"death was not taking a holiday ... Santa Claus was dead. And a couple of his elves weren't looking so good.\\" Thus opens MEMORY IN DEATH, with Eve surveying the horrific scene where Santa Claus was splattered on the sidewalk after a swan dive from the thirty-sixth floor of an office tower during a Christmas party. Surrounded by a crowd composed of both horrified tourists the thrill seekers attracted to such macabre events, Eve was attempting to elicit some background information about the tragedy which had not only killed Santa but also the hapless victim who happened to be at the point of impact in the center of Times Square. While this is an interesting case, its solution is relatively straightforward and is a function of the type of investigation described in any standard police procedural. It is in fact only the appetizer for the main course which is to follow.When Eve and Peabody return to the Station and interrogate their primary suspect, Eve agrees to allow Peabody to write up the report and do the case follow-up. She is thinking about Christmas, an event which is a source of both very confusing emotions for her as well as a great deal of tentativeness with regard to the tradition of gift giving and receiving and the festive partying with friends and relatives. As she enters her office, she is suddenly confronted by a Mrs. Lombard, an apparent stranger who attempts to embrace her and when rebuffed shocks her by exclaiming \\"why honey, Don't you know me? I'm your mama.\\" The woman breathlessly informs Eve that she heard about her on TV during the incredible national publicity which her last case generated (ORIGIN IN DEATH), and she has come to NYC to catch up with the events in her since the time when she (Trudy) had taken Eve into her home as a foster child. Her son Bobby and his new wife Zana are all there to enjoy the holidays, and want to have dinner with Eve. Eve's emotions are immediately in turmoil as childhood memories flood back and overwhelm her, and she angrily warns Trudy Lombard that she is no longer a helpless child and she better get out or Eve will put her \\"in a cage\\".Of course, Eve arrives home an emotional wreck and when she eventually recounts the story to Roarke, he reassures her that she has overcome her past and can handle this incident; he also immediately understands that Trudy will attempt to shake them down in some way to keep Eve's past out of public view. Trudy's confrontation with Roarke the next day quickly changes the dynamics of the situation, but just as she has underestimated Roarke, they underestimate her tenacity as well. Suddenly the situation changes dramatically when Eve decides to confront Trudy and discovers Trudy's dead and battered body in her hotel room. While Eve can feel absolutely no remorse for Trudy, she is determined to prove her professionalism by assuming the role of primary investigator on the case.From this point forward in the story, Eve's celebration of Christmas and gradual understanding of the way the human bonds of friendship are strengthened and deepened by such celebration are totally intertwined with the way in which the case draws her back into repressed memories of her past. She is forced to bring to the surface long buried recollections of many details of her horrific childhood (which she has overcome); the litany of psychological abuse inflicted by Trudy is truly horrendous and very effectively fills in further gaps in Eve's childhood both for Roarke and long time readers of this series. She also remembers the small occasional acts of kindnesses by Bobby during her life in that house of horrors, and now can feel the gratitude that her couldn't fully appreciate at the time. The search for suspects soon leads Eve to contact other foster children \\"cared for\\" by Trudy, and the full extent of the horror which this manipulative witch inflicted on many children leads Eve to conclude that in all likelihood her death was the result of vengeance occasioned by Trudy's attempt to blackmail other victims who didn't have the resolve or the means to resist her.As the investigation reaches its conclusion and Eve gradually focuses in on the murderer, the outcome is destined to exact a further psychological toll upon her. Fortunately, the depressing elements of the murder investigation are offset by the many positive aspects of this Christmas season for Eve. In some ways, it appears that this is the case which may finally force Eve to fully confront her past and thus allow her to emotionally move beyond it. The major unanswered question is how she will react to the upcoming childbirth by Mavis Freestone of the first child for she and Leonardo (of course they make an appearance here), since she and Roarke have promised to participate during the birth.I strongly recommend this book for all fans of police procedurals, especially those who appreciate a significant injection of character development. Since I became hooked on this series by reading SURVIVOR IN DEATH, I have chosen to read all the new releases while also starting at the beginning in order to better understand the backstory and the references to Eve's previous cases. As I mentioned earlier, I certainly highly recommend this book as a standalone story if you have neither the time nor inclination to read what has become a quite extensive stories. However, I would strongly recommend that readers who like such series with a futuristic element read at least the first three novels of the ... IN DEATH series in the order written (NAKED..., GLORY..., IMMORTAL...) for two reasons (even though I do not rate them as highly as the later entries). First, as the best method of becoming gradually exposed to the elements in Eve's background which have formed her personality in the extremely effective manner which the author has devised; the evolution of the tone of the series and Eve's personality is both interesting and profound. Second, the extensive cast of continuing characters is an integral element in the enjoyment of the series, and there is too great an amount of material for the reader of just a single story to fully appreciate the context.I will close with two final observations concerning this story. First, perhaps I have simply read a sufficient number of stories in this series so that the futuristic elements seem less noticeable than previously, but it seemed to me that in many ways with only a few minor modifications this story could have been set in the present and that the futuristic elements were basically only minor embellishments. Second, it struck me as somewhat out of character that there was no reference to any concern on Eve's part that this case and the concomitant investigation of Trudy's role in Eve's past had the potential to publicly reveal her deepest secrets and thus traumatize her once again as well as permanently change her relationship with her associates.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I'm so glad that J. D. Robb (also known as Nora Roberts) is a prolific writer, as it means that I normally don't have long to wait between episodes of the In Death series. In her latest, Memory In Death, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is confronted with one of her more emotionally trying cases to date... the murder of her foster mother.Christmas 2059 is rolling around, and Dallas is trying to clean up a scene where a Santa flew out a window hyped up on drugs. Just another day at the office until she gets back to the station, only to find a woman waiting for her there. This lady claims that she's Eve's foster mother, a person that Eve hated with a passion. She gets tossed out, and Eve starts dealing with the emotional turmoil of reliving her past (which is gruesome). The reason for the woman's visit becomes clear, however, when she shows up at Roarke's office and attempts to blackmail him and Dallas to the tune of $2 million to not turn over files pertaining to her abusive childhood. Roarke also throws her out, and promises to kill her with his bare hands if she doesn't leave New York immediately. Problem is, someone beats him to it, and she's found murdered in her hotel. Eve ends up first on the scene, and really should dismiss herself from the case. But she feels it's her duty to stand up for the victim, regardless of how she feels about the person. There's no clear clues as to who might have done her in, but Eve's gut says that her son and daughter-in-law, vacationing with the lady, are somehow tied in...As I've stated on just about every other In Death review, I really love this series. I started this book on a Saturday morning, and it was done by Saturday night. I won't even think about the things I *should* have gotten done that day that remained unfinished. This storyline fills out more of Eve's childhood, from the point where she killed her abusive father until she left foster care. It's been alluded to in the past, but never fleshed out in this detail. And even though the original meeting threw her for a loop, I got the feeling that confronting this ghost from her past might also help her deal with the nightmares of her father. Just a guess... As always, well written and an extremely enjoyable read.And when's the next one coming out???"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Kudos to the author,for never disappointing her readers for this character, Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke!

She will pull at your heart & soul!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"JD Robb shifts gears again, giving us a slow-paced whodunit with a different set of bad memories on Eve Dallas' mind. On the heels of wrapping up a Santa splattered on the sidewalk, an unpleasant memory walks into Eve's office. Trudy Lombard had been Eve's foster mother for six months following Eve's escape from her sadistic father. Trudy Lombard had delivered her own forms of torture, and Eve boots her from her office.Eve's husband Roarke is utterly unsurprised when Ms. Lombard visits him to try to shake him down for $2 million. He flicks her off and throws one hell of a holiday party, and he and Eve get a shock when they find Lombard murdered in her hotel room. Lombard had come to New York with her son Bobby and his wife Zana, who had a room down the hall. Eve gets them moved to one of Roarke's hotels while she and her partner Peabody run through what few clues they have, figuring out who murdered a thoroughly hateful woman.Eve is plagued with strange new dreams as she dredges up new memories from her past that are only slightly less nightmarish than the usual fare. Sprinkled in between is plenty of quality time with Roarke and some holiday gift giving.While not the gripping page-turner the last Robb novel was, I happen to enjoy an author who can mix it up, and this was definitely different fare. I also liked the touch of Eve dealing with her foster care memories rather than yet again reliving the nightmare she suffered at her father's hands. Eve gets the added jolt of a sense of family as she connects with other victims of Trudy Lombard, whose beginnings were as joyless as hers. While I had the killer pegged right off, the information isn't held back terribly long, and the story spends time delving into Eve's psyche in a more detached and accepting way than before.A quiet, almost ambling read, this is nonetheless another gem in the JD Robb collection."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Nora Roberts, aka JD Robb had me riveted to the latest installment in the LT. Eve Dallas series. Thought it's not terribly difficult to figure out the who in whodunit, it's the why and how. Roberts leaves clues for avid readers who may or may not pick up on them and weaves a tale that will keep readers on edge.A former foster mother of Eve's is murdered in this installment. And Eve is the primary on the investigation. With minimal help from Roarke - unusual compared to the past few in the series - Eve wraps up the case in her usual cool, cop-like fashion.I love how Roberts has developed the relationship with Eve and her husband, Roarke and hope that in the next few books they have a baby. A pregnant Eve and expectant Roarke would give this series an added zing. And likely push the herione to pursue Captain status, a desk job she isn't quite yet ready for.For those who have not kept up, you can read these out of order.

I keep thinking, as I open each one, \\"this one has to be bad, she can't keep this up this long.\\" And each time I'm wrong. And I'm wrong again.Memory in Death is another excellent entry in the Eve Dallas saga. The spectre of her childhood rears its ugly head in the form of an abusive foster mother who shows up to try and shake her and Roarke down. This fails of course, but the woman ends up dead and a trail of other foster children who endured much the same as Eve fill the suspect list.As always, the foundation of the book is the relationship between Eve and Roarke. And I don't mean in romance novel fashion because these books have a romance element but they aren't really romance. But in earlier books, Eve's struggle to get past the nightmare of her youth was more prevalent and played a bigger part. This time, her childhood played a big part but it did not plague her as it did before. Because Eve has moved on.A series this long with the same central characters must have them grow or it gets stagnant. I'm quite pleased to see Eve becoming a better person and not one hobbled by her past anymore.The same cast of characters Roberts/Robb has introduced in the previous books - McNabb and Peabody, Sommerset, Feeney, Trueheart and Nadine are all back but in an interesting enough configuration that it stays fresh.I'll still be anxiously awaiting the next installment in July (and wondering if in fact, Nora Roberts is a cylon for her amazing productivity)"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"In \\"Memory in Death,\\" Lieutenant Eve Dallas is confronted with her cruel and sadistic former foster mother, who is seeking to extort a large sum of money from the ever-protective Roarke. She then is murdered, and Eve takes it upon herself to solve the case.This mystery is much less layered and technical than her previous installment and contained several things that I really liked and one or two that I really, really didn't.What I liked: seeing Eve's vulnerable side, avoiding the cliche of having either her or Roarke be suspects in Trudy's murder, her own mixed feelings about solving the case, Peabody's growth as a character and as a person, Eve's encounters with her foster-brother.What I didn't: how obvious it was who murdered Trudy, the \\"female villain\\" stereotypes Ms. Robb invokes - women are bitchy, conniving, etc, only reinforced with the reappearance of a female villain from another book. Also, just for a change, might we have a book in this series that pushes some else's buttons, who isn't Eve? What about Roarke? Or Whitney? Feeney? Baxter? Don't any of these guys have unpleasant family secrets or past crime-solving activities that might get them in trouble? (Okay, we've had one with Feeney, but still).

We get more of a background look into Dallas's life in the foster care system, instead of the glimpses of the past with her father. This time Trudy Lombard is in town and looking for Eve. She was Eve's foster mother for less than a year before Eve ran away. Trudy physically and emotionally abused Eve along with all the other foster children that were in her care. Eve refuses to spend time with Trudy who is trying to extort money from Roarke. Eve of course finds Trudy dead and she must find her killer even though she despises the victim. The only possible suspects are the son and the daughter-in-law. Very good mystery have to say I guessed the killer early on though. The book also focuses on Christmas and the people in Eve's life. It's fun to watch Eve grow with each book and become more human. The next book is Born in Death which I am assuming is when Mavis's baby is born, I can't wait for that one."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I've enjoyed reading this series in the past, particularly the earlier novels, as I found the tension between Roarke and Eve exciting and some of the murders intriguing. However, this entry seems to be particularly formulaic. The villain is a rip-off of at least three other characters in the previous book, someone who appears innocent but in fact is not; Eve's back story is developed to new, Dickensian levels to the point that credulity is stretched; and there's just no reason for the continued bickering between the two main characters. I wouldn't bother with this book unless you are a rabid fan or there's really nothing else at the airport bookstore."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I enjoyed this book as I do all of J.D. Robb's books. In fact I have given them all 5 stars. However in this book I miss the interaction between Eve and her work mates and friends. Too much wallowing in her own problems and not enough good old fashion police work. There was only the one murder of Eve's foster mother and I really didn't care much about it. Also there were not enough suspects. I figured out \\"who done it\\" because there was no one else!!! Still it was Eve and Rourke so I will read it again as I do all J.D's books."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"A very disappointing read-laborious, predictable, no interesting plot or characterization. The supporting characters that make Eve such an interesting person and the books such fascinating reads were missing--for a book set during Christmas, this lack was even more apparent. I am a huge fan of this series, and this book was the first that felt like a huge waste of my money. I will wait for the paperback version of the next In Death offering."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Don't get me wrong--I started out a HUGE \\"In-Death\\" fan. But it seems Nora has lost the edge with this series. Most of the orginal side plots have been worked out--and the loss of Eve's more neurotic behaviors tied to those was what I found enjoyable. It seems like I keep buying these books just to get a few more fragments into Eve's/Roarke's histories--and those are meted out stigily every 3rd book or so. I knew right after the murder \\"whodunnit\\" and then read 200 pgs of fairly lackluster situations before getting my gold star. Perhaps I have just grown out of the place where I identified with this series, but I can still joyfully reread many of the earlier books."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I enjoyed this book - everything from the witty banter, the resolution to the conflict with Dr. Mira, the words between Roarke and Eve, and how it resolves. It does get a bit slow in the middle and it becomes obvious as to who did the crime, but I have still enjoyed rereading it."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"As a mystery Memory was not her greatest book. I read these books less for the mystery plot but more for the character developement and interactions. I think when you read a \\"series\\" involving the same characters they become as important as or more important than the actual plot. Eve Dallas has come a long way since Naked in Death. The books are a bit repetitive about her past abuse, etc. but show her evolving personally - she is developing more insight into her interactions and feeling for people around her. A softer side of Eve Dallas showed in this book."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I enjoyed this book because it filled in alot of the background on Eve. I wondered alot about what happened to her after she was found in the alley. You understand more about her makeup. Why she has a soft spot about some people and not about most people. J.D.

Can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Eve and Roarke seem to moving beyond their usual hang ups, or at least to recognize them faster. It's refreshing to see them getting more in sync with each other. The surrounding plots are also moving along at a satisfying pace and I also liked that JDR didn't force characters into the story just to let us know how they're doing. I found this new information on Eve's past to be well integrated. I especially appreciated that no one close to Eve was even suspected of being implicated in the crime. The plot doesn't beat my favorite \\"Loyalty in Death\\", and may have been more mind games than action driven, but it was well crafted and satisfying. My favourite part, though, was another glimpse into Eve's past, through her last Christmas Present to Roarke. I won't ruin the pleasure of reading about it within the context of the book, but I liked the image that was created. It doesn't always have to be about abuse and torture with her. After my disappointing experience with \\"Survivor in Death\\" I was happy to see a more human, more approachable private Eve, complement her hard-hitting, unbeatably tough, cop from the tips of her hair to the soles of her no-nonesense boots personna."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"In the year 2059, Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the New York Police and Security Department walks into her office and finds a nightmare sitting on her chair.

Eve manages to be the primary on the case in order to get justice for Trudy who many like Roarke believe doesn't deserve it and but the cop can put the worst of her childhood to rest.Trudy is evil, a woman who will go to any lengths to get what she wants. She likes to hurt people, especially those she fostered and then blackmailed when they were old enough to pay her.

I have read some of Nora Roberts' other books and I tend to get a little bored after 2 or 3 of them in a row. However, ALL of the Memory books have been excellent and keep you hanging right up to the end. There have been a couple that I have figured out \\"who done it\\" before it's revealed, but there is still always an interesting twist thrown in there for Dallas to try and prove it. And then, of course, all of the personal relationships between the characters is facinating.

Cannot wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Nora Roberts (aka J.D. Robb) is sooo... reliable. Not predictable by any means but you can always rely on her for an enjoyable read. The 'In Death' books always manage a couple of surprises no matter how many or how long running the series has been. This particular story is no exception. It's not so much the actual mystery of who did the murder (you do start to suspect the killer before the end)but the real appeal is following Eve and her cast of supporting characters as they solve the crime. The process they go through and the personal interaction of the characters as they proceed is as fascinating in this book as it was in the first 'In Death' book. Roberts manages to reveal something more about her characters (like Eve's experiences with foster care as a child in this case) with each book while still holding back enough to have you waiting for the next book to learn more. The relationships and personalities are the real treasure in these books and Roberts does a great job of pulling them into a good story for our reading enjoyment. I buy the hard copies as soon as they are released now because I simply can't wait for the paperback release. I think it is obvious there is alot of life left in this cast of characters. Thanks again Nora!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I love this book! All the in death books are great, but this one was a pleasure to read!

Eve Dallas is a tough, no-nonsense New York City cop but, in this book, we watch Eve grow as a woman, wife, friend as well as a police officer.

Robb. Fans of Robb's In Death series will not be disappointed with this latest installment. Eve's reaction to Peabody and McNab is still as funny now as when the relationship first began.

Robb fans will love this one!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"the \\"in death\\" series just seems to be getting worse and worse.

I used to get these in hardcover and then I started to wait for paperback, now I just wait till it gets to my local library."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This next very welcome offering in J.D. Robb/Nora Roberts' \\"In Death\\" series takes place at Christmas, and Eve has actually begun to enjoy the holiday, a big change from times past! The discomfort she feels at buying gifts (which nevertheless she does) and enjoying the lavish decorations with which Roarke decorates their house forms a welcome backdrop to the latest murder at hand:A woman (Trudy) who once served as a foster mother for the young, abused Eve surfaces in New York to blackmail Eve and Roarke. Trudy was worse than the wicked stepmother of every fairy tale, and Eve has a near breakdown just seeing her in person again. Before Eve and Roarke even have time to appropriately combat the blackmail threat, Trudy is found murdered in her hotel room.The body is found by Trudy's sweet, winsome, nauseatingly submissive daughter-in-law, Zana, who is married to Trudy's only son and only biological child, Bobby. Eve remembers Bobby as a child who snuck food to her when she was locked without food into her bedroom, and that compassion complicates the case.It's not hard for the reader to figure out who the murderer is, but that's not really the point. The real point is how Eve is going to gather enough evidence to make the accusation stick--and how she is going to battle her own demons while doing so. Because there is a huge part of Eve that is darn glad to see Trudy dead--and yet she must bury that feeling and fight for justice as she does in every other case.I loved this book. I love them all, but this was, unlike some of the more serious stories, lots of fun. Question for the next book in the series: How are squeamish Roarke and Eve going to serve as birth buddies for Mavis? You have to know the series to know just how funny that is. Nevertheless, it's easy to read \\"Memory in Death\\" as a stand-alone, even if you have not read any of the others."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"She looks like a stranger, but she introduces herself to Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas as her mother. Eve's memories have been suppressed, but she remembers that horrible period when social services parked her with this abusive and cruel woman. Eve rejects her, but Trudy Lombard is not content--and visits Eve's husband, billionaire Roark, with a blackmail threat. Either Roark pays Trudy or Trudy will release all of the files of Eve's childhood.Hours later, Trudy is dead and Eve is the officer on the scene. She intends to find the killer, but how can she summon the moral energy to really care about who killed a woman who was nothing but a cruel blackmailer?Author Nora Roberts (writing as J. D. Robb) continues her Eve Dallas futuristic mystery series with an emotionally rich adventure. Eve continues to struggle to fit in, to create healthy relationships with the people of her life. In the Christmas season, Eve's social skill limitations come particularly into focus. Having a woman appear out of the horrible days of her past makes all of her fears come alive. Eve's sidekick, Detective Peabody, is going through similar doubts as her boyfriend insists that she accompany him to meet his family in Scotland--all while Peabody is unable to lose that stuborn five pounds of excess weight.If you're new to this series, you're in for a treat. Roberts/Robb combines just enough mystery with emotional richness to spin an engaging story. Troubled Eve, spunky Peabody, perfect Roark, and the Eve's usual lot of supportive friends and fellow cops all keep up the reader interest. Eve's emotional engagement with the mystery helps us care about more than simply finding who-dunnit."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This book was even more interesting because it is different from the previous books.

I have read the very first book she has written all the way through to Memory in Death. I just can't get enough. The characters are wonderful and all people you can relate to. There is always a Mavis, Eve and a Peabody that one knows. But the thrilling part is that they take you right to the scene of the crime and you're part of the team throughout the story. The plots are always great and leaves you grasping for more and what's going to happen next. The only thing that I regret is that J.D. Robb just doesn't write fast enough. I definitely need more than one book a year."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I liked this book. But I liked it more for the character developement than the murder mystery. I liked hearing about another chapter of Eve's past (although would it kill Ms. Robb to give Eve ONE happy memory in her childhood? It wouldn't make Eve any less cynical if she just had one shining moment), but the murder mystery was just dull. So painfully obvious who the killer was.I found the same problem with the last book. The killer's identity is getting more obvious with every book.

I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion.But anyhow.I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer.It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad.The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens.Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah.I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together.It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on.No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems.Boring.I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them.And why now do we have to be cross with Mira?It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit.Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much.So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed.Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown.Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end.I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together.And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.Okay.Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"The In Death series is fabulous but the quality of the paperbacks recently has been awful. The pages start falling out during the first read of the book!"},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I loved this installment of the \\"In Death\\" series because we finally get a glimpse into Eve's life after she killed her father. Eve was in foster care, and the woman she was sent to live with was a piece of work. She tormented the children in her care, and wasn't above fraud and other crimes. When she learns of Eve's marriage to wealthy Roarke, she sees her chance at the big time. She shows up on Eve's door demanding money to keep silent about her past. When she shows up dead the next day, Roarke is the number one suspect.This was a good old fashioned murder mystery, without some of the wilder elements in previous books (clones!). Though many readers will figure out who the killer is quickly, the main draw here is Eve's single-minded focus to clear Roarke's name. And as ever, Peabody is by her side bringing humor and humanity to the tale. I also enjoyed the scenes with Roarke's personal assistant. She's a great example of a well-done minor character. I can't recommend this series enough."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"'Memory in Death' was my introduction to the 'in death' series, and it took me a few pages to get my bearings, but after that I settled in for quite an enjoyable ride. While I found the identity of the killer to be relatively easy to figure out, I also found it didn't matter that I'd figured it out. The real mystery wasn't so much 'whodunnit' as 'howdunnit.' How was the murder carried out? How was it covered up? And how could it be proven?'Memory in Death' is very much a character-driven story. Rather than being filled with action scenes or gore, this story focused on the people. Most of the details came out through dialogue rather than action, and the characters are interesting enough that I enjoyed that.One of my first thoughts when I started reading Memory in Death was \\"wow, is this over-the-top.\\" That was quickly followed however, by, \\"and it's perfect!\\" Roberts/Robb gleefully indulges in everything that makes over-the-top detective novels and mysteries fun, and infuses it with a dollop of romance for good measure. It seems clear that she's writing for the fun of it and thoroughly enjoying what she's doing, and as a result her books are equally enjoyable to read. The characters are fun, wacky, and larger-than-life; the mysteries are suitably labyrinthine; the setting is just futuristic enough to allow her to shape her world to her whim without making it alien to the reader."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I quite enjoyed this. One reason being that for a change Roarke is allowed to show his nasty side...to Trudy...who turns into the victim of murder a few pages later. The more boring In Death books are all those where Roarke is turned into some kind of opinionless crutch for his wife. Which is most of them nowadays. Also. Eve shows her selfish side and then has to apologise to her husband. I enjoyed that too.Towards the end of the book, the perp, Marnie calls Eve a hypocrite. I agree with her. Eve says that she would have prefered that sadistic foster mom, Trudy, should have been tried for her child abuse crimes and then put in a cage for many many years. But who would have the guts to see that justice was done? Not Eve. She had shut Trudy out of her mind and turned into a pathetic quivering coward the first time she saw her in her adult life. Yet Marnie, another abused foster kid had the balls to hand out vengeance and then had to suffer Eve at her sermonising, insufferably moralising worst. The case of Trudy's death should have been left unsolved and quietly closed.In any case. This is a prime example of a crime some police forces categorise as 'no humans involved.' That is, one felon committing a crime upon another felon. Why a fairly decent human being such as Eve feels any personal attachment to Trudy is beyond my understanding.Despite all that. Like I said I enjoyed this novel. Mainly because there are lots of scenes between Roarke and Eve. One relationship that continues to ring false however, is the one between Eve and Summerset. There really is no need for Eve to be so constantly abusive to Sommerset, who is essentially a well-loved servant. Sometimes it seems that she's bullying him.

As it turns out, Trudy gave many other childrne her special brand of care, and Eve soon relises shes going to have to take down some one who went through exactly what she did.This is the most personal in Death novel.

As time goes on, I find myself waiting longer to read these books. They just aren't a \\"must read\\" any more.Like: The humor! No one does this aspect as well.The mystery, when it is actually a mystery.Her friends - what an amazing assortment of characters.Dislike: The whining. Its more than time for Eve to face up to her past - or not. just do it one way or the other. Other people (in real life) with much less going for them (supportive spouse & friends, job, respect and so on) have managed to face thier pasts in a healthier way than Eve. I do tire of reading about the horrific abuse in every book. Isn't it time for Roarke to use his influence and find her parents? We all know the man she killed wasn't really her father, right? She has to be a much-missed child from good parents.The sex. Perhaps some people read Robb for the sex scenes but they bore me. I find they bring the series down rather than elevating it. These scenes I skip and its easy to do since, once they start, they invariably take up the rest of the chapter. Why not leave these scenes to the heavy-breathing historical type stuff she writes?Love Roarke but dislike that we have to always hear what a bad boy he was. This book kind of moved away from that. Kind of.Overall, its just time for the main characters to grow up and stop sniveling. There are people out there in the world with ever so much less than either one of them have who managed to overcome. Why not make these characters like that?Oh, and what is with the \\"stand for\\"? Someone is always standing for someone. Its written in such a way I just know that no one would ever really talk like that. And its said much too often. She has used that phrase in other books as well (& other series). Perhaps she does know people who speak like that, but I have yet to meet one. Sometimes her characters come across as almost comic when she places words in their mouths that just aren't thiers.All that said, I honestly do enjoy Robb, but for the mystery and the humor and the relationships. The cop work is usually good, but its been missing. Basically, I could do without all the sex (some romance is lovely) and truly appreciate a good detective story written by a talented woman."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Eve Dallas walks into her office and immediately is confronted with her past.

This book is worth the read if solely to read that scene!That's all I'll share about the story so you'll have the pleasure of following what happens next. This book is a treacherous path down Eve's memory lane and we gain lots of insight into her past in addition to an intriguing murder mystery she and Peabody are tasked to solve.

Robb continues her excellent series with yet another great installment. In this book, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is forced to confront painful memories from her past when one of her foster mothers, Trudy Lombard, surfaces at the police station to talk to Eve. Trudy had left emotional scars on Eve and memories of cold baths, being locked in the dark, and scrubbing the kitchen with a toothbrush overwhelm her. Eve leaves the police station instead of wrapping up an investigation, which is so out of character that Peabody contacts Eve's husband, Roarke. When Roarke arrives home, he finds Eve huddled under the hot shower. This is the last weak moment for Eve as she pulls herself together to face her emotions at seeing Trudy again. Meanwhile, Roarke is furious and fully expects Trudy to visit him as well as he suspects blackmail is behind Trudy's return. Sure enough, Trudy attempts to extort $2 million dollars from Roarke at his office; the resulting scene is very powerful and displays Roarke's full capabilities. Eve wants to confront Trudy herself and Eve and Roarke go to Trudy's hotel to tell her they will not be subjected to blackmail. However, Trudy is dead and the rest of the novel focuses on Eve's investigation into Trudy's death.

A wonderful story and actually a welcome break from the previously more gory \\"Origin in Death\\"."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Memory in Death is the latest in the in Death series written by J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts. This latest novel is set at Christmas, just a couple of weeks after the conclusion of the Icove case of Origin in Death, and the two novels are very strongly connected. For, the concomitant publicity wrought by the resolution of the Icove case is the primary cause for the action of the new novel.In brief, Trudy Lombard who was once Eve Dallas's foster mother, an abusive and sadistic woman, catches the news about the Icove case which features the primary Eve Dallas, married to the fabulously wealthy Roarke. Resolved to be repaid for having housed Dallas for a few months, Lombard comes to New York City with intent to blackmail Dallas and Roarke so she will be silent about Dallas's traumatic childhood. Though Dallas is badly shaken and spun into the black well of her traumatic childhood memories, she rejects Lombard, as does Roarke whom the woman later approaches. The action of the novel commences when Dallas and Roarke set out to Lombard's hotel to face her down together and discover her murdered with her body showing signs of a severe beating.Fans of J.D. Robb are doomed to disappointment if they come to Memory in Death expecting the tension and bloody trails that are the hallmark of previous novels or even the philosophical musings that are the subtext of Origin in Death. Instead, Memory in Death mirrors the slowing down of business activity-even cop business-that occurs as Christmas nears; thus, it pays homage to the Christmas season in spite of its unorthodox opening with the death of a party Santa.Though restraining the central characters to the investigation of one murder, Robb retains the sense of the diurnal occurrence of murder by having other investigative officers report in to Dallas on the progress of their cases. This is something that she has seldom done even though readers sometimes hear about the case-load of a regular like Baxter. Thus, Robb slows down the pace, reduces the frantic urgency, and so sets the stage for what Christmas is about: loved ones, family, and friends.In a sense, the novel is a Christmas home-coming for the regulars, almost all of whom are present at the party, and who are like family to Eve Dallas and Roarke. The party itself, like Dallas's later conversation with Peabody when she calls from Scotland, is given too short shrift, and this undercuts in some slight way to holiday celebration.One of the benefits of the slow pace of Memory in Death is that it allows for the development of relationships, such as that between Dallas and Charlotte Mira. The Miras are shown, through Charlotte's conversation with Eve, to be a warts and all less than perfect couple. The result is that Dallas, who struggles periodically with roles and the interpersonal aspect of marriage, is reassured that perfection is unlikely. Mira continues to teach Dallas about marriage, family, and friendship.If Feeney is Dallas's surrogate father, Charlotte Mira is her surrogate mother and friend who cares enough to plead for them to remain friends. Dallas's lack of ease with personal relationships outside of her marriage and the work situation, even her hardness, is highlighted by Mira's plea. In the mushy grounds of disagreement, love, anger, and exchange that is friendship, Dallas is often lost. Happily for her sake, Charlotte Mira helps her find her way back. Dallas's discomfort is also shown in the abrupt way she dismisses Peabody who calls from her Scotland visit with McNab's relatives. Moreover, some of the sticks-in-the-craw dirt comes out in a fight between Eve and Roarke which makes them an even more realistic couple because Dallas vents her envy that Roarke's family situation turned out so well for him. The dust up between the two and its resolution reminds that envy and anger can bubble up against even those we love.At the heart of the novel is the rich irony that Trudy Lombard, who, in life, had psychologically abused her female foster charges, in death is the subject of an equally psychological murder investigation. Call it a consequence of the Christmas slow down or what you will, it is undeniable that Memory in Death is not action-driven but more focused on the detailing of the deductive reasoning process that is so crucial to the resolution of criminal cases.The characters of Bobby Lombard and his wife Zana make the novel work on several different levels. For one, Bobby is the vehicle through whom Dallas realizes that not all of her childhood memories are horrific. Though Bobby Lombard did nothing openly to stem his mother's abuse of her foster girls, he compensated by sneaking Eve food when Trudy punished her by withholding food. In looking backwards, Dallas's experience with the neighbor's boy's airskate foreshadows the tough-minded woman who is unafraid of taking physical shots in the performance of her duties. In remembering him, Eve recalls that what prompted her flight from Trudy Lombard's house was her failure to stand up for the boy, who had been kind to her, when Trudy Lombard falsely accused him of vandalism. For another, Bobby is also cause of Dallas's realizing that true love is not blind to the faults of the beloved. The ability to see the strengths and weaknesses, even the pettiness of the beloved is critical to the formation of a strong bond between a couple. Through Zana come some of the detours that add some measure of suspense, even drama, to this slow paced novel. The philosophical issue at the core of the novel is raised through the Lombard family; through them Robb forces her readers to question whether it is ever possible to say that one knows a person. Certainly, Bobby knows neither his mother nor his wife. This then raises the concomitant issue, if we cannot and do not know whom we love, then can we really love them?Though there are head feints to prevent the resolution of the crime, none is strong enough to counteract what Dallas's gut tells her about the identity of the murderer. Nevertheless, she cannot go on gut alone but must still build the case so that it leads to a sustainable arrest, must still has to follow the evidentiary trail and employ deductive reasoning to close the case.Through Dallas's insistence on standing for Trudy Lombard who abused the young Eve Dallas, Robb reveals the strength of character of both the protagonist and her husband Roarke. Even though Dallas despises Trudy and has no real enthusiasm for the case, she still pursues the investigation to its conclusion. This integrity in the face of provocation-the memories of abuse which would argue against Dallas pursuing Lombard's killer or rejoicing in her death-is reflected in Roarke who, though he would kill those who have harmed/would harm his wife, will not engage in action that would destroy Dallas and their relationship. This, integrity of character, then, points to their suitability for one another.Nevertheless, in the end, Dallas is almost despairing, which mood Robb builds through a judicious depiction of character, use of language and context. Other in Death novels have ended on a cheerier note; this one forces it. In the end, though, Robb has the wisdom to let her readers breathe, to relax a little after the high strung tension and ethical horror she depicts in Origin in Death.Great reading. Make sure and buy it."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"Because this book deals with Eve's past, it's less of a suspenseful police procedural than some of Robb's books. But all the classic trademarks of her writing are still here; excellent dialogue, great characters and interaction between them, well-done sense of place and, lest we forget, hot passion. Personally, I prefer cases where Eve's past is less involved, but that certainly doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading the series. These are definitely books I read as soon as I receive them."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"This was an interesting story blending Eve's past when she was a foster child, blackmail, Christmas celebration, and Eve's work troubles.What I considered interesting was the revelation of Eve's past as a foster child and how CPS failed to help a child in trouble and placed the child with Trudy, who was more of a professional money-collector than professional-mom for foster children.However, fitting to Christmas spirit, everything turns out well for Eve and Roarke, for Peabody and McNabb and all the other important and less important characters in this book. Also, it shows that even if you have had a horrible childhood and have bad memories, you can still turn out to be a good citizen and have a great life when you're grown up."},{"Title":"Memory in Death (In Death #22)","review":"I just want to say that this story is above and beyond the last two - Survivor & Origin. I enjoy all of the \\"In-Death\\" books but some are definitely better than others. \\"Memory\\" takes place in the year 2059 and it is about a week prior to Eve & Roarke's second Christmas together. Eve is totally caught off guard when one Trudy Lombard, Eve's foster care mother from when she was 9 years old, just shows up in her office at Cop Central. Needless to say, Trudy was one nasty foster care parent and Eve's memories of her are more like nightmares. Trudy tries to blackmail Eve into wangling $2,000,000 out of her husband under the pretext that she owes Trudy for taking care of her when she was a child (of course Trudy's idea of care was starvation and cold baths). When Eve throws her out of her office, she goes to Roarke. That little meeting in Roarke's office is really quite amusing. The story takes off from there as Trudy ends up dead in her hotel room and the rest is a who, why and how \\"done it,\\" leaving our favorite Lieutenant with more to accomplish during the holiday season than just shopping. The supporting characters are all here, Peabody, not much on McNab, however, they are off to Scotland for the holidays and Peabody is a little anxious about meeting McNab's family for the first time. Of course, Mira and Feeney are highlighted as well as Baxter and Truehart. We see Eve's character developing nicely. When Christmas finally does roll around, Eve doesn't even baulk at the elaborate gifts Roarke bestows upon her (a total change from her attitude in \\"Glory in Death\\"). Eve herself is quite the thoughtful gift-giver. As always, there is a lot of action and comedy and you can't help but laugh at Eve's way of looking at the world.

The novel follows a divergence where Joel either stay in Jersusalem and falls in love with an American, or goes back to Germany to revisit old wounds. Joel talks of revenge but only finds sad memory. The love story between Joel and Patricia seems totally unreal."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"If there is any doubt left that Graham Chapman could write effective comedy outside of his partnership with John Cleese, this delightful collection of unreleased scripts should do the trick. Sadly, unlike Cleese, Chapman could never get his solo projects truly off the starting blocks (we'll skip the sub-par flop that was YELLOWBEARD), and as a result he never had the solo success each of his fellow Pythons have enjoyed in various degrees. Nevertheless, this book is a vivid demonstration of the uncompromising comic spark Graham brought to Python and to Cleese's writing in particular. Without Chapman's brilliantly intuitive and raging insanity, Cleese's humor became safe, formulaic, smug and user-friendly (as in FIERCE CREATURES and -gulp! - WANDA). By the same token, Cleese's shrewd grasp of language and structure were sorely missing from Chapman's undisciplined, inaccessible and scattershot script for YELLOWBEARD. Still, if you're a fan of the blond, pipe-smoking doctor, this is a must-own. There are four separate pieces here, each compiled by Jim Yoakum, who collaborated with Graham on and off in the years before Chapman's death. Graham's longtime companion, David Sherlock, also offers commentary. &quot;Our Show For Ringo Starr,&quot; a TV special written by Chapman with Douglas Adams kicks things off, and it is by far the longest piece. It's awkward in places, but the best of it has a manic narrative feel that would not be out of place in a series four Python episode. The story concerns Ringo's adventures with a robot that behaves like an early version of Marvin the Paranoid Android. In fact, Adams recycled the B-Ark sequence from this script for one of his Hitchhiker books, &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.&quot; Ringo is mistakenly given powers by this robot, who confuses him with a Rinog Trars. The script is punctuated by proto videos featuring songs from Ringo's (so-so) album GOODNIGHT VIENNA. Some of it is very funny, but after a while the story begins to chase its own tail. The pilot script for &quot;Jake's Journey&quot; is next, and it is my favorite piece in the book. The story centers around an American teen who is sucked into a surreal adventure with a crusty old knight called Sir George (who comes across as a wised-up, more assured version of Chapman's King Arthur from &quot;Holy Grail&quot;). It has a warmth and gentleness that's unique for Chapman, whose humor was usually more aggressive and disturbing. He'd clearly come a long way since the &quot;The Undertaker Sketch&quot;. Graham wrote this with Sherlock, who no doubt played a hand in toning down his partner's excesses. It would have made an imaginative TV series, had CBS had the nuts to put it into their schedule (and Graham not had the gall to die from cancer). &quot;The Concrete Inspector,&quot; the script for a surreal short film, was mainly penned by Yoakum, but Chapman's touches are nevertheless distinctive. The 'It's technical' joke came directly from Terry Southern's novella MAGIC CHRISTIAN (the film version of which Chapman contributed material to). According to Yoakum, Chapman conjured a scene involving the unfolding of an &quot;actual size&quot; map of the Earth on his own. &quot;Concrete Inspector&quot; tells the story of a man who records cracks in concrete sidewalks. An original idea, but the story's shaggy dog aspects (what's the deal with that pink cabinet anyway?) don't really come off. Frankly, this reads like more of a Yoakum solo project than a true collaboration with Chapman. Finally, there's &quot;Tonight: VD&quot;, a short sketch in which a TV announcer tries to dispell myths regarding sexual diseases, only to be cut off by TV censors. Oddly, the collection omits the script from OUT OF THE TREES, Chapman's one-shot BBC comedy special from 1976. It's a shame, for sketches like &quot;Peony&quot; and &quot;Ghengis Khan&quot; (penned with Douglas Adams and Bernard McKenna) would fit in perfectly here. All in all, a mixed bag, but as Chapman's output (barring LIAR'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY) is the most obscure of all the Python alumni, it's a godsend to all of us fans who wondered just what happened to him after YELLOWBEARD."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"I never knew Graham Chapman (the mad man of Monty Python) had written so much stuff! This book is a treasure trove for any Python fan, or for anybody who just likes funny scripts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"This book shows quite clearly exactly what Chapman's role in Python was: to show up late, do very little work, but contribute one or two outrageously out-there ideas to really stir things up. The Our Show For Ringo Starr script (too bad this was never produced!) reads much more like Douglas Adams than Python, but with occasional bizarre Chapmanisms to keep things interesting (and completely absurd.) The rest of the book echoes things that Chapman has worked on before, and even includes a few lines lifted directly from Python sketches. All that said, however, the book was a bracing, inspiring read -- a refreshing blast of insanity that makes for great (easy) (...) browsing."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered 'Ojril-The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman', but as a lifelong Pythonphile, I was interested by any original content from Graham.Essentially, this is a book of unpublished and unproduced scripts written by Chapman with others, notably Douglas Adams. Including the very short \\"VD\\", \\"Jake's Journey\\", a pilot for an American sitcom written immediately prior to Graham's death, the odd conceptual piece \\"The Concrete Inspector\\", and the hilarious highlight of the book written in collaboration with the equally offbeat Douglas Adams, \\"Our Show For Ringo Starr\\", which was a avant-garde script for an hour long TV show promoting Ringo's then current album \\"Goodnight Vienna\\". (The best line is when Ringo gets to say: \\"The concept of a four-dimensional space-time continuum inevitably suggests that the universe looks like a prawn omelette.\\") I found \\"Jake's Journey\\" a bit tedious and formulaic, and the Ringo piece utterly brilliant, with everything else falling somewhere in between. Also of great use to the collector is a 'Chapmanography' of videos, recordings and books in which Graham somehow contributed.This book is a very quick read, and I recommend it to people interested in Graham or Monty Python, just realize that it really isn't a biographical work as much as a set of quirky skits."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"Let's face it: Graham Chapman was weird.Which isn't to say he made no sense. I'm sure he made perfect sense to himself and other alcoholics, but a lot of times he was just plain weird. Still, it's fun to step into his mind just simply because you never know what you'll find. Never predictable, always unexpected, if you ever enjoyed Monty Python you'll enjoy this unique look at Graham's unpublished work. Personally as a Pythonite, I relished and adored it. But even a casual fan will appreciate the unusual sketches and bits that this gem contains.Pick it up. Read it twice. You won't understand all of it, but laugh, because you're not alone."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"What we have here is two interesting Chapman scripts padded out to book length with a few bag-of-a-fag-packet unfunny 'sketches' and some poorly reproduced photographs. Graham Chapman was a comedy legend but his memory is not well-served when the so-called 'Graham Chapman Archives' throw stuff together like this to make a quick buck.The book is worth getting if you're a Python completist for the early 1970s unproduced Ringo Star Show script co-written with Douglas Adams and for the unbroadcast pilot of Jake's Journey, but the rest of the book is so much wasted trees. And that's 'worth getting' but not 'worth buying at full price'. Fortunately the book was very swiftly remaindered on both sides of the Atlantic.The presentation is tatty in the extreme, including a mistake-ridden filmography copied verbatim from the internet and a grainy photo of the Pythons positioned in suuch a way that Chapman himself is invisible in the fold between pages! There's almost no context, no actual stills from Jake's Journey, nothing of any value beyond the two main scripts themselves. The other sketches are short, unfunny nothings written when Chapman was very ill and don't deserve to see print, but evidently the 'Chapman Archives' from where this stuff originates is rather sparse when it comes to good, publishable stuff.What a shame that Chapman's papers have ended up in the possession of someone who neither knows anything about him nor knows how to edit a book."},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"This is a really funny book. No kidding. Really funny. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Why doesn't some clever producer snap up these sketches and put them on TV then we'd be spared another season full of dreck!"},{"Title":"Ojril: The Completely Incomplete Graham Chapman","review":"If the author's track record is any indication, he'll be primed and ready for the 10 metre run in Australia. Just keep up those morning wind sprints, watch your grammar and stay in the margins. Still receiving transmissions and manuscripts from the beyond, this book manages to keep the completely dead (though not completely recognized as dead) Graham Chapman alive. How does he do it? Mirrors? Ventriloquism? Necrophilia? If I know Jim, he is using all of those writing techniques. After all, making a long deceased person type their own memoirs is a little tricky (not to mention smelly) so we have Jim to thank for putting these things to paper and letting Graham do the resting (and mouldering). Several pages into the book you will realize there are several more to be read... and you will hungrily devour each morsel (in keeping with the spirit of the Undertakers sketch). Add this book to your collection of Jim's Python writings and you'll be the envy of your friends and their friends as well. Display it proudly on national holidays and freely quote from it in social situations and at business meetings. Make it your own. Love it."},{"Title":"The Auditory System: Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Correlates","review":"Auditory Disorders covers the anatomy and physiology of the auditory system in a fair amount of detail while clearly explaining the clinical correlates we see in audiology. It isn't the most detailed auditory physiology textbook (it's not Pickles!) but in this text the authors have been hugely successful in bridging the sometimes mystifying gap between anatomy/physiology and what appears on an audiogram/tympanometry/OAEs/ABRs etc. In addition to the usual peripheral, brainstem and auditory cortex physiology, it also includes sections on vascular anatomy, the corpus collosum and the efferent system. Used as a companion to more detailed physiology texts and lectures, it has provided me with a far deeper understanding and appreciation of how the auditory system works and why we get the results we do with audiological assessment. I wish I'd had this book in my first year to help my understanding of auditory anatomy and physiology, but I'm finding it incredibly useful in my second - particularly in preparation for comprehensive clinical exams. Unfortunately, in the copy I received the production values were extremely poor (especially the resolution of the images - and p103 has part of the text obscured by what looks like a post-it left on the printer) - but the contents are worth it."},{"Title":"The Auditory System: Anatomy, Physiology, and Clinical Correlates","review":"This book was in great condition and arrived in a timely matter. I am fully satisfied with this seller. Keep up the great work."},{"Title":"Software Quality: State of the Art in Management, Testing, and Tools","review":"The first two parts of this 3-part book are a collection of monographs and essays on software quality management and certification and testing topics. The third part is devoted to software quality and testing tools.Since I am more interested in processes and techniques I focused more on the first two parts, which were truly state-of-the-art with respect to subject matter and approach.Among Part I's highlights were the essays on knowledge and quality management, and cost benefit models for quality assurance. Other essays (paradigms of software quality management and software development, and process-oriented software quality management) were well written and filled with original thinking, but this ground has been covered by so many authors that my interest waned.Part II, Certification and Testing, had an excellent essay on testing web and e-business applications that I particularly liked. If you are in the embedded or safety-critical development and QA environment, the essay on certifying and testing these systems is definitely worthwhile.This 288 page book is copiously illustrated with 99 figures and 14 tables. If you are looking for a book on software testing this is not it. It is best suited for advanced SQA practitioners and academics. If you are among that group it is a worthwhile read and will give you fresh ideas and keep you up-to-date in your professional reading. For the audience I cited it is a five star book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"I found this book to be an useful photographic guide to the battlefield of Gettysburg. The text appears to be well written and I enjoyed the comparsion photos between how the battlefield look back then compared to modern time. There have been comparison made between this book and William A. Frassanito's Gettysburg: A Journey in Time. I think both books got a lot of merit. Difference lies in presentation. Frassanito's book is all in black and white. Eicher's book got color photos. I liked color photos since it gives a more \\"modern\\" look in comparison to the old. Many of the color photos seem to be pretty well shot as well. It would be great if we can somehow combined both books together. I think both books supplement each other very nicely.Eicher's book got a lot of flak for some its numerous errors and typos. I supposed most readers can overlook that to a certain degrees. But the critics is right about one thing, that isn't Joshua Chamberlain above his name. Its rather surprising that this author would make such an error since Chamberlain is well known thanks to that movie. As for the photo sizes, yes they are rather on the small size. I can lived with it but I wondered why they were arranged in such a way?But overall, this book proves to be well worth the time and effort for anyone interested in the Gettysburg campaign.

How could someone writing a book of this sort not know that he had two of the exact same photo? How can there be two different moderns?P.139 The map key places the fighting at Devil's Den and Little Round Top at least a mile away from where it took place.P.142 In speculating that this image is among the last recorded by Gardner's crew at Gettysburg, the date given is July 6, 1863. Yet, elsewhere in the book, Gardner views are dated as late as July 9 (p.78).P.143 The two images were not recorded from different angles. They are the same angle but with different cameras.P.145 Photographer (Gardner), location of the image (crest of LRT) and month (July) of both images are all known. All are listed as questionable or \\"unknown\\" in the book. Incredibly the famous \\"Warren Rock\\" and the distinctive tree next to it appear in the image on the right.P.146 The photo labeled as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is in fact it is a photo of General Edwin Stoughton.

What's going on here?When I read these reviews, I marveled that so many people could see the same thing so differently. Naturally I had to buy this book to find out for myself.Frassanito set the standard, no question, and Eicher gives great deference to him throughout, but Frassanitos work is not without fault. His \\"modern\\" pictures are always irritatingly taken ten steps to the left or fiften to the right instead of precisely where the original photographer stood. His theory about the soldier being drug uphill to the snipers den pretty well put him on the map, but compelling new evidence now indicates O'Sullivan drug the soldier downhill to prevent Waud from scooping him in Harpers Weekly. My point is that nobody's perfect and nobody \\"owns\\" Gettysburg's history.I loved the \\"modern\\" color shots in Eicher's book as well as his obvious attempt to position his camera in exactly the same location as his counterpart. The mini-essays by the notible scholars added greatly.It's obvious to me that there is something going on of which I'm not aware. No one without a grudge, an ulterior motive or a pecuniary interest would ever give this book one star. It's way too good for that.The small pictures and the numerous tickey-tac errors are legitimate criticisms however, and anyone with a serious interest in Gettysburg couldn't, in all honesty, give it five stars either.My advice: Buy it used for $15 and you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"I've been reading on the Civil War for more than 40 years, yet I do not claim to be an expert. I like to think of myself as just an average 'joe' who has several Civil War discharges hanging on the wall from relatives. So I read to learn about those times and events, and also to gain understanding into what made members on both sides of our family put on Union blue, costing 5 lives on my mother's side of the family.I've read the other reviews here and know nothing of the politics or discrediting, or errors contained within this volume. I purchased this volume and would not ask for the money back, I am satisfied. Further I have several other photographic volumes, including all of William Frassanito's, and can state for myself that I've yet to see a better overall compilation concerning Gettysburg. Some have complained of the small size of photos, well many years back when acquiring the 6-volume set of THE IMAGE OF WAR: 1861-1865, I purchased a magnifying glass and have no problem putting it to use where this Gettysburg volume is concerned.As far as typos or incorrect information goes, does there exist any book ever published that is a complete and correct one without errors. I have found that today's editing is not as good as it once was, and I believe desktop publishing to be the culprit. Also, after spending 12 years in college, I'm certain not all editors graduated at the top of their class.I will no doubt come in for my share of criticism concerning this review, but I rhetorically have to ask, \\"What more could the average person expect from a volume this size on a subject as vast as Gettysburg?\\"Existing errors not withstanding, this is an admirable effort by the author, and a very worthwhile volume.

Eicher's modern photographs are masterful, and his excellent, elegant writing does much to underscore the wonderful photographic presentation.

Some of the criticisms from other reviewers are justified but it does have its place in the mushrooming collection of titles on Gettysburg. While it doesn't replace William Frassanito's excellent photographic books, it performs a useful service for Gettysburg buffs by bringing a large number of old photographs from many sources together between two covers. Also, Eicher has added many photos he has taken himself which are helpful in identifying the present sites shown in the historical photographs. Its text does not rate its self-anointed accolade of \\"Definitive\\" and its maps of troop movements are not as clear as those found in many other books. Though the book is not up to Eicher's usual high standards, it does provide battlefield visitors with the convenience of having a great deal of helpful illustrative material in one volume."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"First saw this book at a bed and breakfast in Gettysburg and knew I had to have it.

Some of it may be due to the fact that my great-great-grandfather fought there and was wounded on the second day of fighting in the Wheatfield. In touring Gettysburg today, it's often difficult to get a feel for just how bad the carnage was. Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History by David J. Eicher is probably the best means to see Gettysburg through the eyes of Civil War soldiers.Eicher includes hundreds of photographs that show scenes from Gettysburg, both before the battle and immediately afterward. But then he also includes modern day photos taken of the same locations from the same angles. These before and after pictures are haunting. It is hard to look at the peaceful Devil's Den of today and imagine the violence that occurred there. Eicher also includes dozens of maps as well as portraits of key figures.What makes Gettysburg Battlefield more than just a picture book is the commentary. In addition to Eicher's own narrative, he includes 15 different essays from 14 guest Gettysburg experts. Eicher was looking for little known stories about this famous battle. There were two that I found interesting. One involved the NY 45th Infantry. Many of these German-Americans were captured and then transported to Southern prisons. Their monument is off the beaten path next to a soccer field. Another recounts the saga of The God Tree--one of a dozen witness trees that still survive from 1863.One thing kept me from giving Gettysburg Battlefield five stars, and that is that fact that there are a number of errors. But overall, the photographs are the main reason I purchased this book and they alone are well worth the expense. This truly is a \\"visual remembrance.\\""},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"This is a very helpful work to the earnest student of the American Civil War. The author wrestled with his own personal feelings in many of his battle observations, but did a commendable job of not straying far from the facts of the fight.The research in the book would lead one to agree with the notion that Robert E. Lee had a singular objective throughout the battle. That was to attack and break the Union center. The wisdom of this strategy has been debated for 140 years. The most definitive source for this argument is not in any postwar work, but in Lee's personal battle report. The report can be viewed at the National Archives.This book eloquently moves through the major battles of the 3 days on Pennsylvania farmland that forever changed our nation.This is a must book for any visitor to the park.

There's a great use of typography and white space not often seen in historical publications of this nature. But perhaps there's a reason for that...This is a great example of a book's design taking precedence over its subject matter. While the grid use and minimalist photo treatment is stylish and contemporary, it's not conducive to this particular audience--an audience expecting to enjoy larger, more detailed photographs and content.I don't entirely blame the designer for the book's failure, either--it was a mistake for the publisher to call it &quot;Definitive&quot;, when it truly isn't. This only makes the design flaw more glaring.Students of design may find the book more interesting than Civil War buffs.

Excellent book and you know it!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"Back in 2003, I noticed this book at a local bookshop (in Australia). I flicked through it and was dutifully impressed by the colour shots of the Gettysburg battlefield.What I did not know was that a scandal had erupted in America over this book. And those pretty photos are the crux of it. Mr Eicher is an astronomy-magazine editor who has no credentials to write about the Civil War. More to the point, most of those oh-so pretty photos of the Gettysburg battlefield are in fact PIRATED.The legendary William Frassanito is known for expending much sweat and trouble over identifying where historical photos of the G'burg battlefield were taken, and how far they may have been staged. Mr Frassanito notified the world, pretty soon after publication, that many of the photos in Eicher's book were pirated from his own book; in fact, they were scanned directly from them.The scandal reached the point where Mr James Macpherson asked that his name be taken off the cover of the book; the Gettysburg bookshops refuse to stock Eicher's book; and several persons contributing scholarly articles to the book wrote asking to be excised.If you search for \\"scandal of Eicher\\" online you will find a link to a site detailing Mr Eicher's egregious piracy. Quite apart from the inaccuracies in the book pointed out by another reviewer, the scandal ought to be widely known in order that nobody inadvertantly give up good money for a book that breaches so many copyright laws and leeches off the hard work of Mr Frassanito and others.I know that the book is superficially beautiful and those colour photos look grand. I thought so myself. But this scandal, coupled with the appalling inaccuracy of the text, should surely convince anyone to look elsewhere for a source about this battle."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"I have been to Gettysburg a number of times and am always interested in another interpretation of the battle and battlefield. This is a very good book in that regard, even definitive."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"I have visited the Gettysburg battlefield on numerous occaisions. Everytime that I'm there I bring with me many, many photographs from Brady, Gardner etc. As a result, after hours and hours of exploration, I've been able to recreate 'then and now' photos that are far more accurate than what this book offers. The 'now' photos in this book are not lined up accurately with the 'then' photos. Sure, it is the same area, but with a little extra effort they certainly could have recreated the angles that Brady, Gardner, etc. had shot from. Yet, while the photos are definatley disappointing, this book still provides a wealth of information about the Battlefield. I'm sure that any novice will enjoy this book. If you really want to see what it looks like now, however, you will need to go there for yourself, or explore more specific works."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"Eicher has done a mostly superb job despite a few errors here and there. The Chamberlain one has been pointed out, and in Ted Alexander's essay on the first Union soldier to die at Gettysburg, he points out that a Cpl. William Rihl of the New York Lincoln Cavalry was killed at Fleming's farm on June 22, 1863 in action with Jenkins' Confederate Cavalry.On the other hand, the masterful Noah Andre Trudeau in his: \\"Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage\\" notes that Private George Sandoe, of Captain Robert Bell's Pennsylvania cavalry squadron, was the first to die at Gettysburg, killed on the 26th,on the town's western outskirts, while valiantly trying to stop the onslaught of Lige White's cavalry, attached to John Gordon's division of Jubal Early's corps.I have always been intrigued by the story of Bell's little cavalry squadron, which tried to stop Gordon's initial march into the town, and was scattered for its efforts. Bell and his men seem to drop off the pages of history, save for Trudeau's work.Eicher also seems to subscribe to the same criticisms of Alfred Pleasonton (the Union Cavalry commander)that Edward Longacre, and more recent historians have seem to suggest. Still Pleasonton performed very capably and competent when he was allowed to by Meade. Meade didn't like cavalry, and as an engineer officer inspecting and improving lighthouses along America's eastern coast before the war, had developed a dislike for Pleasonton's father, a government bureacrat. Simply stated, Pleasonton didn't not have the slack that Phil Sheridan had, later on, under Grant. Eicher also suggests that the doomed Elon Farnsworth never received his Brigadier General commission when he was killed in Kilpatrick's senseless cavalry charge in the vicinity of the Round Tops immediately following Pickett's repulse. When nearly all other sources, including Longacre, suggested that he had.The Cavalry actions on the third day are as usual, minimally covered. The brisk fight between Custer and Stuart so recently well-covered in Tom Carhart's \\"Last Triumph\\" at least rates an two-page essay. The Farnsworth charge only merits two paragraphs.Eicher was wise to invite fellow Civil War Historians to provide a number of very well-written essays, and while all of them are exceptional, the beginning one written by James McPherson, arguably our greatest living historian, is a compelling one that urges all Americans who love their history to visit the Gettysburg Battlefield and get that sense of what is was like then.Photograph choices are very, very good. Some of Eicher's photographs could have easily been taken by anyone with a Kodak instamatic and a good printer, but overall they still convey very well the now as opposed to the then. Many of the \\"old\\" photographs collected seem to have been printed with a deliberately \\"grainy\\" image - note the photo of Buford and his staff, or the remarkable one of Lee near the beginning of the book. I happen to like the effect; some other readers might not.Well-worth it as an addition to your Civil War bookshelf if purchased at amazon's nice bargain price, and as another reviewer said, would blend in well if you have artifacts of the battle, as I do. Still, I wouldn't pay the full or the paperback price."},{"Title":"Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History","review":"The book is very well done. The pictures are great.

Theprospective reader also needs to beware the maps in thiscreation. For example, the 3-D map of the area of Pickett'sCharge on July 3rd shows the &quot;Copse of Trees&quot; severalhundred feet south of its actual position; it is shown as being south of Hall's, Harrow's, and even Stannard's brigades, instead of in its actual position.

How many Americans know that quite a number of women disguised themselves as men to fight in the War of Independence, as well as the American Civil War?)In this thoroughly researched, highly readable account, Professor Alfred F. Young ferrets through myth, slander, and forgotten facts to recreate Deborah Sampson Gannett; a young woman who, disguised as a man, served in the Light Infantry Company of the Fourth Massachusetts Regiment, and as a waiter to General John Patterson. (She later married, bore three children, adopted a fourth, and was her family's primary breadwinner!)While I expect an Emeritus Professor of History at Northern Illinois University (and a Senior Research Fellow at the Newberry Library in Chicago) to be thorough and attentive to detail, what kept me reading this book from cover to cover was the way he brought Deborah to life, imagining her out of an enormous pile of fact and hearsay. He has also portrayed enriching details of post-colonial New England that round out the biography.Initially, I ordered this book as background research for my novels. It surpassed my expectations on many levels, and I refer to it often. If you enjoy American History and/or Women's Studies, Young's \\"Masquerade\\" is an obvious choice.But what relevance does it have for the average reader in today's world? The author sums it up when describing the import and effect of the Deborah Sampson statue outside the public library in Sharon, Massachusetts.\\"Do you have to disguise yourself as someone other than who you are, to do what you want to do in life? Do you have to pretend in order to cross a forbidden boundary?\\"Happily, most 21st century Americans can answer no. But Deborah Sampson Gannett, who fought in the war for our independence could not say the same. And neither can millions of women living in other parts of the world.We've come a long way, baby. But somehow, I can't relax.Star-Crossed"},{"Title":"Masquerade: The Life and Times of Deborah Sampson, Continental Soldier","review":"Excellent book for anyone who is interested in a woman of Revolutionary War times who is mentioned in student history books and for whom there has been very little research previously published. I found Youngs discussion of how he arrived at his conclusions very interesting and I am not a history major. For someone who is not interested in that type of detail it would be easy to skim those sections and just find out about her life. It would also give people who have previously read other books or articles about Deborah Samson an opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of that material. I also would not be surprised if some of those who think they are not interested in historical research methods might find after reading the book they are more interested than they thought."},{"Title":"Masquerade: The Life and Times of Deborah Sampson, Continental Soldier","review":"Deborah Sampson was not the only female who passed as a male and served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionay War, but her ruse was the most successful, and she bacame the most celebrated female soldier of the era. In this book, Young masterfully presents Sampson's story, peeling away the layers of mythology (many constructed by Sampson hersef) to reveal the truly remarkable life beneath. Young's engagement with the sources and deep knowledge of the historical and social context of Sampson's masquerade(s) make this a model of the historian's craft. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the craft of history, or in Revolutionary America generally."},{"Title":"Masquerade: The Life and Times of Deborah Sampson, Continental Soldier","review":"Masquerade is structured like a lawyer's brief, but reads like a mystery. Young peels back the layers of mythology, shows how a real historian assesses information, then describes his findings in an engaging way, never going beyond the evidence (don't you hate historians, who, trying to gain an audience, fill their writing with undocumented assumptions and adjectives). I found myself wanting to keep turning the pages to find out what next nugget Young discovers in separating truth from fiction. This isn't just a book for feminist historians; it's a book for anyone who likes a well-written mystery. A wonderful, absorbing book, with meticulous endnotes."},{"Title":"Die Broke : A Radical 4-Part Personal Finance Plan to Restore Your Confidence Increase Your Net Worth and Afford the Lifestyle of Your Dreams (Cassette)","review":"Die Broke is an extremely seductive book.

He was immediately hooked, and, has already begun to change his way of spending, thinking, and doing. Just last week, he was thinking of buying the paper edition to reinforce what he listened to!Generally, I don't do well with audio-books (or even the written financial word), but, this one is worth picking up in any form.My Dad raised me on many of the same practices and principles preached within, and I couldn't agree more with the concept of; dying broke, paying cash, and giving now!, instead of leaving it later."},{"Title":"Die Broke : A Radical 4-Part Personal Finance Plan to Restore Your Confidence Increase Your Net Worth and Afford the Lifestyle of Your Dreams (Cassette)","review":"This is the ultimate demonstration of GIGO (garbage in; garbage out). They start with defining all readers as a stereotypical babyboomer husband and wife team who are so work driven they get nothing out of life. Authors as lawyer-savior-savant advise them to quit their jobs, or at least think as if they quit, tear up their credit cards and work the rest of their lives while spending all they have and dying broke. Not every baby boomer, much less average American, is what they describe as the party to whom they are giving advice. While there is good advice in some of the book, the idea of proceeding from a stereotypical description of a person leads to a conclusion that might be of value only to that stereotypical person. The conclusions and advice given cannot apply to most people, much less all people. There remain in the society hard workers and slackers; brain surgeons and dullards; computer programmers and ditch diggers; driven producers and fourth generation welfare recipients. Ovbiously, this book is not for food stamp recipients or clients of the welfare system. Never the less there is good advice that is worth taking and understanding. The credit card system, whereby one obligates himself to pay without the pain of shelling out hard earned cash, allows one to build debt without feeling it. This book is really for those much too busy to read it."},{"Title":"Die Broke : A Radical 4-Part Personal Finance Plan to Restore Your Confidence Increase Your Net Worth and Afford the Lifestyle of Your Dreams (Cassette)","review":"My opinion of this book changed a few times while I was reading it.First, I thought that this book was pretty good in that it gives a &quot;radical&quot; new approach to personal finance. I enjoyed this book because of this. It takes a topic that can be very vanilla in its ways, and gives a brand new thought process. I guarantee you that you will see some ideas that totally contradict what other personal finance consultants would say. For example, the author actually makes an argument for leasing instead of buying a car. Seeing that argument was a first for me, especially in this type of book.Then, the author became very repetitive, and actually started to use examples and paragraphs that were previously used in this book. This was quite annoying.Finally, the book finished it's 4 part radical plan, and began to add commentary about various topics in personal finance. After being annoyed, this section kind of got me back on track. Again, it was interesting to read opinions that were not necessarily mainstream, on topics that have been discussed to death in other books.Overall, I would say that people should give this book a try. Beware of the redundancy, and go in with an open mind.You won't read about having to live under your means, or about how accumulate the most wealth to give to your heirs. Instead, you will see how to make the most of you money, live at your means, die broke, and leave people a minimal estate. Through the use of annuities, insurance, and reverse mortgages, one can have money till the day they die. However, the book does come up short when it talks about actually implementing this program. For example, there was no mention on the typical price of an annuity, nor how one would actually purchase these annuities with a minimal savings account. If it was mentioned, it was given the justice it deserved.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Die Broke : A Radical 4-Part Personal Finance Plan to Restore Your Confidence Increase Your Net Worth and Afford the Lifestyle of Your Dreams (Cassette)","review":"Die Broke is an extremely seductive book.

Decades later he finally did. This book stands out from every of life of Christ becuase the author was not only talented but extremely serious about history. Ricciotti explains how Israel was structured, how Herod and the Romans ran it and the hierachy of the Israelite politcal and religious powers. He never makes the mistake of putting words in Jesus's mouth that aren't biblical and he never tries to force the life of Christ into modern clothes. This book will make history lovers happy, archaeologists will enjoy it and anyone who looks at wonder at that One Solitary Life will love it. Sadly, this valubale book is out of print and you may have to track it down at a used book store but it's worth the effort. I read my copy one or twice a year."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"Despite being 60 years old and long out of print, Abbot Ricciotti's Life of Christ is the best I have ever read. I first read in college a few years back and it changed everything I thought I knew about the New Testament. His scholarship is simply amazing and his faith is evident on every page, but the most amazing thing about this book is that it is so down-to-earth and readable. He doesn't use obtuse theological terms or cloud his thoughts in philosophical hair-splitting, but writes clearly, simply, and logically. The chapter entitled \\"Rationalist Interpretations of the Life of Christ\\" is the best debunking of modern New Testament scholarship I have ever read and is worth reading on its own. His explanations of the differences between the four Gospel accounts is both illuminating and intelligent, and his defense of their authenticity makes far more sense than any of the complicated theories I wasted so much time learning in Catholic high school and college. I highly recommend this book or any others by the the same author. By the way, it IS available new from Roman Catholic Books."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"This is one of the most treasured books on my shelves. I came across it in a used bookstore, and in the years that I have owned it, I have referred to it time and again. It has often helped me in my apologetic efforts. This is a scholarly apologetic and historical work containing a wealth of useful and faith-strengthening information. Judging from this book alone, Riccioti strikes me as a man with a deep love of scripture, as well as a strong belief in it's divine inspiration. I could hardly be more pleased with this book."},{"Title":"The life of Christ","review":"CBS' special on the origins of the Christmas celebration and interviews with experts on Palestine at the time of the birth of Jesus impelled me to start re-reading Ricciotti's Life of Christ. Ricciotti drew on exhaustive historical data: virtually every cited fact is footnoted to original historical sources, frequently giving the Greek or Latin text of the original. Ricciotti objectively examines each textual controversy in the Gospels, yet never relaxes his own certitude. Every Christian should read this finest example of historical apologetics."},{"Title":"A Capital Offense","review":"Faith in Jesus enables a widow to fight gambling interests and the destruction of her husband's reputation in the mystery-thriller, A Capital Offense by Gary Parker.

For just general reading I would recommend Gordon's An Empire of Wealth but for others looking to teach or do an independent study this is a must. It clearly lays out all the developments in our economy very carefully and does a wonderful job of discussing current and relevant literature so you can specialize in the areas that you wish to look at further."},{"Title":"American Economic History (6th Edition)","review":"For what it aims to accomplish, this is a first-rate book. Cain (who took over authorship in a prior editions after Hughes untimely death) aims to provide a comprehensive, chronologically arranged narrative and analysis of American economic growth from the Colonial period to the present. The intent is to reach a broad audience and Cain writes clearly, avoids use of a lot of technical language, introduces basic economic concepts as needed, and is very good at explaining relatively abstruse questions. Book production is very good and a strength of this volume. The narrative writing is very strong, there is abundant use of clear and well chosen tables and charts to illustrate many important points and issues. There are a number of nice illustrations in each chapter. Cain does a particularly nice job of providing useful bibliographies and sets of references for further reading.One of the best things about this book is the broad spectrum of issues and analyses discussed. What might be considered the core issues of economic growth, patterns of trade, financial history, and other more purely economic topics are covered extremely well. In addition, there are a number of excellent and interesting sections on important related topics such as the importance and evolution of the American legal system, demographic changes, history of technology, and good coverage of specific and sometimes controversial issues such as the economics of slavery. Cain does a nice job of discussing the history of some controversies.While relatively minor, there are some defects. The narrative, while generally strong, is sometimes a bit historically tone-deaf. Its not, for example, really accurate to refer to the dynastic states of 17th century France and Spain as nation-states. In his discussion of the late 19th and early 20th century, Cain tends to lump together the Progressive and Populist movements. As is common with a lot of economists, Cain has a tendency to treat market relationships as normative, which has a bit of circular flavor. Nonentheless, this is a really useful and enjoyable book."},{"Title":"American Economic History (6th Edition)","review":"This book is very good with the history of the economy from the start of the colonies to the present but does not cover all that I need for my class so I have had to borrwo from my instructor another book."},{"Title":"Tavern of the seas","review":"\\"Cape Town: Tavern of the Seas\\" by Lawrence Green is a South African classic and was first published in 1948. The book covers a range of folksy subjects like the wines of the Cape, Table Mountain, the Atlantic coast, Cape Town carnivals, the streets, canals and shops, the story of Simon's Town and Seal Island, Table Bay, local shipwrecks, blatjang and sambals, the Cape Flats and so on. It's a collection of stories of the Cape Town of yesteryear and if you love the old South Africa of the Afrikaner and the early English settlers, you'll love this book. Something more than 50,000 copies were printed (not including the number sold to those South African provincial Education Departments who adopted the book) so it's generally easily available second hand.Here's some quotes from reviews of the book when it was reissued:Pretoria News: \\"The book is the best known of Green's works and is a celebration of Cape Town , characterised by the nostalgia of memory fading into oblivion. Green remembers the last of the old square-rigged whalers that came to Cape Town when he was a boy. \`Tickey beer', was already only a wistful memory but the tickey still survived. Now the tickey itself is gone and almost forgotten. Green traces the makers of fish horns, already a dying breed. Now the fish horn has fallen silent and only a dwindling minority still remember \`Snoektown calling'.\\"Volksblad-Bloomfontein: \\"Cape Town and its people live in Green's writings. This book is about the Cape and especially about the romanticism during the 1947 period, the year the book was first published. Green's name is well known amongst Capetonians. Tavern of the Seas is full of anecdotal stories and descriptions with a vast historical background. It captures the colonial spirit and the enthusiasm of the people during the period when the British Royalty visited SA in 1948 and this was a major news story. The south-westers, whales, wine, food, plants and animals, places like Table Mountain, Constantia, Falsebay and the Cape Flats, and obviously the people of the Cape live in this book.\\"The Star-Johannesburg: \\"There was a time when a row of Lawrence Green's books seemed obligatory in almost every B&B; and holiday home. Chatty, easy reads that could be dipped into for a quick half an hour, they provided a familiar retrospect of this country's history. Cape Town: Tavern of the Seas, first published in 1948 and ending up with some 50 000 copies in print was perhaps the best known, and it is a pleasure to find this reprinted. May many more follow.\\"Farmers Weekly: \\"This isn't just a piece of Africana, it's a book that helped to keep South Africa on the world stage and as such is part of our intellectual history and heritage. Another one we should be grateful to Galago for keeping alive.\\"Lawrence George Green was an English South African travel writer, who wrote prolificly on the Southern African region. Green was from all accounts a charming man and he was certainly a prolific writer. With his death in 1972 and the collapse of the publishing house almost all his books were issued by, Howard Timmins, shortly before this, the book went out of print and has remained so for more than two decades before being reissued by Galapago Press. This book and his other works are considered valuable literary depictions of life in the Cape and other areas of Southern Africa.On a personal note, I bought my copy of this book in South Africa back in the mid-1990's along with a fairly large collection of his other books. All of them are beautifully written, a good entertaining read and you pick up some weird and wonderful bits of arcane history and information that you won't find anywhere else. They ARE kindof folksy in a South African kind of way, they're certainly not PC but they ARE a good record of the early South Africa of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

Something more than 50,000 copies were printed (not including the number sold to those South African provincial Education Departments who adopted the book) so it's generally easily available second hand.Here's some quotes from reviews of the book when it was reissued:Pretoria News: \\"The book is the best known of Green's works and is a celebration of Cape Town , characterised by the nostalgia of memory fading into oblivion. Green remembers the last of the old square-rigged whalers that came to Cape Town when he was a boy. \`Tickey beer', was already only a wistful memory but the tickey still survived. Now the tickey itself is gone and almost forgotten. Green traces the makers of fish horns, already a dying breed. Now the fish horn has fallen silent and only a dwindling minority still remember \`Snoektown calling'.\\"Volksblad-Bloomfontein: \\"Cape Town and its people live in Green's writings. This book is about the Cape and especially about the romanticism during the 1947 period, the year the book was first published. Green's name is well known amongst Capetonians. Tavern of the Seas is full of anecdotal stories and descriptions with a vast historical background. It captures the colonial spirit and the enthusiasm of the people during the period when the British Royalty visited SA in 1948 and this was a major news story. The south-westers, whales, wine, food, plants and animals, places like Table Mountain, Constantia, Falsebay and the Cape Flats, and obviously the people of the Cape live in this book.\\"The Star-Johannesburg: \\"There was a time when a row of Lawrence Green's books seemed obligatory in almost every B&B; and holiday home. Chatty, easy reads that could be dipped into for a quick half an hour, they provided a familiar retrospect of this country's history. Cape Town: Tavern of the Seas, first published in 1948 and ending up with some 50 000 copies in print was perhaps the best known, and it is a pleasure to find this reprinted. May many more follow.\\"Farmers Weekly: \\"This isn't just a piece of Africana, it's a book that helped to keep South Africa on the world stage and as such is part of our intellectual history and heritage. Another one we should be grateful to Galago for keeping alive.\\"Lawrence George Green was an English South African travel writer, who wrote prolificly on the Southern African region. Green was from all accounts a charming man and he was certainly a prolific writer. With his death in 1972 and the collapse of the publishing house almost all his books were issued by, Howard Timmins, shortly before this, the book went out of print and has remained so for more than two decades before being reissued by Galapago Press. This book and his other works are considered valuable literary depictions of life in the Cape and other areas of Southern Africa.On a personal note, I bought my copy of this book in South Africa back in the mid-1990's along with a fairly large collection of his other books. All of them are beautifully written, a good entertaining read and you pick up some weird and wonderful bits of arcane history and information that you won't find anywhere else. They ARE kindof folksy in a South African kind of way, they're certainly not PC but they ARE a good record of the early South Africa of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Not to everyone's taste, but I like 'em."},{"Title":"Headed for a hearse","review":"Jonathan Latimer is one of the lesser know great detective genre writers from the 30's and 40's. This is a shame, since he deserves to be better known. HEADED FOR A HEARSE was his second novel, and like the first (MURDER IN THE MADHOUSE) it starred an alcoholic, wise cracking Private Eye named Bill Crane. Despite drinking enough to kill a lesser man, Crane usually found time to use what brain cells were left to him to figure out complex, mysterious crimes, and to flirt with the \\"usual suspects\\".In this second of what would be a series of novels, Crane is hired by a millionaire on death row to try to prove his innocence. The only problem is that there are only six days left till convicted wife murderer Robert Westland is scheduled to go to the chair, along with two very different men in the cells adjoining his. The case seems open and shut, involving as it does evidence proving that Westland was at his wife's apartment (they were separated and in the process of divorcing) around the time of her murder, a weapon just like one he owns was the murder weapon, and the body was found in a locked room and he's the only person other than his wife known to own a key!Latimer had great fun with Crane and the host of suspects and characters involved in this almost week long excursion of broads, booze, smart aleck comments, and sleuthing in the bars and mean streets of Chicago. I guarantee that you the reader will have fun too. The only drawback is that the book was written in the non politically correct 30's and contains some racial epithets and stereotypes. If you can get past that then I strongly suggest getting a copy and making the acquaintance of Bill Crane.Five stars for humor, well drawn out mystery, and all around fun."},{"Title":"Headed for a hearse","review":"Jonathan Latimer was a reporter with Chicago Herald Examiner in the thirties before publishing this novel in 1935. The central character is Bill Crane, an operative with a detective agency in Chicago. There are 4 other Bill Crane books by Latimer, all of them hilarious. Crane has to be the hardest drinking private dick in the history of literature, even surpassing Hammett's Nick Charles. This whole series is a screwball comedy lover's dream. Hearse follows the efforts of Crane and his cronies to save an innocent man on death row with only twenty-four hours until the execution (and for Crane, that's a lot of drinking!). Latimer is superb at mixing comedy, suspense and pathos. This is a great first novel."},{"Title":"Asia's Religions: Christianity's Momentous Encounter with Paganism (Horizon)","review":"Dr.Chang has provided a valuable data concerning the history and the major ideas of Asia&#65533;s religions. He has given accurate description of the fundamental assertions and ideas that provide a structure for faith in major Asia&#65533;s religions.He is analytical in his approach of the system of belief and the fundamental doctrine of each major Asia&#65533;s religions. He also points out the margins of the particular religions in term of intellectual, social and moral. He is critical in their teaching of the doctrine of God, Creation, Man, Sin, Salvation as well as on the last things (eschatology). This we can see that he is distinguished and different from most of the academic historians of religions. The academics generally choose to suspend critical judgment when dealing with religions other than their own. This suspension of judgment follows from a real interest to discover what people of other faiths believe and what such believing entails. Critical judgment is thought to often get in the way of understanding. Avoiding a distortion of religious ideas at the same time as critically judging is such a problem that most scholars choose to abandon the critical task in favor of accurate description. Dr.Chang&#65533;s Christian criticism concerning the Asia&#65533;s religions is biblical. His critiques go to the core of non-Christian philosophy, culture and Asia&#65533;s religions by exposing their underlying presuppositions which is notbiblical.His concern is on the system of beliefs rather than specific claims made by Asia&#65533;s religions. It is true that we should give attention to how such claims fit into a larger pattern of belief, because not all claims are being put forward for acceptance by advocates of a particular religion. In the age of toleration and pluralism in the 21st century postmodern world,believers of other faith would tell the Christians not to impose their values on others. Genuine dialogue is not that the partners agree before hand to relativise their own conviction, but that they accept each other as persons. In order to enter into a deep relationship with a person the essential requirement is not that he agrees with me, that I agree with him, or that we are both willing to negotiate a compromise, but rather that I turn to him with the willingness to listen to him, to understand him and to seek mutual enrichment. The real dialogue takes place in an ultimate, personal depth. It does not have to be a talking about religion.13 But something does distinguish real dialogue: the challenge. Dialogue challenges both partners, takes them out of the security of their own prisons which is built by their philosophy and theology, confronts them with reality and with truth.This book serves as a succinct summaries and biblically-based critiques of the traditional religions in Asia. It offers us, Christian, to understand the belief and fundamental doctrines of Asia&#65533;s religions."},{"Title":"Kingdom Hearts, Vol. 3","review":"I absoloutely loved the game, so I was intrigued when I saw this book. I opened it up and once and was fully thrown into the story. In this book, Sora moves on to Monstro, where he encounters Pinnochio and meets Riku, and Atlantica, where he helps Ariel defeat the evil sea-witch- Ursula. Sora then continues his journey to find his two friends Riku and Kairi, determined to do anything to find them.Very cute pictures and I absoloutely love the front cover but I wasn't impressed with the idea that the game is being put down into books, especially using all those Disney characters- I dunno it doesn't seem right. Well anyway, it rounds off to be a pretty okay read.

After narrowly escaping Monstro, next they travel to the undersea world of Atlantica, and finally they end up in the clutches of Captain Hook and an unlikely foe.Honestly, I love this series, no matter what anyone says.

But practical issues gradually reduced this concern in practice, culminating in Dresden and Hiroshima. To begin with, there was no easy way of dichotomizing between civilians and military personnel from the vantage point of the bomber cockpit. The line between civilian and military personnel was blurred in the first place owing to the nature of modern industry-based warfare.Germany set the precedent for WWII aerial warfare by killing many civilians, through massive area-bombing, at places such as Coventry. [Not mentioned is the far greater toll of militarily-unnecessary civilian casualties inflicted upon Poles in the 1939 German-Soviet conquest of Poland.] Allies responding in kind went beyond revenge and beyond \\"two wrongs might make a right\\" thinking. It was inconceivable that the Allied war effort should be hampered because the Allies went out of their way to avoid killing civilians while the German enemy clearly had no such scruples.Area bombing was also a matter of successful bombing strategy. Daytime bombing of individual targets proved too costly in terms of planes lost, and limited effectiveness in knocking out specific targets--both in the judgment of the leaders of the RAF against Germany, and later of the leaders of the later-named USAF against Japan. Nighttime bombing virtually precluded the successful hitting of individual targets, making carpet bombing the only realistic option. Mass incendiary attacks proved much more effective in causing destruction than explosive bombs.It all boiled down to wanting to win the war, and winning it as soon as possible. This was true of England following the Battle of Britain, and it was true of the US wanting to bring the war against Japan to a successful conclusion after years of costly fighting in the Pacific.There were many military targets in Dresden. Unfortunately, the inadvertent light damage done by the US bombers (aiming at such things as railroads in daylight bombing) in comparison with the earlier British ones (occurring at night and raising the firestorm) created the misleading impression that the bombing had been primarily aimed at civilian areas. Willcocks uncritically cites the figure of 135,000 Dresden dead when the probable actual figure was a quarter of that number."},{"Title":"GNU Emacs: UNIX Text Editing and Programming","review":"I liked the depth of examples in this book.

I've rarely been disappointed in the accuracy of information, or the ease of use. As an 8th grade teacher, I find my students are constantly seeking answers. Often, the larger encyclopedia are too wordy and difficult for my students to comprehend on first reading. If I hand them my Columbia, they can get a pithy summary of their topic, which then enables them to understand the more in-depth entries.In addition to containing an amazing amount of information in a compact format, the illustrations are clear and informative, and the typeface is easy on the eyes.In short, this is a wonderful tool and I have been known to recommend its purchase to students and parents -- whether or not they already have a full set of encyclopedia at home."},{"Title":"Pioneers of Flight (Paper Airplanes That Really Fly!)","review":"I happened across this book in a bookstore and could not resist buying it.To date, I have made the first three airplanes in the book and have loved it. The models are very detailed (for being made of paper) and look very nice. They even got my mom, of all people, interested in paper airplanes.I should mention that this is not a typical 'paper airplane' book. You do not simply take a sheet of paper and fold it in various ways then fly it. You have to cut out numerous pieces, form them to get the proper curves, glue them (carefully, so that the paper doesn't warp when it's drying), and THEN fly them. Even though that may sound challenging, the first few airplanes are enough to learn the skills necessary for the later (and more challenging) airplanes. And...THE PLANES FLY VERY NICELY when built with patience and care!!"},{"Title":"The Egyptian revival; or, The ever-coming son in the light of the Tarot","review":"Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones) goes into the meaning of the tarot cards very deeply here. If you are interested in the correspondences between the tarot trumps and the \\"paths\\" on the Tree of Life, this is essential reading. And if you feel like something is \\"wrong\\" with the conventional attributions, you will find much food for thought here.For instance, the conventional scheme has the \\"Fool\\" starting at the top of the Path. But why would the order of the paths go down the Tree ofLife instead of up? Many people think this must be backwards. Otherwise the Path of Enlightenment would be leading downward from Heaven to the material world of Malkut.In \\"The Egyptian Revival\\", Achad presents an interesting argument in favor of another arrangement. I'm not sure that he gets it exactly right, but some of his placements seem infinitely more meaningful than the existing positions. At least his paths start in the material world and lead in the direction of Kether, rather than the other way around. His attitude is very humble in making these suggestions, and he goes out of his way to praise some of those in the world of established commercial magick who disagreed with his ideas.Of course, the same correspondences that cause the tarot to be ordered the way it is, also exist in the dogma and ritual of scores or hundreds of secret orders and organisations. So Achad anticipated opposition. He was very careful to pose his ideas as merely the suggestions of anhumble truthseeker. I think he was like many good and innocent people who assume other people to be good and free from malice in anintellectual discussion.But the magick establishment reacted very negatively to even a second hand suggestion that their ceremonies and grades might not be exactlyright. They moved to pursue and destroy the gentle Frater Achad. Even today, more than fifty years after his death, they spam his Wikipediapage with undocumented rumors to destroy his reputation.For people interested in such things, Frater Achad makes fascinating reading on this very obscure subject matter."},{"Title":"The Egyptian revival; or, The ever-coming son in the light of the Tarot","review":"Do you really want to know your major arcana like the back or your hand?

The mixture of nineteenthcentury misfits brought together under the mothering wing of a blindQuaker widow will make the reader deal with his own prejudices as the characters rise above the struggles of frontier America. This is one of Eidson's best offerings to date. It passes St. Agnes' Stand in character depth and dwarfs the plot of The Last Ride. The only one of Eidson's works that surpasses All God's Children in literary worth is Hannah's Gift which was never published in the US. Eidson is one of the hidden gems among American Literature. May his tribe increase."},{"Title":"All God's Children","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this narrative. It may never win any awards for great literature, but the author has a fertile imagination and comes up with fascinating characters. The events in the story kept me riveted. It's funny, too. But the thing I enjoyed the most was finally reading a novel in which the main characters were truly heroic in their actions. The bad guys are really, really bad dudes (rape, murder, torture - for starters), and you want to stand up, whistle, and clap for the good guys."},{"Title":"All God's Children","review":"Eidson has another winner with &quot;All God's Children.&quot; The characters are developed with great care to show the courage, backbone, and even the humanness of the downtrodden on the late nineteenth century frontier.Unlike his previous two novels, this new effort does not involve surviving against the vast wilderness on a long trek across the desert. &quot;All God's Children&quot; pits a small group of people facing hardship and with little or no outside support.The way the author addresses racial, cultural, and religious prejudice without haranguing his readers is a definite plus for the reader. If you enjoyed St. Agnes' Stand, and The Last Ride, All God's Children is a must read. You will fall in lovewith the blind Quaker widow who binds the family, the town, and the misfits together with her stubborn resolve and her faith in God"},{"Title":"All God's Children","review":"Mr Eidson turns in a third well written and thoroughly engaging story which will transport you in time to the hard life of the frontier. I found the book both interesting and profoundly moving in parts - and always entertaining as well as informative. Great literature: well, no. A great read - and one which does not resort to mega-block-buster fantasy - yes! Perhaps the strongest recommendation for the book is the fact that the reviews at this site are rarely less than 4 stars. Can we all be wrong?"},{"Title":"All God's Children","review":"The movie &quot;The Missing&quot; has finally generated interest in Thomas Eidson, as well it should. Although his novels are set in the American West, their appeal is to a wider audience. A blind Quaker widow with 4 sons, a middle-aged African-American on a quest for his lost children, and a family of Japanese immigrants (including a samurai!) form an interesting cast of characters in this novel, set in late nineteenth-century Kansas. Like all of Eidson's tales, this one speaks to human strengths and weaknesses."},{"Title":"All God's Children","review":"This was an enjoyable little book I chanched upon at the supermarket. Yes, it's predictable, (as Kirkus Review on its high horse spouts), quaint and all that. Most books are of this kind. So what, that doesn't diminish the fact that it's still good. I enjoyed the little garden tips, the description of the grassy plains, and the part about burnt toast coffe is interesting. There's a coffee roasting store near where I live and when I drive by I'm struck by the scent of burnt toast. Really! Go figure. This is a peaceful story and that rooster is something else."},{"Title":"Grounded Theory in Management Research (SAGE series in Management Research)","review":"Karen Locke manages, in a little over 100 pages, to simultaneously explain grounded theory, document its roots, show the conditions under which it can be used, and still maintain a critical stance toward it! She includes an extensive discussion of Barry Turner's work on disaster; an account of Glaser &amp; Straus's procedure called 'coding,' unpacks the various varieties of grounded theory (there's not just one!), and shows great familiarity with the French influences on American social science in the past several decades.Although she doesn't say it, her discussion implies that grounded theory is best learned from a mentor, when a novice is in an apprentice's role. My impression from some purported 'grounded theory' papers I've read in the past few years is that some junior scholars invoke it as a way of avoiding the hard work of doing what Glaser &amp; Straus (&amp; their followers) showed is really required to achieve a scholarly product. Some young scholars I've spoken with see it as a short cut, rather than as a serious &amp; rigorous method in its own right. Locke does a great job of indicating how time consuming serious grounded theory work can be.This is a great book for people just starting to think about doing grounded theory building."},{"Title":"Great Sentences for Great Paragraphs: An Introduction to Basic Sentences and Paragraphs","review":"I am a high school ESL teacher, and I have been searching for a way of teaching writing to my students that makes sense.

Having admired Ms. Kidman since her Dead Calm days, I like to claim her as one of my film \\"discoveries\\" so there's more than a bit of prejudice about her.This biography, painstakingly researched and meticulously detailed, is a work of many textures and is an enjoyable as it is thorough.But, hey, wait until you come to Chapter Seven - \\"The Making of Eyes Wide Shut\\" -- the film she and then-husband Tom Cruise made with the late, great Stanley Kubrick.A longtime admirer of Kubrick's work, I learned some hand-wringing details about ol' Stanley such as whether or not the myths surrounding him and his allegedly bizarre work habits were true or not.And SEX, oh yes. Nicole Kidman and sex. We see how Kubrick manipulated, managed, whatever, Ms. Kidman's 'love' scenes in Eyes Wide Shut. and how those scenes affected her marriage with the oh-so-nearby Mr. Cruise. This chapter has some of the 'hottest' descriptions I've seen in a serious, almost scholarly, biography.

Thubten Chodron's many introductory books on Buddhism, I was very excited to hear about this book when first came out. Upon my first reading, I thought that perhaps I had bitten off more than I could chew!However, as I've continued in my Buddhist studies and continued to study the Lamrim, this book has become a source of joy and clarity. It is a commentary on a particular text, &quot;The Thirty-seven Practices of Bodhisattvas&quot;; but in a more general way, it is a wonderful commentary on the gradual path to enlightenment in the Tibetan tradition. I have been pleasantly surprised at how accessible the teachings in this book are to a Western student of the dharma, with examples given that most of us can readily relate to our daily lives.Ven. Chodron's introductory section on the Buddhist World View is a very readable and useful encapsulation of basic dharma teachings for new students, and a wonderfully concise review for those who have studied the dharma for some time. It puts the remainder of the book into perspective, making reading the book all the more meaningful and relevant.The book continues to follow progressively along the path: appreciating our precious and advantageous life circumstances; studying and listening to teachings; creating a conducive environment for study and meditation; working with impermanence; relating to teachers; understanding the concept of &quot;refuge,&quot; karma (cause and effect) and the Four Noble Truths; generating bodhicitta (the altruistic mind of great compassion); transforming difficulties so that they enhance our practice rather than discouraging practice.The book ends with a detailed section on wisdom and emptiness and a final chapter on bringing our practice into our daily lives through the practices of the six far-reaching attitudes (or six perfections, &quot;paramita&quot;) of generosity, patience, ethics, joyous effort, concentration and wisdom.Dear friends, I highly recommend this book.

I would recommend this to gamers who have bought SIDEKICK and are just getting into the Hero System. If you have 5th Edition and any of the other books, then you don't need this book.Recycled contents for the newbie, the completist or Hero Games maniac."},{"Title":"Hero System: Combat Handbook","review":"The Upside:The Hero System Combat Handbook (HCH) takes all the combat rules and options that are spread across seven books and puts them into one package, under 200 pages long. Easy to transport and easy to find the rules.This is a big boon, especially for veteran Hero players. Once you get to actual game play most of the rules consultations, in my experience at least, lie in the many and varied Optional Combat Rules: martial maneuvers, bleeding, hit locations, environmental effects.The HCH is also neatly organized. Starting with Before Combat in Chapter 1 we get all the mechanical information that gets us from Story to Combat. A full explanation of combat terms and movement can be found here.Chapter 2 goes into basic combat and general combat modifiers.Chapter 3 covers martial maneuvers, including all the new maneuvers introduced in The Ultimate Martial Artist (UMA).Chapter 4 handles the effects of damage, divided into standard and all the optional rules in the Hero System: Bleeding, Death, Hit Locations, Critical Hits and other options to make combat more or less realistic depending on the tone of the game.Chapter 5 is all the other combat effects that don't fit neatly into the previous chapters. As well as Recovering, Presence Attacks and an example of Combat at the end of the combat.Chapter 6 has specific environmental effects, covering two important aspects: Underwater Combat and optional rules for Gun fighting.The Downside:The major drawback to this book for many is that it contains no new information, it's a complete reprint of rules from other books. Of course that can make it an easy purchase choice: either you want the information condensed to one book, or you don't.There was also a bit of controversy over the cover art - it's dirt simple, a Big Red Fist on a blank black cover. From where I sit it's an excellent cover that gets the point across. But on a shelf of RPG books designed to get your attention with eye candy one might decide this cover is too bland. Personally I love it.There are a few elements that the book doesn't contain that I would have liked to see: Martial Maneuver creation rules (found in UMA), Mass Combat rules (Fantasy Hero), and Vehicle combat (The Ultimate Vehicle). Adding these elements in would have made it nearly the perfect book to have at the gaming table.The Otherside:This book, being entirely about the mechanics of hero system combat, has no (or almost no) appeal outside the Hero System. Thus limiting both its sales and appeal to Hero Fans. Or anyone interested in how Hero handles combat.The Backside:I highly recommend this book, for several reasons. It has replaced my copy of the main rule book (which I use almost completely for character creation only) as The Book to take to games. The small size and amount of raw information for the slowest point of just about any RPG (Combat) makes it worth the price.For those Hero Gamers that use Sidekick instead of the main rule book for their games but want more options for combat this book may also serve well. At half the price of Fifth Edition, Revised you get all the meat of the combat system including the myriad of optional rules not covered in Sidekick. A good choice for the Gamer On A Budget.Speaking of budgets, there is a big advantage to this information reprint: if all you need are various expanded combat options the price of this book is excellent."},{"Title":"Christianity as Mystical Fact","review":"In this book, Steiner describes how Christianity evolved from earlier esoteric traditions such as the mystery schools, Egyptian and Eastern wisdom, and Greek philosophy.Steiner interprets the life of Chrsit as a model for the path of an initiate. As examples, he offers elegant insights into parts of the gospels which have previously left me &quot;in the dark.&quot; Some say that Steiner's approach to the Christianity has been continued by Joseph Campbell. If you like Campbell, you'll like this book.This book has reinvigorated Christianity for me-- by showing me how it can be interpreted like a myth.

He's not defending himself; quite the contrary. He's *prosecuting*, and asking for the death penalty, regarding the Cromsag Incident, wherein most of the planet's population died as an indirect result of his treatment; the incident is shown unfolding in flashback, interspersed with the trial.O'Mara, against Lioren's wishes, is acting as his defender, and argues that his only fault is that his perfectionist standards - Lioren has lived only for his work - have made him far too hard on himself. He actually requested his transfer from Sector General to the Monitor Corps in search of an environment with higher standards of discipline.Lioren (who loses his fight to commit judicial suicide) has sworn never again to exercise his status as a Resident Physician; the Monitor Corps can't use him. But O'Mara, who abhors waste, claims him as a trainee for the psychology department, in its tradition of taking talented insubordinate misfits under its wing. (See _Code Blue: Emergency_ for the story of how Cha Thrat, the other non-human member of the psychology department and O'Mara's co-counsel in the court-martial, made the same transition.) Note that the psychology department, officially at least, isn't there for the *patients*, but to catch any signs of problems developing among the hospital *staff*, as well as running the Educator tape system that allows physicians of one species to treat patients of another. One of the routine assignments of the department, for example, is to evaluate progress reports from tutors on various trainees. (The Nidian tutor Cresk-Sar, for example, may look like a fluffy red-gold teddy bear, but his reports are so hideously boring that even the penitential Lioren will do almost any other assignment on his plate before wading through them).White's galactic civilization has non-interference directives, but unlike some other fictional universes, these directives can be waived in light of good sense, as in Cromsag's case, wherein the population was rapidly heading for extinction. But in one case, the decision of whether to interfere with a less developed culture isn't theirs to make, and the hospital now has a *very* uncommunicative member of that species under treatment. But Lioren, whose problems are so much worse than those of any of the patients, and who no longer has any career or dignity left to lose, has begun to develop a certain talent for getting the most unlikely people to speak with him in confidence...Some long-term patients from previous books appear as Lioren adapts to his new job: Khone (see _Star Healer_), part of the long-term project of treating its/her species' inherited phobias; the Protectors of the Unborn; and Dr. Mannen, who in his old age has fallen from his lordly Diagnostician status to that of patient. The Carmody incident referred to by Braithewaite, incidentally, is from \\"Sector General\\" in the collection _Hospital Station_.IRRELEVANT NOTE: The Bruce Jensen cover art on the 1st US paperback edition is a full-face view of Hellishomar in his ward, complete with the gantries supporting the lights and equipment for the surgical team shown to scale.

Each piece presents some aspect of the foremost teaching hospital in the galaxy through medical mysteries which the reader may solve from credible extrapolations from today's medecine and biology. This novel deals with a surgeon who nearly wipes out a planetary population and grows throughout to become a nearly indispensible part of Sector General. Dealing with the hero's guilt in the process, it does so without being in any way doctrinaire, it is tremendously thought-provoking without stepping on any reader's religious or philosophical toes. On any level this novel is a terrific read whether you are new to the Sector General series or a virtual resident."},{"Title":"The Genocidal Healer (A Sector General Novel)","review":"A story about a doctor that has to deal with all sorts of aliens andother problems that makes a fateful choice, that he thinks is the rightthing to do. Others don't agree."},{"Title":"The Genocidal Healer (A Sector General Novel)","review":"James White's Sector General Stories are entertaining and intelligent stories that are truly 'good' both in terms of their quality, and in that there are very few bad or negative characters. Can you imagine Star Wars without the evil empire, or Star Trek without the Borg and the Klingons? Well, James White created a universe of full of weird aliens who were all trying to do good - by working in a vast multispecies hospital space station and trying to actually save lives.\\"The Genocidal Healer\\" is probably the best of the bunch. Most of the books have a human as the main character, but here the story is centred around Lioren, a Tarlan with numerous limbs, a dedication to medicine- and more than a little arrogance.Lioren had been in charge of a desperate medical mission on the newly-discovered world of Cromsag. Civilisation on this world had rapidly decayed over the past few centuries due to a really nasty plague. Not only were the inhabitants disfigured and dying, but they felt compelled to indulge in grotesque bouts of hand-to-hand violence.With only a few thousand Cromsaggar remaining, Lioren feels he has to act quickly, but through a disastrous error of judgement he almost wipes out the remaining population so that there are only a few dozen left.Almost overwhelmed by guilt , Lioren wants to be executed for his crime, but instead is 'merely' transferred to Sector General as a closely supervised trainee in the psychology department - the traditional dumping place there for medical misfits.Whilst working there Lioren meets other beings who have grave problems of their own - such as the Earth-human Dr Mannen, who is no longer a physician and now a terminally ill old man. More crucially he encounters Hellishomar, an enormous octupuslike alien from a species called the Groalterri (so big that when it eventually undergoes surgery, the doctors climb inside its body). Hellishomar has an intelligence to match his size, and carries a burden of guilt too - it feels it has committed a great sin...\\"What is the difference between a crime and a sin?\\" Lioren asks himself, and indeed he is starting to ask a lot of religious questions, which takes the Sector General books into new territory. James White was a Catholic , and here he starts to tackle big themes. If there is a God in the Universe, a God not just for Humans, but for Tarlans, Cromsaggar , Groalterri and all species, how can he let a whole species such as the Cromsaggar suffer in such a way?\\"The Genocidal Healer\\" is a thoughtful book. The characters are well-drawn and believable, there's a scientific puzzle, a theological mystery and the Groalterri are particularly interesting. Although there are religious questions here the author doesn't try to force you to accept any particular answers. But those Christians who can't accept evolution might conclude that James White believed in a rather more universe-spanning God than they do."},{"Title":"A Man's Role in the Home (Tony Evans Speaks Out Booklet Series)","review":"Biblical love is generated by the need of the person being loved. ~Tony EvansWhat does it mean for a husband to love his wife?

While rereading it, many things come back to me which have pointed my life away from depending on the material, the immoral and the un-helpful ways of finding peace in friends and psychiatrists who have just about tried to separate me from the true faith Catholicism and to separate me from Jesus Christ. I find it quite interesting that the chapter of his where he compares psychology vs faith in the Healing Physician (ie Jesus Christ Himself) is very much the core of why people keep going to their shrinks when they might do better going to Holy Mass and meditating on where their souls are at the present time. My biggest recommendation to all is that our souls are the highest possession we have from God above, and that in communing with His Son and the Saints (esp Fulton Sheen, because I know he is in heaven and should be a saint) is our passport to heaven. I feel much gratitude to Fulton J Sheen, and will always be indebted to him and his teachings for where I am and who I am now. Peaceable and contemplative."},{"Title":"Peace of Soul","review":"Bishop Sheen has done an outstanding job of bringing Christian revelation to bear on modern problems and modern understandings of the psyche and the soul. Sheen shows that Christian revelation about the soul is the only true answer to man's neurosis. The book is wholly, and entirely, Orthodox and represents the best of modern Catholic thinking. THe Catholic tradition of thinking has always been involved in an engagement of Christian revelation with contemporary intellectual thinking. Not only was a harmonization of the best of secular thinking and Divine Revelation achieved by St. Thomas Aquinas in the 1200's, but it was also the achievement of the Fathers of the Church as well. Sheen stands in this tradition, addressing pastoral and moral concerns of contemporary man. Sheen will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the finest pastoral theologians of this century."},{"Title":"Peace of Soul","review":"ARCHBISHOP SHEEN DOES A REMARKABLE JOB OF SHOWING THE READER HOW THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO ACHIVE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM AND ARRIVE AT BEING A TOTAL PERSON IS THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE GRACE OF GOD ALMIGHTY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WHO ARE HURTING BOTH SPIRITUALLY AND MENTALLY AND WANT TO FIND TRUE &quot;PEACE OF SOUL&quot;."},{"Title":"Peace of Soul","review":"In modern society, it is common for personal problems to be attributed to psychological makeup, and in particular to the paternal relationships of the individual. Anxiety, guilt, depression and other negative human experiences in general are not seen as the consequences of bad personal decisions but instead are linked to repressions of feelings that go back to early childhood. Freedom from these repressions--often translated into a license to do what one formerly resisted to do--is what constitutes the end of psychology as a means of improving mental well-being.Bishop Fulton Sheen acknowledges the usefulness of psychology and many of the methods used in the field to help individuals sort out their psychological problems. However, he also is critical of particular mindsets that accompany some of these methods. He disagrees with the view, common among many psychologists, that there is no sin. He also frowns on psychologists who separate feelings of guilt from wrongdoing committed. Bishop Sheen professes that besides psychological illness there is spiritual illness, which only can be healed by confession of sin as sin and the receiving of forgiveness, exemplified by the sacrament of confession.The first 2/3 of the book is heavily noted with references to Freud and terms associated with him and his followers (e.g. psychoanalysis, Oedipus Complex, unconsciousness, ID, Ego, Superego). These references are in some cases lengthy, the notes nearly as long as a chapter in itself. The information contained in these notes is quite informative, but the debate with Freudian thought results in several protracted arguments that cause the theme of how to attain peace of soul to fade temporarily.The last 4-5 chapters are the true gems of the work. It is here that conversion and the acquiring peace of soul through inner change receive central treatment.Overall, a Fulton Sheen work that offers astute commentary and worthwhile quotes."},{"Title":"Peace of Soul","review":"I am a fond reader of science non-fiction and spiritual transcendental books and have always yearned for a book which can fuse this dichotomy. Mind you, souls and physics/origins of the universe great logic the 2 do not make! However one cannot argue that there are issues which science cannot answer and theologies which religions hold true. (that being the soul or our humanity)This book is able to convey the importance of the belief in souls/spirituality w/o referencing biblical fiction which would cross realms of scientific culpability (ie turning to salt or creating the world in 6 days). It simply reminds us of our humanity and that our human essence is not grounded in physical origin but rather in a place far greater than our physical existence. He also recounts the human error of solving many psychological problems with drugs rather than possibly sourcing it to something beyond the brain. That our being far exceeds the sum of our physical parts, and that in attending to this, we may truly find peace in this world as well as any others that follow.Of the many great excerpts from this book, one seems to resonate frequently - that our souls will not find peace in finite things of this world. That to truly find peace, we must find it in the infinite.There are many references to God that I believe a Christian reader can benefit from moreso than readers from a different theology. However a modicum of understanding of souls and spiritualism will benefit many other readers as well.All in all, I believe this book is truly uplifting - and I'm not talking endorphin and serotonin rushes here - Fulton is able to truly center on that &quot;something else&quot; which makes you human and brings you to a place so great that makes you KNOW that you can LIVE and DIE in peace.GODSPEED.."},{"Title":"Peace of Soul","review":"Beeeeeeeeautiful! One feels blessed while reading the delightfully estute and directional offerings of Fulton. It even makes one not fear any challenges it may present. It's insight makes me laugh out loud.The Native Americans, Twelve Step guru's, Hindu's, Jews, Taoists, all know that we need guides and mentors else we become lost and half of our selves. We become flat, half-dead and we can definitely feel it. We even grow to not mind the half dead feeling thinking it is just natural human moods.We all must encounter Rites of Passage and that is why the Catholics have the sacraments.It has been scientifically PROVEN that the state of Peace is the most beneficial to the human body. Not just the mind - the body. The Twelve Steppers say, \\"Bring the body, the mind will follow.\\" Fulton knows that our minds are always trying to return to Peace so the act of constantly understanding what we each do personally that distracts us from the blessed state of peace, must be understood. We must understand how to Transition back to Peace. I believe the Catholic church is now going to call The Eucharist (Thanksgiving) the Sacrament of Transition. If Jesus of Nazareth is really the Prince of Peace, and I mean inner peace, than this is a welcomed new title for Communion. They are not erasing the names Eucharist or Communion, just adding that the receiving of it - will transition the receiver back to Peace. Faith, Hope, Love, Charity, etc. are all under the umbrella of Peace.I think it is very smart and wise that the Catholic faith intends to keep our minds engaged on spiritual matters and contains pools of spiritual discussion, practice and thought. It attempts to engage us so we have less time to focus elsewhere. (So, sister Joseph Anne...was right after all)It's a wild thing to believe the whole, Father, Son and Holy Spirit trifecta and all that it entails. But if your body feels it...you can't deny that something is there. May I suggest you spend one hour a week in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament. Find a church that hosts the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. Remember when we were kids and it felt like punishment to sit there in church before it. Woah....do it now. Tell me it doesn't blow your mind. Don't be suprised if you find yourself wanting to skip along the street instead of walking....just like when you were a child.God Bless this modern day prophet who thankfully will be canonized a saint any day now. Modern day saints must exist to distract us from the antithesis. They become the magnet for our eyes, hearts and minds...as Jesus would say...\\"The better part!\\" Aside from all the grossly unfortunate corruptions that have been exposed in the Catholic ORGANIZATION over the past few years, I have found the Catholic FAITH the real deal spiritually. At base it is all about moderation, joy and yes, the most blessed state. Peace. The Prince of Peace...and anyone who chooses to receive that blessings knows the source.

Instead of Clarence the Angel, Ed is led around by David Ricardo, the economist who developed the Law of Comparative Advantages, which forms the foundations for supporting global free trade.Throughout the novel, Ed raises questions based on his traditional thinking on protectionsim. Ricardo addresses each key concern in turn. The concepts debated include: loss of jobs, loss of our nation's economic status, national security needs, etc. More importantly, Ricardo convinvingly makes the point that total national economic self-sufficiency is a recipe for economic disaster/failure.I found this to be an entertaining way to learn more about the debate on free trade and protectionism.

Whether students struggling in Econ class, Teachers of Business school, or just evening news watchers who would like - for once - to understand the sentences that come after \\"Leading Economists are saying today . . .\\" I highly recommend buying two copies. You will definately want to recommend this one. A real eye opener for free-traders, and a wonderful teaching tool for those \\"in the know\\". Roberts nails it!"},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"\\"The Choice\\" is truly a book that needs to be read by all non-students of economics. I read this in my introductory macroeconomics course in college, and it sums up beautifully the basic concepts of why we trade. Inevitablely in my life, I come across some individual espousing the horrors of trade. In the 90's, it was the labor movement that claimed their jobs were lost. Today, it is the environmental leftist or the isolationist right who preach the horrors of greed and trade. Well, I always look back to this book and its simple yet eloquent summation of very complex theories to bash my idiotic opponents with there close-minded thinking. Clearly, this is a book that will forever be on my shelf and given as a gift to those who I bash. So, please give Amazon and the writer your money."},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better. Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible. In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs. Fables like The Choice (or the \\"free-market economy\\" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple. That's why the book is dangerous. The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good. The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable. If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well. Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong."},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"This book is, as the title suggests, an allegory with the notion of free trade at its center. It also not-so-subtly introduces the lay reader, for whom this book was written, to the arguments supporting free trade.It is written in the style of It's A Wonderful Life, in that the main character, resembling the American Everyman in his doubts about the merits of free trade, wishes that things could have been different. He is led on a journey of what might have been. Roberts masterfully mixes in macroeconomic and international economic theory in the process, allowing the reader to make their own decisions on the merits of free trade, rather than simply being cowed by the picture he paints of a protectionist United States.For those who are familiar with both macroeconomic and international economic theory, this book won't open your eyes. It does, however, provide a framework for explaining the merits of free trade to others. For those unfamiliar with economic theory, however, it is probably the most painless and enjoyable ways to become familiar with the territory."},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"Russell Roberts aims to persuade the intelligent layman that the stuff of wealth is goods and services (not money or jobs) and that the way to create wealth is through specialization and trade, which he calls the &quot;roundabout way to wealth.&quot; The book is better than a novel. The author creates a dialogue between the late economist David Ricardo and fictional businessman Ed Johnson. It's easy to imagine that Ricardo represents Roberts as professor and Johnson represents every student who ever raised a challenging question in his class. One can learn a lot about international trade from this dialectic approach.The author uses some numbers and case studies to illustrate what happens when trade is free and when it is not. The &quot;rigor&quot; is there even if the elaborate geometry and mathematics usually found in economics textbooks are not. Like most economists, Roberts makes the case for free trade in terms of efficiency. Ultimately though, his message becomes a moral one and a challenge. &quot;The real choice&quot; declares David Ricardo (Russell Roberts), &quot;is between a dynamic world and a static world---a world of encouraging people to dream and acquire the skills to make those dreams come true and a world of encouraging people to be content with what they have and to dream less.&quot; The Choice is about as good in spirit and persuasiveness as Frederic Bastiat's Economic Sophisms."},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"Roberts does an excellent job a getting across some very complex international trade concepts in a very enjoyable way. I recommend this book to people at all levels economists, like myself; students of economics; businesspeople; working people; journalists; policymakers; everyone!"},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"I'll make this as brief and simple as does Mr. Roberts.

It worked for me!"},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"This book clearly states the case for free trade without falling back on dense economic theory and technical jargon. Especially with the protests and controversy surrounding globalization and trade today, it is more important than ever for people to understand that free trade makes us all better off. In fact, there is no better way to improve the lot of two countries (and their overall welfare) that to reduce trade barriers between them and allow each to concentrate more energy and resources on their comparative strengths. The Choice delivers this message clearly and articulately in the context of a fun and simple story that even the most protectionist leaning person would have difficulty refuting."},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"With THE CHOICE, Russell Roberts has written the 20th-century's finest, most eloquent, most unique, most accessible, and deepest defense of free trade. Even though I'm trained as an economist, and despite having taught international trade for many years, I learned much when I read this 104-page work. For example, never have I read an explanation of the optimal tariff (and of its limitations) that is as clear as that which is presented in THE CHOICE. But the most remarkable trait of THE CHOICE is its humanity -- its successful effort to destroy the myth that free trade benefits only the few and makes life precarious for the many. In every sense, this work is superb."},{"Title":"The Choice: A Fable of Free Trade and Protectionism Updated Edition","review":"Is free trade good for you and your country, or bad ?

Narration is too slim, and sentences are trimmed too much, which makes it look terribly overloaded with names and dates.Such format was obviously chosen to give a feeling of certain 'detached' objectivity of each story, hence \\"encyclopedia\\". And yet artciles are actually made into essays, but where complete lack of any descriptiveness or logical connections (between passages taken from different sources), and lack of emotionally-colored associations - all make this text a way too dry and jejune just to read as a book. The only human features showing through otherwise colorless text are scepticism and indifference of the author. Can't say if it's very inspiring observation.And, naturally, closing sentesences for each article should be much more provocative/suspenseful/suggestive to leave reader pondering."},{"Title":"Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved (Mammoth Book of S.)","review":"I was browsing the stacks at a local Hastings when I found Damon and Colin Wilson's book in the bargain book section. Of course I have an interest in strange events and so picked it up and thumbed through it. Seems the Wilsons had included the deaths of pro-Communist terrorists (RAF) or Baader-Meinhof in the book. That somehow, and rather mysteriously, they had come to a violent end behind bars. The authors then assumed that with the death of the ringleaders, the terrorist organization had itself come to an end. Would that it were so.I was with the U.S. Army from about August of 1979 to the spring of 1983 stationed in Germany. What was then known as the Bundesrepublik of Germany. The first inclination that I had of the very real and present danger of terrorism, was when I was on leave (1981 or thereabouts) taking my mother and a friend around to see the sights in Germany. My mother being herself of German blood. Before she was to return to the states and myself and my friend to take up our duties with the Army; we visited the Munich (Munchen) Oktoberfest. Did not make it back before the last of the trains had left for the day and so parked in the train station at Munich before departing the next morning. We had barely returned and were watching the news and were horrified to learn that a suicide bombing had occurred at the Munich Oktoberfest. We were only hours from having been caught in the middle of it. Baader-Meinhof must have gained quite a following from disciples, followers or sympathizers. Because the Marxist terrorist threat to West Germany and its government re-emerged by the early 80s and the Polizei were in a constant battle with them until the late 80s. Along the way, NATO, stationed in Germany, and the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in Germany came under threat of bombs, etc. from this pro-Communist terrorist organization. It got bad enough that we were generally restricted to base and the guards were armed. I assume that Baader-Meinhof did not exactly come to an abrupt end when the ringleaders \\"died mysteriously\\" behind bars in 1977. That for a long time afterwards, they were still active and still very much a threat."},{"Title":"Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved (Mammoth Book of S.)","review":"OK, here is going to be an unpopular review for sure. Honestly I was having some degree of fun reading this book but then it became obvious that its a giant cut and past hack job filled with misleading and downright wrong information. If you want a pure fictional read then you might like some of this book but even then you will start to come across repeated text in various chapters, storyline's that go off on a tangent to nowhere, other tales that end abruptly as if the author lost interest or forgot where he was taking the story. The same blocks of text are repeated throughout the book in various stories, if you have a real short term memory you might find this useful but for the rest of us it's redundancy to the extreme. Maybe the author was in another state of conciseness when he wrote this book or maybe he didn't write anything and just hired an editor, since it seems the whole book is cut and pasted from scrapes of info found on the internet or encyclopedias.The story on the Shroud of Turin started out reasonable enough but then turned into a complete fact-less all out attack on the Catholic Church. If you are an atheist, agnostic, anti-Christian or anti-Catholic leftist you might just love it, but if you are a seeker of the truth, don't like propaganda and despise mean spirited bigotry then this book might leave a bad taste in your mouth. The shroud of Turin has been scrutinized by hundreds of the worlds best scientists from around the globe, for decades they meticulously analyzed and studied the Shroud of Turin using every conceivable piece of equipment and technology, including advanced NASA computers. The global scientific community still cannot ascertain how the Shroud was created and they still, with all of today's technology, can not reproduce the Shroud of Turin. The author throws all of these facts out the window because of a flawed carbon dating report. He then goes off on a wild nasty tangent that has nothing to do with the story or the Shroud of Turin, He creates this wild baseless fictional story bashing the Catholic Church. I wrote to the author and asked why he did not mention the well know and widely accepted controversy of the carbon dating and its known flawed results. The authors assistant responded to my inquiry and stated that he forwarded my concern to the author. The author obviously could not respond with a rational reason why he concealed the many valuable facts of the Shrouds history or his bashing of the Catholic Church. I guess he finds it easy to write lies on paper but can not directly back up his trash. After reading the Shroud chapter I could not go on reading anything else because I can't trust the author to present facts, besides the book was so poorly written its a complete hack job. Do yourself a favor and read a book that you can actually learn a thing or two from, one that at least is written by an author who has some regard for the truth. Search the internet for 'shroud of turin facts' and you will come to factsplusfacts site that will explain the truth about the Shroud, then compare that to what this author put together and decide for yourself if he purposely created deception by omission. Colin Wilson, you should be ashamed! Write a book on religion next time instead of disguising your animosity of the Church through the pages of this book.I just picked this one story as an example but as the other reviewer mentioned many, many of the stories are filled with flawed information, omissions, factual errors and miss-dated events. This book is a waste of time, find a book written by a true researcher who has a passion for the truth."},{"Title":"Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved (Mammoth Book of S.)","review":"What makes this book by Colin Wilson pleasantly unpredictable is that it contains far more &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; than the &quot;usual&quot; and expected \`Bermuda triangle\`, &Ugrave;FOs\`, \`Bigfoot\`and so on. Sure enough it contains entries about those phenomena, but it goes deeper than these and explores stories such as those of Fulcanelli or Junius (both brilliant and yet unknown stories), a more detailed account on the -possibly- false identity on the man who spent 40 years in prison claiming he was Rudolph Hess (more than likely he wasnt) , a good comprehensive and all-inclusive &quot;report&quot; on whether Homer actually existed and what he really did write etc.. I read books on such matters on a systematic basis and yet i found that a good portion of the onescontained here I\`d never heard before.I\`ve used quotation marks widely on the above paragraph trying to stay in line with Wilson\`s -always- careful treading when he deals with theories about unsolved mysteries.If you\`re a fan of Colin Wilson you\`ll find this to be another excellent contribution of his to the &quot;paranormal&quot; field of research (or to be somewhat more precise: to the not so normal field of research).If you\`re not familiar with this incredible and ultra prolific researcher this book is a great one to start from as:-it recquires no previous specialised reading on your part (Wilson will keep you in the know with several references and explanations throughout your reading)-&igrave;t\`s a wildly fun book even for those that might\`ve never picked up a reading on such matters-and, it\`s Colin Wilson.

It is indeed mammoth as it ranges from the paranormal to more historical mysteries. The authors', Colin Wilson and Damon Wilson, pet theories become abundantly clear as certain themes and concepts are repeated throughout the book, such as their ideas concerning poltergeists which are shoe-horned into far too many of the entries outside of the one for poltergeists. They also have an annoying lack of scepticsim concerning anything paranormal yet pull away the cobwebs from more historical occurences with great ease.

As another reviewer pointed out, some of the authors' information is a bit dated. Also, the authors tend to get a lot of their exercise jumping to conclusions based on very little evidence.It's an enjoyable book, definitely; I appreciated it immensely, and was glad I purchased it.

I'm not attacking the book based on philosophy; one may disagree with their approach and conclusions, but the Wilsons simply get basic facts wrong. One wonders how solid the Wilsons' conclusions can be, given such sloppy research.In some cases the authors seem blissfully unaware that their \\"unsolved\\" mysteries have in fact been solved. Take chapter 14, \\"The Dogon and the Ancient Astronauts,\\" for example. This \\"Sirius mystery\\" has been explained and debunked not only in several Skeptical Inquirer articles (see, for example, \\"Dogon and the Dog Star\\" 4[2]; \\"The Dogon People Revisited\\" 20 [6]) but also in the somewhat less skeptical Fortean Times (140).Even the old Bermuda Triangle \\"mystery\\" is rehashed, along with the disappearance of Flight 19. Though the Wilsons have (presumably) read skeptical books on the topic, they repeat many errors, including that the doomed Flight 19 pilots said, \\"Everything is wrong...Even the ocean doesn't look as it should.\\" (Larry Kusche, author of The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved, studied transcripts of the pilots' transmission and notes, \\"The strange quotations attributed to the pilots...do not appear in the Navy report...\\" [p.126].)The gaffes go on. Throughout the book, they repeatedly misspell their sources' names (for example British neurologist John Lorber and Canadian ethnobotanist and zombie researcher Wade Davis). If the Wilsons can't even bother to get names spelled correctly, it's not a good sign for the rest of their scholarship.I could go on for pages with examples such as these, but I have neither the time, space, or inclination to do so. Both the authors and the publishers should be embarrassed at letting so many errors through- especially in a supposed reference book such as an encyclopedia. There are no references given-obviously because by providing them anyone could easily see just how shoddy their research is.One possible explanation for the poor quality of the book is that it is simply out of date and the Wilsons only occasionally bothered to update cases or correct previous errors. Indeed, the authors' preface states that \\"this book contains most of the chapters\\" from two earlier works. But don't take my word for it: the mistakes are abundant and there for all to see. Sadly, most lay readers probably won't have the background to know how unreliable the book is."},{"Title":"Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved (Mammoth Book of S.)","review":"As might be expected from Colin Wilson and his son, Damon, the wealth of detail and high quality writing in this massive tome raises it several notches above the average &quot;unsolved mystery&quot; book.

Depending on your acquitance with his work, you may find this 662-page tome fascinating reading or 'old goods in a new cover.'ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE UNSOLVED features chapters of all the 'usual suspects' - Atlantis, Jack the Ripper, Nessie, Bigfoot, King Arthur/Merlin, the Bermuda Triangle, Crop Circles, the Man in the Iron Mask, Fairies, the Crystal Skull, the curse of the Hope Diamond, Spontaneous Human Combustion, Robin Hood, Sea Monsters and the Holy Shroud of Turin - along with other lesser-known items like Agatha Christie's disappearance, the death of 'cigar girl' Mary Rogers, etc.As demonstrated above, Wilson is a font of information on a wide variety of topics. And he has an entertaining writing style. Being a dyed-in-the-wool skeptic however, I cringe when, for example, he gives credence to the existence of fairies, etc. but that's just me.However, I gave Wilson's book two stars because it's basically a cobbled-together compilation of two earlier works that date from 1990 and 1992. There have been significant developments in some of the topics covered in ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE UNSOLVED. Consequently, the book would have been much more valuable if Wilson or his son Damon had taken the time to update the entries in this omnibus edition before publication in 2008. Talk about a missed opportunitity!In short, I was disappointed by THE MAMMOTH ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE UNSOLVED...but others may find it just fine, thank you very much!

However I wouldn't recomend it to parents who first want to find out about Montessori, because the language is very complex and you get tired of so many ideas in so little space. First time readers of Montessori are better of with her other book, \\"Montessori Today\\".This is an excellent book for people who will have patience and read it little by little to be able to \\"Swallow\\" and get every idea."},{"Title":"Montessori: A Modern Approach","review":"I chose to purchase this book along with THE MONTESSORI METHOD, MONTESSORI'S OWN HANDBOOK, and MONTESSORI TODAY (by the same author). I was well pleased with Lillard's objective point of view and constant reference to Montessori's own words. I do not feel as though this author is simply trying to idolize someone who many Montessorians consider a heroine, but that she is simply trying to convey the value of a Montessori education in today's world. Another work of hers, MONTESSORI TODAY, is much more explicit when it comes to classroom set up and elaboration on elementary level information. A MODERN APPROACH builds upon information provided in THE MONTESSORI METHOD and \\"sets the stage\\" for MONTESSORI TODAY. I, personally, am most excited about reading MONTESSORI FROM THE START, as well. I feel that she is an excellent author and has contributed a considerate amount of knowledge to parents and educators alike in regards to this particular method. I have yet to find another to rival it."},{"Title":"Decisive Battles: Their Influence Upon History and Civilisation","review":"the drawings are not as good as other booksand the one I got has the different cover design, I prefer this one shown here than the one I received!!"},{"Title":"Decisive Battles: Their Influence Upon History and Civilisation","review":"J.F.C.FULLER WAS A FAMOUR BRITISH MILITARY THINKER.

Set in the shantytown slums of Kingston in the late nineteen fifties, Patterson's charcterizations of the people at the very bottom of Jamiacan society have great power -- as reggae star Dennis Brown once sang, their story is &quot;the half that's never been told&quot;. Following a group of Jamaica's poorest, most humble &quot;sufferers&quot; in their search for deliverance, the author brings to life a Jamaica that is a universe away from most American images of the Caribbean as a beautiful beach with a happy reggae soundtrack. As someone who has visited Jamaica many times, I loved this this book and highly recommend it to anyone who would enjoy an unusual novel from a different cultural perspective, and/or those who may be interested in Jamaican/Caribbean culture and the roots of the rastafarian/black identity movement."},{"Title":"The children of Sisyphus,: A novel,","review":"Orlando Patterson's Children of Sisyphus set the standard for social realism in Caribbean fiction. He does not romanticize the lives of the poor, nor does he damn them with neglect;rather, he gives their lives dignity.This is the moral tightrope that all Third World writers face: the choice between compassion and brutal honesty. Patterson succeeds in this fine portrayal of the lives of the poor that is imbued with grace, despite their mean existence."},{"Title":"The children of Sisyphus,: A novel,","review":"I read this book first in 1987, just when it was published.

The book Robinson R22 was very helpful as it covers the preflight inspection very well with pictures and location of the varous parts.

There is another review here at Amazon that points at low quality of writing, but I thought that It can't be that bad! Well, I was wrong.The language of this book is horrible. Reading this book felt like breaking a spy code. The book is filled with long run-on sentences and really bad punctuation. The author combines multiple ideas into one sentence as if he is charged per every period that he puts in this book. Here is a typical sentence from this book (page 1-18):The alternator is the primary source of power to the electrical system in normal operations, with engine running, the alternator produces alternating current (AC) which is converted into direct current (DC) by diodes incorporated in the alternator housing which act as rectifiers.A sentence like that won't pass even a middle school writing test; it doesn't look like anybody did a proof reading before this book was published.There are plenty of illustrations in this book, which would have been good if all of them were legible. Many pictures are not even focused on the subject of the discussion. For example, the illustration next to Warning Lights chapter shows the whole instrument panel - from cyclic to the top of the panel. If you have never been in R22 before, you would have hard time locating tiny warning lights in this picture. Needless to say that captions under each warning light are not readable because the picture is not even focused on warning lights.I give 2 stars to this review because the book is factually correct.I do not know what alternatives to this book are available in the market, but I encourage perspective students to look around before ordering this book.Good luck mastering R22.

Their friends, the Bensons, moved away and the Malloys moved in to their house. In The Boys Start the War, the boys and girls start pulling pranks on each other, each one more hilarious than the next! In The Girls Get Even, the two families try to outdo each other in Halloween costumes, until a surprising turn of events happen! This book is great!"},{"Title":"The Boys Start the War (Boy/Girl Battle)","review":"\\"The Boys Start the War\\" is a hit in my small Catholic library. After the first girl returned the book, she asked for Book 2, \\"The Girls Get Even.\\" I had acquired only the first one, waiting to see the reaction. She was so delighted that I bought the entire set. The rest has been popular history!As with this series, let one student read and spread the word, then a reading frenzy follows!In historical lore the Hatfields and the McCoys lived in West Virginia across a retaining wall on the river from each other. Bitter feuds ensued. One reason this story is so notorious is that the origin of the feud is buried in time. No one remembers, yet the war continued for generations. See Wikipedia for more information.Phyllis Reynolds Naylor chose intriguing family names for the \\"war\\" in the book: The Hatfords and the Malloys. The setting for the book is West Virginia. The two families live across a loop in the river from each other. The two families are connected by a swinging bridge across the river. For a much shorter route to school, the Malloys must cross the bridge, going alongside Hatford property.This is how the war starts: The former neighbors, the Bensons with five boys moved, leaving their house up for rent. The Malloys take it. The Hatford boys are overjoyed because they think a family with three boys are moving in. Perched on top of their house and carrying binoculars, the four boys eagerly await moving day. Instead of three boys, three girls get out of the new family's car.The boys decide to leave dead animals on the Malloy side of the river to make them think the river is polluted and leave to go back where they came from. This is not the day of wimpy, prissy girls. The three Malloys have gumption. They create their own form of retaliation. The war has begun!What Wally, the middle son and brains of the boy feuders, later concludes is that this will be a war of wit. The skirmishes are often humiliating to one or another of the two clans, even though humorous to the reader. I will say that pranks go into the school, each family house, the neighborhood, wherever they can plot a new embarrassment.That's as much as I'm telling. One prank after the other. One-up-manship. Match queen. However, by novel's end, the reader grasps the tiniest gleam that the reason for the feud will be forgotten. Origin: To drive the girls back from whence they came.Note: Except for the historical allusion, this series is simple entertainment, yet anything that gets reluctant readers to engage in a book is a winner. This series should appeal equally to girls and boys.Book 2:The Girls Get Even (Boy/Girl Battle)"},{"Title":"The Boys Start the War (Boy/Girl Battle)","review":"This is really cool.It can be for 3-??yrs old.Pluse it takes places in my hometown Buckhannon,WV.The school they go to has beem turn into a building for 5-18 year olds,called Stockert Youth Center.The Mallory girls are really cool!!The Boys are trying to get the girls out of their old best friends house by playing tricks and being mean,and the girls try to show the boys the can't tear them away from Buckman wich really is Buckhannon.Read it!!Its cool!!"},{"Title":"The Boys Start the War (Boy/Girl Battle)","review":"This is one of the best books I ever read.

It boasts well-developed characters and some truly funny, well-written moments. The Malloy family of three girls moves to the town of Buckman, West Virginia, into a house that is across the river from the four Hatford brothers. The Malloy girls are 11-year-old tomboy Eddie, 10-year-old sci fi bookworm Beth, and 8-year-old intelligent, aspiring actress Caroline. The Hatford boys are 11-year-old prankster Jake, his quieter, artistic twin Josh, 9-year-old creative force Wally, and 7-year-old naive Peter. The boys decide to declare war on their new neighbors, hoping to drive the girls back to Ohio. But they haven't considered the counterattacks the girls are capable of.The Girls Get Even is not as fresh as its predecessor, but still cute and amusing. The boy-girl feud continues in the second installment of the series. Beth, Caroline, and Eddie follow the boys on their camping trip at Smuggler's Cove with hilarious results. Both clans enter the Halloween costume parade hoping to win the contest. Caroline's fourth grade class puts on a Halloween play called The Goblin Queen, in which Caroline gets to show up Wally.

The boys are in for a surprise when they have to go against the Malloy sister's cleverness. The pranks go on from dead fish to dead bodies and from floating heads to washing windows. The boys and the girls keep going at each other. They both can't tell their parents because then they would have to tell about all their other pranks. The war goes on and on to other sequels.I like book because of all the pranks. The pranks are all thought up cleverly but something always goes wrong. A quote that shows something going wrong is, \\"\`You got the flashlight?' Jake asked Wally breathlessly. \`Heck, no. You were carrying it.' \`I thought you grabbed it,' Josh said. \`Someone did!' But that someone was already inside the house.\\" This shows how the Hatfords lost their flashlight while pretending to be a floating head outside Beth Malloy's window.Another reason I liked this book is because it's a humor book. I don't read many humor books but this book made me laugh. This book is filled with many hilarious events. Caroline Malloy draws a funny picture of her teacher but Wally manages to steal it and blackmails her. The things that go wrong are also funny. Just when one side thinks they've won, the other side finds a way to get even. There are many other books in the series and this is only the first.My favorite part of the book is at the end of the book when the final prank is played. When the girls go to get Caroline from the Hatford's tool shed, they think they won because they made Jake say to them, \\"Your faithful, obedient servant.\\" As they were leaving Wally comes out with Mrs. Hatford saying that the girls were coming over to help peel the bushels of apples the Hatfords had picked. I thought this was hilarious and was a great way to end the book to keep you hooked."},{"Title":"The Boys Start the War (Boy/Girl Battle)","review":"Just when the Hatford boys were expecting three boys to move into the house across the river the Malloy girls arrived instead.

Wonderful! Had no idea MIKE MIGNOLA did the cover and there is a very nice sketchbook of his on the back pages! Well Done!"},{"Title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","review":"Take it from someone who's seen the movie. Atlantis is very far down on my list of Disney features. But if you're wondering what exactly went wrong, I'd advise buying the graphic novelization. Obviously, the writer was working from an earlier draft of the script and elements from the movie that are completely perplexing on screen are cleared up in this re-telling -- especially in the final battle between Milo and the movie's villain. (My 8-year-old daughter actually commented on that fact after reading this adaptation.) Comparing the film and the adaptation tells a fascinating story about some of the last-minute plot meddling that may have happened to help save this doomed feature. I'd advise that any completist Disney collector should have both the movie and this adaptation on his or her shelf. I know Greg Ehrbar as the name behind some very handsome and well-told French-language Disney comic book adaptions that are available only in France. But, I'm afraid no one could have made this feature completely intelligible. Perhaps the film makers concentrated too much on capturing the style of Production Designer Mike \\"Hellboy\\" Mignola. I only wished that they had paid a little more to the one detail Disney usually does best -- story."},{"Title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","review":"This was a great book and adaptation of the film, but it is basically a carbon-copy of the film itself. Nothing new is presented within that was not fully explained within the movie. However, I consider it an excellent collector's item for fans of the film. The artwork in its own right is flawless and very well done. Bonus film production artwork with commentary by Mike Mignola at the end of the book was a plus."},{"Title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","review":"I haven't seen the movie yet, so I can't, and won't, compare. I'll just say that the adaptation is a haphazard mess that seems more like a fast-forward highlight reel than a true re-telling. The reader is likely to spend much of the time wondering what just happened, how did we get from there to here, who is that, etc., which does not make for an enjoyable read. I realize that the book is targeted at children, but children are YOUNG, not stupid. Even when I was younger I would have dismissed this as trash. Greg Ehrbar (The &quot;writer&quot;) is a name I will studiously avoid in the future. The saving grace is the sketchbook in the back, showcasing the design work of the movie's Production Designer, famed comic-book creator Mike Mignola. I bought the book just to see his sketches, and at least they delivered.Mignola fans might be happy, but all others should steer clear."},{"Title":"21st Century Grammar Handbook","review":"The 21st Century Grammar Handbook list subjects in alphabetical order which makes it a good reference tool when a person needs it the most - in the middle of writing.

The lines of Arnold's poem overflow with luminescent imagery, painting a vivid portrait of ancient India.Edwin Arnold arrived in India in 1856, in a period when very little was known about the spiritual traditions of the East, let alone the teachings of the Buddha. It is clear that Arnold fell in love with the majestic culture of India, a love which led him to learn Pali and Sanskrit. The Light of Asia was written, in his own words, \\"in the brief intervals of days without leisure.\\"The Light of Asia truly stands alone. Arnold has let the story of the Buddha fill his heart, and his re-telling has its own particular charms and beauty. His portrait of the Buddha is one of perfect love, perfect compassion, and perfect wisdom--his Buddha is a world-redeemer. Even the stoical rocks are moved by his birth.The Light of Asia invites us into Arnold's romance with a world still veiled in mystery. More than that, it invites us into the spirit of the Prince Gautama. Take the moment of Siddhartha's departure from his wife and child--for many, this moment could seem selfish or callous. In Arnold's rendition, it is a moment of infinite compassion, a moment where even perfect filial love and domestic bliss cannot conceal the truth of suffering. Arnold's Prince does not turn away from the highest worldly contentment in search of some yet-greater divine pleasure, but out of sympathy for the whole of humanity. If even love falls prey to death, we must seek out some greater gift for those we love. We must seek the deathless.But if this were all Arnold's poem captured, we would still be left dangling. The Buddha's enlightenment is described by Arnold as rapture. As the Buddha awakens, the whole world rejoices. The trees begin to dance, the birds go into a frenzy, and across India men and women can feel it: something has happened. The unfulfilled has been fulfilled, the seeker has found the sought, the world has been infused by the beyond.The Light of Asia is also relevant from a historical perspective. It captures something rare: an early treatment of Eastern philosophy by a Western scholar which is not merely respectful and well-learned, but a genuine soul communion. This reveals a high degree of courage, a courage which globalization demands of all of us.The dance between East and West continues, and every day the lines become a bit more blurred. As we come into closer contact with new cultures and traditions, may we find inspiration in the enchantment and respect which Arnold felt so deeply for India. May we all find wisdom wherever it appears. May wisdom be the balm for the world's wounds, and the fire to kindle the hearts of all peace-seekers."},{"Title":"The light of Asia;: Or, The great renunciation (Mahabhinishkramana) being the life and teaching of Gautama, prince of India and founder of Buddhism (as told in verse by an Indian Buddhist)","review":"WHO THWARTS IT LOSES, AND WHO SERVES IT GAINS.THE HIDDEN GOOD IT PAYS WITH BLISS,THE HIDDEN ILL WITH PAINS.SIR EDWIN ARNOLD, \\"LIGHT OF ASIA\\""},{"Title":"The light of Asia;: Or, The great renunciation (Mahabhinishkramana) being the life and teaching of Gautama, prince of India and founder of Buddhism (as told in verse by an Indian Buddhist)","review":"It was a fair printing of this book but the free version on the internet was much easier to read and comprehend at UrbanDharma.org."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"Ostensibly this book is about a tennis match, Arthur Ashe versus Clark Graebner in the 1968 US Open Semifinals. The match was historic in itself:&quot;It has been thirteen years since an American won the men's-singles final at Forest Hills, and this match will determine whether Ashe or Graebner is to have a chance to be the first American since Tony Trabert to win it all. Ashe and Graebner are still amateurs, and it was imagined that in this tournament, playing against professionals, they wouldn't have much of a chance. But they are here, close to the finish, playing each other. For Graebner to look across a net and see Ashe--and the reverse--is not in itself unusual. They were both born in 1943, they have known each other since they were thirteen, and they have played tournaments and exhibitions and have practiced together in so many countries and seasons that details blur.&quot;But McPhee is actually after bigger game than this one match. He also provides insightful portraits of the two very different contestants. Ashe, the only championship level Black tennis player of his time, is single, liberal, mercurial, a finesse player and a risk taker. Graebner is married with kids, conservative, religious, a power player and risk averse. McPhee demonstrates how their personalities influence, indeed shape, their play and how their lifelong rivalry lifts their games to higher levels when they play one another, ultimately lifting Ashe's game towards perfection by the end of this contest.Ashe would go on to win the tournament, becoming the only amateur to win it in the Open era and together Ashe and Graebner lead the US to it's first Davis Cup in years. After that though, while Ashe went on to a respectable career, Graebner slipped into obscurity. But in this book, McPhee has preserved a moment in time when the two were evenly matched on the court, despite being polar opposites off of the court and in charting the lives that brought them to that moment, he provides a penetrating glance at two fascinating men.This is a real pinnacle in Sports writing.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"To say John McPhee has written the best tennis book ever is to say too little. This is far more than a tennis book and, if you're looking for instruction, far less. The platform, if you'll excuse the tennis pun, is a U.S. Open final between Clark Graebner and Arthur Ashe, but it is a study of two men and what brought them to this point, athletically but especially sociologically. The reflective Southerner forced to be a pioneer because he is black. The more rigid son of the Midwest and privilege, with greater power and less versatility. The vagaries that make them human: Graebner, the more up-tight, gambling with a prepared point successfully at a crucial spot in the match. And at the end, there is Ashe, triumphantly whistling a winner off his suspect backhand to close out the match. You want to cheer. And you understand more about people than when you opened the book."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"This book is so gracefully written that it isn't till the end that one realizes that McPhee's writing style(s) has been imitating the players' tennis styles, and that his language has moved effortlessly intune with the 'Levels of the Game'. Inlight of Arthur ashe's death, the book acheives a new poignancy."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"In Levels of the Game, John McPhee once again creates narrative structure out of his subject matter, in this case, a tennis match. The book is ostensibly about a single game of tennis played by Arthur Ashe, the first great black tennis player and one of the best tennis players of all time, and Clark Graebner, a white tennis player who was Ashe's rival for many years on the amateur circuit.McPhee develops the two men as the opposite of each other: liberal v conservative, black v white, calm v emotional. And the narrative takes this another step. Just as the tennis ball bounces back and forth in a match, so does McPhee bounce back and forth between his two subjects, Ashe and Graebner, race and tennis. McPhee wants to draw a parallel between a person's background and their tennis-playing style, and for the most part, he succeeds.As any reader of nonfiction knows, John McPhee writes perfect sentences, does unparalleled research, and crafts his books like a master carpenter. Levels of the Game has all these typical McPhee traits, is easy to read, and full of insight. On the other hand, by todays standards, the book is awkward. The shifts back and forth from Ashe to Grabner, from past to present, become jarring over time, and some of McPhee's sentences are unusually stiff and formal, almost academic.Levels of the Game is a book about sports the way that Friday Night LightsFriday Night Lightsis a book about sports. It uses the game as a window into something else, an attempt to describe two very different men, and all that they represent in America in 1968."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"\\"Levels of the Game\\" is, on the surface, an account of a single match between Arthur Ashe and Clark Graebner in the semifinals at the U.S. Open in Forest Hills. But as the title suggests, a game --- any game, at any degree of competition --- is not just about competence. How you play is a revelation of character; how you play is who you are.It's on all the other levels that this is a great book --- one of the greatest you may ever read, period. First, because of the subject. Arthur Ashe was not the Jackie Robinson of tennis; when he emerged in the 1960s, he was the only African-American player of note in America. Clark Graebner was a dentist's son and a ringer for Clark Kent. As it happened, Ashe and Graebner were both best-of-breed. It's not inaccurate to say that they were friends. But you can't miss the notion that they are also archetypes: privileged white kid from Ohio vs. against-all-odds black kid from Virginia.In a mere 146 pages, John McPhee --- you know his byline from a zillion profiles in The New Yorker, many of them mesmerizing, some beyond dull, but all meticulously reported and more carved than written --- has pulled off a literary coup. He has written an account of the match that's thrilling sports reporting. After, he clearly interviewed Ashe and Graebner at length, for he recreates what they were thinking and feeling at every key point in the match. And then he goes still deeper, talking to parents and wives, coaches and mentors, so he can deliver acute biographies of each player and a revelatory portrait of a sport --- and a nation --- in transition.A mediocre writer would construct this book with long passages in italics. Or chapters that pull us out of the match and take us back to Virginia or Ohio. Well, you don't write a book called \\"Levels of the Game\\" without being aware of the levels of your craft --- and knowing that, when you settle yourself at the keyboard, you can play at a championship level.Which is not to say that the book reads like \\"great writing\\". Just the opposite. It reads like great storytelling. There are no flights of language. It's just great reporting. And then, for a paragraph or a page, the telling of a story that takes place far from Forest Hills that helps to explain why Ashe or Graebner are playing a certain way or having certain thoughts about their match.The biographical, historical and psychological passages are surprising. And thrilling --- you will be amazed at what Ashe had to overcome, and who helped, and how it worked out. And the same for Graebner, though, of course, the challenges are considerably smaller. But what's most exhilarating is when the strands merge, and you're both in the match and inside the players' heads. Like this:Now the thought crosses Graebner's mind that Ashe has not missed a service return in this game. The thought unnerves him a little. He hits a big one four feet too deep, then bloops his second serve with terrible placement right into the center of the service court. He now becomes the mouse, Ashe the cat. With soft, perfectly placed shots, Ashe jerks him around the forecourt, then closes off the point with a shot to remember. It is a forehand, with top spin, sent cross court so lightly that the ball appears to be flung rather than hit. Its angle to the net is less than ten degrees --- a difficult brilliant stroke, and Ashe hit it with such nonchalance that he appeared to be thinking of something else. Graebner feels the implications of this. Ashe is now obviously loose. Loose equals dangerous. When a player is loose, he serves and volleys at his best level. His general shotmaking ability is optimum. He will try anything. 'Look at the way he hit that ball, gave it the casual play,' Graebner says to himself. 'Instead of trying a silly shot and missing it, he tries the silly shot and makes it.'Notice what's missing: the construction \\"he thought\\". McPhee has no need to step back from the moment and use that writerly qualification. He knows what Graebner thinks --- he's writing from authority. And so every word can drive the narrative forward. The writing has the power and velocity of the game it describes.Everyone who likes tennis even a little will savor and learn from this book. But even more, anyone who likes good writing --- or aspires to write well --- should clutch \\"Levels of the Game\\" like a lifeline. The way you learn to write, after all, is to read great writing and imitate it until you break through to a style of your own. If that's your game, start here."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"Reading this book in 2011 was really interesting. 1968 was the year of the Big Bang for tennis with the onset of the Open era.The whole character of this match between Ashe and Graebner feels like a period piece. Imagine at the time, being 6 foot tall was pretty tall for tennis. Nowadays, if you are not at least 6 foot you are short for this game. Back then, serve-and-volley was the dominant style of playing. Nowadays, it has completely disappeared. When is the last time you saw a guy rush the net routinely on his second serve? Well, maybe Taylor Dent a couple of years ago. That's when playing against a modern returner like Robin Soderling, Dent hardly picked up a game per set in two consecutive devastating losses. In other words, the standard style of play in 1968 is now obsolete. That's probably because 3 out of 4 of the Grand Slam tournaments were played on grass. Now, only Wimbledon is. And, they changed the quality of the grass and the pressure of the balls to slow down the game. Also back then, they did not play tie breakers. Sets could go on forever (scores like 10-8, 12-10 were not uncommon). Additionally, out of the 128 men field I think only one of them had a two-handed backhand (Cliff Drysdale who had a most formidable backhand at the time).Despite the book historical interest, I felt like the book had a few weaknesses.First, why politicize the game in the most meaningless way. The concept of Graebner playing conservatively like a Republican and Ashe more deliberately like a Democrat was the most vapid framework.Second, McPhee picked up the wrong match. The 1968 US Open was among the greatest tennis tournaments of all time. The Ashe-Graebner match up was one of the dull ones compared to a cocktail of sensational match ups. The final between Ashe and Tom Okker was a far better match than Ashe-Graebner. Ashe ran into probably one of the most talented players of all time. Okker was a short, light footed, speedy, versatile, elegant Dutchman whose game most resembled Federer. Ashe barely won in 5 sets. If you wanted politics, you could get a lot more drama in the intense match between Cliff Drysdale from South Africa (in the days of the apartheid) vs Ashe. For a battle of the generations, the Pancho Gonzales - Tom Okker match must have been pretty great too. Okker won it in a tough 4 set battle. But, Gonzales must have been more than 15 years older.

This is among several McPhee books that are worth looking at closely, for anyone who loves to write-or loves to read."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"Written for the New Yorker magazine in 1969, this 150 page sports 'classic' has all the punch-and-jab terseness that makes John McPhee's writing both immediate and immediately recognizable. It's fun to read, no question. And it has a way of implying that more is at stake than the ostensible subject of investigation, although McPhee is often artfully cagey about declaring what that \\"more\\" might be.\\"Levels of the Game\\" is constructed around a point-by-point account of a single tennis match played in 1968 by Arthur Ashe and Clark Graebner, an African-American and a German-American who were the soul of the championship American Davis Cup team, playing both as singles and as doubles partners. Ashe and Graebner were as much friends as fiercely competitive rivals can ever be, despite their markedly different personalities and world-views. Graebner, the 'spoiled' scion of a conservative Christian dentist, plays stiff and predictable power tennis, \\"Republican tennis\\" as it were. Ashe, also a 'privileged child' despite his color and father's illiteracy, is \\"bold, loose, liberal, flat-out Democratic.\\" Several critics have made McPhee's point more explicitly than McPhee would ever do: \\"You are the way you play.\\"Like the volleys of an exciting match, the profiles of Ashe and Graebner - their childhoods, their fathers, their training in life and tennis, their quirks and virtues - are lobbed back and forth between the points of the game, from Ashe's first serve to Ashe's last winning stroke. McPhee is crafty; he depicts both men with implicit admiration and maintains as judicious an air of impartiality as an nominee for the Supreme Court under hostile questioning. But there's little doubt about whom he assumes HIS readers will root for, and his tone shows it. Ashe's victory - Ashe's whole career - was a triumph of Civil Rights in America over the forces of stand-pat hold-on-to-your own conservatism. Anyone who doesn't cheer when Ashe scores a point in this match has totally missed the point.When McPhee wrote this book, in 1969, it must have seemed that the societal match which it symbolized was almost over, almost won. Racism had 'charged the net' in the South of Wallace and Faubus, and the ball had been lobbed out of reach. Watching the ads on TV today, couple-watching on the streets of American cities, noting the approval ratings of the First Couple in the White House, one could indeed say that Ashe's victory was prophetic of America's racial Redemption. \\"Game, set, match to Lieutenant Ashe,\\" McPhee wrote; \\"When the stroke is finished, he is standing on his toes, his arms flung open, wide, and high.\\"However, if we take this historic match as an analogy for the cultural match-up between conservatism and liberalism, McPhee's success as an oracle is less clear. In 1969 perhaps, the egalitarian ideals of the New Deal and the Great Society might have seemed pervasive and permanent. The 'loose' liberalism expressed in Ashe's tennis was the preferred style of American youth, and the tight hind-end game played by Graebner didn't stand a chance.Ahh, that was before the Culture Wars, before the 'Southern Strategy', before Reaganism and Ollie North, before egalitarian idealism got lost in the Bushes. What McPhee didn't foresee was that Clark Graebner's 'Republican tennis' could claw and scratch, rage and pout, and make a comeback. After all, they play how they are."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"This was my first John McPhee book, selected because of its subject matter (I'm an ex-serious tennis player). John McPhee was recommended to me as a writer/essayist who can take any subject and write about it intelligently and interestingly. After finishing this book, I would agree with that characterization, but clarify that the subject in this particular book is not professional tennis or even the game of tennis but rather two people and how they have managed their lives. That they play tennis is the point around which the book comes together, but it is not the point on which the book stands. If you're looking for insight into the game of junior/professional tennis, try David Foster Wallace's great essay about Michael Joyce in _A Supposedly Fun Thing..._. If you're looking for insight into two particularly interesting people--Arthur Ashe is one of them, but his compatriot and opponent, whose name, of course, I have forgotten, is worth equal time--in a particularly interesting time period and situation, check this book out."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"Though I enjoyed this slim booklet, I found it rather dated, even antiquated in the portrayal of the two tennis players.

It's a short book, very quick read, and I found it relevant even in 2010 as a 30 something reader who was too young to follow these players n their prime."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"As a longtime tennis fan and nerd extraordinaire, I had a thought sometime last year that I had neither owned nor read too much tennis literature. I quickly set out to rectify that situation, and I've been fortunate enough to have a pretty sizable library of tennis books (and other sports too, for that matter - thank you Amazon!). Before buying these books, I looked up reviews and tried to get a good idea of what would be worth a read. Throughout the many lists I viewed, this book popped up over and over again. You can't go wrong with Levels of the Game, the masses said. Levels of the Game - it's great. It's one of the best tennis books of all time, one of Sports Illustrated's best 100 sports books of all time, etc, etc. I got the picture, and it was one of my first purchases. However, upon reading it, I got the sinking feeling that I wasn't enjoying it as much as I was \\"supposed\\" to, I guess, and it hasn't really improved upon subsequent readings. I'll attempt to explain why, hopefully without being too critical (I'd probably still recommend this book overall).First, the good news: I can always respect it when a piece of work is influential, even if I don't always get it myself. This book is TREMENDOUSLY influential. Jon Wertheim's Strokes of Genius and Marshall Jon Fisher's excellent A Terrible Splendor are but two of the tennis books that have been written with the format of Levels of the Game in mind - I'm sure there are probably others. The influence is so great that it's spread to other sports, as well - I read an interview with Mark Bowden, author of The Best Game Ever (about the 1958 Colts/Giants NFL title game) in which he stated that Levels of the Game was a heavy influence on his work. So clearly, John McPhee had to have done something well for the influence of this book to endure for so long.Secondly, although it's not explicitly made clear in the text, McPhee was able to sit down individually with both players and review a tape of the match. So the thoughts and ideas that run through each player's head as the match progresses are not fictional or conjured - they are exactly what each player was thinking at the time, straight from the horse's mouth. This is an advantage that McPhee has that Wertheim and Fisher didn't have, for different reasons - in the case of Wertheim's book, players are much less accessible than in the late 60s (and the wound was probably still too raw for Federer, anyway). In Fisher's case, both principals were deceased by the time he wrote his book. So that's a clear coup in the case of this book, for the better. And the concept of people playing tennis the same way that they express their personalities (Ashe as the liberal free-swinger, Graebner as the conservative who only takes calculated risks) is an interesting one that may have some truth to it.So why am I not quite as enamored with it as most people seem to be? Quite a few reasons, but I'll try to make this already-lengthy review concise. This book, in my opinion, is HIGHLY disjointed. There's a part around the middle of it in which I had to read about three or four times, it was so unclear to me (and yeah, you can call me an idiot for this - that's fine). Based on the context, it would seem that Clark Graebner is clearly talking about his father in one paragraph, but the next paragraph begins with a lengthy quote that is not attributed to anyone, in which someone is talking about their father being barely able to read or write. Well, it can't be Graebner's dad, since he's \\"Dr. Graebner,\\" right? But the subject is never once mentioned as shifting back to Arthur speaking about his dad - you only learn it if you read on and pick it up through context. It's implied that this is the case, but not spelled out. Maybe this is the sort of writing that requires a level of intelligence that I don't possess, but I guess I just need things like that spelled out. I don't enjoy reading lengthy unattributed quotes and essentially playing a guessing game as to who said what.And really, that's my primary complaint with the book. I feel like the other books that have taken this framework have done a much better job in clearly delineating when the main event is happening and when the surrounding circumstances are the focus. This book has long stretches of bouncing back and forth between seemingly unrelated stretches of the match itself and unattributed quotes, which is something that happens throughout. It helps that the other tennis books divide the chapters according to sets, which makes for more organized reading, in my opinion. The other issue is, as the reviewer Gaetan Lion noted, is that the match itself is not all that interesting. Don't get me wrong: I grew up idolizing Pete Sampras, and the 2001 Ivanisevic/Rafter Wimbledon final is still one of my all-time favorite matches. So I'm very familiar with serve and volley tennis. But it's not a style that translates well into literature. The longest rally of the match is described as being a mere 10 strokes, if I'm not mistaken. Nothing really exciting or noteworthy happens in the match itself; in fact, if it weren't for this book, the match probably would have been lost in the annals of time.Despite my reservations, this is an important part of literary tennis history, and it's cheap enough that, if you're curious, I would ultimately still recommend picking this up. But is it REALLY better than what it went on to inspire? Is it the pinnacle of all tennis books? I don't think so. Perhaps you'll disagree and see its merits more clearly than myself."},{"Title":"Levels of the game","review":"I think its a very interesting book for those interested in the history of tennis. Not much relevance now. Interesting stuff about Arthur Ashe. Probably one of the least popular books written by McPhee though."},{"Title":"Advertising Theory and Practice","review":"The book starts with an overview that spans over the basic essence and inception of advertising and slowly the author migrates into the concept of advertising and how it got matured over the time. These are illustrated by examples of advertisments released in few decades. The book targets on fundamnetal advertising principles which need to be understood like Knowledge of the consumers, products or markets. There is a breif stint with creative startegies that can be used to gather response to advertising. The author also touches media planning in significant detail. To some extent an attempt has been made to quantify the advertisng results.Overall an interesting reading as it provides sufficient insight to advertising as a subject and there are examples that help understanding betteer."},{"Title":"The Politics of Retribution in Europe","review":"It's an old and acknowledged saw that \\"to the victors go the spoils\\". What should be added to this splendidly commonplace bit of street lore is the similarly well-acknowledged fact that it is indeed the victors who get to write and thereby promulgate the official version of history, interpreting it to their advantage, giving it such spin, direction, and body language as needed to serve the perceived needs and political purposes of the present. In this sense the historical treatment of the past, especially the recent past, tells us volumes about what forces exist to warp into particular forms and modes today. This is especially true in this absorbing and well-edited series of essays by a number of noted historians and critics relating to the subject of the relative merits of the retribution process in Europe following the conclusion of the Second World War.As is likely true for all conflicts, the punishment delivered in the aftermath of the war was by no means fair, equitable, or necessarily deserved by those it was haphazardly visited upon, and some who deserved to be punished walked away unblemished, while others who did nothing wrong were falsely accused and punished. Indeed, one of the consistent themes in these essays is the degree to which the captive people of Europe engaged in what has to be recognized as being a widespread accommodation and cooperation with the Nazi authorities and their lackeys. Yet although their were obvious many who escaped getting their just desserts, and many more who were unfairly castigated and punished, by and large the effort at social retribution after the war appears to have served a wider and more useful role in expiating the collective guilt and anxiety that literally permeated the continent in the wake of the war's end.This is a fine collection of essays that seek to address the complex welter of needs, drives, and issues that had to be settled in the postwar period, and among the competing strands of thoughts and arguments one finds that the historical interpretation of the past was indeed manipulated and bastardized, often at the expense of specific groups and individuals, who had to suffer the continuing social indifference to the injuries they had suffered, or worse, the accusation and punishment for deeds they either did not commit, or that they had committed in such a strange and sordid set of constraining circumstances that to make an issue our of it was existentially absurd. It is in this sense that a kind of selective amnesia overtook many of the survivors, such that they repressed the ugly truth in favor of more palatable and pleasing fictions.Of course, many of the issues discussed here are neither fully resolved nor completely played out. Just as many of the events of the war itself found their genesis in attitudes and cultural predispositions formed long before the war, so too, do many of the issues and dilemmas of the present find their antecedents in facts and circumstances located in postwar activities, and these may never be resolved. Whether talking about ethnic differences within a specific country or cultural predispositions existing between reviving cultures, many of the complex issues and concerns threading through these essays may never be resolved. This is a fascinating and quite worthwhile book, and one I am sure you would benefit from. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Politics of Retribution in Europe","review":"Mention of the killings of Jews in postwar Hungary (Judt, p. 321) needs further elaboration, as it refutes the common claim that this happened only in postwar Poland. The two articles by Jan Thomas Gross detract considerably from the remaining ones. The title of this review has an intentional double meaning, as Gross shows us the depths of convoluted reasoning that Polonophobes willingly go through to unfairly blame Poles for not aiding more Jews. More Poles are honored at Yad Vashem for saving Jews than any other nationality. Paulsson (SECRET CITY) has shown that, at least for Warsaw's Jews, the limiting factor in Jewish survival was the infrequency of Jews fleeing the ghettoes. It was NOT Polish \\"inaction\\". Nor was it the rate of Polish betrayal of fugitive Jews. Had more Jews sought Polish help, more Jews would have been saved.Gross cites some indicators of the \\"diffuse hostility of Poles to Jews' and then, without any evidence, jumps to the conclusion that this made Poles disinclined to help Jews. In fact, the acknowledged anti-Semitic beliefs of many Polish rescuers of Jews argue for the opposite. The long history of considerable Jewish disloyalty to Poland, the most recent instance of which was the large-scale Jewish-Soviet collaboration against Poles (Gross' attempts to minimize it notwithstanding) was a major cause of Polish hostility to Jews.Gross would have us believe that, since Poles already defied the German-imposed death penalty in numerous ways, they could just as easily have defied it by saving many more Jews--had they only wanted to. But his equating of various risky behaviors carrying the death penalty is transparently ridiculous, and he, being from Poland, should know better (unless, of course, he has discarded all semblance of objectivity). Gross disingenuously cites Polish incurrence of the death penalty through considerable \\"black marketeering\\". Common sense teaches that it is incomparably easier to hide contraband food than to hide (and feed) a living fugitive Jewish human being. The same holds for livestock slaughtered without German authorization, firearms, radios, and other verboten objects. Assuredly, the Germans directed far greater attention to fugitive Jews than to Polish \\"black marketers\\". Also, Gross overlooks the fact that German officials could often be bribed to spare from death a Pole who was caught \\"black marketeering\\", etc., but seldom for helping a Jew.Gross also falsely conflates the risk of Polish participation in the Underground with that of hiding Jews. In actuality, successful participation in the Underground required one to live an inconspicuous double life that was in some ways the opposite of the overt risky behaviors necessary to save Jews. Numerous Polish guerillas nevertheless fell into German hands. Gross also exaggerates the significance of Poles covering up for each other. Contrary to Gross' selectively quoted anecdotes, membership in the Underground was a closely-guarded secret. Even close neighbors often had no inkling of each other's involvement in the Underground until they both came out in open warfare during Operation Burza (Tempest) during the closing months of the German occupation.Despite significant efforts by the Underground to hide them, some 50% of all educated Poles were found and murdered by the Germans. Hiding a fugitive Jew from the Germans was far harder than hiding a fugitive Pole, as most Polish Jews had easily recognizable characteristics, and didn't blend readily into Polish society. Gross also ignores the fact that all Polish Underground activity was carefully weighed for maximum military benefit for the cost in terms of German reprisals. More extensive assistance to Jews would have triggered commensurate German action against Poles, and excessive incitement of German terror, resulting from any Underground action(s), would have discredited the Underground in the eyes of the Polish population.Gross engages in blatant circular reasoning when he (selectively) cites some Polish rescuers of Jews who claim not to have been intimidated by the death penalty in order to \\"prove\\" its unimportance in the rescue of Jews. That's like going to a convention of blue-car owners, and, examining the cars parked there, arguing that all US cars are blue. Most absurd of all is Gross' mention of the Warsaw Uprising as evidence of the irrelevance of the death penalty in informing Polish conduct. In actuality, the Uprising was planned to eject the Germans within a few days, with minimal casualties, just prior to the arrival of the Red Army. No one could have foreseen the Soviet betrayal and ensuing 63-day agony, the deaths by combat and murder of a quarter million Poles, and subsequent destruction of Warsaw by vindictive Germans.Gross takes a cheap shot at Polish heroism by falsely asserting that the absence of a collaborationist government in Poland was only due to Germans unwillingness. In actuality, Prince Janusz Radziwill and several other semi-prominent Poles were approached by the Germans as prospective Quislings for a (...) Polish puppet state, but they all refused (Lukas. 1986. THE FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST, pp. 111-113). (Nor is it correct that Poles eschewed organized collaboration because of the brutality of German conduct against them. Other Slavic untermenschen were treated little better, yet some of them formed organized collaborationist units).Ironically and unwittingly, Gross undermines two canons of conventional Holocaust thinking: The one that belittles Polish suffering (e. g. \\"collateral damage\\"), and the one that insinuates that Poles implicitly led quasi-normal lives (\\"spectators\\" of the Jewish catastrophe). According to Gross, Poles could never have survived on the meager food rations allowed by the Germans (pp. 118-119; whence the Polish \\"black marketeering\\"). Moreover, German killing of Poles was so indiscriminate and widespread that Poles obedient to German dictates were little safer than violators. Sounds like Polish and Jewish victimization, on a per capita basis, was much less different than commonly portrayed! In any case, how can Poles be blamed for not saving more Jews when Poles themselves faced a desperate shortage of food, and were otherwise necessarily preoccupied with their OWN physical survival under the German occupation?"},{"Title":"The Merry Widow : Complete Score for Piano and Voice in English","review":"The Merry Widow was an important model for the innovators of a burgeoning new style of Lyric drama, the American Musical. It had everything they wanted: lovely, hummable tunes, silly, broad, robust characters, romantic intrigue, even a happy ending. The Merry Widow was, in fact, an essential prototype of the American Musical. Dover Publications reprinted the Oliver Ditson edition from the early 20th century. It's a fine edition with a reliable piano reduction; not over-simplified, like some American turn-of-the-century piano reductions, but simple enough to reflect Lehar's orchestration accurately. It's easy to read, and, as always, darn near indestructable. The only problem with this Dover/Ditson reprint is that, in place of the original German text, it offers a Victorian English text rather too quaint for modern production. This isn't a major problem however. It shouldn't be too much trouble simply to scribble in a skillful modern translation, say Sheldon Harnick's, provided, of course, you have his permission."},{"Title":"Deadly Remission","review":"This book was a real page-turner, a la Crichton.

Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic. If you want to read a book that is a window on the America of the late nineteenth century, or if you want an uplifting book about a man of faith and love, then I highly recommend that you get this book!"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I was very impressed with this book, it is well worthreading and makes you think just how much change for the better has occurred because of the effort of one incredible man."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"a movie needs to be done about this guy. dont listen to al sharpton- if booker t can do what he did, anyone can. i'd give it 5 stars but for the style of writing at the time leaves me wanting coffee"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"What can I say!

The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T.

Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters.

I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself. I do not buy many books; however, this book is one to keep for life. I am sure to refer to Mr. Washington's book in the future; Not just for historical content, but to keep me on track in life."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"...Up From Slavery Booker T. WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington. I recommend it to young kids who enjoy reading about history and how the slaves were freed."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I think Up from Slavery is a good book, its for all readers who want to learn about black heritage.

This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Very interesting perspective on slavery from someone who actually lived through it. All slave tales are not alike."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker T. Washington lived his life on target. He had a purpose and he made a lasting contribution. Washington was a Christian, a scholar, a motivator, a writer, an educator, a role model, a scientist, and more. Look at his life, what he wrote and how he approached life and you will see similarities between his thoughts and those of other achievers. Such individuals usually: read extensively, travel widely, and pursue education. This book is loaded with Christian success principles that transcend time and location. I found this book to be extremely inspiring. What would BTW do if he had the internet?"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"A fascinating read about the life and times of Booker T. Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T. Washington to bridge the gap between what was and what was to be. He knew his role and peformed it well."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"a good read with much information from the early america era. Booker T. Washington use the brain over violence and suceeded where others failed. excellent read.!!!!"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"What is most striking about Washington's autobiographical account of his rise from slavery to revered statesman is his lack of resentment toward white culture. Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a 16 year old female...Upon looking through the history section of the store I discovered &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book.Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success.&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington and his role in shaping the free life we as americans, live today. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \\"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \\"freedom\\" meant \`I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \\"live by their wits\\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \\"made it\\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \\"made it.\\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \\"a job well done.\\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \\"Talented Tenth\\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \\"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \\"educated fool\\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \\"But we've come so far!\\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \\"reverse engineer\\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \\"accommodating Uncle Tom\\" and get to work."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound. All in all, this is an upbeat, inspiring story from a man who truly defied the odds, and his winning attitude is sorely needed today."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"&quot;Up From Slavery&quot; brought to light the real deal behind the man Booker T. Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur. So, in using every resource available including accommodation, Washington underhandedly promoted social and racial equality for all."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker Washington rose to fame as a great American because of his intense understanding of the American system of government and his ability to stay focused. Booker obviously understood the impact of slavery on his race and that freedom alone was not enough in a country that did not respect that freedom. Booker's ideology coincided with that of Frederick Douglas who would have made the speech at the Atlanta Exposition, but he died earlier that year.Booker's speech was &quot;nationalistic&quot; as he told his listeners to be as seperate as the fingers on the hand and to cast down your buckets where you are. It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line. The other 10% were free, yet not free. Tuskegee (Institute) University attests to his abilites as a monument builder. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a story within a story. Booker T. Washinton, according to Louis Harlan was a &quot;wizard&quot;. Even W.E.B. Dubois in his latter years, prior to joining the Communist Party began to agree with many of Washington's philosophies.

READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept. The majority of people never open a book (non-fiction) after they leave school! I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning! This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race. The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Alina Stanton Nov.15Up From SlaveryThe author of this book is Booker T. Washington. This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education.

Washington is a well mannered, honorable man."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker T.

Every one of the members found the book to be very inspirational when they read it. Booker T. Washington was certainly a intelligent man and a great thinker. We found his notes very easy to read and they did flow even though he was a bit hesitant to publish his story from his notes written when he traveled around the country. What a great man. We learned about the book from another book club so there are others also using it as a book club read. It was uplifting to hear from a slave child-man something good about the outcome of his life. His vision for the future still should apply to the children today of all races in America.Thank you Amazon for offering this book.

Washington. Turns out it's a fabulous book and I have since recommended it to many many friends. An amazing man, an amazing life, a global role model.

I find these books to be very interesting, just to give me a little more knowledge on my history and hope to learn something that i don't already know."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Washington was born into slavery as a result of his mother having been raped by her master. This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \\"Black politician.\\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \\"raise yourself by your boot strap\\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \\"the Great Booker T. Washington.\\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \\"accommodationist,\\" \\"or \\"the great compromiser,\\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \\"Uncle Tom,\\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \\"selling his people out.\\" By making a \\"virtue, out of personal necessity,\\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \\"manual arts,\\" and \\"the trades.\\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \\"stooge\\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \\"the white man,\\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;, a state of Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read books.This book is 100% available for free reading, on internet.This book was writen about 100 years ago, by an african-american , Booker T. Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \\"World of Yesterday\\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it. Washigton is so complaicent, the man was not even angry with white people for four hundred years of slavery. The debate between Washington and WEB DuBois is famous: Wash. wanted black people to forgive and forget and continue to be the southerners work dogs. DuBois wanted the negro race to embrace higher education and follow in the footsteps of wealthy Americans like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Which plan was better for uplifting a race? It depends upon which direction the country was going at the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography! All he talks about is his school. He mentions his wife and kids only once or twice. I got the impression that he was a very selfish man.

Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book is hard to get into at first because Washington, in my opinion, isn't the greatest writer. He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM! I didn't think the book was too great or very informative at all."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself. I'm not sure that I am yet convinced, however. The work often seems a little bit on the acquiescent side to me."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book was the most boring book I have ever read. There was no point to the whole book, because all he talked about was his accomplishments and things that other people wrote about him. This book has no suspenseful or interesting parts in it.

Washington is not a very good writer (which isn't surprising because he had very little education). Booker T. Washington was born a slave--interesting, was emancipated by Abraham Lincoln, then traveled from West Virginia to Virginia to go to school, graduated and then eventually got invited to start his own school in Alabama. So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting? He didn't escape a slave or anything like that, he was emancipated like everyone else and then went to school like many people did--nothing interesting. Why don't we all just write autobiographies about ourselves because we feel like it?"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This is an excellent book.

My first interest in this book was to understand how the Tuskeege school started because I am one of the privliged americans that can trace the education of my ancestors back to the begining classes of the institute. As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong? For that answer I will have to continue to research and speak to the elder members of my family because I just can't understand how we went from one united beliefe of education to the fight of our civil rights."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker T.

Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was \\"learn a useful trade.\\" As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book! It's an excellent portrait of America in the late 19th century, and it will surprise you at many turns."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I devoured this book on my newly purchased Kindle! I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them. I can dig that.Overall, this was a great read! A great start to my kindle love affair! :)"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I've long wanted to read this book and finally did in two days. It was a rewarding experience. Booker T. Washington was a great man born into slavery, into abject poverty, on a plantation in Virginia. He never knew his father or even his birthday. Washington was six or seven years old when the War Between the States ended. He lived in a slave cabin with his mother, his older brother John, his younger brother and sister, and an orphan boy. His mother, the cook for the \\"big house\\" was an illiterate as most slaves were, but a strong woman of common sense who cared for her family as best she could. Their cabin was primitive with a dirt floor no windows and poorly protected from the elements.After the war Booker moved with his mother and step father to West Virginia where he was put to work in the salt mines. Determined to get some schooling he did so at night with great difficulty.Washington heard about a school for Negroes in Virginia called Hampton. He set out on foot with 50 cents in his pocket. He eventually reached Hampton and went to school there working his way through as a janitor.Booker T. Washington met race prejudice, poverty, and illiteracy and overcame all of these obstacles.He went on to establish Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for his people. It educated boys and girls not only in academics but in agriculture and useful trades. He started the school from nothing raising all the money from contributions and the hard work of he and his students.

Washington was a great American.Washington was born into slavery, freedom came when he was about six years old. As a child, he worked at farming and coal mining, while he sought an education. All of this time he lived in base poverty.After saving what little money he could, he set out from his home in West Virginia, for a black school in Virginia. The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book. Washington overcame enormous odds with intense ambition; he wanted to do his &quot;level best&quot; everyday.I found his story to be the real thing, the real item in...get this...motivational literature. Of all the self-help books published today, Washington's autobiography reads realistic and true for courage, solid advice, and practical solutions.Washington takes the large view to the race problems of his day. He is more concerned with building better human beings, male and female, regardless of race. His strategies with his students involved enforcing basic health care, instilling focused, daily discipline habits, providing vocational and academic training, and always presenting an overreaching concern for helping others achieve their highest potential. THAT is the good life."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I found the book to be strange in some regards. Professor Washington seemed to harbor no bad feelings toward any Southerner, or even his former owners. That aside, the book is very interesting. His point of view on slavery and Southern race relations are unlike any other I've heard. Regardless of what another review says, he was definately not a selfish person in any way. He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Up from Slavery, autobiography by Booker T. Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \\"A Slave Among Slaves\\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \\"The Great Accomodator.\\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T.

This autobiography begins with Mr. Washington's childhood where he grew up as a slave, and continues throughout his adult life. Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \\"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves. Being born a slave was a major set back in their lives. Booker was determined to received and education at any cost, and he succeeded. Nothing was handed to him. Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race. Together they worked to build one of the finest educational institution in the south-Tuskegee, renamed Tuskegee University."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \\"bringing up the black race\\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book!

The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \\"Up From Slavery\\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \\"Up From Slavery\\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \\"offensive write-up\\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \\"critical\\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \\"lacked depth\\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \\"Up From Slavery\\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in early American history."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \\"Up From Slavery\\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \\"Up From Slavery\\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \\"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \\"Up From Slavery\\" \`s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \\"Up From Slavery\\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book has opened my eyes to the socialization of the so called \\"Negro \\".

Say it loud...."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Of my father I know even less than of my mother. I do not even know his name. I have heard reports to the effect that he was a white man who lived on one of the near-by plantations. Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time. - Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (Chapter 1)Booker T. Washington gives us all the blueprint for how an African man can succeed in the American system. He must forgive any person in power who wrongs him, his family, and/or his community. In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering. If an African man shows any of the attitudes mentioned or a combination of those attitudes, he will succeed in the current American system. You do not have to look to the most famous examples to see African men twisting themselves out of their minds, just look around you, these men are closer than you think."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I knew next to nothing about Booker T. Washington prior to reading this book. Now I feel honored to have had his story shared with me. Despite the risk of sounding cliche, he has become an inspiration and hero to me. If not for his convictions and spirit, he would have been quite ordinary. Instead, he accomplished incredible goals, overcoming unimaginable feats, and has reached an inumerable amount of people, generation after generation. This book is a mainstay on my bedside table. Required reading for all."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Black South Africans have been deprived of educational system for a very long time. Reading this autobiography I'm inspired to teach as much as I've learn to others less fortunate. And I may end up being a career academic like Booker T as well. Having started a career in public speaking before reading this book I feel even more inspired to continue this pursuit because its such an effective tool. Booker T was a master orator from his own accounts. Surely all the invitations received (with no marketing or self-promotion) is a testament to his skill as an orator. Slow but sure progress is made. The language is easy to understand yet the structure is complex because there are lessons to be learnt on many levels. I highly recommend this book to all non-white South African especially those of mixed decent and black people in general. Booker T was what is called in modern South Africa a \\"coloured\\" person. He has a white father and a black mother."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Washington potrays a resilient and resourceful man in his autobiography, \\"Up from Slavery.\\" With little formal education as a child, his abilities and outward accomplishments are astounding to read about. Tuskegee being the most well known, but not his only significant achievement.Stripped to its barest elements, Washington presents a philosophy that those with character and industry will succeed. Despite deep racism and prejudice, persistence in an American form of opportunity can result in success over time, as evidenced by Washington's life.Washinton makes no excuses and moves forward despite unfair and unreasonable treatment."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"A riveting account of Washington's extraordinary struggle fueled by boundless optimism.However, Washington's faith appears overly buoyant when he writes the following about the Ku Klux Klan: 'To-day there are no such organizations in the South, and the fact that such ever existed is almost forgotten by both races. There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"The name of the black school in my hometown was Booker T.

This book should be required reading in every high school in America. I read it with awe on my Kindle Fire, then ordered hardback copies for my children. From the beginning as Booker T. Washington gives us a glimpse of his life as a slave boy in Hale's Ford, Virginia, thru the emancipation and his journey to West Virginia where he worked in mines and onto his quest to receive an education, you will be riveted to this exciting book. As a caucasian from the north, I had never heard of the great institution he founded called Tuskegee. If you enjoy biography and memoir, don't miss this one. Black history in America is vital information we all need.Booker T. was born somewhere between 1856 and 1858. He never knew his white father. His mother was a cook for her owners and she had three children. They lived in a tiny shack with a dirt floor until emancipation set them free. Poor and uneducated the little family walked to Malden, West Virginia where they lived with a step father. The rest of the book continues to enthrall as Booker T. overcame unsurmountable obstacles and eventually became a distinguished educator and founder of Tuskegee Institute. Read all about it! See if you agree with his philosphy. Discuss this book with others. Although Booker T. received many honors there were those who disagreed with his methods of educating his race after the Civil War. I'll never understand why."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"You really have to read this book is bringing a lot of things you really didn't even know, read it"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Here is a black American who realized that through hard work he could accomplish his dream.

Washington has been one of my all-time favorite American heroes -- ever since I first read about him in 4th grade. Washington had a gift for writing, and his autobiography, as well as his essays, are very easy to read, understand, and enjoy. The more I study and learn about him, the more impressed I am with his vision, his integrity, and his drive to improve his people and their lot in life."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker T. Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus THREE stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book has an inspiring message, and gives a viewpoint that is not often looked at.

This book needs to be required reading for all high school and college students!"},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"The legacy of Booker T. Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \\"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \\"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \\"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful. Recommended to all who love a good autobiography, and even to those who don't."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book is an excellent addition to the Sons of Liberty series for homeschooling students. Great for doing a book report."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \\"least offensive\\" is another reader's \\"Uncle Tom\\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This book reminds us of the great truth, that hard work will always in the end be rewarded.

Washington has always been a figure that history teachers use, in my opinion, to support the so-called &quot;Good&quot; African-Americans. In other words, those who don't cause trouble. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; displays this side of Mr. Washington. This book is worth reading because of Booker's determination that allowed him to rise above his former conditions. Yet, one can't help but get the feeling that he is all-to-ready to forget what has happened to him. Booker continues to explain, rather naively, in my opinion, how racism is to soon be erased. I feel it's unfortunate how things later came to contradict his predicitons, but he is foolishly optimistic. Overall, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a decent book, but occasionally tedious."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Booker T. Washington wrote a lively narrative of his life that deserves our attention today. The first couple of pages are startling for the nonchalant way he relates that he doesn't know the year of his birth, nor the exact location, nor with certainty who his father was. He does, on the other hand, describe the tiny dimensions to the cabin where he lived and what life was like for the slaves. Washington went on from these humble beginnings to a fine education and a life of meritoriously helping fellow negroes to improve their education and vocational endeavors. This book is a good reminder of the stark conditions and large barriers present for slaves making the transition to free members of society following the Civil War."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"What an outstanding autobiography regarding a true American heroe! This book details the triumphant acts of Booker T. Washington's efforts to not only develop the famous Tuskegee Institute, but to positively build bridges with America.

What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students.

More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \\"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \\"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \\"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\\"Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery is an American classic. It is the true life story of a little slave boy who grew up to become one of the finest leaders for his race."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"I had never read anything written by or even about Booker T. Washington before. He is not as religious as MLK, militarist as Malcolm X, and not as extreme as Jesse Jackson, etc...The person who resembles him the most is Nelson Mandela. His book is all about forgiveness and moving forward as one nation instead of many races."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This is a good view of a man who came from slavery to political prominence. He also grew up in an area where my mother frequently visited in her childhood. It's sad to see how jaded the world has become, since Mr. Washington lived and worked for education. He had such an optimistic view of the possibilities for his race that I can't see today. Maybe if we worked as hard as Mr. Washington in this era, we could make it, too."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"This is a wonderful bit of history that everyone should read.

It is fascinating to read Booker T. Washington's account of a childhood in slavery followed by his rise to national prominence as the founder of the Tuskegee Institute.While some may argue that Washington was naive and overly accomodating, I was amazed at his ability to forgive and see the best in people. He did not nurse grudges or let others bring him down. Whether or not you feel that he should have spoken up more for judicial equality, you have to admit that he was a strong, dedicated man of character.Everyone: white, black, brown, or any other shade, can benefit from reading the autobiography of this great American."},{"Title":"Up From Slavery","review":"What a wonderful gift to give history buffs or African-Americans. Booker T. Washington began with nothing, not even a last name, and he drove himself to learn to read and become educated. I plan to read this book over and over, and I have highlighted several quotes that I intend to quote to my friends when they are complaining about trivial things. I also recommend the fictional The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, an Emancipated Slave, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones, a Fugitive Slave.

I was so excited since I was the eldest of four kids and always trying to find ways to help my working mother. No more simple dishwashing &amp; ironing for me! I was moving up to the position of family &quot;chef&quot;!My first attempt was the meat loaf recipe from that book. I followed every direction to the letter! And discovered two things: 1) Not everyone likes an entire tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in their meatloaf and 2) It's alright to alter a recipe to accomodate varied tastes.Even though my first meal largely became dog food for a dachshund, I went on to try many of the recipes in that book and it became a cherished part of my childhood. The recipes are given in clear detail with variation suggestions and photos to inspire and tantalize. The holiday suggestions in the back of the book were a particular favorite of mine.Basic cooking terms, measurements, kitchen utensils, kitchen safety and even table manners are discussed at the beginning of the book. This book has a wonderful &quot;retro&quot; feel giving everyone the feeling that Carol Brady, June Cleaver or some other perfect TV mom is about to come to the door to borrow a cup of sugar. Kids today can definitely benefit from the basic knowledge and simplicity of this book."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls Cookbook","review":"I got my first copy of this book in the late 50's or early 60s and cooked recipes weekly from this, maybe even 2 or 3 times a week (with luck). It was really ahead of its time since even now few cookbooks have recipes this good that can be prepared quickly...and far too many of them include trendy foods that kids won't touch. NOt this one. Just good basic fare- spaghetti, mashed potatoes, Tossed saland and lots of desserts.So many things set this cookbooks apart from the numrtous imitators that have come along. Real kids were used as \\"testers\\" and their opinions were actually quoted. Also, most of the recipes taste really good - to KIDS. Parents, however, may be less enthursiastic, perhaps because some of the recipes called for canned soup or some other form of packaged ingredient, rife with preservatives. But many also use fresh ingredients and the Chili is still a particular favorite of ours, being neither two spicy or too bland, all made from scratch. The Noodle Goulash and Basic Fried drumstricks are pretty good, too.The comments from the kids are priceless.(\\"Betty Crocker said not to worry about a crack in your nut bread...it's supposed to be there\\").Crocker was also ahead of her time by including illustrations of boys in the kitchen as often as girls, neatly sidestepping any sexual bias issues (although I doubt that was the intent).I confess I still use this book often since my kids simply love the food, from Peanut Butter Pudding to Mulligan Stew to Fruit Basket Upset."},{"Title":"Betty Crocker's New Boys and Girls Cookbook","review":"I received this cookbook as a gift when I was about six years old. I was much older when I really began to use it, but it is a great way to get children started cooking and gives clear instructions, a real plus for children and beginning cooks. The pictures are great and a real enticement to try the recipes.I now grind my own flour from whole grains and use only whole foods, so I wouldn't endorse the pre-packaged part of this book, but it's amazing how many of these are \\"convertable\\" to being made from sratch instead of with a cake or frosting mix. If you decide to do this, parents will HAVE to be involved, but in my opinion, parents should not turn their children loose in the kitchen until they've had some experience and the parents are confident they won't get hurt or set the house on fire!The recipes are very tasty and with the ease of the recipes give success, a heady motivator to try to cook something else! Overall, this is a great addition to any family library."},{"Title":"The age of malaise","review":"The themes of coming of age, identity and ennui have never been so well intertwined for the feminine subject!

Jaffa's Homosexuality and the Natural Law is something of an oddity. Jaffa is a well known philosopher and a former student of Leo Strauss; one assumes that he takes moral issues seriously, and believes that philosophy can help illuminate them. Little of that seriousness can be seen in this work, however. It is a short pamphlet divided into two sections. The first section concerns a controversy over Jaffa's views on homosexuality that erupted at Claremont Colleges in 1989. After Jaffa declared, in a letter he wrote to the Los Angeles Times, that \\"sodomy is to be condemned because the rational ground of all morality is nature, and sodomy is against nature\\" and that to regard \\"the generative distinction between male and female\\" as arbitrary means \\"to regard all the distinctions upon which all morality rests...as arbitrary\\", he was accused, according to the account given here, of \\"intolerance, bigotry, anti-intellectualism, and homophobia.\\" Unfortunately, Jaffa's offending letter is not included in Homosexuality and the Natural Law, which limits the usefulness of its discussion of the resulting controversy. The letter's conclusions, about both moral issues in general and about homosexuality in particular, do not seem to have been particularly well argued or convincing, although having read only the brief extracts from the letter provided here, I cannot pass judgement on them.Jaffa's subsequent attempts to defend his views on the morality of homosexuality are well represented here, however, and they are embarrassing and a discredit to him as a thinker. In response to a student who argued that Jaffa was denying people the right to \\"live their lives the way they choose\\", he provides an imagined conversation between serial killer Ted Bundy and one of his victims. Though professional philosophers do occasionally like to dramatize their arguments, or even present them in fictionalized form, Jaffa's evocation of Bundy is ill-advised. People who reject traditional views of sexual morality often regard them not only as mistaken (which could be argued) but also as ludicrous (which they are not). Jaffa provides further fuel for such bigotry by presenting his arguments in the form of a fictional discussion (he pretentiously cites Thucydides as a model for this approach). After the \\"conversation\\" with Bundy, Jaffa provides his response to the Student Deans Committee of the Claremont Colleges' denunciation of a group that parodied \\"Gay and Lesbian Awareness Days\\" by holding \\"Bestiality and Incest Awareness Days.\\" Jaffa sternly declares that \\"gay\\" is \\"a neologism, a euphemism of recent origin, and refers to sodomy or, to be precise, anal sexual intercourse.\\" It is regrettable that someone who accuses his opponents of disregard for objective truth would make that kind of claim. Equating homosexuality with anal sex is incorrect, and runs the risk of confusing the moral issues surrounding the subject by potentially implying that it is only anal sex specifically rather than homosexuality per se that is immoral, which I take it is not Jaffa's position.Jaffa is correct that the Deans were guilty of trying to suppress free speech, and to deplore this. Whether or not homosexuality is immoral, and whether or not it is in any way equivalent to bestiality or incest, are indeed issues that people should be able to freely debate, even on college campuses. That being said, Jaffa's comments about homosexuality suggest that he understands little about the subject, and does not really want to understand it. It is good that he defends the right to express politically incorrect views, but it's not good that he expresses politically incorrect views in a way that makes him and them look ridiculous. There even appears to be some doubt as to whether Jaffa's views are consistently conservative: he eccentrically declares, in an imaginary letter to an imaginary friend with sex complaints, that he doesn't warn against \\"sex before marriage\\". Jaffa must know perfectly well that traditional Christian views (and he does appear to identify with Christianity) condemn pre-marital sex as fornication. The impossibility of seriously suggesting that society condemn homosexuality as immoral but accept pre-marital sex should also be obvious to anyone who thinks about it. This is a problem, given that Jaffa wants to argue that homosexuality resembles rape and incest in that it \\"strikes at the integrity of the human family.\\" Total consistency and seriousness of mind are required of anyone who wants to make such an argument and be taken seriously; Jaffa fails to meet at least the first of those two requirements.The second part of this pamphlet consists of a review by Jaffa of philosopher Richard Mohr's work Gays-Justice. There are further hints here that Jaffa's views are not as consistently conservative as they might be. Criticizing Mohr's argument that the Supreme Court decision that found Connecticut's law against contraception unconstitutional implies that laws against homosexual sex are also unconstitutional, he remarks that \\"Mohr would have us place the innocent privacy of married couples on the same level as a homosexual relationship\\", apparently taking it for granted that the state does not have the right to make contraception illegal. Jaffa believes that by rejecting the idea of nature as the basis for morality, Mohr destroys the basis for any objective morality, and logically commits himself to total moral relativism, but his argument consists of bluster and a string of non sequiturs. There is some truth in Jaffa's comments about morality and the family: it is indeed the case, as he says, that \\"Adultery strikes at the good order of the family, because jealousy-properly understood-necessarily accompanies the passion by which and out of which the family is constituted\\" and that \\"Confining sexual friendship to its proper sphere-between man and wife-is the very core of that morality by which civilization its constituted.\\" Sadly, the silliness of so many of Jaffa's comments will make it harder for readers to take him seriously even when he is right. Homosexuality and the Natural Law is an entirely unsatisfactory work. It is bad not because it argues against homosexuality but because it does so unconvincingly. I recommend it mainly to people who are very, very interested in Harry V. Jaffa. Those interested in the works of the late Allan Bloom, who co-wrote a book on Shakespeare with Jaffa in the 1960s, may also find it worth reading."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"\\"The History of Love\\" was good, but not great. The story itself is interested enough, and spans over the course of 60 years. Leo Gursky, a retired locksmith, immigrated to the United States as a young man after escaping SS officers in Poland. He arrived in New York in search of his true love, Alma, who left Poland several years before him. Hoping to resume their love affair, Leo is devastated by what he finds, and spends the rest of his life in relative isolation. Meanwhile, Alma Singer is a 14-year-old girl who was named after a character in an old book. Alma copes with family problems and teenage angst while trying to unravel the mystery of her namesake, which is ultimately tied to the aging Leo Gursky.I had high expectations of this novel, but was somewhat let down. The narration shifts back and forth between several characters, with most of them being devoted to Leo and Alma Singer. I enjoyed Leo's chapters most of all. Author Nicole Krauss did a great job capturing the voice of an old Jewish man. (And yet. There were a few things about the writing that annoyed me. One of the things is the way Krauss used the phrase \\"And yet\\" about 370,000 times. ARRGH!) Alma's chapters were okay, but they didn't hold my attention as well. Many of the details of the story are difficult to follow, and I was disappointed with the way the book ended. \\"The History of Love\\" is an interesting book with a unique format and memorable story, but I think the author could have done a lot more with it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Yes, this is foremost a book about one man's love of a woman, but the writing and language should rightfully be called poetry, because the story is so beautifully rendered. After I read a few pages, I got my pen to underscore a few passages for a notebook of memorable quotes I keep, but the more I read, the more I realized that I'd have to underscore 80% of the book!At one point I totally forgot about the plot and was reading for the pure joy of the words on the page. It's not often (if ever) that you can say that about a book.If you love poetry, prose, spectacular story-telling or just reading a fabulous book that will stay with you forever, then buy this book. I found mine at a library sale for a quarter, but I plan to buy more copies for friends. It's the sort of book you want to tell everyone you know to read!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read an excerpt from this novel in the New Yorker about half a year ago, and it was, quite simply, the best piece of fiction they had published for as long as I had been a subscriber. (Eight years.) I xeroxed it and sent it to all of my friends. They were also blown away. When I found out it was a piece of a larger work, I couldn't wait to read the whole thing. And when I finally was able to this week, I wasn't disappointed.THE HISTORY OF LOVE was more than I could have hoped for or imagined.Leo Gursky is one of the great characters ever to be written. He is laugh-out-loud funny, and cry-in-public moving. He is wholly new, and a classic. And he's only one such wonderful character in a book that's overflowing with delights. I fell in love with Alma, I fell in love with Bird, I even fell in love with the brilliant nonsense-spouting janitor. I fell in love with the wild images, the poignant subplots, the descriptions that are as new as they are perfect.Maybe that's the love that this novel is a history of: the love the reader feels for it.This book is a dream."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"In his lifetime Leo Gursky has endured many losses. Sixty years earlier, following the path of Alma, the love of his life, Leo fled war-torn Poland. He loses a book he authored called The History of Love in which the main female character is named Alma and he also loses Alma. Now, an elderly man in his eighties, Leo is alone and obsessed with his mortality. Feeling that his existence is inconsequential to the world around him, Leo refuses to be ignored and has developed some pretty creative ways albeit eccentric to declare that he is indeed still alive.There are many twists and turns in this powerful story of survival of the human spirit. Seemingly disconnected subplots are brilliantly connected. The History of Love is not your typical page turner for every word in this beautifully written novel should be pondered, savored, and enjoyed. Kudos to Nicole Krauss."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I went into the bookstore two days ago and was accosted by a young man who worked there. He handed me The History of Love and told me I had to read it. It had been a while since I'd heard someone so enthusiastic about a novel, so I gave it a shot. Despite the many other things I had to do, I read the book in one day. (Things that had felt important before I started the book became unimportant in the book's light.) I went back today and bought two more copies---one for my sister, and one for my boyfriend, whom I live with, but want to have a copy of his own. That's the kind of book this is. You want everyone you know to read it, but you don't want to let your copy out of your hands."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This beautifully written story tells of the lives of several lost and wounded souls who would not be connected at all except by their Jewish heritage and by a strange and obscure book that has affected them all. The story is told from various points of view, and slowly we see how the stories intertwine.This story has so much to say: finding one's place in the world; reaching out to others; how all our lives connect in some way; how small actions can have big consequences. And it says it with such achingly beautiful voices: Leo Gursky, whose inner monologue made me laugh out loud at times; Alma Singer, whose detached way of describing her life with lists of unrelated thoughts belied her pain; Alma's brother Bird, whose earnest searching for spiritual truth was sweet and sincere at the same time it could be comical. A host of other sad-but-funny characters float through the pages.Everything about this book drew me in: the shifting narration, the confusion over who-wrote-what, even the confusion over who or what is real and not real. When I first finished the book, I felt a little disappointed. But after letting it stew in my head for a few days, I found myself liking it more and more. It affected me in new ways long after I'd finished reading it. Our book-club discussion revealed I was not the only one deeply affected.One thing that some of our members noticed that I'd like to pass along (it would have helped me, too) was that at the head of each chapter was an icon that identified the voice who was speaking that chapter (or the person the chapter was about, in those chapters narrated in third person). Match the icons with the characters, and off you go!I recommend this book highly. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is one of the few books I've bothered to read multiple times. Read it for the keen observations on life of its central protagonist, Leo Gursky, a locksmith by trade but a writer at heart. Like a good stand up comic, he understands the absurdity of life , Gursky and his own paranoia about dying as an \\"invisible\\" old man , and suffering from TWO unrequited loves, for his original Alma - his first and onlylove, and for his birth son.Gursky's wry thoughts on life, the things he does in the name of kindness and love are touching.His comic attempts to make an \\"impression\\" are amusing.He is a sensitive enough of a man to note that the pain of life can be felt in different parts of his body.Read this book for its tragic yet hopeful tone, emphasized with the thought: \\"And yet.....\\"I don't wish to repeat what is on the jacket but to understand this slightly (but not impossibly) complex story you must know that, when he was young, Gursky wrote a book to express his endless and undying feelings for a young woman, Alma, who would be his first and ONLY love. Ever.He writes a book to express that love and it becomes \\"The History of Love.\\" This book-within-a-book is revealed only short but clever enough passages to give a sense of Gursky's great skill as a writer.His wit also comes off well through the narration of his thoughts. (That Gursky and many of the characters are Jewish adds cultural enrichment to a goy such as myself. )Read it for the contrast between the original Alma and the new young Alma, an American girl (whose name was inspired by the Leo's original love, Alma, the 'first girl on earth,' she is, in a way, the feminineequivalent of the young Gursky introspective thoughtful, as well as a compulsive writer, albeit of lists. She is desperate to fix her now single mother up who now, also like Gursky, has been left in trapped in love for her deceased husband.How the characters talk, act, and think, how their tales twist and turn and speak of love's myriad angles:friendly, courtly, romantic, and imagined, are the materials that makes the this book this book a masterpiece.Gursky *thinks* he has had no impact on the world,. He is a man who wanted to achieve greatness but who has now come to terms with death, dying anonymously seems to be his fate It seems so unlikely hislife could have changed even a single leaf on the street.Life is far too complex to be reduced to a sentence or a title, or even to a short paragraph. But a novel, well, as Gursky himself would say: \\"And yet......\\" Read it to find you the meaning of that final \\"And yet.\\""},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read alot of books, and when I complete one I typically move on almost immediatly to another; not the case with this novel. I was intrigued, bemused and quite frankly damn impressed as to how the author took what some have called a confusing mess and in my opinion turned it into something quite extraordinary. I had to stop and think, I had to re-read and re-work....some might say not worth the effort, but I beg to differ. Few books stop me in my tracks, this one did. I agree with other reviewers that the writing style can be confusing and the various narratives hard to follow, but those issues aside, I say brava for an original and memorable story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Life moves in mysterious ways as Nicole Krauss' second novel, \\"The History of Love\\", proves. The life of a solitary old man who is waiting for death is about to collide with the life of a fatherless teenager girl who is trying to find a new love interest for her widowed mother. Told in alternated chapters, the book has in its core another book, also called \\"The History of Love\\".Leo Gursky is totally alone, except for a friend as old as him that lives upstairs. Sixty years ago, he used to live in a Pollish village and was in love with a beautiful girl. He wrote a book in her honor, but after some dreadful events, the book was lost forever. So he thinks.What he doesn't know is that the book survived and was even published. Fourteen-year-old Alma is named after the main character in that novel. Her main tasks is watching after her little brother called Bird (who thinks he is the Messiah) and taking notes for her own book \\"How to Survive in the Wild, Volumes Three\\". But a letter is about to change it, and connect her to the book after which she is named.Krauss' narrative is a book inside a book in many senses, therefore is not a cheap or easy one. Reading \\"The History of Love\\" requires double attention, what is not a hard task since the prose is so beautiful and the characters so alive. The writer has a gift to bring to life, to make sound like real situations that are very unlikely -- but not impossible -- to happen. Her story of losing and finding is full of stamina and joy, but above all love for her choices of works and plot devices.Alternating funny and sad moments, Krauss keeps the story always moving forward, but always related to the past of her characters and Gursky's \\"The History of Love\\". It works like a giant and beautiful jigsaw that is built little by little and most of it inside the reader's imagination.In a work that never underestimates the reader's intelligence, Krauss deals with grace and charm with painful and difficult subjects showing that life is full of beautiful moments -- even when we can't see them."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The smartest girl in the class, the nerdy TAG girl, has just handed in the best assignment EVER! The one that may win her a trip to the WHITE HOUSE! The one that has all the grown-ups talking! Maybe you'll grow to champion her assignment too, maybe you already love it, maybe you feel too dumb to love it, maybe you like her, but can't stand the fact that she writes so well. Maybe you're jealous, jealous, jealous since you could have written something a lot like this if only you'd known that the teachers wanted you to show off. (And anyway, no one told you that you could share your ideas with a partner as long as you handed in your work separately! That doesn't seem fair! She worked with that goofy boy.) And now there are no prizes left for anyone else to win.Does this feel familiar?Let's face it. People will, in fact, love THE HISTORY OF LOVE because it IS lovable; it's designed to be lovable. In fact, it's a rhetorical exercise in lovability. That's its greatest strength-- something you can emulate-- as well as its greatest weakness-- something you can avoid. Because that's what you need to do: LEARN FROM THIS BOOK in order to write your own!Start here:1) Understand that tragedy can feel good if it's handled right. Dark and heavy and searing (think LEAR), or softened and a little lite (think THE LOVELY BONES.) If you plan well, as Krauss did, the devastation of destruction never needs to cause the reader actually to squirm or to close the book. Such intensity can be avoided through the use of tropes. (We all know THE HOLOCAUST; we all can imagine DEATH FROM PANCREATIC CANCER. Always respect your readers' sensitivity to these iconic human traumas, and everyone's imaginative ability to summon up disaster on cue.) Remember, never emulate Pat Barker by leading your beloved protagonist into the brilliantly described jaws of realistic death at the end of the book if you want to write lite.2) Invent wacky characters. Or better yet invent a single wacky character and assign that character different ages, genders, varying mental states. It helps if the character-cluster is both self-disciplined and of above-average intelligence; that way you ensure on-the-ground action as well as intellectual thrills for your more discerning readers. It also helps if all your main characters are really self-obsessed; that means you won't have to write messy group scenes where people actually want to interact and exchange feelings and confront each other. If you did that, your plot might get away from you. You might end up with another BELOVED on your hands! At the end you can bring everyone together, knowing that readers will gloat over the justice of reunion!3) Make at least one of your characters a really gifted kid-- that can be a cute device-- or an old lovable crank with a frozen heart that will thaw by the end of the book. Readers love those kinds of characters because they can't really compare such folks to their own daily experience and thus be troubled by questions of credibility. (For instance, you can even have an old guy just flap his hands like an idiot when, at last, he's facing the son he's never seen. Don't be tempted to let him figure out why he flaps because then genuine parental love or human cowardice might compel him to do something extravagantly realistic that would wreck the plot, and that just wouldn't be cute.) Don't let the old guy tear out your heart through genuine transformation the way Leslea Newman's did in LETTER TO HARVEY MILK. Also be sure to avoid dazzlingly gifted kids like the one in Ben Okri's THE FAMISHED ROAD. The reader's heart might be lost forever.4) About magic. Use it as a stylistic device, a little razzmatazz! Avoid the profound cultural implications of the unseen world that surrounds us all. Let American readers decide whether things are just zany coincidences or tricks of fate. You don't really want your book to be about Borges' library, or Sherman Alexie's drunken dreamers, because then you'd have to describe the world through a lens of belief.5) Allude to brilliant original thought so people know you find it to be important, but if you must incorporate it into your text, make it wacky, setting it off in quotation marks so people can choose to read it or not. Don't try to enlarge your reader's mind, even gently, like W.G. Sebald, because people honestly don't like to think that much. They want to rush, rush, rush.6) Invoke nostalgia but do it without the serious erection of a credible fictional world. Again, if you say \\"New York,\\" people will get what you're talking about. \\"Israel.\\" Ditto. Same goes for \\"Buenos Aires.\\" Don't try to pull off a Faulkner or a Garcia Marquez and really bring a world to credible life, and don't try to get all heavy about alienation like Camus.7) Speaking of Garcia Marquez-- it's always a good idea to choose a really serious-sounding title with LOVE in it. That doesn't mean you really have to write about what most of us mean by love: that staggeringly empowering human connection that vaults us into devastation and joy, that screams through our blood, that compels us to ravish one another's minds and bodies, that causes our hands to snatch a stranger's baby from the flames, or wash the feet of beggars, that lurches us heart and soul through our present days and nights. No. Don't mess with that. Once again: messy, unpredictable, not a sure seller. Although, as we all know, still the stuff of GREAT LITERATURE.Let's be honest. The Serena and the Venus of the celebrity-literary world have arrived on the court; they're mighty talents. Score. Genuine show stoppers. Score. Genuine show offs. They write with a public in mind. And yes, they write terrifically well. THE HISTORY OF LOVE is really good, literally spell-binding, literally charming, inspiring; it's just not great, morally significant literature. I think maybe you can write better! Try showing off for once! Just imagine what YOU could achieve if you tried to write on the subject of love! Go for it!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The lives of Alma Singer, a 14 year old persistent daydreamer, and Leo Gursky an elderly man who escaped from the Nazis in Poland to live a lonely life in the U.S. working as a locksmith, will somehow connect in Nicole Krauss' compelling \\"The History of Love.\\" Along the way, we will meet an unusual array of characters, including Alma's widowed mother, who's interpreting an introspective philosophical book called \\"The History of Love\\" at the request of the mysterious Jacob Marcus; Svi Litvinoff, the credited writer of that book; Alma's brother, nicknamed \\"Bird,\\" who believes he may be the Messiah; Bruno, Leo's best friend; and, last but not least, the object of Leo's life-long obsession, a now-deceased woman, also named Alma. As mentioned by a number of reviewers, the plot and the manner in which the characters are related can be confusing, and I often found myself flipping back through pages to refresh my recollection of what went on before. \\"The History of Love\\" kept my interest and was quite touching at times. Although Krauss certainly concentrates on certain \\"Jewish\\" themes, and liberally sprinkles the book with Yiddish, I still think the book has universal appeal.Certainly some of the connections between the characters seem a bit forced. (One example is a passing reference that Alma's Uncle Julian, though married, is a closet homosexual who had a passionate affair with an \\"Alberto,\\" who turns out to be a cousin of another unrelated character). Additionally, there are literary devices that seem derivative and cliched (one \\"twist\\" reminded me of \\"Fight Club\\"). I did like the way, though, that the author plays around with blank space on certain pages as the destinies of the two principles start converging. Another small complaint is that Krauss wants us, as the reader, to find something magical and profound in the passages quoted from \\"The History of Love\\" (that is, the book within the book), which perhaps aren't nearly so magical and profound as they're intended to be. After all, Krauss wrote those passages too, as opposed to some brilliant, largely undiscovered, early 20th Century Polish writer/philosopher. But still, I found \\"The History of Love\\" moving and one of the better modern novels I've read in awhile. Indeed, it's a perfect choice for a book club, because there's so much to discuss."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I started reading this work and immediately became very suspicous. Its narrator- hero seemed to me yet another instance of a type of character, the lonely eccentric Holocuast survivor that features in the work of IB. Singer, Bellow, Edward Wallant, and a host of others. I was suspicious because I sensed something 'artificial' in a writer as young as Krauss dealing with people I suspected she had read about but did not know in person.But it did not take long before my suspicion vanished and I found myself reading with tremendous eagerness, the story of Leo Gursky. Gursky living in New York as a locksmith had in Poland fallen in love with a young girl named Alma. She had at her father's urgings made her way to safety in America. And by the time Gursky caught up with her was married to another. The great novel he had written about their love had been published in Poland, translated in Buenos Aires into Spanish, but was largely forgotten.Gursky in New York lives his life dedicated to the memory of the woman he loved, and to following the story of their son who becomes a successful novelist.The second narrative voice of the work is fourteen year old Alma Singer whose father had when as an Israeli tourist found the last copy of the book in a Buenos Aires bookstore. It had deeply influenced him and he named his daughter after its protagonist. When young Alma begins her narration her father has already died of pancreatic cancer, and she is living with her mother Charlotte, a translator and her nine year old brother 'Bird'. The translator- mother too is wholly dedicated to the memory of her one great love, and refuses to make any real effort at connecting with or finding someone else.For me the book really came alive with the narration of Alma and her dialogue with her brother. Their dialogue it seems to me has a lot of Salinger's Holden- Phoebe in it but this to my mind made it even more interesting and enjoyable. The character Alma with her focus on survival in extreme circumstances, her interest in remote geological and geographical worlds is wonderfully alive. As is her little brother who suspects himself of being a Lamed- Vovnik one of the thirty- six righteous whose anonymous presence sustains the world.The language of this work is bright and strong. There is great intelligence in the writing also. And there is also deep feeling which often comes in unexpected and wrenching ways. Perhaps the most painful and powerful of these is after Gurkey sends a message to his fellow- survivor only friend Bruno about the Beauty and Joy of life. This uncharacteristic revelation by him is shortly met by the news that his famous writer son has at the age of sixty , died.Another remarkably moving moment comes in the last pages of the book when young Alma at last tracks down the author of the book that has been at the center of her parents' love i.e. Leo Gursky.This is a book about the joys and vicissitudes of love, and perhaps above all about the losses which pervade our lives, and deepen their pain and their meaning."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I have not had the benefit of reading the author's husband's works, but will give reviewers who have the benefit of a doubt, that this book reflects the strengths and weaknesses of his work. This author starts out strong with Leo Gursky, whose voice remains the strongest in the work. However, this character is derivative, depending a lot on Saul Bellow and Isaac B. Singer, and ultimately descends into bathos. I had difficulty in following the (to my mind) excessively complex, blowsy plot, which I suspect reflects the current level of the writer's style, without her husband's influence. She attempts to keep fifteen balls in the air and drops a few. I felt that, having missed a couple of turns at the end, that p'rhaps I should go back a few hundred pages and Review. Maybe Diagram. I decided against it, feeling that I should reserve this sort of attention to War And Peace."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in ages. This book would work even as a two-dimensional book about the characters' lives. But. After I read the last page, I was stunned by the depth of this book. The author takes on huge themes - love,loss,parent-child relationships, the Holocaust, etc., etc. and delivers on every level. I thought the title was \\"big\\" but it really does address the history of love. True love, and how it can change one's life, and affect one's life, and the lives of others. And that's just one of the themes in the book. There's so much more! I can't wait to discuss this with my book group tonight."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A lyrical and wrenching story that takes the reader on a journey through the human heart. Yearning, desire, greed, insecurity, loneliness, fear, hope, despair.Krauss endeavors to explore the base emotions that motivate and ultimately shape our destinies through the telling of the characters' individual stories. Leo, Alma, Bird and the others are more than vehicles to move the plot forward; they are less solidly anchored in a \\"story line\\" than they are in symbolism and metaphor. The reader is led - by design - to ponder at the novel's conclusion, what is love? Is the risk of loving worth the risk of losing oneself?There is a poetic quality to this novel; it is a construct of the author's willingness to play with form and create ambiguity and allow the reader to experience the interplay for himself. The ending is even open to interpretation by the reader.A History of Love will resonate with anyone who believes that fate, rather than design, drives what we become. A haunting, beautiful story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A Jewish boy in Poland before the War falls in love and writes a book, THE HISTORY OF LOVE. Years later, in the new century, a Jewish teenager in New York, named after female characters in this all-but-unknown work, tries to understand her mother's loneliness and her own existence. At first these stories have no connection, and there are other characters too, of an intermediate generation, whose presence only deepens the mysteries of this many-voiced novel. It is a book about dislocation and loss, missed connections, derailed lives -- the sad Jewish experience in the 20th century. And yet the voices of the girl writing in her journal and the boy turned crotchety old man have such energy and humor that the book is anything but sad. Despite her slight penchant for whimsy, Krauss is wise in never allowing consolation to come too easily. But when the stories finally intertwine in the last pages, the connections made (although not the ones the characters might have been wishing for) make the magic journey eminently worthwhile."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I spent the last 5 days visiting with my gorgeous little granddaughters (2 1/2 and 7 months old). Part of my amazement and joy in them grows out of my realization that they only exist because I met the love of my life some 37 years ago, married her, and began a family that has led to these miraculous creatures. And that's \\"the history of love\\" that Nicole Krauss's wonderful novel paints for readers. This is a book about many things, but for me, it's mostly about the creative power of love. As might be expected, love in the novel produces children, and the depiction of parental love is subtle yet powerfully present in a book focused primarily on romantic love. But love can create art too as Leo Gursky demonstrates, lasting, significant, powerful art in the form of his novel-within-the-novel, also entitled \\"The History of Love,\\" a book whose influence radiates over the course of 6 decades in remarkable and moving ways. Thematically Krauss has written a wonderfully complex and thoughtful book, and when the novel's playfully complicated structure-bouncing from narrator to narrator, from decade to decade, and from Poland to Chile to Brooklyn-is added to the mix, we're left with a memorable narrative ride that packs a hefty emotional punch. My usual yardstick is to consider whether a novel would repay a second reading: no doubts here. \\"The History of Love\\" most assuredly merits re-reading. A definite must-read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a book that is unabashedly unafraid to plumb the depths of loss and sadness and grief; it also is a profound meditiation of the agony and terror of love, and possibly raises the question whether--when one opens one's heart to the world and the world shuts itself from you--can you find solace and meaning. In a culture that prizes the wan and ironic, some people might find the characters' pain over the top. But then again, there's plenty of people who think they are immune from the Katrinas of the world. Until they get hit by one. This book explores what happens when your love and kindness get slam dunked. Reading this book is like cliff climbing: there's the agony and ecstasy mixed together. If you are afraid of heights or respond to tragedy with platitudes to cover up the pain, this book will either get you really mad or maybe open your heart. The book is not structurally elegant; at times there's a bit of plodding; and it just might not be to everyone's taste or temperament. Then again, what book is?"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"After reading the glowing reviews, and absolutely loving 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' which this has been so often compared, I couldn't wait to read this. As I started the book, I read over a hundred pages in one sitting and was drawn immediately in with characters that are wonderfully drawn and specific. Unfortunately, it ultimately didn't resonate the way I was hoping. Frankly the fault could be mine, because as I began to put the book down and leave it for a day or two,the shifting narratives started to become confusing.I would recommend to anyone for maximum enjoyment, read this in as few sittings as possible. There's no denying she's a great writer,for me it just lost it's momentum along the way."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Some parts of this are incredibly well written, while the flash-movement between characters was a bit extreme and confusing. Still amazing this writer can do so from an older perspective. Looking forward to more from her."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I purchased this book having never heard of it or the author. I absolutely fell in love with it. From the first page I was totally engrossed in the story.It was interesting to see how the story unfolded. I most like the chapters narrated by Leo. These chapters were funny, insightful and heartbreaking. The author's use of \\"And yet.\\" throughout the Leo chapters was definitely different. At first I thought it might have been bad editing. Then I realized that this summed up Leo's life. It was what it was...And yet. I was a bit confused by the ending, but it didn't really bother me. The whole book was original and extremely touching."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The character development was intimate and genuine, providing an interesting collective pondering on the meaning of life and relationships. Both of the main characters are realistic in the saddest and happiest ways. I would recommend this book to anyone despite its tacky sounding title, because it is anything but."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This was a beautifully written novel. Each of the characters were uniquely introduced and formulated into people I cared about. I was led through the life of a gifted writer and the unexpected twists his life took, the losses he suffered and the lives he touched in unforeseen ways. To speak too much of the plot would give away the story. The conclusion was soft spoken, poignant, and well worth discovering."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I walked in Border's and randomly picked out this novel by a new writer. I took it home and couldn't put it down. I told me friends that i cried it was so good. Intricate characters with real souls, and empathetic voices. A weaving story of true love and loss. Just brilliant. Please read and pass along."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I enjoyed this \\"mistery\\" novel inmensely. The author managed to spin a really complicated story with several unlikely twists and make it totally believable. I fell in love with all the characters. The way the author tells the story moving from present to past, and from the personal perspective of several characters, may be distracting for some readers, but it made me feel very connected to the characters' feelings and motivations. It is so engaging, I read it in two sittings, and I am the type who likes to pace her readings to 20-25 pages per day.I chose this book by its reviews here for our book club and I am happy I did, all liked it. It is probably the most liked fiction book we have read in about a year."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I found myself going back many times to reread parts, and try to figure out just what was going on. This book is part mystery, part love story. Interesting, but I needed to pay attention to much, and didn't get enough answers at the end. Great book club read, though, and the chat going on at the end of this section really helps a lot. Don't read too much of it prior to reading the book, but use it as a way to get questions resolved once you've finished."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Run to the bookstore and buy this book. Tap your fingers twice and say YES to the beautiful story that unfolds on each page.It's been a very long time since I've been so touched and deeplymoved by a novel. This is literature at its best.Sadly, I leave the characters who peopled this book.Gladly, I know their story will remain with me forever."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Both the book's ethereal charm and its weakness spring from rapid shifts of character, continent, and time and the loose braiding of events. We don't stay in one place long. While I did not find the string of coincidences that drive the story believable and in mild confusion often went back to check on relationships and events, the main characters are so strong, \\"real,\\" and likeable, I found myself holding my breath as I read and willingly suspended my disbelief for the pleasure of the ride. An engaging, fast, and not overly \\"deep\\" read about the many facets of love."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I, too, think this book has much beautiful prose in it and the skeleton of a wonderfully evocative story if only it were written by another author. As soon as Krauss starts developing the parallel story of Alma, her mother, and her savant or obsessive/compulsive brother, only the densest reader could not know how this will end. From that point on, everything seemed so contrived that, if I hadn't needed to finish the book for book club, I would have put it down. I kept reading all the reviews about how brilliant this books is but, frankly, it left me cold. At no point did I ever feel emotionally invested in the characters, a condition that, to me, differentiates a truly satisfying read from a mere read. I have spent days trying to figure out what others are seeing that I don't only to finally conclude that many mainstream book reviewers are so captivated by the word play and stark departure from narrative writing that they cannot see the sheer artifice behind the curtain. Throughout the interlocking stories, my mind glommed onto one glaringly obvious structural support after another that I knew would finally result in the only obvious denouement. What they see as magical realism, I see as the simple sleight of hand of a too slow magician.Krauss's depiction of Leo is indeed incredible, splendidly redolent of so many eastern European immigrant old men of my childhood. Considering that Krauss was not yet 30 when she wrote this, I am especially awed. On the other hand, I thought Leo was a putz. Some reviewers mention how he \\"never met his son\\". By this, I suppose they mean they were never properly introduced. But Leo saw his son often if only from afar. For over sixty years, he followed his son's development, from the time he tied his shoes on the way to school to his success as a writer. If Leo had really wanted his son to know him, he had many chances when he attended Isaac's book readings; at that point, his son was an adult and would not have been traumatized by the sudden revelation of an unknown father. But, of course, allowing Leo to react as a normal person would have removed a glaringly obvious building block from Krauss's story.I became incensed by the utter lack of reaction to Alma's brother Bird's obvious mental illness. A child who believes he's the Jewish messiah? A child so into his fantasy life even as a 12-year-old that he believes he can fly like an angel? A child who is so unsupervised that he can build an ark from trash near a New York City highway? Why was this child not receiving psychiatric help? How did he survive in school where surely he would have been bullied into abject withdrawal? Where was his mother? His teachers?And that brings us to Bird's and Alma's mother. Here is a woman in modern times who, seven years after her husband's untimely death, is still virtually incapable of getting out of bed. Where are social services when we need them? Not until she receives the letter requesting that she translate the hardly-mysterious-at-this-point book does she act like a mother who has children to feed and clothe. I can only conclude that Krauss' determination to trick out her words and sentences at the expense of character development renders these people no more than cardboard cut-outs standing in for real narrative exposition. Face it -- we know more about Leo's maybe-imaginary friend Bruno than we do about Alma's mother.So now we come to the ending, one that so many readers declare so moved and amazed them with its brilliance and beauty, a \\"momentous and satisfying final chapter of great emotional depth\\". Huh? Satisfying? In what way is an absurdly predictable ending satisfying? In what way does virtual silence punctured by monosyllabic words and inane finger taps constitute emotional depth? And let's discuss those finger taps. Were they supposed to echo the chapter in Leo's book about silent communication and hand gestures? Or were they to reflect the taps Leo and Bruno would make on their radiators to assure each other that they were still alive? Is this what passes for depth to writers who seem hell-bent on engineering clever novels that deceive readers into believing they're great literature? And, please tell me, what is the history of love? This book certainly didn't tell me.So I say again, this could have been a beautifully rendered and equisitely tangled story of love found and lost and found again in a different place and time by a writer intent on really telling a story and not twisting dissociate bits into what is really nothing more than a long outline posturing as something truly profound. Nicole Krauss has the seeds of a great story-teller within her along with an amazing way with words so often absent in others; I can only hope that with her her next book, she discards the forced chicanery and fulfills that potential."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"In 1958, a doo-wop group called the Monotones had a hit with their song \\"The Book of Love\\" which included lyrics such as the following:\\"Tell me, tell me, tell meOh who wrote the book of loveI've got to know the answerWas it someone from aboveOh I wonder, wonder who ..Who wrote the Book of Love.\\"Niclole Kraus's novel \\"The History of Love\\" (2005) is about the tortured fate of a fictitious novel of that name. Her book, and the novel enraveled within it, remind me of the Monotone's wonderful song. The book and the doo-wop song celebrate the mystery of love, its joy and sorrow, and its power to move people at whatever stages of their lives. Unlike the Monotone's song, however, the book is difficult to follow in places, marred by artificiality in the plot, and by too great a sense of cleverness. For all that, I found it moving.The book is set in contemporary New York City and is related in several voices, the chief of which belongs to 80 year-old Leo Gursky. Gursky is a Holocaust survivor who escaped to the United States where he worked as a locksmith. As a young man in Poland, Leo fell in love with a young woman who emigrated to the United States before he did, bore Leo's child, but married someone else. For the rest of his life, Leo retained his youthful, failed love and never was interested in another woman. Before he left Poland, he had written a lengthy manuscript based upon his relationship.The other chief character in the book, is a 14-15 year old girl, Alma. Alma's father died when she was 7 and her mother, who works as a translator and reads prolifically, has never become interested in another man, to Alma's regret. Alma has a younger brother, nicknamed \\"Bird\\" who fantasizes that he may be on of the 36 righteous individuals of the Talmud, or, perhaps, the Jewish Messiah. Alma too is in love, with a Russian emigre of about her own age named Mischa.Another character in the book is a quiet young intellectual, Zvi Litvinoff, who also escapes Poland at the time of the Nazis and settles in Chile. He woos and wins a woman named Rosa who writes an introduction to an obscure novel that Litvinoff had earlier published in Spanish under his own name.The novel takes and tries to combine these three seemingly disparate groups of characters and their passions with the focal point the mysterious book \\"The History of Love.\\" While the story line is convoluted, feelings are presented with conviction. In particular, Leo Gursky, with his lifelong unrequited passion, is convincingly portrayed as are the scenes and haunts of an aged Jewish man in New York City -- the streets, parks, apartments, taxicabs, small cafe's and coffeshops, illnesses, and attempts to stay alive. The power of young love is shown in Leo's life and, in a less convincing way, in the lives of the other chaaracters, including Alma's mother, Alma herself, Zvi Litvinoff, and many lesser characters. Much of Krauss' writing is lyrical and poetic while other sections, particularly involving Alma and Bird, fall flat. Some of the mannerisms Krauss gives her characters, the repeated use of the interjection \\"and yet\\" by Gursky for example, become annoying and repetitive rather quickly. But the book sings, if with a limp in places, of human love and its power over the human spirit.Here are more lyrics from the Monotones' song that this book brought to mind.\\"Chapter One says to love herYou love her with all your heartChapter Two you tell her your'eNever, never, never going to partIn Chapter Three remember the meaning of romanceIn Chapter Four you break upBut you give her just one more chanceOh I wonder wonder who ...Who wrote the book of love.\\"Krauss' \\"History of Love\\" brought to my mind, the melody and fresh feeling of love -- captured even more fully in a doo-wop song from the 1950s.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"simply a beautiful story told in an interesting way. it was confusing at first but how the story unfolded was part of the charm of the book. i have never read a book twice, and i did this one"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"When you read this book.

I found myself skipping to Leo's chapters quite often, as the other readers were not as engaging, and their stories not as interesting. To me, Leo's story alone made this a fine book that got me laughing, crying and willing to listen again and again.

This book was very disappointing."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I'd heard so many people talk about this book, all positive. So I finally picked it up and found that I liked it, but it was not quite what I expected after hearing so many glowing things about it. The story revolves around an old man, Leo Gurskey, that is nearing the end of his life, which has been pretty darn sad. Leo is a Polish Jew that survived the Nazi's by living in the woods (and anywhere else he could hide) for years before escaping to America. However, his family was not so lucky and he lost all of them. Leo fell in love with a girl named Alma as a teenager and stays in love with her after her father sends her to America. Leo is a writer and wrote a book dedicated to Alma that he later gives to a friend for safekeeping. The friend ends up moving to Chile and falls in love with a woman as well and steals Leo's book in the process (just changing the names). The Chilean woman insists on her husband publishing the book, although later finds out that it is plagarized. The story goes back and forth between Leo and another narrator, a teenage girl named Alma, who is trying to find someone for her mother after her father dies of pancreatic cancer. Alma's narrative is in the current NY setting, and Leo's goes back and forth between the past and current. The story is sweet, but I wouldn't say compelling. And I found the different characters and different books rather confusing. Which book was being spoken about, and how is this person involved with the book? It does all come together pretty well in the end, and there was a small twist that made the story more endearing. Good book, but not great."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is such a beautiful novel. I almost cried at the end (and not just because the story is sad, which it is--it is full of pain and loss, but it also has some...beams of happiness). I don't even know how to explain it. It's one of those books that you just have to read. The ending is mysterious but complete at the same time, leaving you to just the right degree questioning the actual nature of events."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love seems to be, almost until the last page, stories of those with aches they cannot mend, holes in their souls they unsuccessfully try to fill. The title comes from title of a book that resurfaces throughout the novel.Leo Gursky, now old, as a teenager survived Nazi horror but lost his girl to another man and traveled his life as a locksmith who wanted to write but didn't...except for his book The History of Love. Alma Mereminski loved Leo but married another when she thought that Leo was dead; their child was raised not knowing Leo was his father. Zvi Litvinoff publishes a book not his own to maintain the love of a woman he feels he does not deserve. Charlotte translates to pay the bills and longs for her deceased husband, closed off to future love. Alma Singer labors to keep her small family together by finding ways to make her mother Charlotte happy. Her brother Bird suffers a deep father wound, is socially awkward and fantasizes the impossible. Bruno is Leo's oldest friend, or might be someone created by Leo to stave off complete loneliness. There are others, Rosa, Zvi's wife, and Julian, the unhappily married uncle of Alma Singer. Each has a story.The History of Love is admirable with its depth of character, its travels from the past to the present and back again, and its haunting prose. It defies being captured either by dissection or overview. The book is better suited to a book club discussion; it is a rich story. Throughout the characters remain attached to pain that keeps them from being whole, from moving on.Would I change something? Possibly there are too many characters. Is uncle Julian essential? I also don't think that having only a few words on a page is good technique, although the short interplay between Leo and Alma Singer near the book's end does succeed.You have my permission to read the book.

However, the actual (fictional) &#34;History of Love &#34; sections that are &#34;quoted&#34; are really quite silly and made me wonder whether the author couldn't have written something better for her characters to make such a fuss about."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A touching story about life and love. Interesting characters both young and old. Good read for lovers of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"very fast shipping.....Love Amazon!!!! Great price!!! My daughter loves to read and this was on her list for Christmas this year. She loves it!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Excellent read! Enjoyed how the author entwined each character's story. Wonderful story of love's ups & downs. Speaks to all."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is a well-written quick read, and is a sweet story with very likeable characters, but it seemed like Krauss was aiming for something more revelatory than she actually achieved. I'm basing that largely on the title, which seems to be promising a lot. Maybe I'm being unfair.I didn't find some of the more experimental stuff (like the pages of alternating points of view in the last chapter) distracting. Personally, I think most of the experimental devices improved flow and economy. I can understand why you might come to a different conclusion though, particularly if you read her husband's book Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and expected Krauss to employ the devices in the same ponderous way, which she didn't.I really like Krauss though. I'll have to pick up more of her work."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Good story and well written but with three different narrators jumping around timeframes I found it rather difficult to follow on my Kindle. Picked up a paperback copy from the library and was much better able to follow the storyline and enjoyed finishing the book"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"What a marvelous piece of writing - it ranks as one of the top pieces of fiction written in the past 25 years. Strong, diverse voices narrate a most unusual story. The combination of straight narrative and diary entries works wonderfully. Don't be put off by the fact it was named winner of a prestigious award for Jewish fiction -- anyone will love it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book when it was first published and have since then recmmended it to many people. Without exception, each reader felt the same as I did - that they were fortunate to have found this treasure! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Even though I appreciated the style in which this book was written, I felt that I needed to read it again right away because I missed so much."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I am not a writer of long reviews. Too much slogging required. Just let it be said that this writer has an extraordinarily original voice and great talent. In this decade of debut-novel wunderkinds and super-hype, Ms. Krauss is the real thing. This novel is written with great sensitivity, great warmth, and wonderful insight. Can't wait for the next book. This one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Krauss's History of Love. Reminiscent of Paulo Coehlo somehow. It is impressive to see such understanding of the human condition by a young author at the beginning of her career. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is a wonderful book. It is very well-written and very interesting. I liked both Leo's and Alma's narratives equally...but I have to say that the \\"and yets\\" that constantly popped up in Leo's chapters got to be very annoying. But overall, I LOVED this book, and I loved the fact that it gave me a lot to think about once it was finished. I finished this book days ago, and I still wonder what really happened at the end, and ponder the effects that lonliness had on all of their lives. I also ordered \\"The Street of Crocodiles\\" from my local bookstore so I can read that for better understanding. I thought this was a wonderful book and I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss' The History of Love is ingenious and precocious -- ingenious for its plotting, precocious for its fluent, page-turning style. But it hardly shows much to us beyond its own spectacular surface. And this is odd and disappointing, because it appears to be structured to allow a glimpse into something deep and mysterious. That is, this isn't a novel of character development; if anything, the characters are fully formed by the time Krauss gets to them, and they are used to spin the plotty tale. There is poignancy in the stories, and Krauss should be credited for not leading us to a too easy epiphany at the end. But ultimately, sentiment gives way to sentimenality. Hoping to illuminate the sinuous paths of love and affection, Krauss reverts to a winking knowingness. I concur with James Woods who, writing in The London Review of Books, says this novel infantilizes its readers. One feels manipulated by the entire mechanism -- a fully achieved writerly machine."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading such rave reviews. I found the plot confusing to follow and agree with the advice to read the book in fewer settings to help keep track of the change in narrators. The only character that motivated me to keep reading was Leo Gursky but alas I found the ending disappointing."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book was in my mind the entire week it took me to read it (I could have done it faster but I wanted that feeling to last). It is just plain beautiful and sensitive in a way few books are. Highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I could not get into the characters at all, so ended up not finishing the book. It was selected for our book club. Too esoteric for me - a complete waste of time"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Intriguing enough to keep me going, but sometimes infuriating. Some sections were truly moving (particular those involving Leo Gursky), others exasperating, particularly involving the youngsters. They were depicted as full of good intentions yet for them, apparently lying, stealing and destructively meddling in their mother's work was as easy as breathing and this didn't seem plausible in the context of the novel. I found it disappointing, yet at the same time with much to offer."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Here's what I got from this book, which really isn't all that much. Leo Gursky is a old man that is preoccupied by his own death. In his efforts to survive he makes a complete nuisance of himself in public. Sixty years ago, his life was not this pathetic. He wrote a book about the great love of his life and survived the Nazi invasion of Slonim, Poland. The book that he thought was lost or destroyed, mysteriously survives and is a huge part of Alma Singer's life.Fourteen -year-old Alma Singer has her hands full with feeling solely responsible for her mother's happiness after Alma's father's death and trying to takecare of her brother, Bird, who thinks he is the Messiah.Ms. Krauss explores the timeless themes of love and loss and the ties that bind, but for me thebook was very choppy, dry and for the most part, except for Alma's story, tedious."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I disliked this book so much that I stopped reading it in the middle - something I almost never do. My son, who usually has the same taste as I do, recommended it, but I found it both confusing and dull at the same time."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The Amazon and Publishers Weekly comments and summary are on the mark, so read them for the plot.This is extraordinarily fine writing, along with a wholly original story and characters.I believed in the characters and even though the plot was somewhat complicated, it came together in the end in a most satisfying way.I don't see the connection to her husband Jonathan Foer's writing, mentioned by another reviewer, except in the originality they both bring to their respective work. He can be too cute by half sometimes, while she has the stoy tellers gift of useing less to say more.I read her first novel \\"Man Walks Into a Room,\\" and while I think \\"The History of Love,\\" is far superior, it also has a very unique plot and is well written.This is a talent to watch closely."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Most people probably read 10 ordinary books for every one memorable book. This is one of the books that stays with a person a long time. It is very special. Don't be put off by all the twists and turns that seem hard to follow. Everything comes together beautifully in the end. Only a little is left unresolved. This is a very enjoyable and satisfying read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss' The History of Love is a lovely work of art; the words swell around you and draw you into the world of Leopold Gurksy and Alma. Beautiful and insightful and truthfully captures the agony and the ectasy of love.I love this book. It's a great book to read alone or with your lover."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"one of the best books i have read in a long time"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"When I saw the authors photo on the cover of the NYT Book Review (Oct 17,2010)I was struck by how young she looked and before I'd entertain buying or reading her latest novel I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and whether someone as young as she had enough life experience to write novels that were so highly touted.Here's what happened: I got \\"The History of Love\\" out of the library and started to read it. Granted, I already had a bias, but I was liking it for the first section. Although the \\"voice\\" was familiar and she kind'a sounded like a young female Phillip Roth but without his immense talent and \\"force\\" of writing.So I was familiar with Krauss's voice, anybody who'd grown up in Bkly'n as I did and read all the \\"Jewish\\" writers would be, so it was entertaining for a while. But now I want to say,\\"is that all you got?\\"The mystery is no mystery.I mean I didn't get far enough in the novel to unearth it and I didn't care. I'm not amused by mysteries and I don't read them and this is no different,so that takes care of that part. Her writing is \\"average,\\" I find nothing about it \\"wonderful,\\" in the least, and the structure of the whole thing, I'll have to go with gimmicky as some of the other reviewers here said.So other than sustaining herself writing for this length I find nothing extraordinary about this novel.I'd put it on the level of an average popular novel, nothing more, and I wouldn't invest my time to finish reading it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book is beautifully written AND has a well spun, meaningful plot, something which is woefully missing in many books. It'a a sensitively told tale, which is also a mystery. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"And this book pleases me. It is written with great compassion and insight, it breaks your heart the language is sensitive and stirring, the images evocative.... a wonderful new book to be cherished by many."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This reads like a graduate student's MFA thesis. Krauss bites off way more than she can chew, creating a too-clever-by-half pastiche that includes a Bellow-lite character, Leo Gursky, and two characters - the teen Alma (as opposed to the original Alma and the fictional (sort of) Alma (blah, blah, blah) - and her brother, Bird, both of whom are blatant rip-offs from her own husband, Jonathan Safran Foer. (Leo is a mysterious locksmith; Foer's \\"Incredibly Loud\\" narrator goes on a quest with a mysterious key. Jeez.) Except even living with Foer, Krauss can't muster more than a wan, second-rate imitation of him. Surely Krauss feels some affinity with her character Zvi Litvinoff; both are unduly celebrated copyists.Midway through this disappointing, self-satisfied and ultimately pretentious literary-who-done-it, I stopped trying to follow Krauss' implausible trail of breadcrumbs and could care less about who wrote what for whom, when or why. Although \\"WHY?\\" hangs over this whole misguided enterprise.Would this book have gotten the play it did if Krauss wasn't married to an excellent writer? What a letdown. Heavy boots."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"so sad and happy and full of words. and. yet. life! it made me cry.the loss and the life and the loneliness and the love and madness.a little slow to tango, but ultimately shockingly beautiful."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A poignant tale of love and loss and of the lives we influence without us knowing."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"An amazing synthesis of literary talent, interwoven characters, existential themes, poignant insights, heartbreaking tragedies, and humorous relief, Krauss' masterpiece is an irresistible, and an unforgettable, creation. The story unfolds through the increasingly interconnected journeys of several narrators who each seek to find direction, meaning, and purpose in their lives. Entertaining, suspenseful, and thought-provoking, the novel highlights the human struggle of living in the face of death vs. dying in the face of life."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Can't review it in depth without spoiling it. Just loved the Leo Gursky character....the story really resonates. Not a lot of surprises, but very well written. Read it, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I found this book in an airport book store because i wanted something to read for my flight. I knew nothing about it and was pleasantly surprised by the beauty and sadness of the book. The characters are very dynamic and have stayed with me."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I loved this book! It's sweet and funny and very human. The author has created characters that are so real you feel as if you've known them all your life. The story is captivating -- touching, moving, sad, hopeful, and hard to let go. It's not linear though, so practical types move on. But for the romantics among us, and for anyone who treasures the novel as a literary form, it's beautiful."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The plot isn't as complicated as it seems, but because the book is told by different narrators, readers may feel perplexed at times. The narrative by the main character, Leo Gursky, the Polish man who lost because of the War by the Nazis his family, the only girl he ever loved and the son who didn't know he existed until after his mother's death, is bleak but brilliant. The one by Alma, the teenage girl who lost her father to pancreatic cancer and was forced to grow up to comfort her deeply depressed mother, is both witty and naughty. And the one by Alma's brother, Bird, who thought he would be the Messiah for the generation, is funny and mischievous. Apparently a highly intelligent author, Nicole Krauss writes with sophistication and tenderness, knitting the different narratives pretty well, though some of the narratives are a bit boring. Some reviewers say they don't like the ending at all, but I love it. Two unrelated individuals of different generations, Leo and Alma, hug and comfort each other in their first encounter because of their shared experience of loss and compassion for each other. The ending scene lingered on my mind for a long time after I finished the last page."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"\\"The History of Love\\" has two outstanding characters with parallel stories destined to come together after a story of personal drama, with a bit of mystery and imagination combined with the Jewish theme. Krauss demonstrates a very literary style and, fortunately, has an excellent story to showcase her writing.Leo Gursky occupies the center and we could have heard more of his story. His narrative, with the exception of an odd nude modeling stint, was moving, compelling and sad. A life almost wasted, or maybe not.Krauss also captured the mind of Alma, nearly 70 years younger than Leo, as she deals with loneliness (her own and her mother's), early romance, and the mystery of her name and the other \\"History of Love\\". I liked her.Some reviewers were impressed by the character of Bird and his thread. He did little for me, and actually got in the way at times, in my opinion. I felt Krauss was showing off with the unusual personality of Bird and some fancy writing about him, somewhat of a sideshow."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I cried at the end, for heaven's sake! Great narrators (three!) read for the three story perspectives. A fabulous read and thought provoking ending--wonderful characterization, intricate/clever storyline."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This is the best book I've read in awhile! Had me laughing out loud and crying at times! Great book!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I was a little put off of this book by the title. I'm not really one for learning about the history of love. Even the back of the book didn't give me much hope for it but I had just gotten done reading two 700 page books and I wanted something small to read and so I picked it up off my bookself (where it had been sitting for months after a friend lent it to me) and began to read it. I read it in about 36 hours. I was hooked with in the first few pages. I needed to know who Alma was and why this book was so important to one family.I could not put it down and Leo and his quirks kept me laughing."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"In The History of Love, Nicole Krauss navigates the theme of loss through the characters Leo, a feisty octogenarian who refuses to become invisible by deliberately making a scene when he is out in public, and Alma, a tenacious teen who devotes her energies to assuaging her mother's loneliness. Leo and Alma use reading as a vehicle to connect them with those who they have lost, and they write in order to bridge the all-encompassing gap that exists between their desolate, loss-punctuated lives and the happiness bestowed by those that they love. In unexpected ways, it is their acts of reading and writing that resolve those losses. Unified by the processes of reading and writing that encircle them and ultimately, bring them closer and closer together until their climactic meeting at its conclusion.Sofia Sheth"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book is absolutely beautiful. The writing style is simplistic but still captivating. Though it bounces back and forth and requires the reader to pay at least a little attention, it is most definitely one of the most impressive books I've read lately."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book -- it is moving, fascinating, exciting and intellectually stimulating. Most of all, it is humane and depicts universal truths about romantic love, friendship and family ties. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"So many great reviews have already been written about this book so I don't have much to add other than I really loved this book. I happened to pick it up at the library and finished it over two weeks ago and I'm still thinking about it. Some have said it's a bit confusing to follow but I didn't have that experience. The Leo Gursky bits were my favorite and I wish there really was his \\"History of Love\\" book I could read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"From the point of view of a man in his eighties. Whose very life is dedicated to remembering. To a young, fresh, but hurt girl in her early teens. Whose keen dedication to her family leaves her exploring the city of New-York.Those two charatecrs are different in energy, age and experience. However, their similarties unravel beautifully by the end of the book. The sensation of love, in its true form isn't restricted to type, location, era, life-span, etc. And the way it all feels is perhaps the acme of this lovely story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book, which was excellent, in spite of the idiot at Publisher's Weeekly who decided to give away the last lines of the book in the start of the review! SHAME ON YOU PW!!!!!! So look down past that, note all the stars and just read it! It's worth the time, and time is valuable."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I fell in love with the main character in the first few pages. Looking forward to reading more from this author. She just drew me in to the book, and into the story. written beautifully."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Since February is the \\"love month,\\" I chose The History of Love as our book club selection for that month. While the feelings about the book varied among the club members, I was quite impressed with Krauss' ability to write such a multi-generational story of people whose lives intersected, collided, and affected one another. Our lives are entangled with those we may never even meet! Leo's son is a case in point. Well, actually, they did see each other at a book signing, but the son never knew the true story of his birth and heritage.The intersecting stories take place in different countries and eras, culminating with Alma (the younger) in NYC. A bit confusing at times, I didn't realize until the night our book club met that Bruno was really just a figment of Leo's imagination. Or was he for real? And who was Marcus? Was young Alma a descendent of the one who left Poland? And was the latter the mother of Marcus? Was Bird really one of the holy ones?Some people have complained about the book's anti-climatic ending, but I wasn't disappointed at all. How else could it have ended? Sure, I would have liked for Leo and his son to have met, but that would have been too predictable. Despite the ending and the somewhat confusing cast of characters and their relationships, it was still a good read. It reminded me of the most important element in the universe: LOVE. While its course may not run smoothly, it perseveres."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss is such a wonderful writer. I was hooked after the first few pages. Her descriptions are amazing. The main character remains one of my favorite among all the books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Beautiful book. It made me laugh, it made me cry. I will read it multiple times over the course of my life."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I have read all of Jonathan Safran Foer's work. When I finished his last book, I started to wonder what his wife's style was like. I picked up \\"History of Love\\" and found it is pretty darn similar! They write in almost identical styles using the same post-modern conventions. While I prefer Foer, Krauss brings her own charm to the literary world. The book is at times confusing. There are three separate narratives woven together, yet at times they are ambiguous. The details can be difficult to pin point. I am still struggling to piece it all together. As I read through the book, I found myself longing for the real \\"History of Love\\" that we only get snippets of in the novel. I think Krauss should go back and write the actual \\"History of Love\\" the characters continually refer to in the book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"There are chilling moments of beauty in this book, but more so, I felt as though the whole thing didn't hold together well. Many unanswered questions, which I suppose are intentional, but instead of being impressed by the author's empowerment of the reader, (as I feel I should be when a book offers unanswered questions) this book kinda left me saying, \\"huh?\\". Despite quite a few loose ends however, I still liked the book and would reccomend it strictly for the poetic passages."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love actually enfolds throughout this intensely personal look at love and life. The title of the book is also the title of a book IN the novel but above all,the title tells you in just 4 words just what the novel is all about. This is a book to savor and re-read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love has a plot complex enough for a very good mystery, some remarkable writing in its excerpts from the novel within a novel, an endearing teenager, and a happy ending of a sort, but one which makes artistic sense. Yet its main character, Leo Gursky, is a holocaust survivor, plagued by loss. For the reasons cited, I award the book 5 stars, but I do have some \\"complaints\\".I thought the whole idea of Gursky breaking out of his rut by posing nude for a drawing class was great, but in general I think Krause could have done better with Gursky - she seemed to compensate for a failure of imagination by overemphasizing his physical limitations. I didn't think making his friend Bruno imaginary adds anything, and was kind of pasted on (one reviewer pointed out that Bruno Schulz was an historical figure who died in the holocaust). I did not think the young brother was a successful character either. Finally, I was confused about the copy of his novel left for Gursky. The brother sets off to give him a copy, but that is chronologically after he gets it, as I understand the flow of narrative, even after re-reading some sections."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I am surprised how much people like this book.Ms Kraus has novel ideas in writing, but carrying them out is not within her scope. She makes cutesy lists, that seem to shed little to the tale except as an irrelevant punctuation.To keep from seeming predictable she opts for constant missed opportunities, and inabilities to communicate - becoming haplessly uncommunicative in the face of inexplicably offered kindnesses. Coyly ducking chances for resolution or sweet resolve; she'd rather frustrate her reader to show she's a \\"modernist\\", yet she then allows a lot of suspension of reality with her manufactured \\"coincidences\\", of meetings, communications found, at last...The quotes from this \\"wonderful\\" book, \\"The History of Love\\", so cherished in this novel, are trite. One can't help but wonder why anyone would swoon over it, offer it to a loved one, or read it to one's child, let alone obsess over it!All-in-all, I find her writing manipulative, sentimental tripe. If that's what you want, it's intriguing - disappointing to me; but others seem to love it, and are even willing to re-read it!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I'm an avid reader, but have never written a review. I felt compelled to do so for this book for the sake of other readers because it's one of the worst I've ever read. I'm sorry I even have to give it a 1-star rating. It's inconclusive, confusing, and wholly unsatisfying. I persevered, hoping it would come to something in the end, but it never did."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I write \\"perfect\\" because a great work of art without flaws is actually \\"imperfect.\\" For a reference, read: \\"The Spirituality of Imperfection\\" by Kurtz & Ketcham. Also, I have come to believe that it is wrong to pick apart new works by new artists, which, of course, is contrary to the critical world. A work and its creator should, I feel, be allowed to sit with the world for a while, in a sort of state of grace, to be fully understood. I only add this: I have sobbed at the final notes of two novels. First was \\"Vanished,\\" by Mary McGarry Morris; second, \\"The History of Love.\\" Bravo, Nicole Krauss."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers who emphasize the difficult to follow, convoluted style.

Unfortunately, it went all downhill from there. But for the strength of Leo, I would not have continued reading. This book was a big disappointment."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"In it's startling ends and begginings woven in to time, this book displays certain images that humans have desperatly pondered on for ages. It presents the question of life, of the true meaning that it holds. It also tells the vaguely lit story of a desperate writer still hanging on to the strong rememberance of his past loved ones. Through his quirky voice, there is presented a certain artificial shallowness. Though seemingly by the language a brave, old man he is truely lost of heart. This too, is in many ways what happenes in this life. He has a son he does not know who is a famous writer. He has a friend of the same bruetly melancholy breed. Lost souls are one of the most meaningful but simplest things to understand or write about as they already hold the scary object we all hold which is called problems. The happiest of people have problems but they are failing to admit it but melancholy people admit freely. And so, he admits here. The next character that is so bitterly described, is a troubled girl who wants to find out the truth behind a book called \\" The History of Love\\". These lives connect in unaccepted ways which bring up more questions which are never truely answered later. This is what keeps the reader going on reading this book. Though seemingly repetiful, it truely is not. For the swirling language of this gifted author makes the wrong doings of this novel spin away. the characters are fasinating in thier ways. And the book leaves a certain mark that can not be taken. It leaves a mark.. a mark of integrity, of sweet pain that though stopping for a while returns another day. And we keep hearing this song, this song of love even after the end. Go on, song! Go on. For it is a good song!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"None of the glowing reviews for this novel is accurate.I found it confusing and utterly frustrating. Just when you think it can't get worse it becomes ok. And just when it becomes ok it gets worse and you think you have nothing left to look forward to. Well let me tell you, the ending is just as baffling as the rest of the book.There are a very few pages that will endear you to them, but worry not, it lasts not long. If you're VERY bored this is an ok book. It will pass your time at times. But as for recommending it, it could have been soooooooooo much better.It's true most of it is written in so many styles it will leave you confused. But I'm no critic, make your own decision. I just know I will not look for more by this author."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"What an interesting book!

The last few \\"chapters\\" alone are worth the read, and may be the most powerful, thought-provoking, beautiful and haunting twenty or so pages in contemporary literature."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Five Stars!It was as though I was there: in the little, cluttered, chokingly dusty single room that Leo Gursky slept in; in the heart of a man's interrupted childhood love affair; in the letters and frantic searching of a young girl newly arrived in New York from Poland, alone, frightened, happy to escape the atocities of the Holocaust but with her future rushing in on her and her firm grasp on young love slipping from her control, her grasp, and finally her memory. A relatively new writer, Nicole was recognized almost immediately by critics and publishers as a burgeoning Great American Writer -- a new Hemmingway, an uncomplicated Updike, a committed Roth, a subtle humorist like Mark Twain whose finger touched indescribable sadness and humor simultaneously. If you've not picked up Ms. Krauss's book, do so now and lightly fondle it like a precious baby, hold it to your cheek and feel its warmth, feel its weight in your hands from the human emotions it packs so eloquently inside.Nicole is a writer! She's on my shelf, forever.Five Stars!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love was a deliciously tricky and beautiful novel. I loved the ingenuity of the concept and the story (stories) its/themselves. Two girls named Alma. Two novels known as the History of Love. One lost son, one lost brother.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good fiction and an artfully told tale."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book as absolutly great. Its a novel that can appeal to many different people, not only women who enjoy a good romance on a rainy day. This book incorporates a number of different characters who all are all weaved together to show the beauty of love, lost and new, and the interconnectedness of the human race. I sincerely recommend this to those who would like a to read a fantastic book about love and family and hard times that try the soul."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Once upon a time, there was a book, about a book, about a girl. And yet.What a book! I tried to write about it, but found myslef in a poor echo of the B&N; review, which I shall place below. The writing in this book is fabulous. Smidgeons and phrases resonate with a fullness that is astonishing. Several tales wrapped up in one, interweaving and yet independent. The depth and glory of first love, the rememberances of an old man, who has survived things that never should have been, the struggles of being a child..."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A History of Love by Nicole Krauss is a beautiful story of the power of love and an indomitable will to live, in spite of unbearable loss. Although every character in the book is dealing with loss of some kind, Leo, an elderly man who survived the Holocaust, and Alma, a young girl just coming of age, are the protaganists around whom Krauss builds the story. Their losses are both physical, the death of family members, and emotional, separation from living loved ones. The story of the delicate intertwining of the lives of Leo and Alma and their striving to overcome sadness and pain result in a poignant and powerful story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I've read this book 4 times now.

I have read it twice, and look forward to reading it again and again. Krauss pulls you to her gallery of characters with the most intimate of details, each character naked, his/her every quirk and pimple exposed. The theme is one of loss, remembrance and survival; of isolation and loneliness; of the utter alone-ness of her Beckett-like antihero; but most of all of the redemptive aspect of imagination - of imagination and love as the bare essentials for survival,[[ASIN:0393328627 The History of Love]"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I loved this book. Had to send it back to the library before I finished it, since it's on hold, so I've ordered a copy to own. My philosophy is a novel worth reading once is worth reading twice. With the exception of some genre fiction, if I don't feel it's worth reading a second time, I don't read it at all. I intend to read The History of Love twice: once to finish it and find out what happens;later, to appreciate what the author's artistry.As a reality check, I read some of the negative reviews. That's why my heading is \\"Beautiful to me,\\" rather than just \\"Beautiful.\\" Beauty is famously in the eye of the beholder. Techniques, plots and plot devices that one finds intriguing, another may find annoying contrived, or hackneyed. These judgments are never objective.If you have a kindle, my advice is try the free version and see how you react. Or, as I did, go to a library and check it out for a trial read. If you have a reader friendly local bookstore and you are a rapid reader, you may be able to sample that way.

How can it be that you find yourself laughing at pratfalls and Clouseau'esque pronouncements in the same page filled with grief so powerful that you had to pause to recover? In that context, I was disappointed with the ending which attempted a cleanup of all loose ends to create a moebius strip-like circular plot with a Hollywood-like neatness. Nothing intrinsically wrong with that, except the writing was not up to the task of keeping all the twists in place while maintaining the same naturalistic tone of the rest of the book.Nonetheless, a page turner.[Later edit] Ah, two revelations: One proceeds logically from the review above, the book has already been optioned as a movie. The second is pleasantly contextual, the author is married to one of the Foer brothers.

Leo's story seemed to have so much substance ahead. I kept reading so that I could learn what The History of Love was. I didn't learn a thing! After the initial Leo segment, I was confused, bored and disappointed in the next few chapters. Once the mystery was solved, I guess the book got better but by then, the story was over.

But this book was one of the most confusing I'd read in a while. I liked the idea of the story generally, and each character's story was interesting and well-written.

Interesting read, great the way it all comes together at the end."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"i thought chapter two was the content of the book leo had sent to his son until almost the end where it said something about kissing a boy.a lot of little difficult things to follow. like who's saying something, or who they're saying it to, or who about. you're reading along, it's all good, then there's a passage you read three times and still can't grasp. i can't fathom why editors if not authors can't weed these passages out and correct them, but it seems like there's some secret rule that they need to be included in all books, just like all cd lyric sheets are required to have at least one wrong word somewhere. it's a conspiracy, it probably has something to do with UFOs.in typical novel writing style it seems to continually push you to the brink of starting to skim from boredom before it progresses to the next interesting or significant point.i like it i guess. i mean i don't like novels but i like bits and pieces of it. whether it's worth enduring the generic portions for the value of the original ones probably depends on how much time you have on your hands. the craft of padding is in effect.page 119 i gave up, decided to skim the rest just to see how it ends, but after finding a return to relevence a few pages later went back and read it all.all original ideas have to have some relevence to generic ones, you can't have a silver apple without first having an apple, but i think overall this novel has more focus on generic stuff and an excessive amount of false starts or redirections. more originality than most books, but still more genericness than originality.devoting a paragraph to introducing and naming a pigeon that subsequently flies off is a pointless distraction from what is compelling a reader to read on. or maybe it's a quaint character trait, that the elderly Gursky names pigeons, but it seemed to only unravel his character development at a point where he was already bordering on intolerably dull, making me stop caring and call the book a waste of time.the constant \\"and yet.\\"s. do they make any sense? grammatical or otherwise?i thought about stealing \\"eulogized the falling leaves\\" for a song lyric for a second.the characters each start out depicted as though they have potential and inclination for great achievement and experiences. as they are developed their potential dwindles and they becomes defined by the restrictions and banality of their (sub)urban realities. the book gets continually duller as it progresses until the characters' potential to effect any kind of change on anything is so limited that a walk to the park amounts to a challenge and an adventure.the fact that elderly bruno was imaginary has no bearing on anything and seems like a pointless tribute to the fight club ending. everyone's ending seemed lazily open-ended. gursky's is the only one that is treated as significant. and what is he presumed to have found at the end? going by dialogue it's a stretch to conclude he understands his son has found and read part of his The History Of Love book before he died, but that's what seems to be implied. i'm left wondering why he didn't just call his son 20 or 40 years earlier if his son knowing he existed meant soooo much to him. if there was some reason he couldn't the ending would have had some impact.i can't remember how isaac came to find out leo was his fathereither. was that even revealed? i dunno. ok, yes, pg 216, it says isaac found some old letters from leo to his mother. that's all. it doesn't tell you anything said in the letters, it doesn't say whether they were written when leo was in slonim or after he came to america, and i realise that i can't recall if leo knew she was pregnant with his child or if she even gave birth in slonim or in america. i think the author has failed to direct focus to the revelations that have the most ongoing relevence. possibly the appeal in this book is more in putting the puzzle pieces together than in the content of the story."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is the first novel I've read in many years that has the quality of timelessness. It's imposible to put one's finger on just what makes this book so strong. The characters are remarkable (in their believability, in their vulnerability); the story is engrossing and always a step ahead of the reader; the writing is sharp to the point of taking one's breath away. Everything about this book is gorgeous, even when it has to be ugly. But more than all of that, it got under my skin. It made me hugely impressed, yes, but a number of books every year do that. This one also made me care. Is there anything more a novel can do?"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"In \\"The History of Love,\\" gifted author Nicole Krauss pulls out technique after technique from her literary bag of tricks. By using white space on the page, the remarkably different voices of an old man, a young burgeoning adolescent girl, a Messiah-complex-ed youth and the third person narrative of a guilty plagiarist, letters, journal entries and excerpts from a novel within a novel, she creates a wonderful set of indistinct parallel universes that collapse into an extremely momentous and satisfying final chapter of great emotional depth.The elder voice is that of the cranky realist Leo Gursky, a present day Jew living in New York City since he escaped from Poland during the Nazi regime. Long ago while still in his Polish village, he fell in love with a girl named Alma and like Dante with his Beatrice, immortalized her in a novel he entitled \\"The History of Love.\\" Sadly although he and Alma survived the Holocaust, their happily-ever-after never came to fruition; the love letter encapsulated in a manuscript seemingly lost over the transatlantic journey. Leo knows that his Alma gave birth to his son who now sixty years later has earned his reputation as a writer of great merit. Struggling with ill-health, Leo wonders in his marvelous voice that oscillates from the depths of despair to the heights of great passion and soaring hope if his son knows that he is his father.Simultaneously, in another part of the city, Alma Singer, a 14 year old girl ponders the death of her father and the fascination her mother has with translating a novel written in Spanish entitled \\"The History of Love,\\" by Zvi Litvinoff, who escaped from Poland to Chile in 1941. Because the name of the love interest in the novel bears her name, Alma allows curiosity to overtake her, researching the book itself, its mysterious author and the connection between her mother and the man who most generously has commissioned the translation.As the mystery unravels, the reader is privy to the powerful spirits of both these characters as they live their quotidian New York existences - one old with all the discomfort of the aged, the other young with all the fledgling awkwardness of youth. Intermingled with their musings and findings, we discover the most heinous crime that could befall any writer; we empathize and chastise the plagiarist who published \\"The History of Love\\" under his own name and robbed Leo of his place as a writer of note. As we shift from one voice to the next, we find ourselves never bored, just anxious as we speculate as the characters do how each separate piece of this novel within a novel will fit together to bring us all, real and imaginary to a conclusion that fulfills the books great promise.With great skill, Krauss achieves her goal; the finale is a lyrical as a poem both sad and immeasurably sweet.Recommended highly."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I found this novel to be very cleverly engineered and there is an abundance of talent here, but a lot of the Jewish themes were not as deeply felt or truthful as some other lesser known and less \\"trendy\\" novels. Kraus is surely a writer of promising gifts but many of the events and people felt insincere and painted there for effect and \\"laughs\\" in this book. The drawing upon Saul Bellow and Bruno Shulz may have been righteous but I think it was more imitation, one-dimensional and self-conscious."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book was hard to follow. Half the people in my book club thought one of the girls was a boy (the way the author wrote character). I would not recommend this book to anyone but a book club read. The reason for the book club reading this book is that the we all missed or found things that others didn't catch. So, it was a very lively book club but we basically all agreed (12 women) that we would not have finished the book if it wasn't our book club book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book was so well reviewed by the majority of readers that I feel I have to weigh in since my thoughts on the book are not as appeciative. Krauss can turn a phrase deftly and beautifully at times and there were some passages in the book worth writing down and saving but the story, essentially one of plagiarism, ill-fated love and missed opportunities becomes a slog. In fact, whenever the narration leaves Leo's first person and switches to Alma, or Bird near the end (why Bird!?), it loses strength. The story, convoluted as it is, doesn't sustain itself and in the end you just want it all to get wrapped up. It does but in a sketchy kind of way that still leaves lots of questions (but not in an interesting literary kind of way; more a \\"Oh please get on with it\\" kind of way). I started not to care about any of the characters except Leo who I just wanted to win one at last. Even his second book is-- unwittingly-- plagiarized by being pubished under his dead son's name. The fixation on Alma is obviously an Alma of the past because the Alma Leo meets once he arrives in America basically sends him on his way. Leo's story is the most compelling and the whole book, as far as I'm concerned, could have been about him and then might have been a great book. The book suffers from the hype of being fashionable but I don't think will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Some problems with History of Love1) sometimes the reliance on numbered lists seems at best overly cute at worst simply gimmicky2) only one of the characters is strongly, earthily, humanly realistic3) pet repetitive and frequent sentences such as \\"And yet.\\" or \\"But.\\" add little but distraction4) too many characters are poetically, whimsically odd5) and obsessive6) and eloquent and/or precocious7) the underlying tragedy, sadness of human existence sometimes is diluted by the sense that the characters and their stories are simply created and manipulated to serve a very well thought out plot that must go certain ways8) the novel-within-the-novel varies in quality, sometimes as wonderful as Borges or Calvino, at other times feeling like those two had been co-opted by an overly precious writerAnd yet.History of Love is almost always beautifully written. Its main characters, elderly Leopald Gursky (failed author unaware that his one great work thought lost has in fact been out there changing lives) and Alma Singer (young teen named after Gursky's love--a character in his novel) are strongly portrayed, especially Gursky who stands out somewhat as the one character in the novel that acts almost always in truly human fashion. His voice, his tone, his insights and memories, his sorrows (many) and triumphs (few) alone make the book worth reading. Alma is almost as strong, though she falls at times into the implausible or the precocious. Despite those instances, her search for happiness (either in her own young life or her mother's older more grieving one) and her sharply biting ache for her deceased father, make her a memorable and moving character. Her mother and brother have their moments, but they unfortunately feel much more artificial in their whimsical oddities and thus have less of an emotional impact. The plot sometimes seems unnecessarily complex, at times too neatly put together, but it holds one's attention throughout and has a strong payoff toward the latter quarter of the novel. In the end, while History of Love has its flaws, it remains one of the more moving and enjoyable novels of the year. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"My book club LOVED this book. We are a picky bunch and seem to take pleasure to taking apart one book after another. Not this one. Each of us found something different to like here. That made it the perfect pick for a book club discussion.So what's to like?First and most obvious is the intricate and clever puzzle of the story line. On the surface, it seems completely implausible--how could all these events, all these characters, on four continents, possibly fit together? Not only do they fit together, but each event is intricately motivated; each flows naturally into the next, and careful use of language knits them all together at another layer down. It is a pleasure just to delve into the craft required to do this so fluidly. Frankly, I don't know how Krauss does it, but it is lovely to experience.Next is the pervasive balancing act that so many reviewers have marveled at, between happiness and sadness, between humor and despair. Every mention of happiness is tinged with a sense of potential loss or disappointment; every loss is tempered by hope or at least an unwillingness (sometimes unconscious) to surrender. This subtle balancing act builds a rich, bittersweet sense throughout the novel. It kept me from seeing how funny the novel is during my first reading. A second reading let me relax into some of the silliest, even surreal situations, allowing me to appreciate the warm, human feeling of them in ways that I never did with comparable situations in Kafka or Borges.But enough of that; don't forget the characters, brought to life in the most disarming and unexpected ways. Some of us loved Leo; others found him a whining, tired old man. But all of us could agree that he was very much alive in our imaginations. I personally favored the young wild man, Bird. He is so determined to be something extraordinary as he stumbles forward in the most human ways. And--we disagreed about this, but I firmly believe--he became something extraordinary in the broader story of healing the deep wounds inflicted by the Holocaust.Krauss manages the Holocaust as a hole in a whole community's life--as an obstruction in the middle of the room that everyone must find a way around without admitting it is there. To convey this idea, Krauss talks very little about the Holocaust. Rather, it inhabits the margins of the story at every turn. We argued about this--part of the fun--but I believe Krauss constructed an intricately crafted web of connections that link all the characters in the book through multiple channels. She presents the Holocaust as a mass extinction that sought to sever these links and ultimately failed, but not without transforming the lives of at least three generations of Jews. She shows us the effects on each generation in myriad details in each character's everyday life.I ran into trouble trying to lead our book group toward a conclusion that the book is (among many other things) a parable about how literature and individual lives freely intermingle in the history of the global Jewish community and how sheer love of life, in its simplest, most basic every-day forms, sustained that community through a mass extinction. The book holds open a promise that this community can reconnect to the roots that nurtured and fostered it in the days before so many left their hopes and dreams and loves behind in Europe.So, those who have read the book will understand why I could not describe the closing pages of the book to my wife. Hilarious on one level, devastating on another. I was too emotionally moved even to read to her, much less try to describe, the extraordinary call and response between Leo and the Alma who kept him alive through so much. Maybe it's just me....But wait, there's more! Krauss plays intricate games with literary criticism. She uses four narrators with very distinct voices, two speaking in the first person, one in the second, and a fourth (at least part of the time) in a clever mix of first and second as one character reads the first-person account of a second character. She toys with arguments about the relative importance of author and text by presenting The History of Love in what I experienced as a series of scrims--first, the true life of Alma Mereminski; second, Leo's perception of her as a vehicle to keep himself alive; the third, Zvi's theft or appropriation of Leo's image of Alma to impress his girlfriend, one that combines Zvi's respect for the original Alma (he preserves her name) and Zvi's recognition of Leo's role as author with the disembodied text itself, which Zvi translates into Spanish; fourth, Charlotte's translation into English, framed by an entirely different and complex agenda. Each \\"translator\\" brings a new author's perspective to a story, generating a new text. So how exactly do all these perspectives and the contexts that generate them relate to the texts? What does each text embody, in and of itself? And let's not forget Isaac's appropriation of Leo's text after Isaac is dead! Very clever.There is so much here. I could go on, but enough. I expect to reread this novel many times in the future and to find new things with each reading. It is a pleasure, intellectually and emotionally, and a pleasure to share with friends. So. Stop reading these reviews and go read The History of Love for yourself!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book because there was so much hype around it and I wanted to give what people called \\"a modern classic\\" a try. First of all, let me caveat my overall impression with the statement that I REALLY disliked Nicole's husband's first book (Everything Is Illuminated), but I actually had no idea she was his wife and their styles had been compared in the past. All in all, I did like this book more. I thought the writing was decent - it flowed nicely and had great promise, but by about 2/3 of the book I started to feel that it was probably not going to fulfill my initial hopes. Suffice it to say that by the end, I felt like I was wasting my time and that none of the characters' plotlines were going to come to any sort of an interesting end. Alma sort of finds a resolution (but what happens to her and Misha?), Leo also sort of does (but who cares whether he met up with Alma or not?), Bird...I'm not even sure what happens to him, and Alma's mother's life remains the same, which is really unfortunate.Overall, very unsatisfying, and I'm baffled by the glowing reviews from others..."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"History of LoveIn reading History of Love by Nicole Krauss, I was reminded of the adage, \\"God is Love\\". Carefully crafted, History of Love is a novel within a novel that chronicles the lives of characters who talk about the fruition and loss of their loves, the beauty of erotic love, the power of parental love, the blessings of filial love, love of country, love of God and of angels that love the living. My final conclusion is that this novel is about God and Love.The Greek words that describe these forms of love are eros, agape, storge and filia; common themes that run in classic literature. My experience with this novel is elation from reading about ordinary lives that become extraordinary because of their being gifted with \\"love\\", and their exploring and living their lives with \\"love\\" and then arriving at the conclusion that indeed, all our relationships are instant pictures of how we relate to God. This may be a big stretch of the imagination but let me prove this by citing the following parts in the novel, hopefully, touching on how in most acts of creative work, man transports himself toward God, and he wonders what God is really all about, and what love is all about.1. Ziv Litvinoff, the boyhood friend of Leo Gursky, and who rewrote \\"History of Love\\" in Chile, wrote on his desk where the words Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai Elohaynu Adonai Echad, (Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.) were etched on the sides. \\"so that every time Litvinoff sat down to write at its sloped surface, he would consciously or unconsciously utter a prayer - nothing of the.....\\" p.67 Litvinoff would write his plagiarized version of the History of Love invoking this prayer. \\"History of Love\\" first gets published in Spanish and finds its way in the bookstores, to be picked up by a young Israeli (David Singer) and brings it home to his wife in New York.2. In \\"The Remedy\\", \\"Sing\\" and the books written by Isaac Moritz, Leo's son, the consistent themes that he writes about was man's relationship with God. \\"The root of his art was a passionate humanism and an unflinching exploration of man's relationship with his God\\". p.79 Leo Gursky's son was a famous writer and was the same man (Jacob Marcus) who wanted Eleanor Singer to translate the Spanish versions of \\"History of Love\\". Isaac Mortiz was the lovechild of Alma Merimisky and Leo Gursky, and was the son that Leo lived for. Leo followed his son's career and cherished him in spite of the fact that Isaac did not know him as his father.3. In the chapter on Love among the Angels (Chapter 18 in the original History of Love) Leo Gursky wrote , \\"The Arguments between Angels are eternal and lack hope of solution. This is because they argue about what it means to be among the living, and because they don't know they can only speculate, much the way the Living speculates about the nature (or lack thereof) - here the kettle began to scream - of God\\". p. 186. Unlike men, angels cannot love each other but are in love with the living. They have no idea what romantic love is. \\"This is not to say that they don't feel love, because they do; sometimes they feel it so strongly that they think they're having a panic attack....But the love that they feel is not for their own kind but for the Living who they can neither understand, nor smell, nor touch. It is a general love for the living .\\" p.186There are other subtle passages that are in the novel, much of it is about the Jewish faith that centers around \\"connectedness\\" in the most unexpected places, Poland, Russia, New York, Valparaiso, Santiago. Young Alma Singer's life gets connected to Leo Gursky's as they both meet, to unfold the mystery behind what happened to the original manuscript of History of Love, and the whereabouts of the original Alma in the novel. Young Alma Singer also discovers the true origins of her namesake. Here are two lives that intersect amidst the differences in time and place of where the original \\"History of Love\\" began."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"If you've never listened to books on tape, this is the book to start with.

It is unlike any love story I have ever read. Nicole Krauss crafts characters that are achingly original, raw, unforgettable.This book is a complex, complete, compelling work of art. It fell into my hands in an airport bookshop (a happy accident, indeed). After one chapter I felt I had been given the most precious gift imaginable. By the last page I knew that I had been blessed. A woman I do not even know gave me the story my heart had been waiting for. Leo and Alma and Bird have reminded me that no matter how alone, unseen and lost we all may feel - we are actually just an arm's length away from an embrace. (Thank you, Nicole.)"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Gorgeous, moving, thoughtful, profound, inventive, painfully exquisite, extraordinary.Simply a wonderful book in which to lose one's self for a day or two. No more, no less. I cannot speak of the similarities between it and her husband's book as I have not read his. And never felt compelled to. I was entranced by the first chapter of this book in the Gotham bookstore in NYC and didn't put it down for eight hours.I have subsequently given it to friends. I loved it. Really loved it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Ingenious, grand, and artistically coherent, Nicole Krauss' intellectually ambitious The History of Love takes the reader on a journey from Nazi occupied Eastern Europe, to the wild landscapes of South America and to the modern day metropolis of New York. A lost romance, a book called the History of Love, and a cantankerous old man desperately trying to connect with is writer son, are the threads that bind this strange, oblique, and technically complex work together. Full of literary, scientific and artistic illusions, The History of Love is challenging, cerebral, and also delicately vast in scope.The story begins with Leo Gursky, a grumpy, bitter old man who is trying to eke out a living in a grubby old section of Manhattan. A locksmith by trade he broods constantly about his disappointed life, often seeking the company of his best friend Bruno who lives a solitary existence in an apartment upstairs. As a young man in Poland, Leo wrote stories to impress Alma, his beautiful childhood sweetheart for whom he named all of the women characters in one of the volumes of his work that he never got around to publishing. Before he immigrated to America he gave the manuscript to his best friend Litvinoff for safekeeping. Just before the Nazis invaded, Litvinoff escaped to Chile where he meets and marries a young Spanish girl called Rosa. Together with Rosa he eventually builds a new life, and finally manages to publish The History of Love in Spanish.Alma, pregnant with Gursky's child also flees Poland for the U.S. but by the time he joins her five years later, she has married another man and has another child by him. Bitterly disappointed, Leo resorts to living a life in the darkness, spying on his son Isaac from a distance and scowling at the world. \\"We were locked in a state of mutual disgust. One day I realized I was on my way to being the sort of shmuck who poisoned pigeons. I was a human cancer.\\" Most of the time Leo is so consumed by thoughts of Alma and his own death that he learns to put a wall up against such thoughts. Each new thing he learned about the world was a stone in that wall, \\"until the day I understood that I'd exiled myself from a place I could never go back to.\\"Inserted into Leo's narrative is the story of the intelligent and gifted fourteen-year-old Alma Singer. Alma idolizes Antoine de Saint-Exupery and has an affinity for memorizing scientific literature. She was also named after the characters in an obscure Chilean book called The History of Love, which her father gave to her mother just after they met. But her mother, having recently been commissioned to translate the work into English by an enigmatic, wealthy man, is still lonely and sad at the loss of her husband.Worried and concerned, Alma begins a search for an appropriate new suitor, a search that leads to an investigation of The History of Love, the strange and beguiling book that is responsible for her name. She starts out looking for someone who could make her mother happy again, \\"now I was looking for something else too. About the woman I was named after, and about me.\\"The History of Love demands a focused and attentive reading as the constant spider web of history, the endlessly tangled family connections, and the characters' invariable miscommunications can initially confuse. Krauss also plays games with the page layout - Alma's sections are in numerical point form, and towards the end of the book, Leo and Alma's narratives are just single thoughts, feelings and beliefs on the page.Astonishingly, Kraus manages to make all the fragile filaments of the circular narrative not only hold together but also support the weight of the extremely ambitious tale. Full of incisive observations on history, life, and the ramifications of unrequited love, this impressive feat of storybook engineering will probably be remembered as one of the years best. But more importantly, The History of Love remains a bittersweet and rather sad ode to the magical influence of literature and writing. Mike Leonard May 05."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book reads like a short story that got expanded just to make it a book. The story of the old guy, Leo, is terrific in detail and longing and perspective. The rest reads like filler - clever filler, but still, the only voice I wanted to hear from was Leo's, and much of the rest is just irritating and so convoluted that it's hard to follow."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Amazon recommended this book to be because I'd bought 'The Time Traveller's Wife' and 'Shadow of the Wind', two of the best novels I've read (and I'm a book-a-week kind of girl). When will I learn? Like many other reviewers here, I finished the book only to wonder if I'd somehow missed the point. Yes, it's well-written, sweet and funny, but I can't quite see howt his adds up to all the hype and rapturous endorsements. The characters and plot are solid, but hardly 'vertiginously exciting' or 'astounding'. The love stories cover an awful lot of old ground, and as for the narrative structure, yes, it's non-linear, but this is hardly original, nor are the multiple first-person narrators - writers have been doing this since Faulkner, and few have come close to his level of skill.I read an interview with the author once, in which she described the writing of this book. Apparently she wrote Alma's story and Leo's separately for a about a year before she decided to try to meld them into one, and I think this is why the book ultimately didn't do it for me. The joining is very clever, and very complicated, but ultimately very contrived, and the cleverness and complication stifle emotional depth. For a book called 'The History of Love', this is a fairly distinct shortcoming."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Can you imagine, say for instance, if you yourself undertook the writing of a book with such an ambitious title?The History of Love.First guy: \\"So hey..... umm, what are you doing today?\\"Second guy: \\"Not much. Just working on a book called The History of [frigging] LOVE!\\"For one thing, there is no such thing as a history of love.There are only many histories of loves.And each \\"history\\" -- each story -- a unique, and inexplicable, one.The relevance so internal, is what I mean.Your love for another, for your loved one, your beloved -- only you yourself can know what it all means, if put into words.Those words would be inadequate.If at all meaningful to anyone outside of the relationship, terms would have to be generalized -- you would end up writing a philosophy of love, because anyone reading your work would not have truly experienced the unique thing you are describing. At best, they would know [or imagine] a vague approximation.The History of Love is a difficult book.Read a few reviews. You will see. It is not for the faint-of-heart.If you need a potboiler, don't go here. You're going to be waiting a long while to see any percolation, much less modest bubbles... never mind the lid rattling.A few times I wanted to abandon the thing. It's difficult. Almost like a real love-relationship, there is nothing simple about it. But I have discovered tonight [having finished the book mere minutes ago] that, as with a healthy love-relationship, patient tenacity will be worthwhile.Stay with this book to the end.The pieces you don't think are fitting, will.It's stopping in the middle that would be a mistake.Like a painting that means little in the first ten minutes.In the eleventh, it all hits you.As with history, so with love.To stop partway through is to miss the beginning."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"\\"THE HISTORY OF LOVE\\" written by Krauss is a fine example of how literature connects people to people whether fictional or real. The History of Love written by one of the characters in Krauss's novel, exemplifies the same virtue by way of keeping him connected to his one and only love. \\"The History of Love\\" as written by Krauss's character is also the thread that keeps the Singer family connected after a loss threatens to destroy them.Leo, who narrates much of Krauss's novel, is a holocaust survivor who spends his remaining days on earth reflecting on the life he could have had were it not drastically altered by the holocaust. Alma is Leo's muse and it is his love for her that keeps him alive.The Singer family, characters in Krauss's novel, adds another layer of complexity and connectivity throughout the stories. David and Charlotte meet in Israel, fall in love, marry and start a family. David, by chance, happens across a copy of \\"The History of Love\\" and names their first child Alma, in honor of the girl in the story. David's death is devastating to Charlotte who slips into a depression that lasts for years and alienates her from the children - each of whom try to cope with the loss of their father as best they can. Bird, the son, too young to remember much about his father turns to God and all things religious while Alma, the daughter, becomes engrossed in assimilating her father's interest and hobbies into her own life until that pursuit is replaced by her search for someone to make her mother happy again.Krauss has written a much nuanced and highly creative story that explores love, and what one will do in the name of it, from many angles. There is the all consuming love that renders both Leo and Charlotte incapable of having that experience again. And yet. There is the transitional love that changes with time, for better or worse, depending on the elements that influence it. There is the love that secrets forge. I've enjoyed Krauss's novel on many levels. There is an element of mystery that surrounds the publication of The History of Love. The characters are well drawn and uniquely identifiable by voice, making it easier to follow the multiple story lines and perspectives from which they are told. The novel contains a layer of complexity that I was able to grasp using the same approach that I've at times employed in the pursuit of love; that is, I simply turned myself over to it and followed where it took me. This read was well worth the effort. Kudos to Krauss for the delivery and Amanda for the recommendation; enjoy!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book over a year ago while visiting British family in London.

The History of Love is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I loved the book and it's various pathways, but it was difficult and confusing at times to keep track of it all.The author has great talent, I laughed and I cried, and will probably reread it at some time."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I had to order this book for the spring trimester of my English class. I was a little skeptical, thinking the \\"girl-seeks-love-for-her-mother\\" plot would most certainly end up in the clich&eacute;d ending of a happily ever after with the man of her dreams. Not only was I surprised to learn that the plotlines are entirely original, but that none of my predictions came true, and the outcome was one I would never have expected. The book is beautifully written, the stories jumping between protagonists, and time periods, journal entries and long-lost letters. The writting style is one I have never seen, and this book definitely deserves a spot on any favorites list. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and to my surprise I actually found it easy to participate in class discussions each day. Over all, a beautiful, moving book for anyone to read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love is a powerful novel narrated by several of the characters.

It was a book that was easy to jump into and difficult to set down."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Short summary:There may be a lot of criticisms over the confusion of characters,etc., but if you are a thinking reader, this is a great book, definitely worth your read. It is a 'meaning of life' book.I finished this book three days ago. At the ending, I 'thought' I was disappointed. \\"Wait,\\" I thought, \\"did I miss something?\\" I went back thru the book to make sure I got the characters straight. Yep. So I went to bed about 9 p.m. and woke straight up at 1 am - what's up with this book? I went back downstairs, got the book out and read parts again. Then I got on the internet and looked up some discussion groups, yes, I had understood it perfectly.So, after three days, this book is consuming my thoughts! I think about parts, then rethink them with the understanding of having finished the book.Enjoy@"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I will recomended to the people who likes \\"poesia\\", perfectly written. The stories very well blended."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Krauss's loveable characters break your heart and they journey they take heals it in a strange esoteric way. This is what reading is all about."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love has much to recommend it--two marvelous main characters in Alma and Leo and minor characters who actually seem to be real rather than just support plot development. Bird and Bruno in particular are finely drawn and Krauss' injection of humor and pathos are beautifully paced.I was ready to love this book and recommend it to everyone I knew until the last fifty pages. An absurd confluence of \\"happy\\" coincidence and a major dose of sentimentality spoiled it for me. A shame really--could've been great."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love, certainly the best book I've read this year, will stay with me for a long, long time. The voices are at times funny, justifiably sorrowful, a reflection of the ways of life, which lifts us to great heights that reveal the depths of loss. When we feel the joy of love, we know the immensity of the loss that yawns before us. As Leo recalls from his youth and the freshness of love, at the moment you fall in love, you are as happy as you will ever be and as sad. While the character of Leo is so very compelling that you yearn for his voice to return, young Alma is expertly realized, as well her younger brother, Bird, and their deliciously believable and brilliant mother. Each share the wound of loss, having fallen from great heights. Only a truly gifted writer could weave such a plot, at times difficult to follow, and bring her readers to an ending that ever so deftly affirms life and what makes it worth living, love. I cherish this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book contains some of the most beautiful prose I've ever read, but I'll admit to some frustrating moments. I loved Leo, but found the parallel story hard to follow at times. My book group met last night to discuss it, and some interesting points came out. (Spoiler alert!)The most compelling idea presented was that Alma Singer and her family didn't really exist. Their story was the book Leo was writing in the present day. He created his own reality throughout his life, (e.g. his relationship with the long deceased Bruno)so why not create the young Alma? I recommend this book for book groups, rather than as a solo read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Other reviewers have said much in praise of Nicole Krauss's beautiful & sensitive History of Love, which was my book club's choice for June 2006. I can't top the superlatives, much as I'd like to, & won't bore readers by trying.The subtleties of Krauss's writing are what make the book such a wonder, & her mention of The Street of Crocodiles is not to be overlooked. As you read, before the fog of confusion that has not lifted for some reviewers engulfs you, google Bruno Schulz & read his story. It is almost certainly the impetus for Leo Gursky & The History of Love.Much to look forward to from young writers Nicole Krauss & talented husband Jonathan Safran Foer."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss has written a truly brilliant book. I can't recommend this novel highly enough. With quirky characters, sad humor, a love story about loneliness and death (or a loneliness and death story about love?), a detective story that is solved only to be purposefully (and playfully) thrown into confusion again, this whole novel is a juxtaposition wrapped in dichotomies and peppered with what seem to be unsolvable mysteries. The simple, beautifully written prose is not difficult to understand, and neither is the plot, even though there are multiple narratives being told simultaneously. Alma's parts were the most enjoyable - as they were simple, but belied a knowledge of the world beyond that of a \\"normal\\" 15-year-old. Do yourself a favor. Read this book!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Ultimately, this is a tale of the triumph of life over the alternative, no matter what the circumstances or how precarious the grip on living. The central character, Leo Gursky, is someone to treasure for his tenacity and prickly personality. But the book is organized using alternate narrators and it jumps around from person to person, place to place and past to present in a most confusing and off-putting way. Granted, it's an original way to tell a story, but I found that I lost the thread of the action when it moved away from Leo's tale. Eventually, the two stories intertwine but it takes too long and link between the parts is so tenuous that it's hard to keep the characters straight. Not recommended. My score would be 2.5 if fractions were available."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I must admit that I started this novel and put it down the first time. However, the second attempt was completed in a couple of days. I will not spoil the story with a recap, but just add some comments to help future readers. I did not notice until almost done..the little pictures heading each new chapter. A compass for Alma, an arc for Bird, a heart for Leo, and an open book for Zvi. I found myself diagramming the family with squares and circles to keep track of who was related to whom and what generation each character belonged to. I thought Bird's story was a bit ill fitting for the story, though I could also sympathize with a young boy's magical thinking and imagined superpowers. Don't we all wish that we could control life more than we think we do? If anything, Bird's playing with the outskirts of sanity mirrors Gursky's questions about his existence and the unimaginable nightmares, depression, and loss of sanity that these WWII survivors must have gone through. I agree with other commenters that Gursky's point of view in the story is a grand and well written voice. Gursky's asks the question, \\"If not you, who?\\" several times in the book. He might have said, \\"If not me, you?\\" There seems to be a sense of resonsibility or destiny in Gursky when he asks these parenthetical questions. Someone has to live; someone has to die; someone has to love someone; someone has to lose someone. Someone is always needing to take a role in life. His memory of hiding in Poland (in the potato cellar while the soldier was strolling by, talking about his perhaps unfaithful wife) reminded me again how my own thoughts and actions can make a huge impact on someone else's life however removed. The plots seemed a touch forced, too many coincidences, but didn't detract from the flow and artistry of this novel. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book right on the heels of Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close which, of course, was written by Krauss's husband, Foer. Perhaps that was a mistake. While I enjoyed The History of Love, I didn't feel that it was as refined or powerful as Foer's work. Some parts of the novel seem a bit to contrived and predictable. Still, I would rank it among the best books I have read recently. It is certainly worth the time and effort though, like others here, I don't think it is an easy or quick read. It takes a bit of effort, but in the end, the characters will capture your heart."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Books rarely bring me to tears because of how beautifully written they are, but here is one for you to try. First: the language. Such voices in my head, I can't tell you. Second: the structure is gorgeous. I've often grown impatient with the common device of alternating between and among characters, but this time it works just perfectly.Finally, the truth. This writer knows people, evokes them with an unblinking eye for detail and tone. Rueful, strange, nearly blanketed with sadness at times, yet. So good.I didn't really expect to like this book much, but you know, the reviews were promising.And delivered."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"A very romantic and poignant story of lost love. I found the narration of Leo to be compelling, gripping, and humorous. The parallel story of Alma was unfortunately a bit tedious at times; it seemed to just go on and on...I found myself skimming Alma's narration, while relishing every word of Leo's story. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I have never gotten teary eyed finishing a book (and I've read a lot). This book did it. I wasn't wailing, but I got misty and it wasn't a Hallmark-induced, \\"you-must-feel-this-way\\" sentiment; it was totally real and totally authentic. Krauss writes deftly and the tale of Alma, searching to cure her mother's (and her own) loneliness, and Leo intertwine perfectly but without the predictability that often accompanies stories structured in such a manner. If you've ever loved, if you've ever lived, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love: A Novel is a book, which is recognizable in real time, our time, and not another \\"world\\". Yet through a leap of belief and an extremely long life- one character lives to near present day through his own early writings (with passages in this book) and his profound loneliness. This book was about a book, about the inner voice of each multi-aged characters expressed through their thoughts and through their writings, with several characters writing in their own voice in a novel that is an effortless read and a journey to the inside of the soul. It will be a lifetime favorite for me."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Loved this complex book and all of its eccentricities. The connections between plot lines and stories were very well done and the ending was powerful in its simplicity.At times this book will break your heart, yet you wont be left to wallow in the sadness.

I cant wait to read this book again, as Im sure that a second look will reveal more than can be absorbed by just one read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book was one of the most beautiful works I have ever read - it is definitely a modern classic.

While I appreciate why that may be the case, I was more touched by Foer's book, believe it will stay with me longer and be the book I recommend if asked to choose between the two.\\"History of Love\\" appears to me a feat in literary virtuosity. Krauss uses bunches of sophisticated techniques, the flashbacks,the story within the story, the one-page chapters and one-sentence pages, all to powerful effect. However, to an \\"amateur\\" reader of better books like me, much of this effect is a lost, and becomes instead a difficulty in following what is going on. For that I can only blame myself.\\"Everything is Illuminated\\" also used several of these techniques, and is no trivial read. But somehow, at the end it all built up into a dramatic scenario that left me in tears, and amazed at Foer's prowess. Foer's book also had the added pleasure of the delightfully original humour in one of the narrator's prose. At the end of \\"History..\\", my feeling was one of accomplishment at having read something wonderful, mixed with a slight frustration of not knowing exactly why."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book hooked me from line one. Leo Gurskey is one of the funniest, saddest, and most real characters I've come across in years. I was very sad to see this book end. It's unusual, original, deeply moving, and lyrical.

It was overwritten, self consciously mannered and just plain annoying. The picture of old people was revolting-- too much bathroom minutia.

Oh, well-- each to his own."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This book could have been much better than it was. The voice of the old man was wonderful and compelling; however, I found the story told by the girl about her family relatively uninteresting & the sections told by her brother a chore.The common thread among them was original, as was the ending, but it just didn't move me as much as I expected it to. Not enough closure?

It is a wonderful book, thrilling in that manner of slow realization that we find with each new love.If this is only her second novel, imagine what this young author has for us in the future.WRITERS: If you think great writing is dead, think again.

I lost interest and after a while gave up. My interest was piqued with the charachter of Leo but Alma, Bird and her mother left me cold and I couldn't have cared less what happened to them. I remember thinking let's get back to Leo, at least he is interesting but I couldn't push through any longer."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History of Love was a selection for a book group. It clearly split this group down the middle. Readers either loved it or found it boring.This is the narration of a man's life through war, love, loss and enlightenment. He discovers that a story he wrote for the woman he loved has been published by a younger man many years later. As he searches to remain a visible presence in the world, the elderly locksmith seeks out the truths that seemingly lock themselves out of his reach.There is also a very young woman looking to obtain information on who she has been named for.The tale entertwines itself in a way that makes it nearly burdensome.The people that loved it, loved it a lot and defended it vigorously."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I started this book with such high hopes. I feel in love with Leo right away and was so excited to \\"enter\\" his life. The story for me, however, got confusing FAST. I couldn't follow what was what and who was who... I think that was supposed to be part of the charm but for me, wasn't. I read the whole story hoping there would be some redemption in the end, but was sorely disappointed. Good luck!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I'm left scratching my head at the critical acclaim this book has received, although if you start looking, there are many middling-to-bad professional reviews out there. What disturbed me most about this book is the way it plays fast and loose with historical truth. If you are going to invite historical characters -- real people -- into your book, such as Isaac Babel and Franz Kafka and Bruno Schultz, you had better do your research. What Krauss writes about these people is misleading. Babel disappeared and certainly died in the Soviet prison system, but what his last days were like is certainly not known. And Kafka, who published very little in his lifetime, would have been unknown at the time of his death, and so the celebrity \\"obituary\\" she inserts in the book is puzzling and misleading.That aside, I agree with many of the reviewers here that Gursky's story, especially in the beginning, has potential, but ultimately that potential is never lived up to. The characters feel flat and stereotyped; it is hard to connect with them. The \\"novel within a novel\\" which is also titled _a History of Love_ isn't gripping or magical at all, like so many of the characters insist -- it actually reads pretty poorly, isn't very well-imagined, and at times seems downright silly. I'm all for magical realism, but a kind of magical realism that *earns* the suspension of your disbelief, that presents a fully-imagined new world. This isn't that kind of writing."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"The History if Love, is beautifully crafted and heart felt. The story follows the perspective two main characters, Alma and Leo, and includes the thoughts of a few other supporting characters with an important role in the novel. Especially from Alma's perspective, the story truly takes flight. Alma wants to find her namesake from the book her mother is translating (this book is titled The History of Love). While Leopold Gursky, a Jewish immigrant from Poland and survivor of the Holocaust, is trying to make peace with the decisions that have created his existence in old age. It is, when all is said and done, an ingenious story of self-discovery for multiple characters.I read this for a book club and we haven't talked about it yet, but I feel there will be ample discussion points and would highly recommend the book for this. The other book club members have also said they really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"If you like good writing, you don't want to miss this book. I wasn't hooked by the first few pages, but thank G_d, I picked it up again before returning it to the library. I loved all of the characters, especially Alma. Krauss's story manages to be both mundane and yet magical. It was probably the best book I read this year."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book as a book club selection. I'm not sure I'd have ever picked it off the shelf without the club, but I'm glad I did. Nicole Krauss weaves a fascinating tale. Some of our book club members had a hard time following it. Just keep in mind that those funny little symbols at the beginning of each chapter represent a different character's voice and perspective. I found the characterization wonderful. Each voice so distinct I didn't need the symbols. The old man, Leo Gursky, so honest and candid and so lonely. Take care, this book can bring tears to your eyes."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book after being amazed by the craft and power of Great House. Although it took a bit before I was hooked, I enjoyed this just as much. In fact, after just finishing it, I'm going to read it again so I can put together all the \\"clues\\" and admire Krauss's craft even more.

Part of it was the book within a book conceit, which seemed just to say pretty things in pretty ways.But in the end, I was tremendously moved (I cried through the end and for ten minutes afterwards), and am still thinking about how it all came together, in that way life often does - unhappily, unresolved, and with just enough of the human essential: acknowledgement. Thank you, Ms. Krauss. I'll look forward to more."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This was July's book club selection and I greatly enjoyed it! In continuation with our current WWII theme, this book is more about the layers and coincidences of life and relationships than about the war itself. Strange and beautiful, the unique style and perspective completely caught my attention. There was a definite storyteller-quality to the book - particularly from the sections from Leo's point of view.

Very happy with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This novel was recently recommended to me by a friend who has great taste in films, poetry and novels. I usually love multi-narrator, multi-time period, multi-setting quirky novels-- especially when the stories come together.But I felt like this was a jumbled up version of some of my favorite books. Namely: Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and Everything is Illuminated by Jonathan Safran Foer (who is Krauss's husband) and the Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery.Let's look at the parallels (spoilers)-Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close--Mother experiencing depression after loss of a husband-Children suffering living with a depressed mother-Child going on a quest to discover more about their lost father-Setting in New YorkEverything is Illuminated--Escape from Holocaust in Eastern Europe-Under appreciated authors-Story of lost love divided by the HolocaustElegance of the Hedgehog--Precocious, loner, female narrator-Seemingly everyday elderly person who is surprisingly intelligent and insightful-Unexpected friendship/ bond between the young girl and the insightful old personIn conclusion, I think that there are better developed novels that have the same themes. If you like what you read in the plot summary, I'd recommend picking up these three other novels instead."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Why is it that readers like books about books so much? Here we follow the connections via multiple narrators of a book written in Poland just before World War II called \\"The History of Love\\". The author of this book is our prime narrator and we find him an old man living in the past. He fathered a son who is now a famous writer. And now the text of his long lost book has surfaced... and then there is the friend Bruno who lives upstairs.The writing is superb but the story's structure(if there is one)left me mostly confused and frustrated. I found the book's single minded focus on loss, dealing with loss, understanding loss, feeling someone else's loss just a bit to depressing no matter how interesting the writing. Yes, the book does have some humor but it is but a minor part of the narrative. I found the book difficult to stay with and really only did so with the expectation that the ending would make the read worthwhile. This was not a page turner by any means. It did in the end offer up an interesting ending where the narrators' story lines all come together leaving us asking, what is real and what is not?It is interesting that in giving this book a middling review I think it might be better upon a second reading which I might undertake one day."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this novel for a college English class and it made for some of the best discussions we have had thus far. If you need a book to analyze, review, or write a report on this is an excellent candidate. There are so many intriguing thesis statements to explore, particularly the debate over what is real and what is imaginary. Our class had many Inception-like theories about the novel which made me want to read it again as soon as I was finished to pick up all the details I had missed the first time through. Another unique aspect, of course, is Krauss' display of the Holooaust as it relates to modern day America which is very fresh and different from reading memoirs or even historical fiction. By relating the stories from multiple generations, Krauss creates a story that shows how each layer of history is still very raw and real in the present. Overall, this is an amazing book that will break your heart. I am so glad it was an assignment because I may not have found it any other way, and it is now one of my favorite stories. From a student's perspective, it is a great source for paper writing. As a reader, it is a story that will touch you and never leave you completely."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Man, I was all set to rave about this brilliant, brilliant, moving, and brilliant novel until I looked up author Nicole Krauss and found out she's a year YOUNGER than I am. Now I'm consumed by too much self-loathing and jealousy to be able to think of anything interesting to say about her book.I'll suck it up. Give me a minute.Okay.Let me begin by saying this novel took me over a month to read, not because it's long, not because it's boring, not because of anything negative about it whatsoever, but simply because it made me cry every ten pages or so and that made it hard for me to, for example, read it on the bus.The novel tells two stories from two narrators, and it seems clear from the first page that these stories will eventually intertwine -- what's less clear, even at the half-way mark, is HOW they will intertwine. The first tale is the one that had me bawling on a regular basis -- it's about an elderly man, Leo Gursky, a Jew who lost his entire family in the Holocaust and eventually lost the love of his life as well (they got separated during the war and when he couldn't find her for years afterward, she lost hope and made the painful decision to marry someone else). Leo is a lonely man, despite the daily presence of his strange and wonderful best friend Bruno, and his greatest fear is that he'll die completely unseen. For that reason, he goes out every day and does things like knock over display stands in stores -- on purpose, to be noticed. To be looked at, talked to, maybe smiled at. Once, he even agrees to pose nude for an art class, just to give himself the hour-long sensation of being visible.Oh, break my heart, Leo Gursky, you wonderful, hurting man. And then let me kiss you tenderly on the aged cheek every night before bed until you are finally gone from this world. It's all I will take -- I won't settle for less. I love you. I love you. I love you.The second story is about a young girl, Alma Singer, desperately trying to find a boyfriend for her widowed mother, while also struggling to keep a strong hold on the memories of her dead father. When a man writes her mom asking for her help in translating an old book, THE HISTORY OF LOVE, from Hebrew to English, Alma becomes obsessed with him, writing letters pretending to be her mother in an attempt to forge a connection that might finally pull her mom out from under the heavy veil of depression that's been dragging her down for years.How these two stories end up converging, I'm going to leave for you to discover. Suffice it to say I found this entire book absolutely breathtakingly-written, sentence after sentence of the most empathetic and powerful prose I have encountered in a very long time. I could hardly stand to read it at times, it was that goddamn good.And if that's not enough to get you to give it a try, maybe this will do the trick -- the last two sentences of this book, soft punches to the heart, are:He fell in love. It was his life.Oh, beauty. Such beauty. Buy it, read it, be changed. It's worth the tears."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"There are books that when I finish them, I'm not ashamed to admit, I kiss them softly like someone I love who's going away. It moves me so much that it's no longer just a book, it's something alive in my hands that's changed me. Changed the way I see the world, how I want to write, what I want to discover from the people I meet.It seems a book about three different people who are completely unconnected, but as always with books that start out like that they are all interconnected. The ways that they are connected though are so shocking, and so lovely that you're left completely surprised. The three different voices that are used to narrate are people that you fall in love with, young girls full of vigor and old men withering and a man so lost and far from home. Their pain touches you, their stories intrigue you.Without a doubt, this is one of the best books I've read all year. It's powerful in its subtlety, the threads that are connected throughout the book till suddenly in the last ten pages everything is crushed together and your heart breaks. The ending is so moving, so powerful, I can't imagine something more perfect. Nothing is more important to me than stories that take something like the holocaust and put it in a different context than what you would normally see; this isn't just another memoir about how hard life was during the holocaust. It's a story where the history of WWII is woven so tightly into the lives of these people, you can't extricate where the war stories begin and the character's personal histories end.The book flows without pause, ceaselessly keeping you enthralled and touching every inch of you until you just start to cry because you can't keep the emotions in anymore. Or perhaps that's just me... Regardless, it's beautiful and gorgeous and everything everyone has ever said about it. This isn't hype guys, this is 21st literature at its absolute finest."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Surveying the writing style and characterization within Klauss' novel--the intertwined multiple narrators, the reflections on the lives of Jewish immigrants and their decedents, the plot element of the child searching to illuminate the mysteries of his or her family's elusive past--it's not hard to believe that she is married to Jonathan Safran Foer. And, being a great fan of Foer's novels, that's perfectly fine with me.The story unfolds like a mystery novel, beginning with two seemingly unrelated narrators and unfurling--slowly at first, and then more rapidly as the story progresses--to reveal an outpouring of unforeseen plot twists and unlikely connections. Both of the main characters, the old and lonely Leo Gursky and the young girl Alma Singer, are beautifully crafted with a fantastic combination of honesty and quirkiness. There were parts where each of their innocently hopeful and often pitiable perspectives on life brought me to laughter and even outright tears.The History of Love is easily the best book I've read since reading Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close several months ago. As the story drew towards its climactic close, I found myself eagerly turning each page, impatiently awaiting the resolution; while, at the same time, a part of me regretted deeply that it should all be over so soon. My consolation is the certainty that Klauss' memorable characters will undoubtedly stay with me for a long time. I urge anyone and everyone to find a copy and read it."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I loved this book. The language is beautiful; so many sentences I just had to stop after reading them and marvel at how perfectly profound it is. The contrast of the different characters is phenomenal, though a little confusing at some points since the plot unfolds only as you read on. Leo Gursky is perhaps one of my favorite characters in fiction to date."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I loved this book. It's a great read with a haunting theme that has stayed with me. It is well-written and the complexity is, for the most part, very well managed. I recommend it highly.The History of Love: A Novel"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I had to read this book for my bookclub and it was really really different than I thought when I read the jacket. It moves and it always seems to change and shift before it gets too dull. Its a strange read though, not sure i'd pick it up on my own."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I will skip the plot review.I abandoned this book several times before finishing it. It is not a page-turner. Every time I picked it up again, it took me several chapters to sort out who was who. Even when I had it sorted, there was confusion. The links between characters are revealed gradually, so that the early chapters read like several independent novels. Eventually, everything is illuminated.Leo Gursky, the protagonist, wrote a novel within this novel that is presented in fragments. It is difficult to read. He writes in near stream of consciousness style. There is no discernible plot to Leo's work. It is interesting but peripheral to the story, although the author apparently wanted it to be central.One thing bothered me about the plot: Leo knew about his son, watched him from a distance at times, but never revealed himself to him. The reasons for this heartbreaking choice were not fully explored, even though it was believable, considering Leo's nature and history. It was the most compelling part of the story for me, and the result was slightly disappointing.The most frequent sentence in this story consists of just two words: \\"And yet.\\" The author does a pretty good job of capturing the cadences of a Polish-Jewish immigrant's English. The characters speak in different voices, yet they all share certain characteristics: a constant interest in bodily functions, a tendency to think tenderly while speaking sharply, and a tendency to isolate themselves. They all live with the loneliness and depression of holocaust survivors and their families. And yet.Finally this book is about love, as the title suggests. In spite of my occasional confusion and boredom, love runs through the whole of it. The ending is an affirmation of love, and for that I salute the author. There is no more worthy topic for a novel."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"This was the most wonderful book I have read in a long time. It is quickly becoming one of my all time favorites. It was such a touching tale of love and just humanity in general. I did not think the \\"flaws\\" other reviewers speak of took anything away from the book. In fact, I find myself going back and re-reading certain parts of the book. Every time I read it again I make new discoveries about the characters and the plot. This was truly a beautiful book that I hope becomes a classic. A must read if you have good taste in literature. I cannot wait to read future books by Nicole Krauss!"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"What a great book. Now, I am not going to get into the story, I don't think that is fair. I will just tell you this book was very well written and very enjoyable. A must-have read for anyone."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I found this book because it was recommended to me by Amazon based upon previous books that I purchased. Usually I do not find myself liking the books that Amazon flags as books I would like, but this time I did. Set across time, the novel is beautiful and hopeful, tragic and sad at the same time. I instantly fell in love with characters and cared about the young girl's search for love for her family. I was moved by the old man and his best friend downstairs. If you have read \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", you will be familiar with this book's 'book within a book' format' which can be a bit confusing. This novel falls a bit short of 5 starts as I feel the ending was rushed and that the author wasn't sure what exactly she wanted and therefore the ended came across a bit muddled. All in all a beautiful novel that will not stay on my bookshelf because I intend to circulate it amongst all my friends and family."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I was captivated from the outset by The History Of Love, which opens with a narrator called Leo Gurnsky. He is in his 70s, lonely and waiting to die. He lost the love of his life when they became separated during the Holocaust. By the time he found her, she had given him up for dead and married someone else, raising his child as her husband's son.Then the narrative jumps to Alma, a girl aged 14 who lives with her mother and younger brother. Her mother has been alone since Alma's father died, and Alma wants to set her up with someone. Her mother has been asked to translate a book and Alma wonders if the client might be a suitable candidate.At this point I was curious to know how these two stories would intersect. Everytime I thought I had found the connection I would be proven wrong, and it's not until the very end of the novel that it all comes together. I can understand the reviewers who feel they didn't fully understand the book because I do feel that my grasp on what really happened is a little tenuous! This would be an excellent choice for a bookclub, as it leaves you wanting to discuss it with someone.It's also a beautifully written book that is a joy to read. The sections narrated by Leo are particularly wonderful. The language throughout is rich and the narrative is multi-layered. It reminded me in many ways of \\"The World to Come\\" by Dara Horn, and I also recommend that book to anyone who enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Nicole Krauss has written a convoluted story of love lost and the emotional reconciliation for that loss, of course recognizing that reconciliation is never complete or just compensation. The basic story is of a young Jewish man and woman in Poland who are childhood lovers, but through the horrors of the Holocaust and World War II are separated and are never able to repair their relationship after each has moved forward with new lives and relationships. At least this is the case for Alma, the beautiful Jewish girl who escapes from Poland as a pregnant unmarried woman trying to survive in the new world. For her lover, Leo Gursky, the vast emptiness remains since he loses both Alma and his son, Isaac. Leo has written a book about his love for Alma but the chaos of war and terror leads him to believe that it has been lost.A second storyline in the novel involves Leo's competitive journalist best friend, Zvi, who survives the war by fleeing to Chili where he marries the younger and charming Rosa. He has brought with him Leo's novel which he hides for many years until he decides to translate it from Yiddish to Spanish as a gift to his wife and to impress her. Rosa pushes Zvi to publish the book in Spanish in Latin America, which Zvi reluctantly does since it is not his book. Eventually Rosa realizes the truth and realizes that Zvi's love for her was the driving force in the deception. The book is purchased and read in Buenos Aires by an American Jew, David Singer, and given to his wife Charlotte. The book so impresses both of them that they name their daughter Alma after the central character in the novel.The third story line is a request from a mysterious Jacob Marcus to translate the Spanish novel into English. Marcus makes this request of Charlotte Singer, a professional translator, after the death of her beloved husband David. Yet a meddlesome young Alma Singer gets into the action and tries to sort out who Alma, Leo, Zvi, and Jacob Marcus could really be.Through a maze of letters, manuscripts, translations, and twists of fate, the characters interact. Some of the characters have long been dead, others imaginary, and others living in another world of their own reality. Yet together they weave a tapestry of how painful loss colors human existence. For in this novel, as in many novels, a central theme is that human existence is a series of losses and attempts to recover from those loses. This is the theme that Leo uses for the second novel he writes, which ironically is also published under the name of another.The book certainly deserves 4 stars for its vibrant characters and wonderful humor by which painful life experiences are explored with a touch of wit. Yet, the book does not warrant five stars. The reason for this is that Krauss has woven too complicated a plot of too many twists and turns, leaving the reader in the situation of trying to savor the resolution of events while trying to remember hundreds of mundane hints and lose ends left hanging throughout the novel. Less artifice and more art would be appropriate here. The technique began to overpower the message. Her literary tricks become predominant whereas the tragedy of the characters receded. Less virtuosity would have produced a stronger novel."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"What if the world around you changed drastically in the midst of your first love? It would leave you, like Leo, to live in the innocent haze of first love that one only experiences once in a lifetime.This is the story of a book, its author, its translator, and a number of other characters who are no longer alive. Each used the book for love- to express lost love, love of a child, and as a means of courtship. The book within the book, in its infinite translations, is called the history of love, while the nicole kauss' history of love contains an example of every kind of love, therfore becoming yet another translation of the history of love."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I enjoy a wide range of literature. But, I am sorry, I did not think this book was worth my time. I got very frustrated with Krauss' writing (\\"And yet.\\", \\"But.\\"), I did not find a real mystery or climax, and did not perceive any sense of closure for any of the characters.On the other hand, if you want to read a good book about a book, please accept my recommendation of \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", a truly entertaining and beautifully written novel.

I liked Leo and contemplating his loneliness. I don't like profanity. I could have really enjoyed this story without the profanity and a couple of uncomfortable scenes. I'm old-fashioned. If you are too, I'll save you the discomfort of reading this book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I didn't love this book. I didn't hate it either.The History of Love is about 2 people. A man, Leo Gursky, who fell in love with a girl at age 10, wrote a book about her, then lost her. And a girl, Alma Singer, whose father gave her mother Gursky's book and who is named after the girl in that book.I really liked this book in the beginning. Leo's part of the story is well written and pretty funny at times. You really get the cranky old man part of him from it. Alma's parts were scattered and choppy which was annoying at times but I think it worked well given she is a 14 year old girl, and sometimes, that is how their brains work. The further you get into the book, though, the more puzzling it gets. It seems Krauss wanted to make such a mystery with the story that she put so many twist and turns and she got lost. Toward the last third of the book she starts to insert diary entries from Alma's little brother, too, which just made it that much more confusing.There were so many characters meaninglessly inserted into the plot, also. I don't get why half of them were there, they had no story to tell and no real point of being there.I did love a few of the chapters that were shared from Gursky's book, The History of Love. Quite a few of them were so compelling and beautifully written, that I wished the rest of the book was just a retelling of it's namesake. I especially loved the chapter called, \\"Die Laughing\\".There were some really good parts, where I laughed or smiled. But most of the time, I was just confused and wanted it to come to an end. After 240 pages, it did finally start coming to an end, but it was completely disappointing. Krauss wrapped up her confusing little novel into a pretty little bow and called it good. Why would you write such a complex story line just to quickly end it in such a trite way?What dissapointed me more was that Krauss is married to Jonathan Safran Foer, who wrote \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\", which I read, reviewed and loved. Their writing styles are very similar but she just can't compare to him, in my opinion.I am not sure if the good of the book outweighs the bad. I thought the book was just ok.(taken from my blog: theultimatebooknook.blogspot.com)"},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I thought it started out strong and fell apart at the end. There were so many characters spanning years that this story was sometimes hard to follow. A good editor could have encouraged the author to tighten the story and bring all the threads together for a stronger ending."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"If I had more stars to give, I would give them. I read this book once, then recommended it for our book club as I knew it would be a great discussion book and perhaps give me more perspective. I didn't expect that we would have the very best book club discussion we have ever had and that I would gain even more insight than I dreamed of.You can read other reviews for synopsis of characters so I won't repeat. I appreciated and loved the effect of the tiny illustrations at the beginning of each chapter (heart-\\"Leo\\", compass-\\"Alma\\", Noah's Ark-\\"Bird\\", etc) to alert the reader as to whose \\"voice\\" the chapter pertains to.\\"The History of Love\\" is quirky, beautiful, complicated yet simple (much like love) and continues to loop through my mind long after the last chapter was read."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"Alma and Leo are both fascinating characters and great narrators. The author seems to have complicated her plot a bit too much and it does require the reader to go back and forth in the book searching for clarity. The ending is ambiguous at best."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"My sister recommended this book so I was eager to read it only to find that I was only interested in the present involving Leo. When the book switched, I lost interest and did a fast forward to Leo in the present again. I usually persevere with books and try to read the whole book but with this one, I felt like it was too much of a slog to finish it. i gave up and moved on to another book."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"You must read this book.I am a voracious reader. I am a bibliophile. I read and read and read, and I own many, many books. But, even before I finished this book, I knew it was going to be my new favorite work of fiction. Ever.This is a magical piece of work. It has some of the most beautiful writing I have ever read in my life. If you are a romantic, a lover of language, a poet, or simply a fellow reader...buy this book. Now."},{"Title":"The History of Love","review":"I read this book 2-3 years ago and it still stays with me as the best book I've read in many many years -- I loved it cover to cover and can't even comprehend how anyone could give it anything but 5 stars.
