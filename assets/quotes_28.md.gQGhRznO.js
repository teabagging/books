When she shows at her best friend Anouska's wedding it is where she meets the man who will change things in life. Zachary Burne moves into Becky's life and as she starts to cheat on Julian with Zach she never realized just how much trouble she can get into.Overall this was a cute book, I felt at times like I wanted to reach out and smack Becky around for being so foolish and hurting people in her life. Not only Julian, but her friends and other various people in her life.I look forward to reading more from Kathy Lette."},{"Title":"Altar Ego","review":"I found this book to be simultanously well-written and poorly written.

What's bad: the plot is a little over the top (although, I admit, in all fairness, that is rather the point...) and some of the writing is mediocre at best (does any American speak like Lette writes????).

Rebecca Steele is the perfect anti-heroine - dissatisfied, obnoxious, adulterous - and she stumbles upon trouble throughout the novel as she makes one ill-fated decision after another.Having jilted her lawyer fiance at the altar, Rebecca makes the added mistake of having a sizzling liaison with a gorgeous rap star. No sooner does she embark upon the affair than she discovers that her boy toy is one of her boyfriend's exclusive clients. With the help of her eccentric friends, Rebecca tries to figure out a way to get out of the situation without hurting anyone. Will her boyfriend find out? Will Rebecca be able to resist the rap star's tenacious nature? Will she ever grow up? There are some fun twists in the novel.I roared with laughter at Rebecca's relationship angst and ironic humor. Kathy Lette is a great comic author. Her writing style is sort of sloppy, which makes it all the more entertaining. I couldn't put this book down and I look forward to reading more from this talented Australian author."},{"Title":"Men Like Trees, Walking","review":"I rarely read anything twice, but I re-read diPasquale's &quot;Men Like Trees, Walking.&quot;Of the seven short stories, my favorite is &quot;Sarah's Cry,&quot; about an artist and a young father who meet at a Berkeley coffee shop and have a love affair. DiPasquale spends the first part of the story developing the artist's background and character; then he tells us about Doug Bennington, the young architect father who has become a stay-at-home dad. I was truly touched by his observations about Doug, a man who by his family and surroundings, could not develop to be the man that he is.Another story, &quot;Appeal,&quot; came to mind this week when a friend was describing a man who was delightful when you found him, but never quite followed through on those promises to get together soon. I think we have all connected with this type of person, and diPasquale so aptly describes Oscar.Except for one of the stories (&quot;Liebestod&quot;), which I found disturbing, I found all of them charming. I will re-read some of the stories again and look forward to reading more of diPasquale's work."},{"Title":"Men Like Trees, Walking","review":"\\"Men Like Trees, Walking\\" is a really wonderful collection of stories by a writer with a surprisingly mature and confident voice. Exploring primarily the relationships between men, (both gay and straight, young and elderly, rich and poor), but also the relationships between people and art, and the self they create out of the environment which surrounds them, di Pasquale writes like a cross between Henry James and Mart Doty -- both writers who explore the inner life in great detail, and whose work resonates long after completion with a truly wondrous and generous fulsomness. \\"The Recital\\" is a great story about the investment people make in both art and love, while \\"Liebestod\\" is a great (and creepy) exploration of the theme of love and death, life and art. I also really liked \\"Sarah's Cry\\" (a story about two men who meet and have an affair, one an artist, and the other a married man just beginning to explore his sexuality), and \\"A True Story,\\" a sweet tale about true love found in unexpected places.

It ends with that myth typified by the new magic of science as presented in Hugo Gernback's Amazing Stories magazine and ends in 1945. An impression is left of one set of superstitions being supplanted by a new set which is supplanted in their turn by yet another, ad nauseaum (as a history instructor once remarked, \\"History is just one damned thing after another.\\") At the point of 1945 and the dropping of the first atomic bomb, the Panshins appear to argue that there was a split between the myths of science fiction and SF (as opposed to sci-fi) and that SF continued from that point.One of the most interesting parts of the book is the depiction of what some consider the height of the Campbell Era, the years 1939 to 1945. John Campbell and his stable of writers (Heinlein, Asimov, Simak, van Vogt, etc.) are studied closely. One is left with the feeling Campbell believed he was caught short by events--when told of the dropping of the first nuclear weapon on Japan, his reaction was, \\"Oh, my God! It's started.\\"Two nice features are the notes and references at the end of each chapter (a placement greatly appreciated) and an index that not only lists the authors but also their works.On the whole, a worthy effort."},{"Title":"Mutant Message from Forever","review":"because I think it is badly written fiction which I cannot believe is based on any kind of fact based research. Yet the author is seemingly representing the &quot;teaching&quot; herein as &quot;aboriginal&quot;. She does the Indigenous people of Australia and the reading public a grave disservice by continuing to represent herself as someone who is a &quot;messenger&quot; for this culture. There is nothing wrong with the lessons themselves, and no doubt they are appealing to the New Age fan, but it is arrogant to continue making money by tapping into a Western love of the &quot;other&quot; and exploiting a people who have asked her to stop it. She publicly apologized to eight Aboriginal elders in January of 1996 but she continues to capitalize on the midleading impression that her first book was reality based. In this book she prints a picture of herself with Burnum Burnum who publicly severed ties with her and the first book in March of 1996 in a statement wherein he made it clear that he is was a non-initiated, non-traditional, urbanised Aboriginal from the East Coast of Australia. Since he passed away in 1997 he cannot protest her exploiting his image. Anyone who is interested in what actual Aboriginals have to say about this woman and her &quot;message&quot; should check out the Dumbartung Aboriginal site and read about the investigation they have done into this woman, her background and her supposed experience with &quot;the tribal people&quot;. When this pseudo-anthro fantasy is accepted by the mainstream reading community as the truth a great disservice is being done to Australian Aboriginals who are real people trying to make a place for themselves in a world in which they have been denied equal access. It is deeply disturbing that this exploitation of Indigenous culture continues in the 21st century. My book club selected this book and against my better judgement I purchased it - for that I am truly sorry."},{"Title":"Mutant Message from Forever","review":"Marlo Morgan's second volume is captivating by its sheer, simple beauty right from the first page. I thought her first book was entertaining,educational and haunting. I enjoyed this one even more; it is quite different, though the lessons similar. I am happy to note that the &quot;civilised&quot; world is finally coming around to those ancient truths. I found the scene of the twin's birth absolutely breathtaking and glorious - what a way to begin a book! Throughout the book it seems clear that the two are destined to meet again and I almost dreaded the &quot;cliche ending&quot; I felt was bound to come. I was wrong. I could not have imagined a better and less expected ending. Brilliant! BRAVO! I plan to read this book again some day and have just obtained the first book so I may re-read it. Whether you read this as fiction (as some claim) or truth (as most believe) - it matters not. The spiritual messages are clear, true, universal, sound, loving and beautiful. Is that not what matters most?"},{"Title":"Mutant Message from Forever","review":"After reading Ms. Morgans first of her Real People tales, I was left with a sort of warm glow from the lessons contained within the pages, but a little rattled by the heavy handedness. Then I came across the controversy surrounding the actuality of her stated experiences. Still I had liked what she had said in her first book, so I picked up her second. Sadly, I found it to be both a plodding reworking of her first effort that became over burdened with it's own pedantic preachiness. Yes, yes, European man bad, indigenous Australian good. We *got* it the first time. We learn of some of the specific atrocities committed by the acts of the not Real People, but presented in a style that I can only feel was exploitive to Ms. Morgan's own purpose. Cultural jingoism is still jingoismif it purports to be The Answer. I am wholeheartedly against killing puppies, giving hysterectomies to nine year old little girls and ripping babies from their mothers arms. I'm also against high-handed superior lording over others like almost every single European-Australian does in these books. I am all for gratitude and gentle co-habitation with all beings on this planet - but having said that, I got tired of the high handedness of the tones of this book.I also don't appreciate fiction being passed off as fact. Someone seems to be fooling herself. Either that or we're the chumps. Yann Martel had the decency to present his &quot;Life of Pi&quot; as the fiction it is. I think this makes it even more true. Ms. Morgan may want to consider her own lessons. Always Truth.(See the Dumbartung Aboriginal site for feedback from Aboriginal Australians to these books)"},{"Title":"Mutant Message from Forever","review":"I find this book to be prophetic, for it touches on much of the unnamed 'dis-ease'in our own culture, religions, and time in history. Don't know that I've ever read anything so compelling. Our estrangement from nature has caused its own illness, but we've not yet recognized that to be true. I find this book hopeful, and it's a point of no return, I trust, once it has been read. Integrating its' message personally and communally lies before me. I am a Sister of Mercy, so the poor portrayal of my own community hurts. I acknowledge the weakness and brokenness in me and in all of us, and would like to know from Marlo why she chose us to be the callous people we appeared to be in the book. It was difficult to read lots of it because of my love for my community, and at the same time, I am very aware it is time for humility among all of us as a people that we've not prior lived. The portrayal of Caucasian European influence was so painful yet not unknown. In our own becoming, we do need to acknowledge the effects on others and ourselves of past/present attitudes and behaviors, so we can reclaim, as for the first time, our own dearness. It feels like a long road ahead of us, but I'm grateful for the part this novel plays in helping us to see anew. Would like an opportunity to speak with the author.

I found the story of the twins intriguing, heartbreaking touching. I was thrilled at the way the story wove between the two separated children. It was quite Dickensian, actually, with good peripheral characters and great descriptive paragraphs and interesting conversations. However, it suddenly changed simply to the girl twin, or rather, it was mostly her story, and though I learned a lot about the aborigine's oppression and want to know more in that vein, I was disappointed that the story became more and more didactic and mostly about the one character. In other words, the second part of the book didn't hold up like the first did. It was as if the author couldn't sustain a truly dramatic story of lost children. I wanted a juicier &quot;tale,&quot; if you will."},{"Title":"Mutant Message from Forever","review":"There are so many truths in the book it is more than a one time read. The spirituality and logic of the Aboriginal teachings are profound in their simplicity.

In Australia we dont 'fix' drinks nor put 'diapers' on our babies. The lack of Australian idiom is a dead give-away that she does'nt know too much about this place. Her 10th anniversary comments (in Mutant Message Down Under) about Alice Kelly being the most powerful Aboriginal female leader on the continent is absolutely ridiculous, as there are thousands of senior law men and women and none of them would claim to be the most powerful, this very non-Aboriginal claim only goes to show how little Morgan understands of community, rather than individual interest.

The biggest hurdle to implementing that program for my son was the randomness of the words with no connection to what he is reading or learning in his daily life. This was a difficult hurdle for an intuitive learner like him to overcome. The McGuffy Speller lists words with common sounds. Thus you will have words like fair, and fare together on one list, teaching the child the different ways one sound can be spelled. I think this is easier for a child to deal with than having to decide as in Spalding which spelling goes with the same sound. In McGuffy the sounds are introduced with the words and this is less frustrating than a child having to feel he should somehow know which spelling to use: are, or air. If you tried Spalding, and liked the phonetic approach, but don't think you will continue in it, and are looking for a similar but more conventional approach, this may be a good choice for you. I think it takes the best of phonics, memorization, and word patterns, and combines them into a great word list that can be used for weekly spelling tests. Personally, I am not using even this method this year as I believe the memorization and detachment from hands on learning just won't stick with my son. If your child doesn't balk at weekly spelling tests, learning the words in this book will prepare him for college level reading and writing."},{"Title":"McGuffeys Eclectic Spelling Book","review":"I have purchased this book and the others in the series because of the timeless teaching tool that it is.

Above all, it is a call to action - an inspirational, educational guide to effecting social change. Suburban Sweatshops illustrates the enormous impact of one person's efforts to aid a disadvantaged and largely unnoticed segment of American society - immigrant workers - not by fighting for them, but by organizing and empowering them to fight for themselves. As Gordon recounts the events preceding the Workplace Project, and leading to its inception, she acknowledges the horror of the relatively few well-publicized atrocities against immigrant workers. Yet such incidents of \\"super-exploitation,\\" Gordon submits, are only the most graphic illustrations of an infinitely more obscure problem - a web of appalling injustices so frequent as to seem an almost inevitable aspect of immigrant workers' lives. Gordon reveals these injustices in a variety of ways, supplementing examples of particular immigrants' living and working conditions with statistics that emphasize the pervasiveness of such situations. Most compelling, however, are Gordon's gripping portrayals of immigrants' personal stories. In her direct and elegant style, Gordon introduces the reader to a series of individuals whose experiences, though poignant, are studies in strength, courage and ambition. Many of these anecdotes are the result of Gordon's personal involvement in, and exposure to, the lives of her subjects. Her sympathy and respect for the people whose lives she documents are evident, as are her high expectations of them. Gordon describes the development of the Workplace Project in equally balanced terms. Her pride in the enormous success of the project is apparent, and well-deserved. Throughout the book, however, she offers a candid assessment of its challenges and limitations. This book is truly essential reading for students and professionals in the fields of law, sociology, government and history. It will serve as an indispensable reference to anyone seeking to enact social and political change. It will serve as an inspiration to anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights","review":"While I understand another reviewer's complaint about the book not being national in scope, and not telling us a lot about the daily lives of immigrants. But the discussion of legal and organizing strategy is far from arcane or dry. This is really a story about the ongoing process of democratization in our country--which the book makes clear is far from complete (something it would be useful for President Bush and other global democratizers to remember). The book provides a very insightful and thorough examination of how workers in the so called informal and underground economies learn about, use, and deepen their rights in the United States. It also makes a compelling material and moral case for why they deserve those rights. Heartwarming personal stories are nice, but this book expanded my own understanding of the politics of globalization at the micro level. It would make a great case study for college teachers to use with undergrads because it combines an immediate issue with theoretical and philopsophic substance."},{"Title":"Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights","review":"Suburban Sweatshops is a captivating, honest and well-written examination of the workplace abuses, struggles and hard realities facing so many working men and women in the United States--and the efforts of community organizers and advocates to create a space where workers can unite to improve their conditions and change the balances of power. Gordon details the valuable lessons learned through her unique and pioneering experience founding the Workplace Project, and examines the challenges and obstacles facing the growing workers' rights and immigrant rights movement. As an organizer working in the trenches of immigrant and workers' rights in Texas, I can say that Gordon's book is as real as it gets! The book hits all of the key themes and points, and will no doubt be seen as a groundbreaking insight into many of the challenges and issues that will face our society for many years to come. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights","review":"Jennifer Gordon's Suburban Sweatshop is a compelling portrait of the changing face of labor and workers in America. With graceful humility Ms. Gordon tells the stories of Americans' newest immigrants and their struggles against abuse, threats, and the denial of basic employment rights. Set in the suburb of Long Island, New York, Suburban Sweatshop is the continuation of the struggles that all immigrants have historically faced in finding dignity in the work that no one wants. Suburban Sweatshop is also a moving story of how a small organization, the Workplace Project, organized landscapers, domestic workers, factory and restaurant workers in an effort to challenge the pervasive abuse that they faced. Ms. Gordon's contribution is timely, inspirational and reaffirms a basic American goal; the opportunity to work and contribute."},{"Title":"Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights","review":"Yeesh. The title of this book, Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights would lead you to believe that it's an expansive look at a *nationwide* problem - would it not?. Well, it's actually a very cerebral discussion of the author's own (commendable) work setting up the Workplace Project, a small resource center for immigrant workers in Long Island. Still sounds interesting, doesn't it? Well, it might have been, in other hands, but we actually learn remarkably little about the workers. We meet a few individuals - or rather, \\"case histories\\" - but the author is a lawyer, not a writer, so while we're told a lot about the workers' grievances, we learn very little about their actual lives (and nothing whatever about the other side of the story, if any). Mostly, it's a lot of chin-rubbing about legal and organizational strategies for increasing the influence of Long Island wage-earners. Perhaps the publisher thought that giving the book this broad title (it ought to have been called something like, \\"MY Fight for Immigrant Rights\\") would increase sales. It worked on me - 20 bucks later I have a book I don't want and my only way of defending myself is . . . this indignant review. The reason it gets two stars instead of one is because Gordon has done so much good work for our country and, in particular, the most exploited and neglected among us. I would much rather have contributed the 20 bucks directly to her organization."},{"Title":"Suburban Sweatshops: The Fight for Immigrant Rights","review":"Uh, the author is a lawyer, which means her first obligation is to uphold the law.

This fictional dialogue between the head of the Inquisition and Jesus is more than just a metaphorical commentary on the debate over whether or not humans willingly give up their existential freedom in order to avoid the sometimes awesome responsibility that accompanies it. Dostoyevsky's classic also serves as a powerful critique of institutional religion and, by implication, all institutions (gov't, education, corporations, welfare system, etc.) who offer &quot;bread&quot; in exchange for the sacrifice of free choice.

This book is an easy and fun read that adds even more personality to one of America's greatest wine labels."},{"Title":"Chalone: A journey on the wine frontier","review":"As a friend of Greg's during his days at SmartWine.com I freely admit my bias. However during those formative days of my wine education I was fortunate enough to engage in wine chats on the 'net when such ideas were still in their infancy.Greg has the unique gift of being able to talk about a subject such as wine with the knowledge of a master without seeming arrogant or snobbish in the least.Most people that want to learn about wine are intimidated by the 'snobbery' people associate with it. Greg makes no pretense about his not being a snob. He is engaging, and his 'chatting' and writing styles are absolutely what the burgeoning wine industry needs more of.Jancis Robinson did more than anyone to make a knowledge of good wine accessible to the British public. Greg Walter's first book will be a keeper as I'm sure someday he will be thought of in the same breath as someone like Jancis.If you want to learn about a wine company's development from step one, this is absolutely your book. And even if you're not 'into' wine, it's still a great buy if you like an engaging story.The French never call themselves 'connoiseurs' of wine as the word means they 'know' wine. They call themselves 'amateurs' (lovers / friends) of wine.Tonight I'll raise a glass to one of the United States' most engaging 'amateurs' in the French sense."},{"Title":"Chalone: A journey on the wine frontier","review":"Among all the wine regions of California, Chalone and the Pinnacles are unique, not only in soil composition but also in atmosphere and cultural history. This engaging book shows how Chalone wines, some of the best in the world, came to be. It is essentially a history of the company and of the people who made it happen. What emerges from this fast-moving tale is the constant determination and vision required for any successful enterprise. I do wish the authors had spent a little more time discussing the wines themselves; we are told that a given year is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; without any sense of what that might mean in the glass. But this is a small quibble. All those interested in wine, California history, or the inner workings of a growing company (the discussions of which are unusually frank) should read this book, which was written to support Chalone's very worthwhile foundation."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Every thing perfect, ok.

What a huge disappointment! To start, there are three things that are made clear with this book: 1.- Mr. Florescu will take ANY given chance to put his name and his family in the highlight, as if you bought to book to know about the nobility and long ancestry of his family tree. 2.- Oh, he HATES Hungarians, so he will take WHATEVER chance, real or fabricated to just expose his biased views about what a bunch of \\"traitors\\" and \\"spineless people\\" they are. 3.- Books will be SPOILED! So, if you just bought \\"Dracula\\" from Bram Stoker, read that one first or you will know the end of that book in the first chapter of Mr. Florescu and Mr.McNally's self-glorifying book. Oh, and another book is SPOILED the same way- no, even worse in the last chapter. Basically: \\"oh yes, there's this book about this that ends like this.\\" Yep.More in detail, the dates are scrambled, so do not read it without pen and paper next to you to unscrable the timelines and get a better view of the actions. It doesn't happen once in the book, but quite regularly. You will find interesting also, how the last chapter, after all you read, comes and states the exact opposite to what has been exposed in the rest of the book. Dracula's childhood, his younger brother's \\"encounter with the sultan\\", their opinion on the accuracy of Stoker's book and it's worth, and even the way Romanian people feel about Dracula. My advise is, if you are going to read this book, purchase a large stock of other books as crossreference. Among them, please do include the first book on the subject by Mr. Florescu himself. At the end, you are left with the feeling of having read the speech of a politician: you are just no longer sure whether it's true or a bunch of self-promoting lies."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"For those who lack historical knowledge of Central European history in the 14th and 15th Century, this book is an interesting book to read, as long as they do not fall into the trap the authors conceived in their false national grandeur. Due to that, I can only give this book, ONE star.This book has several flaws big enough to drive a Dacia through it and would take a lot of pages, if not another book to correct all of them. A Dacia, for those who do not know, is a Romanian built automobile, based upon an out-dated Renault design that was manufactured in the 1970's.Fascinating how historical facts intermixed with obvious bias, envious bitterness and with written with, in my opinion, a chip on their shoulder, includes inadequacies lacking a national historical identity towards the true owners and rulers of the Erd&eacute;ly, the region known in Latin as Transylvania, \\"beyond the forest,\\" can portray a Wallachian despot, a Prince wannabe named Vlad III, better know as Dracula, as a national hero! No wonder the same people who call Dracula their national hero in the 20th century, who've uprooted 1000 year old villages, bulldozed down every house and all monuments, justifying their actions in the name of ethnic cleansing; then, resettled tens of thousands of persons from Hungarian speaking areas in Transylvania into harsh regions of modern Romania, Yes, that would make Dracula proud!While there is a lot of history portrayed in this book, it is done with much envy and distortion towards Hungarians in general. Right from the beginning of the book \\"...Transylvanian place names that have Romanian, German, and Hungarian equivalents, we shall use the modern Romanian names...\\" This only makes sense one would assume, however even such simple statements reflect the falseness that is displayed throughout the book. It is implying that the Hungarian names held the least or were of no significance in the history of Transylvania, where as, the truth is factually the opposite. In Dracula's era, there was no such country as Romania, nor was Romanian an official language in Transylvania. The official language was Hungarian, Latin used for general administration, German in the Saxon cities, while Romanian was spoken by the minority in the western counties or duchies, increasing towards majority near the bordering counties or duchies that were near the regions of Wallachia and Moldavia. Romanian names in Transylvania only became dominant after 1918. Since the events portrayed in this book took place mostly in the 1400's to be historically accurate, and unbiased, one should use the proper names perhaps with the modern names in brackets for reference to their location in modern Romania. The method used in the book is just an extension of the eradication and continued denial of the significant Hungarian culture, history or presence in the region.Transylvanian history goes back to time of the Roman Empire, as it was an outpost region bordered within the western slopes of the Carpathian mountain range known as Dacia. In brief, as the Roman Empire broke up and separated into separate two Empires: Western and Eastern, ethic tribes from the East started to migrate into areas formerly occupied by the Romans. These invaders such as the Huns, Avars, Lombards, Gepids, Slavs, and later the Magyar tribes, they moved into the Carpathian basin and the surrounding areas just west of the Byzantine Empire. Some have left and moved on. These eastern invaders conquered, subjugated the native population, some who intermarried with descendants of the original Roman Legionaries who decided to stay behind once the empire fell apart, thus forming the native population for the next generations. The Carpathian basin including the regions of Pannonia and Dacia of the former Roman Empire were settled by the Ten Magyar, (Hungarian) tribes. Thus, the Magyar (Hungarian) State was established in 896 AD. Note at this time, and for almost 1000 years after the establishment of Hungary, there was no Romania. The modern state of Romania was formed by the merging of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1859 and in 1918 Hungarian Transylvania was annexed by the victors of WWI, as punishment for the Hungarian participation in WWI. When the pagan Hungarian King Vajk, converted to Christianity and adopted the Christian name Istv&aacute;n, (Stephen, who later was named a Saint), and by force converted the rest of the Magyar pagans, he was rewarded by the Pope in Rome and by Byzantine Emperor with crowns to symbolize his sovereignty over the lands under his command including Transylvania. The two crows were assembled into one as the Holly Crown of Hungary. As the Hungarian kingdom congealed, and needed additional populous at the eastern borders (Transylvania) to shore up the defences against any further invasions from the East, such as the Hordes of Genghis Khan, and the Ottoman Turks, Sz&eacute;kely (Szeklers descendants of the Huns, who left after the death of Attila) from the East and Saxon (German) settlers from western Europe were encouraged to move in, along with the Teutonic Knights (who were expelled later on), and were granted lands and independent city statues, but were subject to the Crown of Hungary.Wallachia east and Moldavia to the north of Transylvania were autonomous regions ruled by Princes, or pretenders to the throne. These regions were populated in majority by Romanian speaking inhabitants.Thus, what these so called historians scholars have cooked up about a petty Wallachian despot named Dracula, as the founding father of Romania, is a laughable! \\"Dracula became a national hero par excellence, one who defended the nation's independence against overwhelming odds - kind of George Washington of the Romanian people...\\" I do not believe George Washington had people impaled while he ate his dinner, nor had tens of thousands (if not over a hundred thousand) killed by boiling, skinning people alive, sawing off their limbs, who'd disagreed or challenged his political ambitions. Nor was Dracula like Robin Hood, giving to the poor from the rich!Throughout the book, and at every opportunity, the Hungarians are perceived as corrupt, unreliable, who had betrayed Vlad III, spreading false propaganda unjustly, undeservingly about this Christian Knight, who wore the Order of the Dragon. From John Hunyadi, (being described as: from a humble Wallachian stock, a turncoat Hungarian wannabe), he actually was a true Christian Crusader at the time and whose victory over the Turks in 1456 at Belgrade is still celebrated to date: every day at noon, church bells are rung. Hunyadi was the Regent of Hungary and the Governor of Transylvania to King Matthias Corvinus, was described as \\"...King Matthias evidently liked to think of himself as a true patron of learning and the arts.\\" Matthias didn't have to think of it, he was! Matthias established the flowering culture of the Hungarian Renaissance, by modernizing and building. His treasures were ransacked by the Turks later on, but some of the surviving books that were published upon his orders and were housed in the King's Library the Corvinus Codex's are worth millions and are now treasured by Museums world wide. In fact, the only painting of Dracula that existed was done by the King's artist while Dracula was in his imprisonment, when the King had no choice but to put Dracula in \\"prison\\" for his alleged autocracies after Vlad III, was overthrown the second time by his rivals. However, the prison was far from a real prison, it was more like a house arrest and at the King's palace. I do not of many prisoners in history who were allowed to marry the cousin of the King, while being incarcerated by the same King. The fact is that Vlad III, aka Dracula, married Ilona Szil&aacute;gyi, a cousin of the King, while he was in, so called \\"imprisoned\\". Later on with the King's army, Dracula was put back in power for the third time to help with the continued fight and gain a psychological advantage against the invading Ottomans. Dracula's fierce reputation against the Turks gained by his prior autocracies against them and excellent knowledge of their tactics was something that the King did not ignore.These two bright scholarly historians overwhelmed with debasing anything that had to do with Hungarians, could not even get the small facts straight about the Hunyadi coat of arms and the family symbol of King Matthias. For example, the black bird is a raven holding a gold ring in his beak and not a \\"crow.\\" There is a significant difference between the two. Both John Hunyadi and King Matthias, among many other Hungarians in power in Transylvania, were actual benefactors of Vlad III.The real Dracula, Vlad III, was not a forthright Christian or a nationalist hero. At the very best, he was a warlord with many ambitions. He was power hungry, cruel, sadistic, evil, revengeful, and treacherous yet, a very savvy individual who made the right connections with powerful benefactors, looking out for his own true interests in being or trying to be the ruler of Wallachia. Ambitions supported by using all his talents and available methods: torture, intimidations, bribery, and psychological warfare against not just his enemies but his own subjects. While Dracula did fight the Ottoman Turks, it was based upon his childhood hate towards the Turks (for that Dracula cannot be blamed) and own self interests in manifestation of power to rule independently over Wallachia against Ottoman expansionism, than being a Christian Crusader. Dracula was in many ways just like many of his contemporarily power hungry despots and tyrants in the 14th to the 15th centuries who made deals and alliances with more powerful benefactors. What made him different was that he was a lot more cruel and bloody in his methods. By constructing monasteries he thought he could seek salvation from eternal damnation and from hell.Ironically in 1476, when Dracula was assassinated, his head was cut off and taken to Constantinople to the Sultan to be displayed on a pole, just like he had done to so many of his enemies. If not for Bram Stoker, Dracula would have been forgotten in history, like so many petty tyrants of the era."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Here is why I say this!

Thrill seekers should be more than satisfied by the vivid descriptions of Dracula's divers forms of despatching those poor individuals who incurred his wrath. The authors deal both thoroughly &amp; entertainingly with all the characters, wars, international intrigues, &amp; give a chilling idea of what life was about in those violent &amp; dangerous times. Dracula in particular is described in a most non-judgemental manner. Whilst it is impossible to defend his awful behaviour, study of his early life leads one to easily understand how his baser instincts might be brought to the surface. The book abounds with ironies &amp; contrasts. Depending on the country of origin, there are totally different historical treatments of his deeds. He was brave, cruel, ambitious, devious, loyal, unreliable, resourceful &amp; vain. A clever, or honest response to his interrogation could result in impalement, or dinner &amp; a pot of gold, depending on Dracula's violent &amp; unpredictable mood swings.

I found this work extremely informative since I am deeply interested in the history of Eastern and Central Europe and well-written and well-researched works in English can be difficult to come across when it comes to this part of the world. It is nice to read a book about this period and not have to wade through a myriad of contemporary Western biases."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"In an earlier review I wrote regarding Dr. McNally's work on Robert Louis Stevenson, I noted that I had been a student of his in college. In reviewing this book, rather than discuss the meat of what lies within, I thought I would relate a couple of stories related to me by Professor McNally.The first is that the opening of Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula film was inspired directly by the writings in McNally and Florescu's two Dracula books, although there was a bit of tiff over the fact no credit was given.The second tidbit came later in that semester, when I caught an &quot;In Search Of...&quot; episode on A&amp;E which detailed the search for Dracula's castle and featured some rube gumming happily to the camera over his discovery. Well, the next day I tracked down the Professor and mentioned it to him. Befitting his status as the &quot;Dracula professor&quot;, he let out this deep, rumbling and, well...evil, laugh. He was well acquainted with the special, and the simple fact was the castle in the special was the wrong one! In fact, as Prof. McNally evidenced in class soon after with a nifty little highlight video from the late 70's/early '80's, he and Radu Florescu had gained their noteriety by being the ones to find and prove which castle belonged to the historical Vlad.These two stories evidenced for me, and ought to evidence for the prospective buyer, that Ray McNally and his longtime associate Radu Florescu are the definitive academics on the historical Vlad and the legend of Dracula.

I have chosen Prince of Many Faces as one of the required readings after reading most of what is available on Vlad in English. Florescu's biography is impossible to put down. It is written for the general public and is scholarly at the same time. The title tells us exactly what we will find in the book. But it also provides a selection of translated contemporary sources which allows us to savor the contemporaty attitudes towards the Impaler."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"The world over, Vlad the Impaler is considered a ruthless and bloodthirsty tyrant who butchered 100,000 people just for the sick pleasure of watching them die. Sure, this is absolutely true, and in Romania they say it with pride, where he is regarded somewhere on a level between George Washington and Jesus. A huge chunk of Transylvanian land that Vlad gave to a clan of minor nobles was never made subject to Communist collectivization 500 years later. Maybe Romanians know something we don't.Virtually every movie about him has been a blockbuster and every book a top seller (including the ones that came straight off Gutenberg's press!), but this is one of the few biographies about him. It is also the only one that dares to tell the story of the desperate conditions that threatened his sovereignty. This tells not only the most complete story of Dracula's life, but puts it into context by giving accounts of all the players and politics of the 15th century Eruopean theater.The stories about and around Vlad's life are enough to satisfy anyone's thirst for romance, horror, or history. As he is faced with the incalculable odds against him, one will marvel at Vlad's fast and effective soultions to his multitude of problems. He is, for example, a true pioneer in the fields of chemical and germ warfare on the battlefield. Domestically, the tales concerning government reform, rearmament, Transylvanian justice, and what could be termed as the first \\"barbecue for the homeless,\\" are both horrific and hilarious. No book about the condition of Dracula's death can ever compare to the story of his life."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Off of their original research &quot;In Search of Dracula,&quot; the authors have given Vlad the Impaler a more detailed historical assessment without losing their initial sense of fascination with their subject. They do not give in to the sensationalism of their infamous subject, which is a pretty neat trick. It is hard to think that even without Stoker's novel this is a character who would have been forgotten by history. After all, you can make the argument that Vlad does in Eastern Europe what El Cid accomplishes in Spain: stops the Muslim invasion of Europe."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Having expounded on the connection between the fictional Count Dracula of Bram Stoker's 19th century novel and the real Prince Vlad Dracula who ruled 15th century Wallachia in their book \\"The Search for Dracula\\", professors Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally subsequently wrote \\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\", a meticulously researched biography of the real-life warrior prince. This book starts with an overview of the extremely convoluted political landscape of 15th century Europe, in particular that of Wallachia, in present day Romania, when Vlad Tepes, also called Vlad Dracula, ruled for only 6 years in the mid-15th century. The authors follow Dracula into his youth, spent as a hostage held to insure his father's obedience in the court of the Ottoman Sultan Murad II, among many distinguished fellow hostages and tutors. Dracula demonstrated his military competency even before securing the throne of Wallachia, having been instrumental in the defense of Belgrade from invading Ottomans. During his rule of Wallachia, the Prince would ruthlessly advance an agenda of centralized power, draconian law, and military might that earned him a reputation as one of history's most excessively cruel and murderous personalities, while at the same time his defeat of the Turkish army during the 1461-1462 Turco-Wallachian war did no less than stop the Ottoman advance into Europe and make Vlad Dracula a hero of Christendom.The historical information in \\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\" accounts for most of its contents, and it is where the book excels. There are also chapters on Vlad Dracula's descendants and the sources of his considerable notoriety in his own time, when he was regarded as a maniacal tyrant by the Germans, Hungarians, and Turks, and as a savior by many of his own people. One risks engaging in presentism by applying moral judgments to Dracula's actions 6 centuries after the fact. But the Wallachian Prince was excessively sadistic even by the standards of his own time, to which his far-flung reputation attests.\\"Dracula: Prince of Many Faces\\"' weaknesses are its attempts at psychoanalyzing Vlad Dracula and its insistence that Bram Stoker based his fictional vampire, Count Dracula, on the 15th century prince. The authors use words like \\"clearly\\", \\"undoubtedly\\", and \\"obviously\\" too often to draw conclusions about Vlad Tepes' motives that require considerable leaps of faith. \\"Prince of Many Faces\\" indulges in Freudian and behaviorist speculation about Vlad Dracula's character while ignoring what I would consider to be a simple observation about his personality: Vlad Dracula was extremely uncomfortable with behavior that is not orderly, predictable, and regimented. Hence his obsession with protocol, insistence upon strict adherence to rigid laws, and inability to see anything in shades of gray, as opposed to black and white. It is not an uncommon personality trait, but it's not desirable in persons of power. As for the Vlad Dracula-Count Dracula connection, I have read 2 books on the subject by authors Florescu and McNally, and I still see no more of Vlad Tepes in Count Dracula than his name and vague ancestry (\\"one of my race who as a Viovode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his ground\\"), mostly because the novel \\"Dracula\\" contradicts itself repeatedly in describing Count Dracula. Bram Stoker certainly referenced Vlad Tepes, but it seems more to evoke a sense of grandeur and history than to assign a specific identity."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"More a study of the region than of the prince who inspired the Dracula tales, this book offers a rich picture of the circumstances of Vlad Dracul's era.Thick in geographical data, this book only falls short if you're looking for a book that focuses on Vlad Dracul himself. This is more of a study of the people and circumstances that spawned him than a deep look at the man himself. While battles are detailed, this is not an account full of gory details or one that gives much emotional impact. Even while describing the Prince's work ethic, religious beliefs and family history, you don't get much of a feeling for Vlad the man, who he cared for, why he hated the people he did and why he was rumored to be so bloodthirsty.This is a superb look at roughly 50 years of Romanian history in the mid to late 1400s, but there are better books out there if you're looking for a more graphic and personal view of Vlad the Impaler."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Alright, all vampire nonsense aside, this is the real article!

The crusades were always defensive. Dracula means son of Dracul, the dragon, his father was a knight of the order of the dragon and used that name. The Knights of the dragon were sworn to protect the church, knobbles and the defenseless. The people of the area were known as the people of the wolf, therefore referred to as wolf men. Both parents believed to be catholic. Born in 1431. Died 1476. A victim of and somewhat successful enemy of islam during the second jihad. The conflict of values between islam and Christianity is as great as the conflict between communism and democracy. The efforts to hold back the islamic conquest was called the Balkan crusade in western Europe. When the Pope call for Rome and Western Europe to be protected, Prince Dracula Father was the only one to respond. During this era shivery was laid aside and all contemporaries had low regard for human life. As a child Dracula was held prisoner in Turkey till 1448, Brother Radu till 1462. Most of Western Europe was under the Islamic dhimmis, slavery (lower class citizenry) through a capitation (Jizya), keep your head tax. Vlad and brother Radu had to live as slaves (hostages) with the muslims to guarantee their fathers forced enslaved peace to the Ottoman Empire. During this time, his father and other brother are murdered by their enemies, which only make Vlad more ferocious and raging. Released in the military service of the Ottoman Empire he used it to return home to avenge his father's assassination. As a young hostage he found out that the only way to successfully over come terror at times is to overcome it with greater terror. As distasteful and uncomfortable as it may seem, in some violent situations overcoming force requires greater force. As young men, Radu takes to this new culture, converting to Islam and becoming lovers with the sultan's son (bisexual) and a commander in the ottoman cavalry. Vlad resents where he lives, hates his captures, and wants revenge against anyone who's wronged him and his family. (There are terrifying results that come when; islam comes to those who don't convert). Impalement was used by the German Saxons and the Ottoman's before Vlad used it, that's where he got it. Ordained and crowned as prince of his rightful throne in 1457 by the church. He was cruel and irrational as he ruled with an iron fist. In 6 years he executed 40-100,000 people by torture, impalement or battle. His methods of torture were common for Europe and islam during this time. He would pike and place impaled people where his enemies had to see and travel through before they battled him, and filled forests with hanging people. The local cultures were all Germanic based. Dracula was considered a Christian crusader during the second jihad. He seemed to be as generous in founding monasteries and churches as he was a harsh ruler. Any profound theological convictions that he may have had, had little bearing on his personal behavior. The crusades were crusades against the 2nd jihad and Dracula was a Romanian war lord and master at guerilla warfare. He inherited his obligations of the order of the dragon from his father. He made some victims eat the flesh of other victims, and on occasion dipped his bread in the blood of his victims. He successfully held off the Islamic invasion by his own army's and fortune, then the nobles and his brother (minion of the sultan) betrayed him and stole his throne and crown with Turk help, his army disserted him. Political, religious, economic conditions changed and every one turned on Dracula. The Hungarian King sized him, tried for treason on forged documents and embellished accusations of past atrocities, his ememies went to great lengths to darken his name and history. Under house arrest for 12 years in Buda 1462, to be released from arrest, he converted from the Orthodox Church to Catholicism for a royal marriage.1474. Favored by many Popes, it was hoped that he would lead a new crusade against a new Islamic expansion in Europe. Successful and brutal again he regains his throne for the 3rd time. Two months later his body was found headless and mangled, assassinated, December 1476. It was and is common in arab propaganda to say that the crusaders were savages who ate the flesh of those they murdered. Keeping up the level of hatred within islam against the non muslims. In propaganda films today, muslims portray Jews as murders and drinkers of the blood of young muslim children, this is on arab TV today to keep up the hate.

I found the sentence structures often awkward, so that it didn't flow, and often there were so many different names of people and places that it was difficult to follow the details. Despite these difficulties, Dracula was a fascinating character, and since Europe during the middle ages generally interests me, I enjoyed a look at the Balkans during that time and in particular, the battle against Mehmed II.

The narrative is clear and well written, and it is not too academic in tone. It can be used strictly as a background source on Eastern European 15th century history, but I found it very entertaining to read simply on its own.

And of course, various web searches, but safe to say, I didn't know much about the man. But, I must say this was a very good read. The reading is a little tough, I will say that. Some things don't seem to go well together, and some things don't make total sense, but overall, you can piece together enough information to get the general picture.The real Dracula is definitely more scary than the movie dracula. This man was a real scourge, a real monster in the form of a human. He apparently idoled Attila the Hun and one can see why, for he seems to have tried to be Attila, in fact, I think from reading this book, one can say he went beyond Attila.Still, from reading this book, it made me think of Saddam Hussein. And here's why. Vlad the Impaler, as much of a monster as he was, was the last line of defense for the Christians in the east against the Turks. And because of this, his atrocities were pushed under the carpet because of his position. In some ways, he is a great military leader, in others a horrible scourge. In the end though, he is a man who basically had a purpose, to hold the line against the spread of Islam in the East, and he did so very effectively.I would recommend this to anyone not only interested in Dracula but also to others interested in Medieval military history. Considering his resources were poor and he was facing a sultan who had a greatly advanced military, Vlad made such amazing moves to strike fear and terror into his opponents heart, that he could not be forced to submit on the battlefield."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"This book was very good in my opinion because it gave more insight than most books about the time period of the famous Wallachian Prince Vlad III Dracula.

McNally's paternal ancestors came from County Mayo (an interest in folklore), his maternal ancestors came from a German-speaking village in Slovenia.The \`Prologue' says the authors did not think Bram Stoker's novel was part of the Gothic horror romances (p.3) because of the specific geographical locations. They used Stoker's novel as a guide to their travels (p.5). The word vampire is Slavic rather than the Rumanian strigoi (p.7). The descriptions of the countryside are accurate (p.8). The historical Dracula was \\"one of the most fascinating personalities of history\\" (p.11). Chapter 1 describes the history of this area in the 15th century. The states of eastern and central Europe were able to halt the invasion of the Turks then and for the next two centuries. It tells about the politics and problems of western Europe. You should read this chapter if nothing else. Chapter 2 continues the history of that area and of Dracula. Chapter 3 tells of the wars and politics, the equivalent of gang warfare in the 1920s.Constantinople was conquered by the Turks in 1453. The Turks were defeated at Belgrade in 1456 but the plague spread over the land. John of Capistrano was beatified (p.86). Dracula was anointed Prince of Ungro-Wallachia (Chapter 4). He created the fortress of Bucharest (p.86). Dracula neutralized his domestic enemies (p.91) and gained his reputation for cruelty. Religion served politics (p.98). The peasants favored Dracula (p.99). Dracula's savage punishments shocked his contemporaries (p.104), many of them with similar practices (p.106). Chapter 5 tells of the internal wars with the Saxons of Transylvania who backed a rival. Ten of thousands were slaughtered and their villages destroyed (p.122). Dracula was able to defeat the larger Turkish army in 1462 (Chapter 6). After this Dracula's younger brother gathered support to overthrow him (p.152).Dracula fled to his castle near Brasov (Chapter 7). He escaped with the help of local peasants (p.155). Instead of finding an ally Dracula was imprisoned (p.159). Changing political events led to his release to lead an army against the Turks, winning battles in 1476. Dracula had many enemies (p.173). One day his headless body was found (p.174). His grave is unknown (Chapter 8). Chapter 9 tells of Dracula's descendants. There are three views of Dracula: \\"Gruesome Psychopath\\" (German), \\"Cruel but Just\\" (Russian), and \\"Dracula the Hero\\" (Rumanian). Dracula was the only European ruler to inflict a crushing defeat on Sultan Mehmed II (p.205).Chapter 11 discusses Bram Stoker's novel which was printed in every European language except Rumanian (p.220). There were many novels about vampyres in the early 19th century (p.223). Stoker borrowed details from other books (p.227). Did the details of realism contribute to the success of \`Dracula'? The Gaelic word \\"drochfhola\\" means \\"bad blood\\" and sounds like \`Dracula' (p.228). The \`Conclusion' discusses the real Dracula in history. Was he maligned like Richard III or Henry VIII? While folklore can be exaggerated, so too official historians have their agenda (p.238). [No one compared Dracula to modern rulers.]"},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces, is the first biography of Vlad Dracula I have read. Being a fan of the fictional Dracula and of vampires, in general, I decided enough was enough and searched for a book on the real life Prince of Romania. And I am happy to have found this book in my search. Why?First, they give you a picture of the political and social background of the time period. You are not tossed right into Dracula's life without knowing what he is getting into. The Popes, The Holy Roman Empire, the Turks, the backstabbing, the greed, the hopes and fears. They show you his family, his lands, where the people and culture and traditions came from, starting with the Romans.Does that sound like overload? Maybe a little, but the book is not a massive tome, it is a paperback that runs about 260 pages. And yes, the authors tell it like it is - some people are brave, some are spineless cowards, and some are so greedy they would sell their own family members out for a few gold coins. Or, to be honest, a crown.Did the Germans create the image of him as a unbalanced, impaling, killing machine? Are the Russians right in thinking of him as cruel but just? Is he a Hero? Is he a little of everything?Sometimes I kind of felt sorry for him. Trapped between the powerful Ottoman Empire, the European Kingdoms too worried about their own power bases to help, and the Churches who would damn him for making the wrong move. What's a guy to do? I would suggest this book as a good starting place to learn about Vlad Dracula. I plan to find other books, maybe find more details on his military tactics and victories."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"This is perhaps the greatest book I have found on Vlad \\"the Impaler\\" Dracula, not just because it is a good book, but because it is a reasonable book, well-written, flawlessly researched, and priced at a bargain.See, when I first heard the name Dracula in reference to a man instead of a pointy-toothed daemon in a black cloak, I was 12. Since then, I have dedicated my life as an student, scholar, and historian to finding the truths of this \\"real Dracula,\\" as he has been called. My research has led me to track down many rare books from medieval writers and historians. Yet, just recently, I was given a call by a friend of mine who deals in rare books, and in his usual charismatic voice, he asked me if I was crazy, as the sources I wanted were impossible to find, and not even Stanford Library had them. That I wanted them in English actually made him laugh.With this in mind, I say that the book Dracula: Prince of Many Faces--His Life and His Times is a masterpiece. Now, it is brilliantly written, summarizes and explains complex history, while citing actual contemporary sources to give more life and flavor to the already exciting story, and is simultaneously the densest and most enjoyable textbook I've ever read. It doesn't waste a word in explaining it's goals. But best of all, it's in English, and it's affordable, which is rare for an American audience.Radu R. Florescu and Raymond T. McNally are perhaps the greatest modern experts on Dracula I have ever encountered. They can tell you anything from the nature of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula (which they cover in the introduction to ease the reader into place) but also the obscure details of history such as passionate jousts in which Dracula's father took place or the education of the young prince impaler. Furthermore, they have been to locations. Every castle, every battlefield, every tomb, they seem to have a personal experience with.Regrettably, this is not written in chronological order. Events jump around, as do dates, so one unfamiliar with the history should be wary. Also, the writing is very dense. That said, to a well-researched scholar on the topic of Vlad Dracula, or some one well read but curious, this book is a great aid. For any scholarly source out of print or written in a different language, I have yet to find as much information useful to me as this book contained. While anyone unfamiliar with Dracula will still be able to read it, and enjoy it, as the story is well told and well-organized and everything is clearly introduced, despite hos dense it all is.Overall, Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally succeeded in writing the greatest book on Dracula in the English language."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"A fascinating figure in history deserves a book as good as this. Immoral butcher, and defender of most Holy Christian Europe, murderer of the poor and upholder of absolute justice, war criminal and heroic defender of his people.One could perhaps describe Dracula in simple terms as the Dr. Doom of his day. A horrible villain to some, yet a hero to his people and one who followed for the most part his own code of twisted, and very literal honor. In fact, half of the fun of reading this book is the way Vlad consistently deals out the most extreme punishments for minor and major infractions (and they are infractions make no mistake). Yet the way it is done is both so brilliant and logical to the extreme you can't help but applaud him for him being such a magnificent bastard.Disrespectful envoys not taking off their hats? Nail their caps to their heads so they won't break their own rules by *accident*. Islamic armies oppressing your land and taking your kids to raise as their shock troops? Impale their prisoners of war and make a forest of them to send their greatest general a message. Poor masses and criminals dragging down your country? Give them a *banquet*, and then mercifully send them to God's kingdom by locking them in and burning them alive. Traitorous nobles kill your father and brother? Work them to death building YOUR fortress and then bury them alive. A visiting merchant robbed in your kingdom? Threaten to burn down the town unless the money is returned... and then give extra gold back to the merchant to see if he's just as bad as the thief (with equal punishments for both if guilty). Disgusted seeing a peasant with shoddy clothes? Impale the wife responsible and get the poor guy a new one (Good help is so hard to find).Even Vlad's own people eventually tired of his reign towards the end of his life. But after the fact, it's amazing how many people thought he did far more good than harm in his life, saving his country from being humiliated and enslaved from outside powers and decayed from within from crime and lawlessness.Of course, a modern prejudiced mind that thinks putting a rapist or murderer in jail for a few years before cutting them loose is a 'just' punishment, will instantly peg Vlad as yet another two bit Hitler or Stalin or warlord of your choice. This is an unfair depiction in my view, especially considering most of Vlad's bad press came from his enemies who were rightly terrified of him. Vlad comes off in these accounts as having far more courage, class and cunning than these hack jobs. If you consider Vlad a villain, at least give credit where its due.Best said in the words of the author, Vlad was only occasionally guilty of bouts of random murder. His extreme killings were directed at three main groups, the Turks invading his country, the merchants squeezing the life out of his country, and the vagrants and the poor.Dracula was by no means a nice person, but his contributions to history are really much more positive than most common histories (i.e. dumbed down garbage) would have you think. If you can be as bad mother as Vlad was, and STILL have your face on your country's currency and be regarded as a national hero, my hat's off to you.It just goes to show that history is far more interesting than fiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Florescu and McNally have exhaustively researched the REAL Count Dracula bringing the historical figure to light. Readers will not be disappointed, as the historical Dracula (aka Vlad Tepis) is every bit as interesting - dare I say bloody - as the better known character of Stoker's novel._Dracula:Prince of Many Faces_ shows us the Machievellian politics of East Europe and how Tepis survived - even thrived - in the laybrinth that was 15th century politics. As a fan, historian, or curious on-looker, I recommend this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"I had just recently found out that Dracula was a real person. So this is the first historical reading for me. This book contains excellent information on Vlad Tepes (the Impaler). The book not only tells about him but also contains chapters on what was going on in the world during his time. This gave me a better &quot;feel&quot; for his times. Most articles I have read on Dracula are pretty opinionated but the authors really tried to say clear of &quot;pushing&quot; their opinions of Dracula on me. The book also contains Chapters on the Stoker novel and the real Dracula's descendants. Although very little is know about the enigmatic Prince the authors did a great job of researching their topic. A must read for people who love history and/or mystery."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"This is a fairly concise and accurate summary of the real Dracula's life and times. Florescu and McNally are just about the only Western writers to have concentrated on this subject matter and have done a great favor by translating the original German, Romanian, Russian, and other sources into English. This is certainly an enlightning book however I missed having a summary of the various fictional incarnations of Dracula that were described in the authors' previous book, &quot;In Search of Dracula&quot; which provided an excellent tie in to most Westerner's perceptions of &quot;Dracula&quot; from the movies."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"The authors of this book capture the man behind the myths. The historical Dracula was from noble stock in Romania. He was traumatized as a young man. He was held as a prisoner by the Ottoman Empire for several years. His brother Radu the Handsome was used sexually by Mehmed II. Dracula was hardened by the ordeal with the Ottomans and he responded by becoming a heartless and cruel dictator.Vlad was able to fend off Ottoman encroachment for many years. He was a great intimidator. He frequently impaled his political opponents. Visitors to his kingdom never forgot the fear engendered by seeing dead bodies impaled around the castle.This book delineates fact from fiction. The authors point out that some of Vlad's atrocities have been exaggerated. The authors also link the work with Bram Stoker's famous book. Dracula was one of those figures who made an indelible impression on the native Romanian populace. The legacy of fear and intimidation continues to survive to the present day. This was a great book and I enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"One reviewer has stated that this was one of the scariest books he has ever read, and I would concur with that. For those enjoy all of the legendary (and fictitious) stories of vampires, you are missing something truly evil and scary. This man was real. His actions were brutal, ruthless, and cold.I enjoy a dark and scary story time and again, but I prefer historical accounts, especially if they are true to the original event. After reading other reviews, I believe this book really does try to stay to the facts and paint the picture of the real Dracula. Speculation about Stoker and all that is fine, and probably was necessary to appease a few readers. Nice to know, not need to know.If Dracula had been in his tomb, would we ever have had Stoker's tale? One does wonder.I first heard of this book while watching a History special on Vlad Dracula--that special pulled me away from Sunday Football (American) for the rest of the day, because I hunted this down and read it. Highly recommended, even for a casual reader of history. I think it will open your perspective."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"This is one of the best accounts that I've ever read of the man behind the name \\"Dracula\\". Vlad loved his family and his people, but his thirst for revenge drove him to incredible heights of cruelty in an age when men of power sometimes took the law into their own hands. Dracula, Prince of Many Faces is a book worthy of any scholar or student of both the man and the times, which shaped him."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"This is a thorough look at not only the mysterious life of Vlad Dracula, aka Vlad Tepes, aka Vlad the Impaler, but also a comprehensive history of 15th century Eastern Europe and the evolution of the Vampire myth. While not much is known about his \\"personal life,\\" eye witnesses and oral history have kept accounts of Vlad's tyrannous reign of the Wallachia region of Romania alive through the ages. Meticulously researched, the authors try to grasp the motivation behind his notorious undertakings in the slaughter of tens of thousands of people, not only in defense from the invading Turks, but those of his own people. As allegiances shift, Vlad's reputation darkens and his fate is sealed. Long after his death, the heroic, sadistic prince develops from regional folklore and religious propaganda into the Dracula of Bram Stoker and Bella Lugosi fame that we are familiar with today."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"Florescu and McNally boldly proclaimed that the historical Dracula is far more interesting than the fictional vampiric version. They proved it in this extraordinary book. I hold tightly to the adage that \\"life is too short to read a book twice\\" but made an exception here and have read it 3 times and counting. I have been fascinated with the fictional Dracula since childhood and now have had new life (unlife?) breathed into the subject -the catalyst was this book.The book is exhaustive although not ponderous -they place the story in its proper historical context and discuss the political volatility of the region, the dying crusading spirit, the anxiety of the Roman pontiff, as well as the rich and fascinating context of Sultan Mehmed II's world. And make no mistake, it almost was his world. Dracula, betrayed by a father who was himself betrayed by his subjects, forced to spend most of his developing years under the heel of his Ottoman captors, and soon thrust into a position of authority in his native land where he will be torn between two competing, greater powers, must always have his back to the wall. While still in his twenties, Dracula casts aside all ambiguity and chooses a side in the conflict between the east and the west, becoming a nemesis of Mehmed the Conqueror and actually making a fight of it -with virtually no support...Rome sings of this Crusader on the eastern hinterlands who defends the Cross with such heroic virtue...But there is a dark and sinister strain in this prince. His techniques against Mehmed are, shall we say, extreme, even by the measure of that brutal period. Wait until you get a load of the \\"Forest of the Impaled\\" -you won't forget it. It was said that Mehmed himself took one look at that ghoulish spectacle and said \\"see ya\\". Dracula is not your average Christian knight. The Turks scare their children with stories of \\"Kaziglu Bey\\" -the \\"Devil Impaler\\". German merchants in Wallachia are terrorized by Dracula who has vendettas that won't end... As they trickle back to their homeland, Gutenberg is printing the Bible on his new invention in the 1450s -and soon enough, Dracula gets bad press as the first horror stories are printed and circulated.Cast aside the horror and the terrorism that he undeniably committed against foe and countryman alike, and you may see what I saw by the end of your study: Dracula could very well have been the veiled model for Machiavelli's \\"The Prince\\"."},{"Title":"Dracula, Prince of Many Faces: His Life and His Times","review":"This book is an educational read not only to learn about Vlad Dracula but also the history of the surrounding area at the time. If your just interested in Dracula alone this book will probably not be of interest to you. It explains the legend well and goes into the whole life of Vlad."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"I bought this book recently and it exceeded every expectation I head. The excellent presentation of the subjects, the quality of images and the huge number of exercises all make this probably one of the best physics books out there.Although this is a calculus based text, vector calculus usage is kept quite low. If you need a text that is heavily using vector calculus you should probably use the Berkeley Physics Course of the Feynman Lectures on Physics."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"I realize that if you are looking to buy this book you probably need it for a class and thus do not have the option of not buying the book so I would like to share my experience with it.I needed this book for my freshmen physics class at SUNY Stony Brook and decided to buy it online. I was greatly dissappointed with how much the book assumes. It assumes a thorough education in calculus and a lot of &quot;common sense&quot; that really isn't so common. As an example, in the first chapter of the book, it assumes that the reader knows that the horizion is the line perpendicular to the tangent of a person on the face of the earth. It does not explain this, rather it just assumes that you would know that, and the book proceeds in this manner through out the later chapters.The answers that it gives as examples often skip too many important steps and use mathematical ideas that can be foreign to some students, especially freshmen. It is hard to follow the examples because of this and the solutions guide that is meant to complement the book does even worse work in terms of abbreviating important steps and concepts. By skipping too many steps it makes the later chapters more difficult because they assume knowledge which you do not have and, in all likelihood, do not learn in the earlier chapters. The book is filled with too many pictures that really don't illustrate anything important (as an example there is a picture of an ice skater spinning) and not enough free body diagrams and logical, step by step proofs and examples. Overall I found the text to be very frustrating and really lacking in clarity and ease of learning. It was an ordeal more than a guide.For professors who are considering using this book -- I urge you to pick a different book that has more extensive examples and proofs and doesn't assume as much from the reader."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"This book is a very well explained and logically presented introduction to college level physics.

I don't recommend this book if your a poor college student. My second bad critique is that some examples aren't fully explained (particularly with the some equations). Third bad critique: some problems require knowledge that you won't find in the book. There was an instance where I ran into a problem (a double Atwood machine problem) that required knowledge of Newton's laws in non-inertial frames which the book does not provide.

I am also currently working through the \\"modern physics\\" section of Giancoli in preparation for a course in modern physics.I can tell you that all the books are about the same, with subtle differences. So ignore the morons who say things like \\"this is the worst book ever it doesn't explain anything blah blah I'm dumb.\\"Giancoli(1) seems to take the most mathematical approach, reaching physical conclusions from derived equation, whereas Halliday(3) tends to take a more physical approach, explaining the physics and then deriving the equations. Wolfson(2) seems to be somewhere inbetween these approaches. Which is better is a matter of preference and surprise. As primarly a math student, I was suprised to find I enjoyed Halliday's physical approach more.There seem to be more problems in Giancoli than in the other two. And Giancoli offers some more difficult problems than the other two. Giancolli and Wolfson also offer a large number of \\"general problems\\" at the end of the problems section, which help to tie together the different sections.I should note here for students planning to use any of these books that the calculationless questions at the end of the chapter are a very useful step toward the more difficult problems. Don't ignore them, they sort of train you to think more critically rather than paging through your book for an equation to plug numbers into.One advantage of Halliday is the \\"checkpoint\\" questions placed at the end of each section. These checkpoints ought to be particularly useful to beginning students who either have trouble monitoring their level of concentration or gauging their level of understanding. This way you won't get to the end of the chapter and say \\"What the h*** did I just read!\\"Wolfson is nice because it comes in three seperate volumes, so you don't have to carry around 1000+ pages of back pain every MWF.All 3 of these books offer a section in modern physics in recent editions, so that should not be an issue. If you are planning on doing the two semesters of physics, and then a semester on modern physics, it's probably not a bad idea to shell out the extra cash for the modern physics chapters so that you can get a head start over the summer.All in all I'd say get whatever book your department requires and don't complain because all introductory physics books are about the same. If you have a choice get Giancoli if you like solving difficult problems, get Halliday if you think you will enjoy more physical explainations or have trouble monitoring your concentration or understanding. And get Wolfson if you'd like something inbetween or are concerned about the health of your back. If you are taking AP physics and will need to retake physics in college, maybe try learning from different texts if you can afford it.My final word is to go with the best bargain, and if money is not an option, you might as well flip a coin or throw darts or something."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"I had to use this book during my two semesters of non-calculus college physics, and my first reaction to this 1000+ page monster was mathematical FEAR. However, as I kept reading the book I realized that it explained the majority of concepts clearly even for a person with limited calculus knowledge. The book does an excellent job early on with Newton's three laws, but it gets a little confusing on statics.The last half of the book was covered in my second semester, and it was also excellent in explaining the topics of thermodynamics, DC and RC circuits, Magnetism and Optics among others. Nevertheless, there were times when the explanation and examples of the book were not enough to answer some of the problems at the end of each chapter. Furthermore, my only complain about the book is that sometimes it uses what my instructor called \\"Shortcuts\\" in the sample problems without explaining how the author arrived to a given equation or derivation of a formula. Physics is by no means an easy subject and to do well at it you will need a great instructor and a great book - I was lucky enough to have both.There are very few books that I keep after I take a class, but I have to say that this book is an invaluable reference that will be in my professional bookshelf for many years."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"I am currently taking a calculus-based physics course in my freshman year using Serway's text (Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Sixth Edition). I purchased Giancoli's text because it has the same type of material and a solutions manual to accompany it. I am now in my third term and, having used both books for the first two terms, I can say that Serway's book is probably a better choice for those majoring in physics such as myself. The reason I make this claim is that Serway's derivations are a little more riggerous in most cases and in the exercises Serway FORCES you to develop and derive equations for the perticular problem at hand (precicely what a physicist in the &quot;real world&quot; must be able to do to be successful), whereas Giancoli rarely gives problems that cannot be solved directly by substituting values into given equations. This discrepency can sometimes be troubling though to those not used to having to decide what assumptions to make for themselves.However, neither book can give a student a complete insight into the complicated subject of physics. Each is a pretty good text for a first course in physics and the level of calculus used in each is very basic (a study of basic differential and integral calculus will do fine)."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"You are blessed if your professor adopts this book as your textbook.

I've looked at other books of the same level since I wrote the original review, and this one has turned out to be better than all the others. The book would've been better if they mentioned a few extra things like how its treatment of electricity and magnetism should be taken as only working in an absolute frame, and is only an approximation to the full treatment.All in all, this book covers so many topics, that no matter what physics you are doing in the future, you'll always be able to find some information in here that won't be mentioned in your other book.It covers everything you need to know for a first mechanics course, a course in waves and modern physics, a first course in electricity and magnetism, plus a lot more that is never touched in class. Calculus is not needed for the mechanics course, but it is used in the book. If you know calculus, then you'll benefit. If you don't, you can skip the &quot;calculus equations&quot;, and the rest of the mechanics part of the book will still all be comprehensible."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"I am a senior physics major and I can assure you, if you are looking for an amazing general reference book, this is the book to get. It is essentially broken into 3 major sections. Newtonian Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Modern Physics. It has introductory topics on One and Two Dimensional Kinematics, Newtonian Mechanics, Optics, Electricity and Magnetism (including Maxwell's Equations), Thermodynamics, Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, Nuclear physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology. I first purchased this book about 4 or 5 years ago for an entry level \\"University Physics\\" course. At most Universities this book is used for two semesters. It is a calculus based physics book, so if you have not yet had at least Calculus 1 this book will not be very useful for you if you are going to try to work out the problems. By the time you get to the second half of the book I really recommend at least having Calculus 2. With all of the interesting topics available to read about there are some people that might believe that this book can be read as a popular physics book and just ignore the math. I do not at all recommend that. Although the topics are throughly explained, reading this book and ignoring the math would be an injustice. In every class that I have had in physics since purchasing this book I have consistently gone back to reference it for help. This book is second to none and I believe that there are two books necessary to make it in physics (1) Douglas Giancoli \\"Physics for Scientists and Engineers\\" 3rd Edition (2) James Stewart \\"Calculus\\" 5th Edition. Just one last thing, make sure that if you are considering purchasing this book note that there are two versions of the 3rd edition. One contains a Modern Physics section and one does not. I highly recommend you get the one with the Modern Physics section. All in all this book is the absolute best and I see myself using all through graduate school."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"When i started to use Serway's text for AP physics C, i felt that's a great book.

After using Serway's text for self study for two month, i switched to giancoli's text by friend's recommandation, and i found that it was much better than serway's text in respect that more problem solving, detailed proof are included.

It is very helpful in learning with examples and the diagrams used so you can visually see what is going on in a system."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"This book, if studied and used in a course for beginners, is by far one of the best intro physics books ever made. I think that the 2nd edition is close to being the best, because it has so many applications and example problems often not seen in many intro physics books. Also, the author takes the time to explain ALL the concepts thoroughly. He does this slowly and builds on one related subject to the next. Further, he has so many wonderful in-text example problems that brilliantly illustrate concepts....I love how he explains the integral in chapter 2 in the 2nd edition. That said, this is for students with at least a Calculus I background. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with any less of a mathematical background, unless you're willing to work hard to understand some of the calculus concepts--most are just simple derivatives, integrals, and limits--even then, the author attempts to explain those concepts.I think that what stands this book apart from most other physics books of its type is that the author tries, and succeeds very well in my opinion, to explain the concepts as thoroughly as possible and not let the student infer things. Many, many physics books glaze over subjects and let students \\"draw their own conclusions\\"...hopefully the correct conclusions, and if not they can ask the instructor of their physics course for the right conclusion. So, many intro physics books are NOT self-contained texts. They are merely supplements to a college physics course involving an instructor. This book, with the dedicated student, could teach intro physics on its own! So, it's more of a reference book. Later editions of his wonderful text cut down on the material covered and some of the examples and applications in order to conform with being a supplement to a course. So, I highly suggest you get the 2nd edition or the 3rd edition, no higher."},{"Title":"Physics: With Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers","review":"The main thing I consider with a textbook are the following:How well can an author communicate ideas to a wide variety of studentsHow well the subjects are explainedAre there enough examples to see how the subject applies and how well the examples are explained.Does the text cover enough information to work through at least most of the end of topic questions.It is assumed that you understand Calculus before you start reading this book, hence the \\"For Scientists and Engineers\\" If you expected to learn this book or any other physics book for Scientists and Engineers without having at least one full semester of Calculus, perhaps you didn't understand what the \\"For Scientists and Engineers\\" meant. Usually all of these books require at least one full semester of Calc knowledge to work through the first few chapters, but really a full understanding to work through the entire book.With this in mind, I find this book very readable, much more so than Serway and Jewett, I like the examples better and there are more of them, and the questions at the end of the chapters have varying levels of difficulty, which is normal for any serious textbook. Giancoli writes in plain English, not in Science speak (to the degree he can of course). I also find that each topic has enough explanation for me to understand. Lastly, I can work through many of the questions without having to go to other sources. So for me, this book meets all my criteria for a high quality textbook."},{"Title":"The Green Consumer","review":"This book is fine for what it is, a compendium of information about buying 'green', from toys to pet supplies.Its premise is wrong, however -- buying green is only the thinnest of band-aids atop our monstrous systemic problems of overconsumption and non-sustainable production. I dislike this brand of recycling effort because it shifts responsibility for the environment almost entirely upon the consumer. Certainly it is laudable to be responsible and aware of environmental issues in our buying choices, but the fact of the matter is that perhaps 1% or 2% of waste is directly generated by consumers. The remainder is generated during various production and transportation processes leading up to the sale. Trying to wade through thousands of products in an attempt to buy green simply obscures that key fact. Naturally that's in the interest of corporations themselves, who are all for having municipalities and private citizens bear the brunt of recycling labor and expense -- yet another cost of production successfully externalized out into the community.This kind of book should simply be unnecessary -- ALL products should be 'green'. It is simply common sense: our resources are finite, but our systems are geared toward infinitely-growing production and consumption. Clearly, our systems must change such that the great majority of products are sustainably produced."},{"Title":"The Green Consumer","review":"I've had this book for almost 10 years!

Instead, it touches on the simple, yet most profound, questions of life and death in the deceptive plainness of the most wise. It is food for the heart, and it rings deeply true. And, while the author seems to be a deeply spiritual man, there is nothing of a dogmatic sense about any of the writing.Read this book; your best self will thank you!"},{"Title":"How, Then, Shall We Live","review":"Wayne Muller is an ordained minister, psychotherapist and best-selling author. A graduate of Harvard Divinity School, he has spent the last twenty-five years working closely with some of the most disadvantaged members of society. He founded Bread for the Journey, a national, nonprofit charity serving the poor and underprivileged. Muller's meditation on four simple questions takes him far afield into revealing much of himself, the struggles and victories of the many he helps and into beautiful, illustrative literature and stories from world religions. At the end of each section he has inventive exercises that help the reader find her answer to these immortal questions. The questions:Who am I? The way we feel about ourselves, the way we live our lives depends upon how we answer this question. Am I the sum of my symptoms? Am I the roles I play, my job titles, what others think of me? Have I shrunk to the circumference of a label others placed upon me? Or is there a hidden wholeness within that I must strive to connect with each day? Jesus answered the question in saying \\"You are the light of the world?\\" He did not say you are the light of the world if you grew up in a rich or famous family, or if you are svelte and good looking, if you have never been abused or a child of a broken home. \\"No, regardless of the shape of the sorrow or victory or grief or ecstasy we have been given, there is a potent inner luminosity that is never extinguished and is alive in us this instant.\\" (17). We come into the world with a true self that lets us know when we have gone astray from our nature as children of God. Ask yourself throughout the day, \\"Who am I?\\" Pay attention to the breadth of your answers. Which reflect your deepest nature?What do I love? You cannot love everything or everyone. Jesus said \\"Where your treasure is there will you heart be also.\\" The aim of this section is to help you with the fruitful challenge of discerning and choosing those things you truly love -- to reset your center of gravity. Who and what gets most of your attention. \\"Attention is the tangible measure of love\\" (p. 87) Look through you date book, recall your week. Where are most of you time and energy going? This is where your love is going too. Do you need a course correction, a realignment between what you do and what you profess doing? In a world where doing is more important that being, we can easily lose ourselves in doing too much. Gather some magazines and cut out those pictures that seem powerful and intriguing. As you do this keep in mind this one question, \\"What do I love?\\" What do you notice of each, how do they make you feel, pick one and ask what it says to you about your inner life, what you love? (P. 123)How shall I live, knowing I will die? It is life's impermanence that makes us value it so dearly. Nothing intensifies life as the scare of facing death. Suddenly, life is intense, the unnecessary fades, worries about money are eclipsed by the preciousness of our remaining time. If we are not careful, our life becomes a joyless grind of work and chores. How many of us want immortality but don't know what to do with ourselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon? Who of us is just passing through this life waiting for a happier more fulfilling afterlife? Take an hour to plan your own memorial service. Who do you want to be there, for what do you want to be remembered, what do you want people to say? What is the primary legacy of your life? What would you like your epitaph to say? This exercise may afford you some surprises about the kind of life you want to live. What one thing can you do to begin this life? (P. 204)What is my gift to the family on the earth? If you believe what Jesus told you that you are the light of the world, then upon what do you shine that light? Or do you hide it behind sorrow, or hurts and try to save it like the last morsel of bread? It is only from the broken places of our life that our light can shine. It is in suffering we gain wisdom, and in trials that we learn empathy. Our gift is ourselves, in whatever manifestation of generosity we share it. Daily we are given opportunities to offer our gifts to fellow workers, family, strangers, to the lonely, dying, to our planet and its many endangered species who have given us so much. Take a day and track your impulse to give in different circumstances. Does giving emerge naturally or is it hindered by a sense of obligation, or resentment? Notice how it feels to give of yourself. Does it produce happiness or leave you feeling weary and drained? (P. 253).How Then, Shall We Live? makes you aware of the need to listen and to learn from your inner life.

Whether physics can distinguish between past and future is then considered, and although the 1965 perspective is somewhat dated, the concepts nonetheless remain valid. Quantum mechanics is then presented with imagination and enthusiasm. The reference closes with a philosophical consideration of how theorists produce new laws of physics, with Feynman reminding us that it doesn't matter who the physicist is, or how smart he/she is, or how he/she came up with the new law -- if it disagrees with experiment, then it is wrong."},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","review":"And you'll even understand how the scientific process works,to boot.

Feynman had demonstrated in the lectures how the principles in physical laws can be extended from one to another and how great theories evolved when the predications of laws disagree with the observations. The materials are simple enough to demonstrate what physical laws are, but amazing enough to let almost all sort of people being able to grab the central idea of what a physical law means to a scientist as well as everyone in the world.I was really touched by the works Feynman had brought to demonstrate the basic principles (or characters) of Physical Laws, such as the general principle of conservation, symmetry or even uncertainty principles in quantum mechanics, in the simplest words and the most intuitive way.

It reaffirms simple truths in science research that are often forgotten in an age of automated analysis, that for example one must dig into the details of an experiment or observation with as little bias as possible to uncover the next aha moment and what is worth pursuing next (in my experience, one always finds something worthwhile if one digs, even if it is just explaining what went wrong) that arriving at the same answer by using different sets of equations (working in energy vs force space is a favorite example of mine) is anything but a waste of time, as different calculational paths lead on to connections to different phenomena.

This book is a testament to all three of these contentions. As the title states, this book is about physical laws: what they are, what they are not and why they require mathematics for their complete understanding. While the need to understand physical laws in terms of mathematics is stressed, this book uses almost no math, and none beyond basic high school math is required.The book is based on 7 lectures, each of which is covered by an approximately 25-page chapter. These chapters cover: the law of gravitation, the relation of mathematics to physics, the great conservation principals, symmetry in physical law, distinction of past and future, probability and uncertainty, and seeking new laws. These chapters touch on classical physics, relativistic physics and quantum mechanics, all in a fluid and continuous manner. This book is not, however, a physics text because it does not discuss how to solve specific problems. It is, however, a great adjunct to those texts as it goes deeper into what physical laws really mean.The stated audience for this book is people who are interested in science, but may have little or no background in this field. This is not to say that people who are well versed in the physical sciences would get nothing from this book. Quite the contrary, the more your scientific background the more you will get from the time spent with this book. Theoretical physicists may already understand all of what Professor Feynman is teaching, so this may be old hat to them. They may, however, still enjoy the presentation, so even they may get something from this book. As someone with an advanced degree in the physical sciences, but not in theoretical physics, I found this book to be mind expanding. Feynman gets to the heart of physical laws in ways that I had never considered. For instance, he provides one of the best descriptions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics that I have ever read, but never mentions them as laws per se, as he shows that they are manifestations of more fundamental laws. (Actually, he shows that there is no single set of fundamental laws, as many different ones could be used as the starting point to get to the same conclusions.) College physics students should love this book. It should be of immeasurable help in their more fully understanding what their texts may only hint at. Those with only a high school physics background should also get a lot from this book, but it may be a bit of a hard slog for them."},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","review":"Once every 2,500 years someone is born who transcends human knowledge and takes us to a higher place.

I found this book both too simple and too difficult. I probably need to explain this further. The lectures were aimed at students of physics, not at complete laypersons like myself, who would like to take a brief glimpse into the awe inspiring world of science. Mr. Feynman assumed therefore, that his listeners already had some notion of basic physics, like newtonian gravity and some calculus. Although the book is non mathematical and you do not need to solve any formulas, some concepts are not explained from the start up (for example in his example about acceleration or gravity he uses some differential equations and he assumes that you will understand both the mathematical symbols and the reasoning behind it). This was the difficult part. But then again I found it too simple, because he does not go into much detail, which I would have liked, in order to understand the topics better.What I liked most from the book was his explanation of the difference between Greek and Babilonian science and how physics resembles more to Babilonian science. In physics you do not need to construct everything from basic axioms (fundamental statements), in fact you could use any law as an axiom to another law or putting it differently, you can derive other laws from it and expand its application to other areas, the same as you can use other laws to arrive at your initial law. Everything in physics is interconnected and many laws express the same, but viewed from a different angle or using a different basic assumption. If your theory can be applied to other fields, it is probably a more fundamental law. I also liked how Mr. Feynman explained the difference between Math and Physics in the sense that in Math, if you find a solution, it is correct, whereas in Physics you need to go to the data. If your solution does not fit the data, your theory is either incorrect or incomplete.Regarding the chapter on particle physics, I had the impression that some of the statements were a bit outdated. I think inFantastic Realities: 49 Mind Journeys And a Trip to Stockholm, I have read that a few of the open topics that the author mentions have already been studied in deeper detail and some questions have already been answered in experiments carried out in the big accelerators.

It is quite remarkable for perceptive interpretations of physics with a minimum of maths and as a bonus, the reader gets an insight into the mind of a truly leading theoretician. If you want an initial insight as to how physics works, excellent. Unfortunately, extemporization leads to \\"forgetfulness\\", e.g. \\"action\\" is stated to arise from and is fundamental to quantum mechanics, but is not mentioned in the discussion on quantum mechanics.I believe the title is misleading. The book will not help or encourage an emerging theoretician. How to form a theory: Guess, compute, compare with observation. The rest of the book is argued to be no guidance, because any new theory will be quite different from the examples! Worse, we know all theory except at extreme energies or distances. (We could be wrong, but we aren't!)I disagree. The book states on nuclear binding, apart from proton electrical repulsions, neutrons and protons interact with a constant energy. Theory is sound, but cannot be computed completely. Instead, suppose hadrons comprise up and down quarks, with different electric charge, that produce two types of interactions. Believe it or not, that, with consideration of that \\"action\\" is sufficient to produce relative stabilities for isotopes, and show why technetium has no stable isotope, and to indicate nuclear binding could come from electromagnetism. Wrong? Maybe, but isn't the fun of theory trying things out? Feynman offers no encouragement, little hope, and surprisingly, no insight on how he developed his theories. That is a pity."},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","review":"July 8, 1999 I would like to take a minute to thank Audio Scholar for abridging this novel to audio. I much prefered having a professional speaker narrate the book as previous Richard Feyman products I have purchased have really lacked in sound quality (they were not Audio Scholar products). I thoroughly enjoyed the abridged audio novel as did my 18 month old son who gets to listen to them to as his bedtime stories. I would like to encourage Audio Scholar to produce more of these types of edutainment audio programs on tape or CD. In many instances I wouldn't mind seeing the programs extend to 4 tapes or CD's. I love listening to scientific books on my way to work and also love to share them with my 18 month old son as his bedtime stories. Actually I initially started buying them for my son and then got hooked on them myself. Why should my 18 month old son get all the good stuff to listen too! My budget for this type of audio edutainment has sky rocketed from $100 a year to $1,000 a year due to the high level of quality of the Audio Scholar work. The more science and physics books abridged the better. I would love to see the following subjects abrigded to audio for distribution through Amazon.com. Maths, sciences, physics, astrophysics, geology, any and all space related topics, gravity, unified field theory, electromagnetics, electronics, microproccessor design, optics, micro-optics, electro-optics, light and the theory there of, satellites, satellite orbital mechanics and related theory, engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering. I would also like to encourage Audio Scholar to pursue the rights to abridge Michio Kaku's books to audio as well.

From almost beginning to understand angular momentum, to getting a feel for gravity, and how many laws have been integrated. For a novice at physics but with a keen interest this book gives an excellent background and, for me, is a joy to read each time, I can almost hear Feynman making his lectures and sharing jokes with his students. Each time I come away from reading this book I find myself pondering more about various aspects of physics and get a clearer idea of other books to buy to continue my current hobby of understanding the way the universe works just a little better (hopefully anyway :)"},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","review":"This is yet another book that attempts to convey the essence of physics to common people. After explaining exactly why it can't be done, arguing that you'll never get it, Feynman goes right ahead and does it anyway.For each topic, you get a feel for his goal in covering a topic. He explains gravity, yes, to explain gravity, but also because by explaining it he can also convey what essential properties gravity has that other laws have.He also explains the difference between fundamental laws and the consequences of those laws. That the individual laws are reversible, but that probability is responsible for the arrow of time. He spends a lot of time showing the difficult relationship between the basic laws (which are reversible) and the irreversibility of events. Both are characteristics of the physical universe but the latter is not a fundamental law. The latter is a logical outcome of them.So there's a hierarchy, which goes; fundamental laws like gravity at the ground level, consequences of them like irreversibility and surface tension at one level up, organic chemistry further up, then eventually concepts like tree, frog, man, pain, beauty, good and evil - each at a higher level, but based upon the levels below them, and difficult to fully predict using only the laws of the lower levels. The levels can be extended up and down. Below gravity is the unification theory of everything. Above good and evil are love, politics, etc.And then he asks, of the extremes on this hierarchy, the fundamental laws and the most abstract concepts, which is closest to God? After asking for patience with his religious reference, he spends little time before revealing his belief that the question is flawed. To understand God is to understand how the levels interrelate; how the fundamental laws were \\"chosen\\" so that they would lead to the unfolding of all the beautiful complexity that we see around us.Is this what you want to learn? Why else do we read these books than to attempt to gain a bit more insight into the eternal questions. Most authors that tackle the nature of the universe have a theological axe to grind (the need for God or not) and can't hide it. This book did more on this topic, with fewer pages, while offending me the least because of any theological bias (either way), than anything I've read before."},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","review":"One the greatest theoretical physicists and popular lecturer, Feynman expresses his view on the puzzles, controversies, and problems at the core of physical theory. He uses as an example the law of gravitation to show that despite the simplicity of physical laws, they are not exact, there is always a mystery, always a place where there is further work to be done, so &quot;scientists must stick their heads out.&quot; And what is most remarkable is not what scientists have been able to discover, but what nature has taught us. Feynman stresses the importance of mathematics as the key to any system of scientific laws (mathematics is more than just a language, it is language plus logic). This is a series of lecturers to be read preferably by those individuals who have a solid background in physics, otherwise you may find your neurons will not know in which direction they should fire!

Smart high school kids know at some level that out of ignorance their teachers aren't really telling them the truth in math and science classes, and it's a thrill for them to hear things from someone who really does understand what they are talking about.Anyway, this book is great, and you should get it for your smart kid who is interested in science. You should also demand that they put the lectures on DVD, because watching Feynman talk is even better than reading the books.

While I wouldn't have this on my list of first Feynman books to get (or physics books for that matter) if you do find it and have an interest in physics then by all means, pick it up.The book is a collection of Lectures Feynman made. He deals with seven topics in fewer than 200 pages. The topics are.1) Gravitation2) Mathematics and physics3) The conservation of energy4) Symmetry5) The arrow of time6) Quantum mechanics7) How to find new lawsFeynman brings a lot to the table in such a small space of time. His examples are usually quite good but some are hit and miss. It was written in 1965 and while most of it is still valid (it is missing over 50 years of physics!) you may find that you can learn about these topics better elsewhere... and that's really the catch. However, I would certainly say you can learn a lot here and the point of getting this book is to get Feynman's take on these subjects. He is still as good today as he was back then.I wouldn't say that if this was your first time coming across physics that Feynman is too advanced, as this book and Feynman's lectures are designed for any audience with an interest in physics, but that is not to say that it is easy. In fact Feynman goes out of his way to explain that it is hard because it is so counterintuitive. I would say though that if you could get a modern book on cosmology that you will get a better introduction to these topics. In fact several books on cosmology would have you better prepared but in the end you are probably going to want to read Feynman. This may not be a bad place to go, but at the same time I feel there are probably much better Feynman books out there.There are some illustrations in this book but most of them are hand drawn and apart from the images of galaxies are not always helpful. However notice that this still gets 4 stars for all its failings. Why? Because when it clicks you learn something you won't elsewhere. That is just how it is with physics books. They all have these accomplishments and failings to some degree. If you come away from a book with something new or a new way to look at physics, or have something explained to you in way you have never seen before, then it has already done its job. Within these 200 pages are some gems. I think his explanation of Newtonian Gravity is one of the best I have ever seen though. Also his overall explanation of how science works is nearly worth the price of this book alone.Pros:- Feynman's explanations- Newtonian Gravity explained- ShortCons:- 50 recent years of physics is not covered- Can get very difficult even for experienced physics readers"},{"Title":"The character of physical law (The Messenger lectures, 1964)","review":"My title is one sentence from these lectures.

But at certain points in this book, Feynman begins to venture off and begin discussing things that are relatively complex and I can't say are really intended for people that don't have a solid background in physics.I personally found myself either thinking his lecture was either too simple (or explained extremely well) or too complex. All in all, I'm not sure who Feynman had in mind for an audience when he gave his lecture, but I would imagine it's for the person that has a solid background in physics and wishes to indulge in some physics \\"brain-candy\\" to think about some extremely interesting concepts.Good book.

The author loves to use a string of big words where a couple simple ones would do better.Mainly, though, I found the book to be very hard on the eyes. For a book that's written by someone supposed to be a guru in the publishing industry, I have to wonder why he chose to prepare the text on either an old dot matrix printer or a cheap inkjet. The text is fuzzy, with horizontal lines dropped out-- suggesting a broken dot matrix pin or clogged ink jet. Further, many, many paragraphs contain hyphens in the middle of them. It is obvious that hard hyphens were used to typefit the book, but then it was reformatted without further editing-- throwing those hyphens into the most awkward places. The services of an editor would have been a wise investment.Anyway, if your eyes can stand it-- and my old ones could not-- you could glean some good information from this book. Note, however, that the largest part of the book is geared toward hiring department heads, something that will be of little or no use to the small publisher.My suggestion?

As if \\"FREEDOM\\" meant \\"freedom to live in terror of the Paris mob,\\" or indeed, \\"freedom to participate in the random, vicious slaughter of innocents ALONGSIDE the Paris mob.\\" But in this book, there is no such thing as an \\"innocent\\" aristocrat. The aristocracy concept itself is oppressive, and must be rooted out through violence in pursuit of a \\"pure\\" France of poverty, random dismemberment, starvation, and despair.In this book, Paine considers ALL the authority of the past illegitimate -- all of it. All structures from family to piety to duty to honor must fall ... supposedly because it is \\"enlightened\\" to think so. Paine thinks the only thing holding people back from becoming truly transcendant beings (heaven on earth again) is those moldy old conventions. If this sounds like Pol Pot and Mao and today's \\"pragmatic\\" politicians, it's because revolutionaries from that age to this have borrowed these words in pursuit of their true goal: POWER. They've also borrowed the methods of the French Revolution -- terrorizing their own people and destroying their own nations.SO, my big question is this: Is it because of Paine that Jefferson failed to comprehend the evil of the French Revolution?How could Paine, who championed the American Revolution (a war to UPHOLD the long-standing British principles of natural rights and common laws, which were being violated by the Colonial governors) have written this book so soon on the heels? Was Paine secretly paid by the National Assembly to produce this? Did he instead revel in misery and bloodshed, was he a real sicko? One must wonder.The person to read on the French Revolution is Governeur Morris, the American minister to France after Jefferson's stint there -- his journals reflect the reality on the ground, and he roundly conveys his disgust.Gentleman Revolutionary: Gouverneur Morris, the Rake Who Wrote the ConstitutionEnvoy to the Terror: Gouverneur Morris and the French Revolution"},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"On time, and as promised.

It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL \\"democratic\\" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow."},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today. Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading. Regardless, the second part, the chapter on &quot;Ways and Means&quot; in particular, is composed of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find. What Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state, replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other fine statist amenities. Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever. It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty.

Its message is the superiority of reason, in the form of Republican government armed with the Declaration of the Rights of Man, over despotism which holds populations in ignorance. With the American and French revolutions fresh in his mind, Paine was writing in a world on the threshold of freedom and that comes through in his forceful and forthright style. That said, and most important for the reader to appreciate, much of what he has to say still applies today. Paine in scathing in his critique of hereditary monarchy and privilege. He says &quot;the idea of hereditary legislation is.......as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man.&quot; He rejects the notion of government laws being justified by tradition and therefore irrevocable. His argument against Burke's defence of the 1688 revolution in England is perhaps the best in the book. Paine argues that the only thing that is truly hereditary is the Rights of Man : &quot;The Rights of men in society, are neither devisable, nor transferrable, nor annihilable, but descendable only.&quot; The book is a superb polemic when both understood in its historical context and applied to world politics today. His arguments for reform of the House of Lords strike a particularly pertinent note. He expresses liberal doctrines that many people take for granted but in our own genocidal times Paine reminds us that many of the topics that impassioned him should continue to impassion everyone with an interest in humanity. The style of the writing may put off a few as many themes disappear and reappear throughout the book instead of being dealt with in a coherant whole.

Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;."},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"\\"Rights of Man\\" (1791-92) is Thomas Paine's famous response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution of France\\" (1790). Although it helps have read Burke's essay, a general background is sufficient to understand and appreciate Paine's basic and groundbreaking arguments.Paine and Burke were originally allies; Burke not only supported self-rule for the American colonies, he also supported the emancipation of the House of Commons from monarchical control and the independence of both Ireland and India. Many of his allies, then, were bewildered by his fervent opposition to the French Revolution; Burke drew the line between territorial autonomy from a distant or aloof government and the total overthrow of existing monarchies and institutions. For Burke, humankind's real enemies were drastic change and \\"unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos,\\" and he proved himself a staunch defender of the status quo, of precedent, and of gradual reform.Jerry Muller, in his recent--and superb--book \\"The Mind and the Market\\" asserts that Burke's denunciation of the French revolution is \\"the single most influential work of conservative thought published from his day to ours.\\" (This, of course, depends on what one means by \\"conservative.\\") Yet Muller and likeminded historians inevitably cherry-pick Burke's more attractive economic and philosophical arguments and foreground Burke's critique, in Muller's words, \\"of the revolutionary mentality that attempts to create entirely new structures on the basis of rational, abstract principles.\\" (Muller doesn't even mention Paine, much less the example of the United States.) Such a focus inevitably sidesteps Burke's brief for the supremacy of European monarchical institutions and of the landed aristocracy. And that's where Paine comes in.With his usual acerbic wit and extravagant rhetoric, Paine, in the first part of his treatise, makes mincemeat out of Burke's sillier statements. For example, he finds especially unspeakable Burke's claim that that \\"the English nation did, at the time of the [1688] Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate [the right of self-rule], for themselves, and for all their posterity for ever.\\" Paine correctly challenges the primacy of a decision made by members of that generation over desires of other generations, questions the right of any generation to surrender the rights of their descendants, and notes that \\"government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it.\\"He also chastises the English for a system of hereditary government that virtually guarantees unfettered rule by children, madmen, idiots, and foreign-born pretenders (and he certainly has plenty of examples from which to choose), many of whom led their realms into chaos and terror without the help of radical revolutionaries. And Paine argues that wars would cease with the promotion of democracy and the cessation of the selfish interests of absolutists. His critics rightly respond that the rise of democratic institutions has hardly stopped wars, although one might pose the counterargument that, relatively speaking, democratic governments go to war with each other much less frequently.In the second part, Paine proposes a radical agenda for an overhaul of the British government. Although his anecdotally based statistics and figures must be viewed with skepticism and a few laughs, the prescience of his proposals is startling: poverty relief, social security, public education, maternity care, homeless shelters, workfare, veteran's benefits, and progressive taxation. His is the agenda of the idealist: \\"When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive . . . when these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and its government.\\"Paine, of course, had the nascent United States to cite in support of his proposals, but he and Burke were debating these matters before the onset of the Jacobin Reign of Terror, which dismayed Paine and seems to have realized Burke's worst fears. Yet, throughout history, for every Robespierre or Lenin, one can find a Mandela or a Walesa; monarchies too were no strangers to upheaval. Paine hardly argued for \\"mob rule\\" or even \\"majority rule\\"; the French Revolution failed in part because it violated the fundamental tenet that the citizens of each nation have a right to choose whatever rule they please, even \\"a bad or defective government, . . . so long as the majority to not impose conditions on the minority, different to what they impose on themselves\\"--a caveat we all should take to heart in today's political climate."},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"Paine wrote RoM while in France, during the early years of the revolution, in response to an antirevolutionary pamphlet from his previous friend Burke. There is lots of polemics going on, and the crux of the matter is that Burke makes light of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, which was adopted by the French National Assembly in August 1789, after the storm of the Bastille. The Declaration, written by Lafayette with some input by Jefferson, is a brief and concise document. It became the preamble of the constitution of 1791.Here a shortened version.1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the ... rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. ...4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; ... These limits can only be determined by law.5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. ...7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. ...8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.9. ...all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty ...10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be intrusted.13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their means.14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of the taxes.15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his administration.16. A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all.17. ... property is an inviolable and sacred right ...Paine contrasts this brilliantly utopian text with England's lack of a constitution.But there is not just the matter of principle, there is also disagreement over matters of fact.Burke had denied not only the French right to revolt, but also the reason to revolt, as the current holder of the throne was not known to be a despot. Paine's point is that the revolution was not against the king as a person, but against a despotic system, which divided and sub-divided in 1000 steps and acted by deputation. Popper's concept of the \`open society' comes to mind. The \`declaration' quoted above aims at an open society. That is not a question of the personal quality of an individual ruler.(I can't help thinking laterally, about a special country, which right now also has a reasonably mild and rational government, within the limits of the system... What is the leader of the revolution over here quoted as having said when asked about the French Revolution? It is too early to tell. Well, that seems to be apocryphal.)Government, wrote Paine, arises out of 3 sources:a)superstition (priest craft, think of Islamic or other religious states),b)power (dictatorships, one party rules), orc)reason (which i.m.o. is synonym with secular).Unfortunately we know from history that many cases which started out from reason went into some kind of hybrid state, down the road. Or worse, we see the effect of the \`dialectics of enlightenment': reason itself becomes embodied in power and perverts itself.The order of the day for us, today, is to struggle for the survival of reason in existing governments, or for the growth of reason where it is lacking."},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"In reading Tom Payne it is best to go right to the horse's mouth. Don't buy a volume with a modern day author's interpretation. Tom expresses himself clearly, logically and in up to date readable language. He needs no interpreter. Read what he has to say for yourself and make your own judgements.This work is rather amazing when you consider the date that he penned these masterpieces. Don't pay any attention to the right-wing attempts at slurring Tom even today. He made sense in 1776 and his arguments makes sense today. If there were no Tom Paine I doubt if their would be an independent United States today - even George Washington admitted that fact. Tom Paine was simply too outspoken and too honest (and too courageous) for his time - or for today's times for that matter.If you love history, philosophy, or politics as an American this is a man that you must read.Tom Paine writing style and ability is \\"inspirational\\" to say the least.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"Great product, the service was right on time and I greatly appreciated how the product was as it was advertised"},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"Much of this book should be committed to memory by anyone who loves the freedom we enjoy here in America because we have this freedom largely due to him!!!!!!!!(Thomas Payne) God definitely gave him wisdom far and above the average person.

Thanks so much."},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"The book is a response to arguments made by Edmond Burke that were critical to the constitution and behavior that resulted from the French revolution. Edmond Burke believed in the English constitution and the structure of the government in Great Britain. Mr. Paine argued the British did not have a constitution, the government was tyrannical, not efficient, a poor economic system, and not democratic. The sporadic alterations in the general design of the English government was not designed by the people voted on by the population in Great Britain, so it cannot be considered a constitution. The purpose of this work is to make an argument why the constitution set up by the French revolution is superior to the pre-Revolutionary French government and the current British government at the time of publication. No constitution cannot be established but through referendum.Thomas Paine argues that the equality of man is established by his very nature. His arguments come from the bible and other religious resources. The rationale for the rights from man come from God, but the author does not believe an individual religion has a monopoly on the truth. Pain believed in freedom of association and the organization of individuals in the making a political argument. He believed people of opposing thoughts could come to accommodation while they walked this earth. Anyhow he believed in the arguments of different world views could be made to come to the conclusion all men equal in his natural state.Paine argued government is formed either through Superstition (Religious manipulation) Power (war, conquering a people) and those that arise out of society (constitutional government). Constitution must occur before the government. The United States and France were his examples of governments coming from society. Governments that exist out of power or superstition produce a hereditary government or government ruled by a certain association not from the population or society. Edmond Burke defended the nobility. Mr. Paine made a distinction between government privileges inherited based on birth and the wealth obtained through inheritance. Titles are nicknames of legal sanction to have authority over others in the population. Consequence is not just unfairness, but a less competent government and the lack of fairness in governmental decisions. Distinction between people must be determined by the person's utility. Does the person improve society by holding a specific position of trust. The sovereign and legislators should be determined by the vote. Transmission of ideas through debate will improve the government. Debate is formed through association. People should be encouraged form into groups in order to form alliance to their point across. Society and Civilization, the wants of the people can be pursued more efficiently when a structure exists where ideas may be debated, thoughts learned, and more may seek participation. Some men have abilities that other do not posses. Society therefore the individual function better under structure but that does not mean all governments are equally as effective. Thomas Paine did not want the rights of a select few chosen through heredity protected at the expense of others. Men seek a fair government where their concerns are heard.Thomas Paine believed in the Universal Right of Conscience. Man does not worship man, but God. The mortal worships the immortal. Government should not presume or regulate how man worships the immortal neither should government define who the immortal is. - If man is free to judge his own faith his beliefs will hold what is to be true. - If man is free to judge another's faith he will hold or believe the idea of another God to be false. Thomas Pain makes the argument government corrupts religion. I have no argument here. But when he argues that government is the cause of religious intolerance that argument is absurd.The author saw the forces of history on the side democracy. Thomas Paine saw democracy as a major factor in developing the free enterprise system. He saw the United State as a major example of democracy and prosperity. Man was set free to go after wealth in so doing creating more wealth. He presumed France would soon follow the United States. Thomas Paine argued government sanctioned Charters (monopolies for the Aristocrats ) hindering ingenuity and the betterment of man. The more efficient the trade between people and nations the more wealth is produced.The author goes into great length to argue for less regressive taxes. Taxes on products hit the poor the hardest and increase the need for more in the population to receive aid to be able to survive. Thomas Paine was an advocate of a more progressive tax. He also argued for more government to those in aid by taking returns of investments and taxes on the wealthy.."},{"Title":"The rights of man (Everyman's library, 718A)","review":"This book was written in 1790 and 91. It was written in two parts. It started out as a rebuttal to Edmund Burke's book on the French Revolution, but as it developed Paine ended up discussing the whole aspect of democracy and goes in quite detail into the ills of a monarchial government. Paine was an ex-patriot Englishman who lived for a time in the United States. His time there coincided with the American Revolution, and Paine was a contemporary of George Washington and Ben Franklin. Paine was an idealist and that comes out clear in this important work. He also made a lot of enemies in England with his radical viewpoints. His was not an easy life, but he certainly lived at a crucial time in world history, and his viewpoints are actually quite valid in some respects even today. Not an easy book to read, but an important work to make the effort to do so."},{"Title":"Infant and Child in the Culture of Today: the Guidance of Development in Home and Nursery School","review":"Based on a longitudinal study of children starting in the 1930's, this book describes behavior of children at certain ages. It does not tell you how to raise your child. It simply tells you what to expect at 3 months, two years, eight years, etc. Instead of perceiving your child's behavior as peculiar or bad (and therefore punishing the child), the parent can see the behavior as normative. It enables acceptance of your child as he or she is and should be."},{"Title":"Infant and Child in the Culture of Today: the Guidance of Development in Home and Nursery School","review":"This book has taught me so much ( and I haven't even completed tit .. almost though)!Times change, people don't ..

I highly reccomend this title for anyone who intends serious to pursue serious scholarship of Charles and Ray."},{"Title":"Bright Minds, Beautiful Ideas: Parallel Thoughts in Different Times","review":"This book is not only for Eames enthusiasts, but for those interested in socially relevant design. It is a critique of current design, its over-emphasis on form, and its lack of social relevance - roots in actual social need versus just padding the pocketbooks of their manufacturers.It covers how Eames created the fiberglass shell chair initially to bring affordable, well-designed products into the homes of all people. In his lifetime, he saw his own products become over-priced and lose sight of their original intention. The books includes a brilliant visual diagram (drawn by Eames) of how the needs of the design office, the client and society as a whole can have overlapping interests! And how in this overlap, design can work with conviction and enthusiasm.It also covers the work of Marti Guixe, who focuses on designing solutions rather than products - hesitant to bring one more item into consumerist society. This is responsible design! Design can meet a need without costing society and the environment.Designers have a lot to learn from this book. I know that this has inspired me, and given words to the dissatisfaction I felt while practicing graphic design over the last 10 years. 'Design' needs to be redefined in the context of social relevance and problem solving, one designer at a time."},{"Title":"Pornography And Silence - Culture's Revenge Against Nature","review":"Griffin is a master with words. Less prose-like than her well known classic Woman and Nature, Pornography and Silence is another attempt to unearth the pathological mind that divides men and women, culture and nature. I would not recommend this book for those first exploring the issue of (anti-)pornography (look instead for Gail Dines's \\"Pornland\\" or Robert Jensen's \\"Getting Off\\"). Those well read in or familiar with the last two centuries of Western literature and art, though, will find this book stimulating. Griffin uses the six lives of Franz Marc, Kate Chopin, the Marquis de Sade, Marilyn Monroe, Lawrence Singleton, and Anne Frank to navigate through two hundred years of silence and violence in Western culture. Also interesting is her challenge to the typical claim that pornographers are leaders in the liberation of the body and sexuality from Victorian-like repression. She makes a strong argument that, while apparently antithetical, the total demolition of borders found in pornography and the suppression of human sexuality found inherited from the religious tradition of the West share an invisible alliance.\\"These pages will argue that pornography is an expression not of human erotic feeling and desire, and not of a love of the life of the body, but of a fear of bodily knowledge, and a desire to silence eros.\\" (p. 1)"},{"Title":"the house that berry built","review":"Jonah and Co. is a series of stories about a family who share their lives in the days betweenthe Wars.

There are detective type series, some love interests series and overall a wonderful commentary on the years pre-1950.

It deals with real adult issues, as this whole series does, and may not be suitable for people who do not understand the circle of life.This book picked up upon Nancy's growing relationship and attraction to Peter Goodwin (I think that's how you spell it). Somehow, Nancy gets these vibes that Peter is not telling her the truth. Ex-girlfriend (of Peter's) Dawn Steiger, who is also Nancy's resident advisor, only confirms Nancy's suspicions, yet doesn't tell her, though it is obvious she knows. Another complication - well, maybe not so much a complication, but definetely confusing issue - is that Nancy has got to figure out why junior, journalist, and hot-shot Jake Collins is suddenly giving her much more attention. They haven't even spoken two words to each other before!People who have read any book(s) in this series know that mystery takes the back seat whereas life and romance share the front. However mystery still plays a significant part in all books, and in this one, Bess Marvin - one of Nancy's best friends - is framed for stealing a huge biology exam. It's up to Nancy to help her friends and clear their names.I know that I've said plenty about not reccomending this book, but honestly, it is one of my favourites in the series.

In this book, we learn a lot about Johnnie Cochran the man, his passion and committment. We learn more about his deep family ties, religious conviction, and sense of justice, which led him to take such high profile cases, from Leonard Deadwyler, a black motorist stopped for speeding to the hospital with his pregnant, then shot dead, to the black football star Ron Settles, who was murdered by the police in an apparent attempt to make his death look like a suicide.

He shows that it takes time and patience if one wants to become successful in like and that is exactly what he has done. I didn't think that his writing style was going to be that great but it wasn't half bad. Another thing I loved about &quot;Journey to Justice&quot; is that he recognizes key people in history and key events. That keeps one involved in the story.

Why read a book if you've formed an opinion already? You're apparently seeking vindication for your prejudices, not information or knowledge. I suspect there are more nefarious, more personal, not-so-healthy reasons.Whatever you feel about the O.J. trial, you must acknowledge Johnnie Cochran's excellence, his perserverance, and his professionalism.

Tragically, his defense of O.J. Simpson was as unethical and morally reprehensible as could be and thus his legacy is a mixed one at best. Christopher Darden said (in his book \\"In Contempt\\") that he had long considered Cochran both a mentor and role model but that his actions during the \\"Trial of The Century\\" undermined and shattered his (Darden's) respect and admiration for him (Cochran).

Some parts of this book tread through very sensitive areas of relationships between the public and those hired to &quot;protect and serve. Much of that revealed will prove hard for some, but in the end will both educate and mature the reader.A highly recommended book for anyone curious about Johnnie Cochran, his credentials, life and thoughts."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"This is a great book by Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., the lawyer who headed OJ Simpson's Dream Team and won his acquittal. It is more or less his autobiography, but it all leads up to the aptly named \\"Trial of the Century\\" as its exciting climax. From humble beginnings in Shreveport, Louisiana Johnnie's family moves to Los Angeles where through hard work and education he becomes a successful lawyer. Cochran is a marvelous story teller, and he, along with writing partner Tim Rutten, kept me turning the pages throughout, anxious to find out what was going to happen next. The portrait emerged of an intelligent and religious man who was a tireless advocate for the people of his community. It was quite at odds with the image I had prior to reading his book; that was closer to the parody of him--the fictional character Jackie Chiles, portrayed by actor Phil Morris on Seinfeld.I still think that OJ did it and find it hard to believe that Cochran really thought that OJ was innocent, but it was fascinating reading about the trial from his point-of-view nonetheless. Also, there are many interesting cases that happened before the American Othello, and I enjoyed reading the first part of the book just as much as the latter. Cochran was right in the thick of things, and he worked as a prosecutor for the City of Los Angeles, and as a defense lawyer during the struggle for civil rights. The Watts Riot, the riot that followed the Rodney King verdict, and many other chapters in our Nation's history were witnessed by him, and he participated in many of the trials that followed. His clients included Michael Jackson and Lenny Bruce, as well as the Black Panther leader Geronimo Pratt, and many others. Cochran presents a very convincing case that Pratt was framed by the FBI--better even than his OJ defense--nevertheless, Pratt remains in jail, while OJ... well, OJ is in jail now, too.The Bottom Line is that I recommend Journey to Justice for all those who enjoy riveting court drama and those who seek to understand the tumultuous times lived through and affected by Johnnie L.

PersonalyI would rather get to the subject."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"I just noticed my copy of this book in my library and decided to write a belated review.This book has nothing to do with OJ, it was merely the publicity around OJ that made a bestseller possible for Cochran.Regardless of how you feel about him, it is impossible to come away from this look into the treatment of minorities in LA without a new perspective.Whenever a person of color is stopped at a red light in a surburban town just because he is in the wrong place at the right time, Cochran's themes resonate.Watching the news in the last few days, the indiscriminate beatings at the hands of professionals who are trained in the art of restraint makes Cochran's book a must read for anyone whose interest in our country runs beyond blaring country music promoting revenge against foreign enemies.Some of the enemies are right here."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"I was absorbed with the Simpson case from the moment O.J returned to Los Angeles to answer charges of his guilt. I am not among the confused group of muddle-headed O.J. supporters who claim, &quot;The truth may never be known.&quot; Of course the truth may be known, but only to those who can seriously digest evidence, separate forensic facts from smoke and mirrors, and draw logical conclusions based solely on the hard issues. I found it interesting how LITTLE Cochran wrote about the case itself. He splatters a lot of &quot;guilty paint&quot; on a lot of unnamed, alleged &quot;co-conspirators&quot; but he never addressed the actual evidence. Nowhere does he attempt to make the ridiculous claim that he knows who did it. He already knows who did--he worked for him. And who can blame him. Cochran would rather go outside at noon and stare at the sun than look at the actual evidence in this case. If he started discuss possible explanations for blood DNA, OJ's confusing alibis, OJ's attempted freeway getaway, and OJ's failure to explain his cuts, then he would look like a fool. So instead he gets off the subject of evidence and talks of vast anti-black agendas on the part of the LAPD. If you don't like the message (OJ's murder evidence) then attack the messenger (LAPD.) Sadly however this does not wash with educated readers. Only those convinced they are 'victims' of The System buy his nonsense. Cochran is not a hero, nor is he a role model. He is just a guy who tells angry minorities what they want to hear: Don't try to live within the law because the system's stacked against you; Don't trust the police because they are all racist; Don't believe anything the police tell you because they're all out to get you, (however he conviently never explains WHY they are out to get African-Americans or what they stand to gain by the vast conspiracy.) As long as there are Johnnie Cochrans out there, minorities will be able to continue blaming the police for all their problems. And the cycle of victimization rolls on."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"If you want to read a book by one of the most self-absorbed, shamelessly self-promoting, egotistical one-note &quot;johnnie&quot;s ever, this book is for you. Less about the Simpson case than about how wonderful and godlike Johnnie Cochran is in the eyes of Johnnie Cochran, I could not force myself to read past the first hundred pages. Such delusions of grandeur! And such an unjustifiably huge ego!"},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"The main topic, justice, is a good one, but I rated this low because Cochran rambled on and on about his personal history into excrutiatingly needless detail (his youth, marriages, divorce, rolls royce, nice house in the hills, condo for his mother overlooking the beach, etc) and he did it in a manner that resembled a eulogy...everything that he and his family ever did was wonderful. About the divorce, he even heaped the blame on his ex-wife without taking any blame. He just painted her as a gready, money grubber. And what value did this add to the book? Nothing. It was just one of many irrelevant items of what I considered a life travelogue, a view which was compounded by all the pictures of his family.Throughout, he continually descibed the LAPD as a bunch of thugs that only changed when Cochran forced them to convert. Perhaps some of them were, but to paint the whole department so negatively detracted from Cochran's credibility. Surely he must have seen some good things done by the LAPD during all those years, but he didn't relate those and istead made them out to be all demons from hell. He didn't give them credit for working in a very tough and dangerous environment.Apart from that, the fact that racism and injustices occur all the time is true and I admire anyone who fights for truth and justice and equality as Cochran did. In that effort, I think Cochran deserves a great deal of credit as an attorney. On that point, I found the interesting parts of the book were the numerous court cases he took and how he described in detail of where the police overstepped their bounds and caused a great deal of suffering. It was heartbreaking to read of so many people's lives shattered needlessly.But like many attorney's, he had his share of what some people view as the wrong side, such as the OJ case, and so he'll be hated by some. It's the nature of the business, like police work.One of the ironies I noted was how he described working to improve LAPD responsiveness in domestic violence cases. He said that after he left the DA's office, a collegue of his brought him a pamphlet that the LAPD started handing out to women who were the victims of domestic violence. Cochran was proud of his efforts at attempting to reduce domestic violence, he says. But ironically, the case that he is most famous for was a domestic violence case and he took the side of the abuser.After a couple of hundred pages, I got tired of reading about his personal life and put the book down."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"This was the book that started me off on OJ-iana.

And, more than Chris's book, or Marcia's book, or Bugliosi's book, or the &quot;friend's&quot; dad's book, what I remember is the ex-wife's book. I thought she did a great job with what seemed to be a tawdry premise. Her modest little book ought to be sold as a companion volume to Johnnie's vanity printing."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"Any African-American who has had a run-on with police officers in the United States will appreciate this book.

He is analytical and he is needed in America......especially the America that allows African-Americans to be choked to death."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"Johnnie Cochran is, simply, an appalling human being. He represents the worst type of person society in this day and age has to offer. He knew his &quot;race card&quot; would singlehandedly help change perceptions of black and white relations with each other and with the police for the WORSE, and he smilingly played it. Quite possibly, he helped take race relations in this country a step back. I find it impossible to have an ounce of respect for him."},{"Title":"Journey to Justice","review":"The only thing this clown is famous for is busting out with a clever rhyme that convinced 12 of the dumbest people in the world to 'acquit' a known killer.

I don't care what Johnnie's past is or how he has helped minorities receive justice for the undoubted cruelties and prejudices they have had to endure, because his defense of OJ Simpson in the so-called trial of the century was immoral and unethical. Race was not and should never have been an issue in the Simpson case, because it was not a racially motivated crime. The only way in which race factored in this case was that Simpson, a black man, murdered two unfortunate white people. It's totally laughable, isn't it, that with all the money Simpson was paying these lawyers (or should I say liars) the defense couldn't refute the highly incriminating scientific evidence, instead they had to resort to ridiculous theories of frame ups and conspiracies. I wonder if Cochran actually believes the drivel that he spouted with all the fire and brimstone of a Southern Baptist preacher? I also read an article recently in which he displayed sympathy for Bill Cosby upon the murder of his son. How compassionate of him, since he couldn't have cared less about Lou Brown or Fred Goldman and their families. It's a pity that I borrowed this book from the library, for it's winter here now and it would make such great fodder for a fire. The Goldman family's opinion of Johnnie Cochran is the most salient, and in my mind, the most accurate."},{"Title":"Training Exercises for Competitive Tennis","review":"Another German tennis manual but highly practical and easy to apply on court. Drills are classified into singles (20), doubles (10), team (31) and fitness (11)categories.But then some will question - Is this another of those predictable run-yourself-crazy drillbooks that's guaranteed to give you intensive/extensive breath shortages with hardly any demands of your creative domains?The book stands out for most of its use of simple language, particularly from pages 18-175. It stands out because the author has taken special pains to share much of his coaching and playing experience through illustrating very clearly the specific aims of each basic or complex exercise.There are numerous iconic diagrams to explain the sometimes confusing abbreviations generously sprinkled throughout. Most importantly, technical drills are not interwoven too much with fitness/movement drills such that early fatique comes on to interfere with skill absorption - as is the case with the old drills. The main drills also contain at least 3-4 variations to the theme.I have found that these drills have greatly improved the strategical and tactical awareness of my younger players when they are in tight situations - a far cry from a previously simplistic let's-outslug-each-other approach. However, I have found that introducing no more than 2-3 new drills at each training session will suffice for optimal inculcation.I must confess that in the process of drilling my students I have also imbibed mentally quite a bit of the strategical objectives of these drills. The action has made me more adept at recognising my tennis mistakes and devising remedies for my personal game.My complain(s)is the small print and book format makes reference to it on court quite difficult. Can the author/publisher think about a larger format of print with also colour?"},{"Title":"Bipolar Puzzle Solution: A Mental Health Client's Perspective (Psychological Disorders Series , No 1)","review":"From someone who lived with a spouse diagnosed with bipolar disorder, this is the best information that I have found to date on this subject.

It is presented in question and answer format, and offers basic advice, therapy almost, on how to live with manic-depressive illness. It covers the everyday problems, such as how to deal with diet and food additives, exercise, drug use and abuse, that may affect one's moods.It also talks about what to do when feeling &quot;down&quot;, how to handle possible daily mood fluctuations, how to be, make and keep friends, sexual difficulties due to medications and how to keep ignorant people and their thoughtless remarks about your &quot;craziness&quot; from getting you down. In short, this book has much advice for staying healthy, as a book about diabetes and well-being would have advice about that illness.What surprises me is that I'm the first to review this book, and I have not yet seen it on any of sites devoted to bipolar disorder. Perhaps there is too much space devoted to the &quot;memoirs&quot; of so-called celebrities, that people have forgotten that bipolar disorder is not a glamorous disease suffered only by beautiful, elegant, brilliant people. It is a harrowing disease that wrecks the lives of many smart people just trying to make a living and enjoy life. It has quotidian (everyday) implications such as mood fluctuations that subject their sufferers to a skewed vision of the world and the people in it, and diet, exercise and sleep problems that can throw a person into a serious episode.This book has a religious component; those who don't adhere can skip those questions and go onto the other things, because there is much of value here for everyone!I think this book should be in every public and medical library!"},{"Title":"Bipolar Puzzle Solution: A Mental Health Client's Perspective (Psychological Disorders Series , No 1)","review":"There are two things that potential readers need to be aware of. First, that the author has been diagnosed as Bipolar II. There is a difference between I and II, so if you happen to be Bipolar I, do not expect to read about the extremes that you may experience. Second, this author comes from a Christian perspective. This is great if you happen to be a Christian; otherwise, you might find his references to God/He/Jesus rather annoying.

I like to get my information from a variety of sources however, so I think this book is a worthy addition to any small library on bipolar disorder, even though it doesn't provide the level of detail or expertise that the other two books bring to the table.

All of the questions that were asked in one particular bipolar support group were written down, with answers, and published in this book. The author is a bipolar II patient and his answers have been reviewed by his psychiatrist. The questions cover a wider range of topics than is found in other handbooks for bipolar patients however the question and answer format limits the depth of each of the answers to typically a few paragraphs. The author's personal struggle with the disorder comes through clearly. However, the author's experience is with the bipolar II form of the disorder and I felt that aspects of the disorder unique to bipolar I were missing.

You read that correctly, by the way---I recovered from a DIAGNOSIS of &quot;manic depression,&quot; and everything that went along with it---the psychiatrists, the &quot;concerned&quot; family members, the drugs, the hospitalizations---all of it.We are all individual human beings, and each of us has a particular outlook and way of behaving toward others and toward the world. If one's outlook and one's behaviors and responses toward others and toward the world are troublesome or dangerous to ourselves or to others, then one needs to be made aware of what is wrong, and one needs to be helped to change those things, not given a permanent drug prescription.There are therapists who are skilled at giving such help, which can lead to recovery. Unfortunately, what happens far more often than not is that a psychiatrist sells one a permanent &quot;diagnosis,&quot; along with the permanent drug, or drugs, that &quot;matches&quot; the diagnosis, and no further progress is ever made toward recovery.Allow me to point out to the authors of &quot;Bipolar Puzzle Solution&quot; that lithium, the main drug used for manic depression, is positively toxic, and toxic overdoses, which can be fatal, regularly occur. I myself experienced such an episode. For two weeks I was semi-comatose in the hospital, and I remmember nothing about that period of time. After that episode, Tegratol was substituted for the lithium, and it had the side effect of permanently lowering my blood platelet count. Also, because regular anti-depressants did not help when I was depressed, I was given MAO Inhibitors. I found out later that over the long term, they can permanently alter brain chemistry, leaving one permanently dependent on them.Drugs may have their place in the treatment of &quot;manic depression&quot; or &quot;bipolar disorder,&quot; but they are not &quot;the key.&quot; The key lies in getting into therapy with a therapist or counselor who can help one recognize and change one's troublesome behaviors.For example, a psychiatrist I was seeing told me I had &quot;a problem with rage,&quot; and that because that was &quot;a part of my makeup,&quot; I would &quot;always have a problem with rage.&quot; When I left that psychiatrist, and began seeing a &quot;mere&quot; and very gifted social worker, she lost no time in showing me that I ALWAYS had A CHOICE about whether or not to get into a rage, and she taught me that I am responsible for, and have control over, my feelings and actions.Today I am no longer someone who lives in fear of my feelings, &quot;moods&quot; and actions. I no longer have to swallow drugs to &quot;keep myself under control.&quot; I no longer need any psychiatrist to give me his opinion about my sanity. I am instead a free, well and responsible individual.It took a lot of work and determination, but it was unquestionably worth it! &quot;The key&quot; is not medication; the key is learning about and changing one's behavior and one's outlook."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"This was Porter's second work, a gothic romance that was preceded only by a children's story. A very popular early effort in the historical novel genre (first issued in 1803 and still in print), it is set in Poland in the 1790s and tells of a Polish exile and the failed struggle for independence. The novel drew on eye-witness accounts from Polish refugees and was lauded by the Polish patriot Kosciusko, an acquaintance of the author's brother, Robert. Porter (1776-1850) is best remembered for her later book, The Scottish Chiefs (1810), a work based on the life of Scotch patriot William Wallace. She was the sister of novelist Anna Maria Porter, friend of Hannah More, and others. Amazingly enough for a work first written 200 hundred years ago, Thaddeus of Warsaw reads quite well, and the characters are quite sympathetic, although men cry a bit more than in similar modern day novels."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

Read it on a Kindle because you are going to need a dictionary handy because you are oging to need it - their vocabulary in those days was WAY bigger than ours today. There are many words in this book that I have never even heard of before. Critically speaking the author uses 100 words when 10 would do nicely. It's one of the best \\"stories\\" I have read, only surpassed by her other book written some time later called \\"The Scottish Chiefs\\", which was a truly incredible story based on William Wallace life.

I keep reading it over and over again!"},{"Title":"Churches That Make a Difference: Reaching Your Community with Good News and Good Works","review":"Ronald Sider has done it again. That is, he has left many of us who may not be fully engaged in significant social ministries in our communities, feeling a little less \\"holistic\\". Now this statement should not be mistaken for a criticism, but rather as an honest sigh or moan on the part of this pastor, and I suspect many others who far too often are ensnared in the traditional model of doing church. As I read \\"Churches That Make a Difference\\", I was impressed with the scholarship of this new resource. It attempts to bridge that age-old gap between evangelism (in the traditional context), and social action. The book is based upon a significant research undertaking conducted by Sider and his two colleagues, Heidi Unruh and Philip Olson. The research project sponsored by Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary examined the relationship between evangelism and social action in fifteen protestant churches in the greater Philadelphia area, and involved over 2,000 respondents.What I appreciate about this book is that it is well researched biblically, theologically, and scientifically. The authors are not novices, and this is not popularist fluff. The book gives generous examples throughout of churches bringing balance to an issue that for years has divided believers and reduced the effectiveness of many Christian churches. The reader is given a glimpse into success stories of \\"holistic\\" ministry, and testimonies of hope and assistance. I believe that many 21st century churches desire to reach out to the world outside of their walls, but they may not know how to respond to this call to do so. Traditional models of evangelism which the church utilized well into the late 20th century seem unfortunately inadequate in a 21st century Postmodern culture and context.To paraphrase their description of how this can happen, a \\"holistic\\" church is an exciting, exuberantly alive place in which the active presence of the Spirit can be felt; where renewal, growth, and transformation take place, and by which the church is a change agent in the community. It has a spiritual dynamic about it which causes it to be sacrificially caring, boldly prophetic, and lovingly nurturing. This holistic church understands its mission, possesses a dynamic spirituality, is healthy, and practices what it preaches.For Sider, the Christian church must recover her mandate embedded deeply in Jesus' command to \\"love God and love your neighbour as yourself\\". Sider and his associates emphasize that individual churches must find new and innovative ways to connect people with Christ. They stress that diversity in ministry based upon community needs, and employing the spiritual gifts and resources of the members, which are influenced by the vision and calling of the church is holistic. Holistic ministry in fact is well defined when a church: 1. Focuses on ministries of personal spiritual transformation as a path to social change; 2. Focuses on social services ministries as a door to evangelism; 3. Focuses on ministries of reconciliation that witness to unity in Christ; 4. Focuses on community development to express God's love for whole persons and communities; 5. Focuses on justice ministries that embody the empowering message of the gospel; 6. Focuses on reaching skeptics by demonstrating that the church can and does make a difference in society.The bottom line for these advocates of holistc ministry--:\\"Reaching Your Community with Good News and Good Works\\", is that \\"any church can become a centre of healing, hope, and shalom in its community...any church---including your church---can make a difference by serving the kingdom and witnessing to Christ the King.\\" Who among us would not agree? This book is a must read toolbox for churches and leaders seeking to do just that, \\"make a difference\\" in their community and world, as Christ's hands and feet, His mouth and heart, His life incarnate among a broken and bleeding human race.Dr. R. Wayne HagermanSenior PastorFirst Baptist Church,Prince George, BC.Canada"},{"Title":"Churches That Make a Difference: Reaching Your Community with Good News and Good Works","review":"Churches That Make A Difference has clearly been a popular Christian book, now having reached its third printing. The subtitle, \\"Reaching Your Community with Good News and Good Works\\", suggests the subject matter, namely - how to bring together Good News and Good Works in the Church. The book's great strength is that the content is based on fifteen \\"in-depth case studies\\" of Churches in the greater Philadelphia area. That is, it has its feet planted in reality. Among its weakness, in my view, are its \\"makeshift\\" theology - not because the authors espouse any theology in particular, but because the theology is not particularly well thought through, tending to fray especially in the details.The authors point out that \\"evangelism rarely happens by osmosis\\". \\"Loving acts need the complement of the verbal presentation of Christ's life, death, and resurrection. If people don't ask, and Christians never tell, how will anyone ever know the gospel?\\" That is, the gospel should always be presented clearly. On the other hand, however, \\"proclamation alone may ring hollow\\". The authors refer a great deal to \\"holistic ministry\\". This is ministry where \\"evangelism and social action are distinguishable but inseparable\\". Holistic ministry is \\"based on the understanding that the physical, spiritual, moral, and relational dimensions of human nature are intertwined. Churches of this type encourage faith commitments in the context of social activism\\". The book describes five classic models of social ministry in evangelical Churches today, as well as the option of forming coalitions or partnerships in social ministry.However, I sensed a void at the centre of the book, which has to do with the American \\"can do\\" attitude. In fact the concluding chapter is titled: \\"We Can Do It\\". The authors would seem to suggest that the solution to social ills is just a matter of \\"reaching your community with the whole gospel for the whole person\\". However, it needs to be borne in mind that, in some parts of the world, it is a case of \\"NO can do\\". In fact, in many parts of the world, the general situation is rapidly regressing, and there seems to be little hope of assistance from outside. What sustains people in such situations? What should sustain people over five years - even a year - of grievous want or oppression? It may not be enough to offer that \\"God's salvation includes [...] material prosperity, justice,\\" or that He \\"promises to renew the earth\\"."},{"Title":"Churches That Make a Difference: Reaching Your Community with Good News and Good Works","review":"Best line in the book: \\"If its not there, everyone will know its missing.\\" The book makes a strong case for more attention to social activity in advancing the gospel. Its a call for balance between word and deed. Each one depends on the other or there is a lack of balance; a church's ministry is not \\"holistic.\\" Caring for the community shows that church is genuine. I sense the authors want to work on the Christian image to cure, what they perceive, as an unchristian attitude towards unbelievers. Many times the authors use examples and even statistics to support the assertion that many unbelievers are just put off by insensitive presentations that are void of compassion. I had to chuckle when they stated, \\"For every new believer transformed by the liberating Good News of Christ, others have been turned off by offensive soul wining strategies.\\" This is obviously true and many have seen over zealous believers turn away unbelievers who where lambasted with the truth. Such passion for the truth must be tempered by love or unbelievers will think Christians just want to win an ideology war.The authors may take their point a little too far however. A recent survey is quoted (pg. 64) demonstrating that 44% of non-Christians came away with a negative impression after an encounter with a believer (Christian Smith?). Only 44%? I would think even if the gospel were presented in the most compassionate way possible, you could not escape offending a higher percentage. Much of the problem I see in today's churches is the gospel is so watered down it wouldn't offend anybody. The true gospel by nature is offensive and certainly it will not matter how many programs your church performs, the truth remains. The gospel is offensive to human pride. Paul was not exactly the most popular person in Athens or Ephesus! Jesus' popularity was suffering badly also, after all, they did release a criminal and condemned him to torture. I guess the masses forgot about how compassionate he was the past three years. Since Jesus is portrayed as our example to follow in exercising compassion, why aren't more unbelievers trying to kill me? I cannot help but wonder if Jesus would of scored lower than 44%. Probably not. All in all, the book is very good, well researched!!..easy to follow and very thought provoking. It's balanced too, no wishy-washy social gospel junk.

Sir Bobby is not yet done, though his days in the limelight are certainly past, this book captures many of the times, and goals, and games, that led to establishment of one of the games most brilliant and well respected managers. Watching Sir Alex Ferguson, the Manchester United Manager, chew his gum and spit it into his right hand just a second before he shakes your hands, shows the vast difference between the two men. Both are brilliant football/soccer tacticians but only Sir Bobby is a gentleman. One of the last. An eye watering journey down memory lane. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Bobby Robson","review":"You might think it would be hard for a former manager of the England soccer team (and a good one at that), a former England player as well as one of the best club managers of his generation to produce a boring book about his exploits, but Bobby Robson has done just that. This has all the hallmarks of a work which was slapped down onto paper with no planning at all. We jerk around from his playing career (we never learn how he became a player) to management of Ipswich, then a backwater club in England. He wins a major European soccer title (something little short of astonishing) but gives us no idea how he did it, how he managed to inspire a collection of largely obscure players to great heights. Instead we have a boring list of \\"We beat this side, and then that side, and then another side\\" and before we know it he's in Holland, then Spain and then a chapter later he's back in England, always whining on about money. The man must be a millionaire many times over but we're treated to endless paragraphs about how he fought for the money he felt he was entitled to. In short, this is an awful book."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I read Ghosts Have I been about 2 years ago, but I recently thought of it and what a great book it was.

I believe that people of all ages would enjoy reading this novel"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"This was the first novel by Mr.Peck that I have ever had the honor to read, and probably my most favored out of all of his many novels. I have probably read all of his books, except for his new one Strays Like Us. I'm positively sure it will be excillent, but I'd find it hard to believe if somebody told me it was better than Ghosts I Have Been."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I think that this is a very good book to pick. I give it only four stars because it goes on about some things. My favorite parts are when Blossom goes on the Titanic and when Blossom and Alexander go to the Chamber Of Horrors in Madam Tussaud's museum. But, I don't like the fact that they focused a lot of chapters on one thing. I recommend this book greatly."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"This book was very strange. In some chapters it jumped around alot and was kind of boring. It also had a lot of events witch made the book confusing. The book was okay but wasn't the best one I've ever read."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"Like many another reviewer, I'm 30ish now but still go back to reread this wonderful book periodically, in part because it is so mature and intelligent, and in part because it never dumbs things down for young readers; while it incorporates big laughs and genuine chills, it is also an engrossing and moving portrait of a spunky and self-reliant young woman who discovers her own psychic powers (a truly mixed blessing). The first-person narration is some of the most skillful I've ever encountered: with her wry humor, clear-eyed honesty, and pluck, Blossom is convincing and engaging in every word she says. Readers (of any age) who enjoy this book should definitely go back to read its predecessor, The Ghost Belonged to Me, which offers a similar mix of laughs and goosebumps, as well as an equally vivid period setting, but lacks the gritty charm of Blossom as narrator. This is one of the books that helped form my taste for intelligent ghost stories with the flavor of another era, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"Fourteen year old Blossom Culp lives in a small town in 1913 with her eccentric mother and a penchant for getting into troubles and adventures. When she discovers that she has a sixth sense, Blossom uses her gift to help a few local citizens and things proceed merrily until she has a crushing vision of the sinking of the Titanic a year earlier. Fame and fortune brought on by the revelation of this vision bring many changes to Blossom's life, not the least of which is a change in her relationship with her friend,Alexander Armsworth. Peck makes this story so much more than a ghost tale; it's a delightful romp through the paranormal in a more innocent time period. Peck never fails to amuse and often makes the reader laugh out loud over Blossom and her antics. This is recommended for kids of all ages."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"Let me start by saying that this is a VERY unusual book. To some, this kind of unusual could be bad, but to me, it is good. I really cannot compare it to anything that I have ever read before, because it is SO different. To be incisive, it is a great book. The story is about a 14-year-old girl named Blossom Culp, going about her everyday life until a certain cataclysm brings her world, and another's, sinking down. Blossom is a hilarious character with spunky quirks and a strong cleverness that makes the whole story captivating. By the end of the book, I felt like I knew Blossom. I really liked her attitude and the way that she handled certain situations. The horrible event that I mentioned brings her into a tragic happening of the recent past that a restless soul will not let go. One day she finds out that she has the Gift of the Second Sight. This sudden discovery links her fate with the ghost of a young boy who life was sunk, literally. Once the destinies of the two met, both the living one and the dead, they would be changed forever. The boy causes her to worry a great deal about the purpose of her visions of him, and later, something even bigger. She then surprises the world by making a huge break-through to the Other Side, which attracts a lot of publicity. Through all of this her life stays relatively normal. Her mother is still a spooky, dark-eyed fortune-teller, her friend Alexander is still a smug and supposed \\"gang-member,\\" and everyone in her town is still sure of how eccentric she is. She has a perpetual connection with all things ghostly, whether it's foiling a fake spirit or getting in touch with a real one. This is an excellent book; its humor, intense theme, and deep concepts are all outstanding. I would reccomend this book for girls ages 10-15 so that they can relate to Blossom. This is definitely one of my favorite books, though very unlike the others. The whole book, each individual event, is dependent on events from the past and future of the story. This book is written by Richard Peck, whose books I have read before, all of which I have enjoyed. He is a truly imaginative, suspenseful, and complex author. I loved this book and hope that you do as well. :-)"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I have read this book many times over the years, starting when I was about 12 or so. I just reread it this last spring (I just turned 30). Richard Peck is eternal, and this story is one that keeps one riveted and entertained throughout. Never a boring moment, and it is easy to get caught up in the intricate plot line. An original quirk to the Titanic tragedy as well. I recommend this book highly to young adults and adults...a good book to read together with children!"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I read this book many years ago and began searching for it on amazon without knowing the author or title of the book. I was simply going on what I remembered from Blossom's episodes on the Titanic. Luckily I found it and reread it and I am so glad I did. Obviously this book had impacted my life- I remembered it over 10 years after I had read it! Thank you amazon and to kids out there, this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I think this book is a great book because it is adventures and diffrent from all the books I have read.The reason why its diffrent is because its about a girl who has a gift of second sight and I find it very interesting when it tells about the things she sees and how she uses her gift. So if your into fantasys and mystery I would recondmend you to read this book because its a book I think you would like it!!!"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"The novel, 'Ghosts I Have Been', is a suspensful, compassionate story. The main character, Blossom Culp, discovers she has the ability to see ghosts, and to view past events. This power is fun until she sees something terrible. Blossom finds herself in a room on the doomed Titanic as it is sinking. What she sees will be an international controversy, and open a pandora's box.

Although not scary these days, it was well worth my efforts to track it down."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I'm so surprised to find out that I'm not alone in my love for young adult novels dealing with paranormal phenomena. So far, I haven't found any adult novels that deal with the paranormal as well as Lois Duncan and Richard Peck- I wish I could! The Blossom Culp books are some of my all-time favorites. I think I was 9 or 10 when I first read Ghosts I Have Been (I'm 24 now) &amp; I still need to re-read it from time to time. This book inspired a fascination with the Titanic that may lead to a book of my own someday."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I first read this book when I was 9 years old, I have often thought of the Blossom Culp character since then.

In fact, it gave me a fascination with the Titanic that resurfaced (oops, pardon the pun) this year when I went to the Titanic exhibit here in Memphis, and when I saw the new movie with Leonardo DiCaprio. Both of those things made me want to read Peck's book again! I highly recommend it for kids with healthy imaginations, as well as any adult who remembers being a kid with a healthy imagination.

It is a horrible novel, with flimsy characterization, impenetrable turn-of-the-century Midwestern slang and a plot that moved so slowly whole civilizations rose and fell. Some writers can do beautiful things with the English language. Richard Peck isn't one of them."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"The Gift of Second Sight is nothing new to young Blossom Culp, as it is a gift that has been passed down amoungst the women of her family for years. Her own mother is one to have been blessed with this particular gift. Blossom herself doesn't believe she could possibly be gifted like her mother, as people with gifts such as these come in hand with good looks and a good meal.Blossom decides that she must stand against the local gangster boys from tipping out houses, by scaring them witless with her ghostly costume. She doesn't give her name away, but she does give the name of another young girl, Letty, in her own class. Letty gets attacked the next day at school by one of the young gangsters and, feeling guilty Blossom finds herself defending the poor girl.To show her appreciation, Letty's mother invites Blossom to their house to spend time with Letty and her band of friends, The Sunny Thoughts and Busy Fingers girls, as they call themselves. Letty doesn't appreciate what Blossom has done, and neither do the other girls, so they make Blossom tell them a scary story. She tells them about an encounter her own mother had with her gift of second sight, only for them to tell her she's nothing but a liar. Before Blossom can even think, she tells them that she herself has the gift.Blossom must prove to them that she isn't lying, and so she begins to tell them that two of such girls will be punished the following day for cheating. They believe her, because they know they have cheated, so she is in the clear. To make things more believable, her own true gift shines through and she foretells an actual event that will stir the whole town. She will soon become a celebrity for her gift of second sight.This book was recommended to me by a friend from work. I didn't think I would enjoy it, but I suppose he knew more about myself than I did. This story was truly captivating, and at points even gave me goosebumps. It was also a nice quick read, only lasting a mere three hours total of reading time. This book was originally published in 1977, and it shows in the way that it is written. The author, Richard Peck, has written many books including, Are You In The House Alone?, Dreamland Lake, and The Ghost Belonged To Me. This is the first of Richard Peck's books that I have encountered, and I look forward to reading more of them in the future."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I read this book by accident, just like many others I've fallen in love with. Anyone interested in worlds beyond should read this."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"As some of the others, I read this book when I was about 8 or 9 and I can vividly remember so much that I have been in search for years of the title. I knew the author but I couldn't remember the Title--I would suggest this book to any young person who likes to read, it will stimulate the imagination as well as spark a love for reading."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"Harry Potter fans will love this book and its three companions, The Ghost Belonged to Me, The Dreadful Future of Blossom Culp, and Blossom Culp and the Sleep of Death. They are about two young teenagers, Blossom Culp and Alexander Armsworth, with extraordinary psychic abilities. The books are by turns funny and scary with hints of romance along the way. Buy the series; it's a sure-fire hit!"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I may be 49 years old but I still loved this book. The writing is great, the story has some great laughs and Blossom Culp is a girl I'd love to meet. A hit with my 20 year old daughter and 16 year old son, too."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"How do I sum up my feelings about this book? Quite a few other reviewers have described it as a \\"classic\\". I read this with great expectations, but was struggling to keep my eyes open throughout. A classic children or young adult book would be in my opinion, a book that can be read and enjoyed by all ages, such as the Narnia books by C.S. Lewis.I won't go into details about the storyline, as those who have read and reviewed it already will have done that. What I will say about the blurb is that it is very misleading. To quote: \\"She actually does have ESP, and what she sees in the future is far from funny - the sinking of the Titanic.\\" That to me says that the tragedy is still to happen yet the book is set in 1914. And the Titanic tragedy is not even the big event in the book, there are a lot of other pretty boring events until the Titanic visions start.The characters are eccentric and highly unlikeable, Blossom being the worst. Sybil was the best character I thought, but then she doesn't appear in the story that much. And the ending is rushed, obviously leading up to the third book, The Dreadful Future of Blossom Culp. I won't be reading the first or the third books.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I feel like I've wasted valuable reading time with this, even though it only took me two days."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I read this as a kid. But don't get me wrong, it's a great read for an adult too! I bought it after all these years because I remembered it being such a good book. I'd forgotten about most of the plot and found myself enjoying it this time as much as before. Got me thinking about the idea of parallel universe and such. Like how do ghosts see us if we are in their time, do we look like ghosts to them like they do in our time? Etc. It's a great fiction story so keep an open mind and you'll love it! This is one of few books that stayed with me for 25 years!"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"This book is an all time favorite for my family. My daughter loved it when she was in the fifth grade and has reread it several times as an adult. We both read the sequels as well, and found them to be most intriguing. We could have read stories about Blossom Culp indefinitely. Richard Peck is an awesome writer, and we have read many of his novels, but this series is our favorite."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"Although technically not a sequel toThe Ghost Belonged to Me, GHOSTS I HAVE BEEN has enough elements in it to tie the two together.Blossom Culp (who was the co-star in \\"The Ghost Belonged To Me\\"), a teenage outcast who is very poor and has an odd mother that should be arrested for child neglect, is the one who tells the story this time around. Anyway, Blossom pretends to have the gift of psychic powers and before you know it, it comes true. She ends up becoming a local celebrity after communicating with the dead and helping them find their resting place, which catches the eye of the Queen Of England who then invites Blossom for a visit. She's able to make the trip with the help of a rich and eccentric old woman and Alexander tags along.Here's another exciting tale from author Richard Peck that includes ghosts, con-artists, and historical events--all the while taking place in the early 1900s--that should keep kids of all ages glued to the book to the very end. I enjoyed the adventure to England, the trance that takes Blossom back to the sinking of the Titanic, and the funny and ironic observations that she makes about people and life.If you enjoy reading children's books or are looking for some that are exciting but not too scary for the kids, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"This book was the first ghost story I had ever read, and it definitely made a good first impression! The setting and time were perfect for the story line. I loved how I felt like I was watching what was going on, instead of just reading about it. I didn't connect to the characters in this book as much as I do in other books, but all the characters were unique and very interesting. The book was highly unpredictable and not scary at all. It was fun to read and I loved how Peck tied the Titanic into the story. I don't have much critisism for this book, mostly comments and praise. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys ghost stories, richard peck novels, or titanic stories."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"This is a wonderful \\"almost ghost\\" story for kids - because it is partly funny and ends well. It is better for adults because it \\"remembers\\" childhood scenes of those who have and those who have not and good things happening to those who deserve it. The most amazing thing of all about the book is that it is written by a \\"man\\". The main character is a young female but the male writer seems to be able to function and think as a young woman. This is an all 'round good book for everyone."},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"I read this book when I was in my early teans and again when I was in my early 20\`s...It is a book I intend to read again. This book tells the story of the sinking of the titanic from the eyes of a scared little boy who was traveling in first class, but was abandoned by his selfish parents. It is the story of a lost soul and a girl who has an uncanny ability to talk with the dead...It is a real page turner, and young people will learn as well as be entertained...I highly recomend it for all ages!"},{"Title":"Ghosts I Have Been","review":"One of the best books I have ever read.

In the fast paced world of integrative medicine, some info seems a little dated."},{"Title":"A Stochastic Control Framework for Real Options in Strategic Valuation","review":"Vollert's book contains many great insights, but most readers will find this very tough going, indeed. The strength of this book is its rigorous taxonomy of real options and stochastic processes, extensive bibliography, and criticism of naive DCF models. However, the reader will need extensive mathematical background and already understand much of what is contained here.Motivated and mathematically able readers may want to consider Dixit and Pindyck's classic Investment Under Uncertainty, or a recent compendium like that of Smit and Trigerois. Those interested in a less intensive, but still rigorous, overview should consider Anderson's Business Economics and Finance [my book]. Those interested in just applying some real options analysis could choose from many books, including the Mun book. Note that many of these, however, are full of black-box thinking that can result in ridiculous results. Vollert's book, while difficult, at least avoids this error."},{"Title":"Behavioral Statistics in Action","review":"I sure as heck never had before. I am dyslexic, math phobic, and a graduate student in Psych who must take 1 full year of advanced stat. Terrifed of this prospect, I bought this book. It is, without doubt, the best text book, ever. It is funny (to the point of being downright cheeky), laid out exceedingly well, progresses from one idea to another naturally, and explains all these confusing concepts easily. I actually looked forward to reading it in my spare time, and I promise you, I am not a math geek! There simply is not a better Intro to Statistics book out there. Better than cartoon guide, stats for dummies, etc. Save your money and time and go right to the source."},{"Title":"Behavioral Statistics in Action","review":"In my field I must read many research studies dealing with various topics. I've taken research classes and have learned to recognize key statistical concepts but I must admit that I've never fully understood how they work, what they really mean (no pun intended) or how they were derived. Don't get me wrong. I've studied, but most texts were just too advanced right from the start. Now that I've read and worked through the sample questions in this text I finally feel ready to tackle more advanced texts. The language used is clear and concise with clearly presented examples and applications of concepts. The sequencing is well thought out and quite seamless. I highly recommend it for anyone just starting research classes who has had little or no preparation in statistics. However, knowledge of basic algebra is a must. If you haven't had algebra for some time, you may want to brush up a bit."},{"Title":"Behavioral Statistics in Action","review":"When I had no idea what was going on in class (which was 99% of the time), I turned to this book.

She takes you to Scotland in this book and makes you believe that you can really feel the cold wind, and see the mist on the ground. Mhairi and Rowan are characters that you will never forget as they discover a love that makes you smile and sometimes makes your heart ache a little bit.Besides the wonderful storyline, it is also refreshing to have injuries that actually cause the characters pain and a little healing time. However, by far the best part about this novel is the incredible realistic and accurate Scottish history that you learn without even realizing it!! You will really enjoy this tale!"},{"Title":"The Raven's Moon","review":"This is the first book I read of Susan King's and I must say that I'm thrilled with this author's way of story telling that keeps you glued to the tale until the last page.From the first page, you would be gripped by the excitement and suspense and the imminent danger threatening Mhairi, her brother Iain and the hero, Rowan Scott. This is a relentlessly fast paced tale with twists and turns, danger and romance with no frivolity common in other romances.Highly recommended to readers who love a &quot;more&quot; serious kind of romance."},{"Title":"The Raven's Moon","review":"I come from a long line of Scots, Scots who were storytellers. So when I came across this book, it was like coming home. Was not my first King book, read The Black Thorn's Rose before, this book is what really made me a King fan (though I have been disappointed a bit with her Maiden series, like she is losing the &quot;heart&quot;). Mhairi is the lass in a male dominated family. She knows the men are doing wrong when they reive sheep from below the boarders, but also know it's a way of life for the Scots. In comes Rowan, half English- Half Scot went with order of &quot;Fire and Sword&quot; to bring the borderlands unto lawful peace - by negations if possible, by destruction of the Clan in need be.Mhairi has seen visions of his coming, and though she comes to love him, she fears her visions of his death will come true unless he leaves the highlands.King paints the period with vivid detail, and beckons you to follow her into Mhairi and Rowan's fight for love and the survival of Mhairi's family.Just does not get any better than this."},{"Title":"The Raven's Moon","review":"Susan King writes an amazing historical romance!

What I particularly liked was the two chapters on symmetries, which were thorough compared to what i have seen in comparable textbooks. I also found the chapters on nuclear physics quite good, as they gave a very compact presentation of the most important aspects of this subject. The weakest part of the book in my opinion is the chapter on the standard model.If you don't know math and quantum mechanics you shouldn't buy this book as it is somewhat mathematical in style and uses fewer words than many comparable textbooks. Readers who want a historical treatment of the subject matter should look elsewhere too, as this book tells little about the experiments that were instrumental in developing subatomic physics."},{"Title":"Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics","review":"I used this book for my first 400-level course in junior year. I found right off the bat that it is a bit difficult to adjust to, as it will probably be one of your first books with the CGS unit system. This might cause miscommunication with the author and reader- for example, q*(r)^-2 is the electric field, but it will seem to be missing the constants of nature in front. While this is a well-known example of CGS use, some other formulas have an enigmatic nature because of these features. Also, many topics are covered but quickly given up as enigmatic features because little rigorous derivation takes place. For the most part, it does introduce many new concepts of nuclear and particle physics but with few and ambiguous explanations of the mathematics behind it all."},{"Title":"Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics","review":"The actual textbook is very good but lacks examples so sometimes the transition can be difficult for the homework, this manual really helps you find the direction, and is a huge time saver if you are really pressed by everything else. The solutions manual goes into more depth than most do, which is good and bad I guess. It's good for both kinds of readers, those like myself actually trying to learn the subject, as well as those just looking for answers. I'd recommend to either, though I'm a dreamer and hope people just use it as a guide and not for less admirable purposes."},{"Title":"Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics","review":"The ad conveniently hides the fact that this is a solutions manual for the author's text and does not link to the text book.

They might have expected horse thieves, but what Zeke never expected to find holding the end of the rifle was one of the most beautiful black women he'd ever seen - with an attitude bigger than the state of Texas!Along with Josie, three other women had been stranded when their wagon had lost a wheel. Suzette, the blonde seemed much more open to accept their help in repairing their wagon, and in gratitude, reluctantly offered to share supper with them. With Zeke being black and Hawk, part Indian, it was difficult to believe that they were brothers. Their explanation of being adopted helped in easing the tension between the men and woman.Zeke and Hawk thought they'd just be on their way the next day, never to cross paths with the bristly females again, but they realized that to leave the women alone in the desert was not a gentlemanly thing to do. Suzette and Josie protested that they could take care of themselves, though they grudgingly admitted to themselves that the men's escort was comforting. Along the way they discovered that stubborn pride was easier to let go of when sharing the dangers along the trail, especially when love and compassion entered the equation.*** I truly enjoyed this wildly entertaining and sensitive entry in Leigh Greenwood's \`Cowboy' series, but would have entitled it differently - rather than The Mavericks, more appropriately - The Misfits! The lead characters were all so terribly wounded! Each bore childhood betrayals and self-esteem issues that it seemed as though they'd need a miracle, or a bunch of them, to ever get up the gumption to take a chance in accepting one another and the love that blossomed. Greenwood masterfully built relationships and situations that helped to bridge these wonderfully strong characters into would be partners. Additionally, lively dialogs and illuminating descriptions of trudging through the western landscapes pointing out both the beauty and dangers along their journey were great! It is certainly easy to see why Leigh holds his place as a leader in the historical romance genre for his compassionate and sensitive storytelling. I would suggest this as highly recommended reading for all lovers of historical American West romance!Marilyn, [...]"},{"Title":"The Mavericks","review":"At the end of the Civil War the Maxwells adopted eleven orphans whom they showered with love and raised to respect others. Though all in this loving brood cherish one another, the two non-white children became best friends. For years, former slave Zeke and half Indian Hawk rode together with neither of them thinking of settling down, but now in their late thirties, they decide to end their wanderlust and raise quality horses to sell to ranchers.As the Maxwell brothers escort mares in foal to their ranch, Josie, a black female, fires at Hawk. Zeke persuades Josie and her dance girl companions Suzette, Anna, and the ailing Laurie to stop shooting. Their wagon lost its linchpin stranding the helpless females until the siblings showed up. When Ben Norman arrives to take Anna with him as his wife, the ladies lose their driver and with the help of the guys take Laurie to her parents' spread. As Suzette and Hawk fall in love over horses, Zeke and Josie fall in love between jabs. However, while in loving denial, they deal with horse thieves, kidnappers, and an idiot sheriff.Leigh Greenwood, known for his terrific western romances, returns to the Cowboys' saddle with a fantastic double love story. The character driven tale lassoes in readers from the moment Josie fires a shot at Hawk and never slows down until the final confrontation between her and Zeke. The story line focuses on the dual romances, but is enhanced by the rustlers and a sheriff who applies racial profiling (Suzette is French Canadian) to decide that the four heroes are liars and thieves. Fans will cherish the return to one of the best sub-genre series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Mavericks","review":"I loved the Seven Brides series do much I read each book more than once. Now I am reading the Cowboys Series and find The Mavericks most exciting and moving as well. In each of his books Mr. Greenwood brings to the forefront a little bit of the history of the West.

Zeke and Hawk both felt too outcast because of their heritages to ever find a woman who could look past that to love them; and Josie and Suzette were dancehall girls. Their past was not one that made for wives. Yet, once the two groups meet, neither can get the other out of their minds. They try, but when trouble forces them to reunite, they find love leading them home.** There is actually very little coherent or cohesive plot here to engage one's attention. The narrative seesaws from one to the other jaggedly, focusing mostly on angst, not romance. The friendships portrayed are noteworthy and heartwarming, but that is not enough to commend this tale as readable. **Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer"},{"Title":"What a Woman Ought to Be and to Do: Black Professional Women Workers during the Jim Crow Era (Women in Culture and Society)","review":"I had to read this book for a history project I was working on, but came to enjoy the book.

The story begins with the adoption of Dolores. Young readers are likely to identify with the cat. The other character, Dolores' patron, is a white, middle-aged bachelor living in lower economic conditions. He is highly tolerant of Dolores' idiosyncrasies. For example, Dolores is afraid of the dark. He, therefore, leaves all the lights on at night. While the story is realistic, it is rather scary. At first I thought the book was morbid but it did pull on my heartstrings and won me over in the end. The illustrations are watercolor and are often spread across both pages. The art is not imaginative or particularly attractive. The palate is largely browns and grays. The images do reinforce the serious tone of the book, however, and in the last analysis must be regarded as appropriate."},{"Title":"Dolores and the Big Fire (Ready-To-Read - Level 1)","review":"Grandma, daughter and granddaughter loved this book from the library so much that we had to purchase it.

The good news is that this book is outstanding. The bad news is that it is NOT for everyone. From my perspective as a former Khmer linguist with the US Military I remember the beginning of the Pol Pot era, the \\"strange\\" messages we began to intercept from the mysterious and scarry \\"ankar,\\" and most of all, I remember following the genocide in the news during the '70's and wondering \\"how could this happen in such a gentle society as Theravada Buddhist Cambodia?\\"This book, which lists hundreds of Khmer sayings during the Pol Pot era in both English and in Khmer, is like an injection of ice-water. I read and shivered. There are several editorial mistakes but remember that the original was written in French and translated into English with the Khmer equivalent also provided. The book took me back 30 years. I believe this book will prove to be a valuable source far into the future despite its niche appeal."},{"Title":"Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar","review":"I am currently working with a Cambodian to write his memoirs as a young teenager under the Khmer Rouge regime. He was twelve when he and his family were evacuated from Battambang City, and sixteen when the Khmer Rouge were finally defeated. His experiences differ from most of the other personal accounts coming out of this war as he spent most of this time in traveling workgroups, about half of which were in the jungle. He remembers many of the sayings in Pol Pot's Little Red Book. This book is a valuable resource when used with other scholarly studies of that time."},{"Title":"Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar","review":"This book has to be seen, to be believed. It's extraordinary. Anyonesceptical of the paranoia, propaganda, winner-takes-all, ends-justifying-the-mean psychology behind the Leader of State in Cambodia, Pol Pot, merely has to read this book.There's an index, at the beginning, of various topics.Each quote has an explanation, the original language and alphabetical letters of the local language. Therefore, the context is given, as wellas a translation into English.At 336 pages, it's more than generous. It's comprehensive, as comparedto Mao Tse Tung's own Little Red Book, which is 30% of the size of thisone, although with as many pages, roughly.The power of slogans, the effectiveness of soundbites for bull hornand graffiti repetition is clearn, with this book.A must have."},{"Title":"Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar","review":"Locard provides a valuable, if flawed, service here for students of the Khmer Rouge, with his presentation of the slogans of \\"Angkar\\". This is not a scholarly book by any means, and his contextualization of Democratic Kampuchea is extremely shallow. Having read Philip Short's excellent biography of Pol Pot immediately prior to this book, I find Locard's writing to be near tabloid-calibre by comparison. He is certainly not hesitant to editorialize and promote his own rightist political views and ideologically biased interpretations of late-20th century Cambodian history. With a high school level of sophistication and an incessant stream of sometimes almost histrionic denunciations (frequently emphasized with the use of exclamation points), he spends a great deal of the book ridiculing (what he thinks is) Marxism in general, lumping the backwards-looking and organizationally psychotic Khmer Rouge with \\"all Communist and tyrannical regimes\\" everywhere, and bascially implying that any movement or group calling itself Marxist, including reform socialists, is basically a Khmer Rouge just waiting to happen, if ever given the chance. Poppycock! On the other hand, the translated slogans give the reader a unique and and often disturbing view into many aspects of life in Democratic Kampuchea -- I, for one, always wondered what they were saying in those black-and-white films from the Khmer Rouge years where everyone is standing, fists clenched in the air, yelling revolutionary slogans. Now, it seems, we know.I give this book an \\"A\\" for the material directly related to the translation of the slogans, and a \\"D-\\" for interpretation and contextualization, thus two-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Pol Pot's Little Red Book: The Sayings of Angkar","review":"5 stars for compilation & translation.1 star for interpretation & opinion.Nothing more boring when an author hates & loathes what he writes about, and uses every chapter to prove it."},{"Title":"American Indian Craft Book","review":"This is a compact little book, with a moderate amount of photos and diagrams regarding American Indian artifacts. In addiition to giving instructions on how these artifacts were made and how modern reproductions may be made, the authors also explain their use and traditions involved with Indian crafts. One thing that I particularly liked was the emphasis on day to day life of the tribes, and how that was changed by the advent of the white man. A fun and informative chapter near the end of the book tells you how to say some common names and phrases in several languages used by the Delaware, Pawnee, and Dakota tribes, among others. There is also a brief section on sign language and mention of smoke signals. I thought this book was a good introduction for teachers, scout leaders, and other interested individuals to the Native American lifestyle, and was written in a sympathetic and quite readable style."},{"Title":"American Indian Craft Book","review":"I loved this book!

The author has a very bad habit of leaving out important information, as well as quoting anonymous &quot;authorities&quot;. Be wary of his annoying habit of quoting Catholic documents and personalities out of context. He also likes to use the infamous &quot;...&quot; deception method to weed out information that would contradict his argument. If you are a Fundamentalist, who already believes that the &quot;Church of Rome&quot; has apostasized, then this book will help solidify your current beliefs.For those of you who would really like to know the &quot;secrets&quot; of &quot;Romanism&quot;, you would probably be wiser to purchase the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which details the teachings of our Faith. One quick point...refering to Catholicism as &quot;Romanism&quot; is not a good way to make friends with your Catholic neighbors.For those Catholics involved in Apologetics with Fundamentalists, this book provides a perfect example of the argumentation used to misrepresent the Faith.I would have given a book like this a higher rating, assuming the author was engaged in honest dialogue, but I can't endorse a dishonest representation of the Catholic faith. An ex-priest is not necessarily an ample authority, any more than an ex-policeman is necessarily a shining example of the police force."},{"Title":"Secrets Of Romanism","review":"I first encountered this book over forty years ago. If Joseph Zacchello ever was in reality a Catholic priest, he evidently paid scant attention to his seminary lessons. Unlike today, back in the day of Zacchello the Seminarian the Catholic Church actually taught Roman Catholic doctrine in its seminaries, witness the exponential growth of the Church in America and elsewhere during the reign of Pius XII, a fact rebuking the lamentable post-Conciliar record. Zacchello's ignorance with respect to the doctrine and customs of the Roman Church is embarassing. An example: use of the ancient ecclesiastical custom of speaking of the Roman Pontiff as 'Our Most Holy Lord the Pope' is construed by Zacchello as proof that Catholics believe the pope is God Himself. This kind of illiteracy is barbarism, and the book is filled with it. Its hatreds and lies are violent, even disturbing. The author spits rather than writes, and never more disturbingly than in the vitriol he concocts against the historical mother of Jesus. Polemics, after all, has standards; even the most convinced anti-Catholic person will find nothing here but the decayed spiritual death of the hater. It is mortifying to know this book is still published and available to the public, while so many valuable worthwhile books are out of print. What a comment on the culture we live in! The only secrets you'll find in this book are those that mock the reader to his moral peril."},{"Title":"Secrets Of Romanism","review":"A unique explanation of Roman Catholic doctrine and beliefs. Written by a former Catholic Priest the book is based on fact presented in a noncontroversial form.The Chapters are divided in first in brief analysis of the Catholic Doctrine then an analysis and refutation with references from authorized St. Anthony Guild &amp; Douay Versions.It's presents the facts proving Roman Catholic doctrine and practices are not Christian, but actually derived from pagan traditions and practices only using the essence of Christianity to deceive the masses.The book lists Catholic practices with dates of institution, Scripture references and detailed index.Great book for Christian Apologetics"},{"Title":"Formula 1: The Autobiography","review":"Gerald Donaldson has a reputation for penning Formula One books that are exaustively researched, beautifully written, and a pleasure to read. His biographies of the late Gilles Villeneuve and James Hunt fleshed out a very thorough, and human story of these extraordinary men. His 1990 release, \\"Grand Prix People\\" gave an incomparable snapshot of the F1 \\"circus\\", with remarkably candid interviews with all the principals of the sport at that time, from the drivers and engineers to the caterers and members of the governing body.In this latest book, Mr. Donaldson has co-ordinated and edited a massive tome, with various chapters being penned by some of Formula One's best journalists. It attempts what many have tried, but few have succeeded - a complete and compelling history of grand prix racing, from the late 1800s to the present day. Produced by the same publishing team that produced last year's \\"Beatles Anthology\\", this heavy coffee table book is packed with stellar photos, and tells the story of F1 through the words/quotes of the principal players of every era.

Every page is beautiful and lyric, and yet gossipy and real at the same time. Love it Love it Love it!"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters reminds one of the Tale of Genji, a work which Tanizaki himself was deeply influenced by. The characters belong to an upper class family, and are concerned with appearances, understated refinement, and tradition. Scenes such as the cherry blossom viewings and the firefly hunt are given as much importance as great floods and miscarriages. Although the characters have great depth, they are still not quite accessible--they belong to a different age and class, and float before the reader like a painting on a silk screen. Although the themes of encroaching modernity and falling family fortunes are forever in the picture, in the end it is tradition that has the happy ending, modernity that has her hopes crushed. As other readers have remarked, this is a significant shift from Naomi, where the \\"modern girl\\" is the clear and decisive victor.In many ways, The Makioka Sisters is a full-length novel version of Tanizaki's essay \\"In Praise of Shadows.\\" Few pages go by without a mention of traditional elements of Japanese culture: poetry writing, architecture, nature, dance, etc. None is a casual reference; all have layers of nuance and undertone. Still, there is the feeling that Tanizaki has Traditional Culture win the battle but lose the war, for he--like us--knows that Japan has lost World War II and the elegant world he has created will not survive the following decades of strongly Western-influenced modernization. The youth and beauty of the Makioka sisters and their world is to scatter in the wind like the petals of so many cherry blossoms.Captured best in the scene where Sachiko lies awake watching a lone firefly play about in her kimono sleeve before she lets it go, the book is a reminder that there is no such thing as true timelessness. The Makioka Sisters is very much a story about a family, a nation, and a culture on the brink of violent change. This book will reward readers with the insight and patience to savor every detail and contemplate every nuance. Tanizaki's masterpiece, this book deserves five stars."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"I was never sure, to be honest, whether I would ever get through this book ... but I'm glad I did! What started off as a slow read turned into a delightfully quick one, until I finally realized that I was so entrenched in these women's lives that, like all great books, I just didn't want it to end. I think Tanizaki's master stroke is best evidenced by the content of the novel: it's a story about practically nothing, but oh, what an addicting read!"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is a beautiful book. I bought it because of a quote I read somewhere that it was the Japanese version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". I don't know if that is true (it is more complex) but it certainly held my attention. I think the other reviewers have admirably covered the plot so I will just add a few comments. You feel like you are living with these people - even though it is an entirely different culture. And I was intrigued by the insights into that culture. The names are of course a mouthful for Westerners but fortunately in the beginning the book lists out all the main characters and their positions. In the beginning I was constantly referring back to that list but soon didn't need it. My only problem was envisioning all the beautiful descriptions, particularly of clothing (like kimonos and even western dress), and their hair and the rooms. So I went to NetFlix and found they had a 1983 Japanese film which I immediately got. It helped me a great deal even though it completely changed some of the plot. The book is much better than the film (which seems stilted and artificial to us today) but still I enjoyed the contribution that the film made to my insight. Now I want to look up more of Tanizaki's writings. I would love to see a sequel to this book to see how these characters managed in 1945.... I will look to see if any of Tanizaki's writings cover that period. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"A really fine, hypnotic piece of writing. I think the category can safely be termed using the industry standard 'chick-lit', but it certainly was no barrier in enjoying a book that delves deep into pre-WWII Japanese culture. The coming war is provided in hints, but the real war is between the future of two sisters, and their older sister's hope in a good outcome for them.Sachiko Makioka is empathetic and tenacious in trying to help her sister Yukiko become married and avoid nearing spinsterhood. How the two navigate the vicissitudes of the Japanese wedding dance is instructive and interesting. Sachiko's youngest sister Taeko is the rebel, trying to run away with one profligate beau before settling on a man of a lower class. When he dies, she rebels again, ending up pregnant by a lowly bartender.The book is concise and is very interesting in how it deals with class. Additionally, the view of Europe & America (particularly Germany) is quite fascinating. This nuanced book is well worth reading, and deserves its billing as a 'classic'."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"\\"The Makioka Sisters\\" opens a window into Japanese society in the late 1930's, the years just before Pearl Harbor. We see an upper class family grappling with domestic issues, apparently quite unconcerned about what's happening outside of Japan. The characters are well-drawn and although their lives are of no global significance, we are carried into their small world by the excellence of the writer's art. It's a most satisfying book!"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The story of a declining rich family in Osaka/Kobe of the late 1930s/early 40s reminds me of the North German Buddenbrooks and of the Portuguese Maias, both set a few decades earlier. The subject of decline of clans seems to be transcultural.The Makiokas have had their best years. Now they are struggling to keep up appearances. Main plot driver is the attempt to find a suitable husband for sister #3. Yukiko is nearly an old maid already with her (initially) 27 years. Proposals have been declined in the past, and now expectations need to be adjusted downwards. Sister #4 is also unmarried, and she has unusual ideas of being financially her own boss, with a doll business and ideas of learning designing/ dress making and dance teaching.Does this sound like a recipe for lengthy boredom? It is lengthy, ok, but to me it never reached a stage of boredom. It is a beautiful piece of prose, which must be partly due to the translator, Edward Seidensticker. The interesting historical period adds flavor.The time at the start being 1937, it is amazing how far away from politics the text stays, which is a statement in itself. The ladies of the family can't be expected to bother with such things. It seems unseemly to even mention them.Sister #4 is a bit of a rebel and has made friends with a foreigner, a White Russian woman divorced from an Englishman. This leads to a most amusing and interesting dinner party between some Makiokas and the Kyrilenkos. This is the first time that China and other unpleasantness are even mentioned, after nearly 100 pages into the 500! The Russians raise the issue of the so-called Xian incident, of December 1936, when Chiang Kai Shek was abducted by a regional warlord with the objective to press the nationalist government into a more focused fight against Japan. (CKS was, it appeared, more interested in the civil war against the Communists.)On page 111 sister #2 reads in a newspaper that Japanese carrier based units have bombarded Swatow in South China. That is the first time that we learn that Japan is at war. The whole aggression against China is euphemized as The China Incident. The first person who says, explicitly, that Japan is at war, far into 1939 now, is the Makiokas' German neighbor. Trust these blunt Germans to tell the truth, these uncultured beasts!Tanizaki was a master in pinpointing the intricacies of dos and donts of his protagonists' social world. You don't look the world into the face or even the eyes, it is unseemly! We get a walk through the world of marriage arrangements, and a lot about the Japanese version of a caste society into the bargain. We spend time with people who fear nothing more than the disapproval of their peers. (How I hated that attitude at home! I think I learned a lot about myself in this book, as odd as it may sound.)The book makes me want to re-read the Buddenbrooks."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is perhaps Tanizaki's finest work. Four sisters trapped in the gap between traditional Japanese mores and those infiltrating from the West. Each of the sisters comes to life with the authors wonderful descriptive language. Much is left to the imagination, however, in keeping with his theory that the reader MUST participate in the effort with the author and not merely sit back passively. It is not a speedy, swift moving work. Rather, the pace is a slow but steady one which, given the subject matter, is entirely appropriate."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This book is an immediate pleasure to read from the moment a bretrothal is attempted to be found for Yukiko through to the last page.Set just before World War Two, the Makioka family is of an old and fast fading aristocratic line. The world is rapidly changing around them, yet they continue to burden themselves with centuries old etiquettes and live in a state of denial of their own fading light.This-like the works of Yukio Mishima- is what can only be described as a work of art.There is something unique about Japanese literature that (thankfully!) isn't lost in translation.The Makioka sisters is a book you want to last forever. I cannot wait to buy more of Tanizaki's work."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This beautiful novel set in pre-World War II Osaka completely transported me to it's time and place. Mr. Tanizaki has drawn the characters of the Makioka family with great care and precision. I sat bolt upright when he first puts Yukiko together with her domineering little niece Etsuko, a scene that perfectly illustrates the personalities of both characters with subtle directness. At that point Mr. Tanazaki had an attentive reader and so I remained. It is said that this is a \\"novel about nothing\\" but that couldn't be further from the truth, it's about life as perceived through the eyes and experiences of one family, principally the four sisters. Life is often about nothing much, I suppose that's why we have the desire to read. The writing has a beautiful ethereal quality, I am reminded of fog or mist or cigarette smoke and yet at the same time it is robust and gripping. The details of the city, Japanese arts, kimono and nature are superb giving great ambience and sense of place. The pace is leisurely but a sense of urgency is implied through the nerve wracking task of getting the recalcitrant Yukiko married off and the knowledge of the cataclysm of war that is lurking but never delved into. I suppose this is a work for a particular audience that can revel in the slower pace of sixty plus years ago in a tightly confined social structure but Mr. Tanizaki rewards the reader again and again with flights from the ordinary into the sublime. The Everyman version with translation by Edward G. Seidensticker is a good choice."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"I read this novel whenever I'm tired of everything else. It's almost indescribable. A plot summary might be &quot;Tsuruko and Sachiko attempt to marry off Yukiko before anyone notices (a) Yukiko's hormonal problems or (b) the morals of the youngest sister, Kaeko; and while contending with financial difficulties in 1930s Osaka and Tokyo.&quot; And it's true that the major events of the novel, at least as far as the characters are concerned, are those which surround the marriage search. At the same time, the melange of ingredients, which include marriages with and without love, intense scrutiny of the tiniest processes of day to day living, gentle (and not so gentle) satire, the Osaka/Kyoto flood, is unique. At some point you realize that what appeared to be a novel of manners, with an omniscient narrator is an entirely subjective chronicle from the viewpoint of one character, and she's charming. Moreover, how can you resist a novel with the last line &quot;Yukiko's dysentery continued until the 26th and was a problem on the train to Tokyo.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This Japanese novel, first published in 1943, depicts the lives of four sisters between 1936 and 1941, a period of time in which Japan was evolving in a military way. However, these wartime preparations are a bare glimpse in the background as the four sisters involve themselves with family life and, specifically, the marriages of the two younger sisters. According to tradition the fourth sister cannot marry until the third sister marries and much of the 540 pages of this book revolve around her marriage proposals. Her younger sister, however, has already tried to elope but the family has stopped that and she is asserting herself by going into the business of making dolls and leaving the confines of the house each day to go to work. These two sisters live with the second oldest sister and her husband and young daughter. They have been upper class in the past but their fortunes are now dwindling. However they still live in a household with servants and a degree of elegance in Osaka. The oldest sister and her husband and six children live in Toyko. They are considered the head of the family and need to be consulted on all matters.With an eye for detail, the author creates this world in a way that made it easy for me to relate to. He takes us into the world of arranged marriages, filial devotion, various illnesses, a torrential flood, the decline and decay of traditional Japanese culture and the evolving preparations for war. All this is told against a background of descriptions of everyday life and the sense of how these siblings take care of each other. I was totally drawn into the story, identified with these sisters and found myself understanding their way of life. I loved reading this book, didn't want it to end and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Considered Tanizaki's best novel, this work has been called a textbook of Japanese behavior. The author began writing it around 1942-3 in the midst of World War II. Magazine publication in installments was banned after the early chapters were judged insufficiently supportive of the war effort. The work was finally published in book form in 1948, a few years after the war's end. The English translation came out in 1957.The novel began in the late 1930s among a formerly wealthy merchant family from Osaka and ended around 1940, before the outbreak of war with the United States. The family consisted of two married sisters, with their husbands and children, and two younger, unmarried sisters. Much of the novel dealt with the family's concerns about finding a suitable groom for the third sister and determining whether the fourth sister should be allowed to travel abroad, take up a trade, and continue meeting a suitor from the past. There was seemingly endless description of these two concerns, mainly from the second sister's point of view.Determining a proper marriage candidate for the third sister meant endless rounds of negotiation with each successive prospect. Each point of discussion was passed up through the hierarchy of the family ranks for decision, with soundings carefully taken of everyone's potential reaction, and any eventual decisions that resulted then passed back down. Any unexpected development restarted the cycle. Throughout, it was essential to show outward respect for the proper forms, maintain the face appropriate to one's place in society and keep the family's name unsullied. The sister herself, the one on whose behalf the entire family was working, showed the least interest of all in tying the knot and was content to remain dependent. Given all this, it was no wonder she was long past marriageable age.With the fourth sister, by tradition her conduct was regulated by the family of the first sister. The family heads were so stuck in the past, however, that their decisions for her bore little relation to what realistically she needed to do. Ready to marry, she wasn't free to act until a groom for the third sister was chosen. The second sister, her go-between within the family, sympathized with the predicament but wished to avoid a family upset. This meant endless thinking about how to divine everyone's true motives and spin discussions, avoiding confrontation while protecting the family name. And continued reproaches to herself or others -- thought but unexpressed -- for hesitation or lack of proper consideration. What happened in effect was continued avoidance of any clear resolution until too late, when events forced the family's hands, so to speak.The author was skilled at setting up contrasts between the actions of the two younger sisters or the two older sisters, and at establishing situations where a character would condemn another for something and behave later in a similar way. When action on a larger scale occurred from time to time -- a flood, a medical crisis -- his powers of description were memorable. And the irony of the conclusion, after the family's endless consideration of its good name, was very pointed. Not to mention the irony of having the novel conclude, after more than 500 pages, with hoped-for events still in the future.At the same time, what I could appreciate was affected eventually by the book's seemingly interminable proceedings. One wondered sometimes whether the author was intentionally drawing out things to the point of parody. I also had trouble figuring out exactly where the author's sympathies lay. With Teinosuke, the second sister's husband? Not with any of the four sisters, it seemed, most of whom were described from the outside, none of whom received compassion unmixed with mockery. The characters were almost entirely closed to each other, rarely if ever sharing their deeper thoughts. And how class-bound they were, so much of the time.For reasons like these, I didn't enjoy the book all that much. Another novel read recently that was set in the past and focused on the lives of women -- The Doctor's Wife by Sawako Ariyoshi - with a far narrower scope, less mastery and much less detail but with clearer, unalloyed compassion, was preferred."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Others have commented that this book is slow-going, which I can understand--there certainly isn't a great deal of what you'd call 'action,' in a Hollywood sense--but on the other hand, I found it an amazingly effortless read; pages would simply melt away at an astonishing rate. It's very much a novel after the manner of the nineteenth-century (though it's probably best to avoid Jane Austen comparisons, which, though superficially appealing, ultimately don't really work very well): no modernist jiggery pokery (not that I have anything against that, necessarily), just a straightforward narrative of things that happen. One sometimes forgets how effective this can be, when done well.All this notwithstanding, perhaps the most interesting thing about the novel is its ambiguity: out of the three sisters (the fourth, Tsuruko, being a very minor character, although this does also apply to her, to an extent), only one, Sachiko (the novel's de facto protagonist, I suppose), is made entirely psychologically comprehensible by Tanizaki. Taeko and Yukiko remain to a large extent mysterious throughout. I find that the glib characterizations of them and other major characters in the Vintage edition to be very misleading: nobody in the book can be so easily characterized. Even Taeko's old flame Okubata, who the reader is likely to quickly write off as 'total jerk,' is ultimately given the benefit of the doubt.One thing that may seem strange to some readers is the way that world events of the time are understated. The novel takes place in the years leading up to World War II, concluding at the end of 1940. However, in spite of occasional references to Hitler and \\"the China Incident,\\" there is little effect on the lives of the Makiokas, and insofar as they are aware of these things, they remain undemonstratively, naturally, loyal to their country and their allies. This, of course, is nothing more than self-evidently realistic, and I certainly hope nobody would be deranged enough to condemn them for it. People have to live their lives; it's not as if the US hasn't been involved in its share of ignoble wars (hmm...can we think of a current example?). Tankizaki may be subtly critiquing this behavior, but it never becomes more than an undercurrent.At ANY rate! This is nothing like my preconception of what Japanese novels are supposed to be like was, based on reading Mishima and Kawabata. It is, however, excellent in its own right. If you want something a little more circumspect than your average novel (whatever THAT beast would like!), go for it."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The war in Asia is already going on, and Pearl Harbor hovers on the horizon. The readers are very well aware of this, as was Tanizaki. The book was published between 1943 and 1948. To the Makioka sisters, the war is still very distant, though. The concerns that are urgent to them are of a more everyday character, not least important the matter of finding a suitable husband for Yukiko, who is past thirty. That we have this knowledge about the future will probably make the final chapters of the book seem heavy with irony to most readers.The fortunes of the house of Makioka have been declining for some time. The junior branch, the family of Sachiko (the second sister) and her husband Teinosuke, nevertheless lead a comfortable upper middle class life near Osaka. The younger sisters prefer to stay with them. Sachiko is the center of the story, insofar as it is told mostly from her point of view. The events, however, revolve around the two younger sisters, Yukiko and Taeko. There is drama and some tragedy, but much of the book simply records fairly undramatic events in the lives of the Makiokas in the years leading up to the Pacific War. Above all, the story conjurs up a world that was already disappearing at the time of the story - and was soon to be in flames. I would describe the book as bittersweet.To me, The Makioka Sisters was not exactly a page-turner. It took me more than a month to read all 530 pages. It was, however, a highly engaging book, beautifully told and easy too read. I never felt bored."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is a portrait of an upper middle class family attempting to preserve its status is a changing world. Junichiro Tanizaki tells the story with sympathy and humor. Two of the four Makioka sisters married while the family wealth and status were in tact. Sister #3 must be married before sister #4. This marriage and required investigations and negotiations haven't gone smoothly. As the family fortunes decline, the delays in finding a suitor for sister number #3 and the lifestyle of sister #4 decrease the marriage value of both.Tanazaki pays attention to detail in his portraits. He notes the accents, the kimono, jewelry, injections, small talk, superstitions, who sleeps soundly, the size of the rooms, guarded and unguarded discussions with and about the servants, and the formal letters which exchange greetings, pleasantries and heavy verdicts.Some of the best parts relate the inner thoughts of the characters and how their thoughts incorporated what they presumed to be thoughts of the others. This is best done with Sachiko, as she cares for her sisters, dreads telling her husband of Taeko's troubles, navigates the judgment of the \\"main house\\", gets pressured into a miai for Yukiko or a punishment for Taeko. You think you know a character like Yukiko, but mid-book you learn why she rejected her first suitor, you hadn't suspected it, but it fits right in and you think ahhhhh.After the \\"main house\\" moves to Tokyo, you can feel the out of touch patriarch making colder, more detached decisions for the others. Were this a meritocracy, Tatsuo would never be heading this family. Teinsuke cares for three Makioka sisters supposedly due to geography, but clearly he does it because he's the better man.The book has the stuff of everyday life such as memorial services, dance lessons. waiting for others, seeing a former suitor on a train, inane dinner conversatons, and huge efforts that die on a \\"missed\\" telephone call. It also has the Japanese aesthetic appreciation: the Kabuki, the cherry blossoms, firefly hunts and the curiousity about the west.Current events are a backdrop such as the Chinese \\"incident\\", Okubata's interesting \\"opportunity\\", and German friends return to a country at war. The economy is taking a toll on the family fortune at the \\"main house\\" and a military contract benefits the others. At this time, Japan has been opened to the world for 3 generations and class structures are rigid. There is a anticipation that there will be a war and the characters seemed resigned to it. They have no positions such as \\"pro war\\" or \\"anti war\\" or any \\"fight for the country\\" fervor.This book isn't for everyone. To appreciate it you need some background (not a lot, but some) in Japanese culture and sympathy for people trapped by the social conventions of their times."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Not having read many Japanese novels, I cannot agree or disagree with those who argue (and there are many) that this is the greatest Japanese novel of the twentieth century. That said, it took no more than two chapters to convince me that Tanizaki was onto something remarkable.The novel's theme is highly recognizable--an aristocratic family, fallen on hard times, desperately clings to family mores that are at increasing odds with a changing society--but Tanizaki's handling of this and other themes is original in its humor and detached irony. Tanizaki is never pious, never over-earnest, and his ability to treat the family's frenzied attempts to marry off the respectable third sister, Yukiko, often had me clutching my sides. Impossible to forget Sachiko's obsessions over the dark spot on her sister's eye (she is convinced that the spot is responsible for spoiling her sister's prospects), but equally hilarious are the descriptions of Katharina's eccentric Russian family, Koi-san's and Yukiko's attempts to avoid the Tokyo \\"main house,\\" and O-Haru's negligible hygiene All this is written in a style that is a paragon of simple elegance, subtlety, and enviable vividness.Many reviewers have made much of the novel's few references to political events, with some even arguing that \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" offers a rebuttal to the authoritarian regime of the 1920s and 1930s. I disagree. The momentous issues of the day--the China Incident (translation: a skirmish that would escalate into one of the bloodiest wars of the twentieth century), German and Japanese military ambitions, and the beginning of World War Two--are danced around, alluded to, almost avoided. The Makiokas go about their mundane business while the world goes to pot, and this explains, perhaps, why we care about them so much: we, the readers, know that the world will soon tap them on the shoulders - and hard."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The primary emotion that I felt during the reading of this novel (at least the first time) was impatience, slowing building to a combination of irritation and finally incredulity. Why won't the \\"main house\\" in Osaka drop its pre-occupation with rank? Why won't the unmarried Yukiko show some decisiveness? Why doesn't Koi-san actually rebel and break free, rather than go through the charade of submission, deception and clandestine affairs? Why won't the well-meaning, practical Teinosuke take charge? When will the sisters have a mature relationship between themselves?Perhaps this is what makes the novel so good; out of the initial irritation comes understanding of the characters and a reluctant, grudging empathy. They have their own reasons for doing what they do, their own philosophy of life and the reader is encouraged to replace judgement by understanding. Interspersed in this family drama (which could probably have been placed in any culture) is an interesting backdrop of Japanese-German relations as war-clouds are gathering and the typical understated Japanese reaction to the tragedies of life, death and birth."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Reading \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" is a bit like taking a long train journey on a local train that stops at every station. Tanizaki's novel, the story of four sisters of a once affluent family that has fallen into decline, moves along at a leisurely pace for most of its 500 pages. The novel is set in the years 1937-1941, a tumultuous period in the history of East Asia, yet events barely intrude. One hears of Japan's aggression in China as merely \\"the China incident,\\" and December 1941, has more to do with the impending betrothal (after many disappointments) of the third sister, Yukiko, than it does with the onrush of war.This is a book that is set mostly within the walls of the Osaka household of the second sister, Sachiko, and her husband, Teinsuke, with whom the two unmarried sisters, Taiko and Yukiko, live. The eldest sister, Tsuroko, and her husband, Tatsuo, run the \\"main house\\" in Tokyo (the branch of the family with which decisions about money and marriage lie). The realism of the novel lies in its inclusion of intricate detail: a spot that appears and disappears over Yukiko's eye; the choice of restaurant for a \\"miai\\" (a social gathering to assess the suitability of a couple for marriage); the type of medications Sachiko carries in her bag; the type of dress (western or kimono) a sister is wearing, and so on. So minute is that detail that it may leave a reader who is unfamiliar with Japanese culture quite unhappy by the time yet another \\"miai\\" for Yukiko commences.Yet when the family goes forth into the world, in its circumscribed way, there are scenes of great beauty---of firefly watching, cherry viewing, Fuji-gazing. And this world IS circumscribed, so much so that the three sisters who live in Osaka never adjust to Tokyo (and indeed, their small disasters happen there). Every minute the Osaka sisters spend in the capital reminds them of how provincial they are; ashamed of even of their \\"western\\" accents, they are relieved to return home. Although modernity has crept into the sisters' lives(a phonograph, the films the narrator often mentions by title, cigarettes, permanent waves),they are still often startled by the brusque certainty of some of the more modern women they encounter, with their smart western clothing and lacquered nails. Within the family itself, it is Taiko, the youngest sister, who struggles the most with this tension between modern and traditional ways, and thus is is she who wears western dress with the most ease, while, paradoxically, she is a skilled practitioner of traditional Japanese dance.The last scene in the novel is set on the train that is carrying Yukiko, the third and most \\"Japanese\\" sister, toTokyo for her marriage, at long last, to a dissolute aristocrat; his connections, the family hopes, may lift the Makioka name to some of its former luster. Even here, the novel moves as slowly as it ever did. There is no grand denouement, and the story closes on the most intimate and mundane of details. However, by this point, the accumulation of bits of information about the world at war has gained force, and it seems to carry the Makioka sisters straight into a long dark tunnel from which one knows they will not emerge unchanged.M. Feldman"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This story, primarily set in Osaka, spans a period of four years (from 1937 to 1941). This period, is a tumultuous period for Japan, and we view it from the perspective of one family. The Makioka is a family in decline and after the death of the parents, the husband of the eldest daughter adopts the Makioka name and becomes the head of the family. There are four sisters: the eldest is Tsuruko, married to Tetsuo (a bank employee); Sachiko, married to Teinosuke (an accountant); and the two unmarried sisters, Yukiko and Taeko, who live with Sachiko and Teinosuke.Tradition dictates that Yukiko should be married before her younger sister, Taeko. Tradition also dictates that unmarried sisters should live with the head of the house. Some traditions, it seems, are easier to ignore than others. A number of attempts to marry off Yukiko fail: Yukiko herself, seemingly passive in many ways, exerts considerable influence from the shadows. Marriage to someone at some stage is seen as inevitable but Yukiko does not seem enthusiastic. In the meantime, Taeko is trying to live her own life.This is an amazing novel. The shifts in fortune for the Makioka family, the changes within Japanese upper-class society, and the influences of the Western world all shape the story. On the face of it, this novel is about the minutiae of the lives of sisters during a period of four years. The turmoil of Taeko's life, the attempts to arrange a marriage for Yukiko and the challenges faced by the careworn elder sister Tsuruko with both social standing and family to maintain contrast with the comparative happiness of Sachiko's life. The detail of the lives of the sisters provides an intricate view of upper-class Osakan life immediately before World War II: tradition and obligation as well as moments of great beauty. Simply superb.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Before soap operas or movie dramas, Japan had to rely on books. The Makioka Sisters is about four sisters living in pre-World War Two Japan. The sisters are from a Samurai family which is declining in fortunes. Two of the sisters are married and spend most of the three books trying to get the other two sisters married. The book really allows us to see Japanese daily life, from interaction between families, worries about employment, the traditions, the holidays, the fashions and even problems a normal family had. The book, funny enough, got the author in trouble because it was about nothing. It neither attacked the government or military nor did the book support or help the national war effort. It was thought of as a waste of paper.The chronology in the front of the book is very useful to understand what is happening during the author's life. If you want a taste of Japanese life, this is it. But it isn't a bus or train book. It is 498 pages of small print, complex plots and twisted sisters. Not easy, no matter how much you love Japanese culture. But worth it."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This book holds a very special place in my reading history. It opened my mind in the subtlest of ways. It is a book about the meeting of cultures, east and west, and to my surprise neither side wins. Tanizaki shows that blindly revering the past can yield fatal results, but so can blindly flying into the future. Tanizaki's sentiments lie somewhere inbetween. The novel is longer than most and moves at a pace which reveres eastern tradition while assimilating western forms, in short, this is a perfectly poised work that does not sacrifice anything to short term gain nor martyr itself for some unwinnable cause. Tanizaki is a master at a game that his whole culture is (and less obviously ours) is playing. Neither way is completely correct and neither way wrong. The characters in this magnificent novel all walk in between. In some ways the novel belongs to the twenties in which it was written, in other ways it belongs to us."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is a sweeping view of a changing Japanese aristocratic and domestic life. As everyone else has said, it's a long book, and it's not flashy, but its characters are enigmatic and real, and after you have read it you wish there was more. I suppose that it does in fact earn the praise given on its back cover--at least as far as my limited reading of the modern Japanese classics would allow me to judge."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is one of the rare books which makes you unconsciously smile as you read. The language is beautiful and the pages are full of poignant scenes of personal discovery and familial relationships. I loved the chapter where Sachiko is complaining (lovingly) about O-haru.

I rushed to finish it but didn't want it to end. Books like that are few and far between."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is Tanizaki's masterpiece. The characters are multifaceted, with all the complexity of real life. The writing is simple and elegant, yet filled with beauty and emotion."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"It was recommended to me as a good insight into Japan of the 40s but I found it incredibly long winded with massive excessive detail. It is probably a cultural thing but I feel it could have been edited to a short story. And should have been. The writing wasn't bad but not fantastic but it just went on into ever more minute detail for no story advancement and to me the ending was left hanging. I could not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"I am somewhat reminded of Willa Cather's works in that there is not any real action or deep plot but boy is there a lot of story. Unlike Cather, however, The Makioka Sisters spans a relatively few years in the lives of its characters. The whole plot, if you can call it that, revolves around trying to get the third of four sisters married. The problem is that Tanizaki could have made the story half as long or twice as long as it is. Unfortunately, he chose the latter. However, it is well written and an easy read. Although I did enjoy most of it, I began getting impatient about 100 pages from the end. Tanizaki must also have thought it was time to wrap things up as he seems to have rushed things at the end trying to wrap up loose ends. I would like to give this 3 1/2 stars but half stars aren't permitted."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Transcending the barrier between the Japanese and American minds requires direct experience that no amount of reading can supply. However, this novel of culture, manners and decay in the interwar years is poignant and enlightening. The obsession with class and manners is particularly sad in light of the immanent war and destruction of The Empire.Probably a \\"girl\\" book, but still.Read and learn."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The level of detail concerning the trivialities of daily living is amazing especially if like me you're not that familiar with post war Japanese family structure and customs. This is my first read by Tanizaki but won't be my last. I also appreciated the intro and how the characters are defined so to speak. Tanizaki's writing flows in a structured type way that I appreciate probably because I can easily follow and not get lost."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This book gives an enormously clear and natural picture of life in one slightly decayed family of the upper middle class in immediately pre-WWII Japan, where the approach of the war is seen in entirely personal terms (the German neighbors leave) and the most important thing is getting the younger sisters of the family married off in the correct order and preserving appearances. A wonderful portrayal of a society through a tiny detailed snapshot. I especially enjoy the sympathetic character of the second sister's husband, as it is rare to find such a thoroughly likable man in a book primarily about women."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters (Sasame Yuki, Light Snow), first published in 1948, was written by Junichiro Tanizaki (1886-1965). Tanizaki wrote The Makioka Sisters after translating the Tale of Genji into modern Japanese and the Murasaki novel is said to have influenced his own. It tells of the declining years of the once powerful Makioka family and their last descendants, four sisters. It has been translated by Edward G. Seidensticker in 1957. Powerfully realistic, it mourns the passing of greatness while celebrating in wonderfully evocative detail the beauty of a particular time and place, Osaka in the 1930s. In its creation of beauty out of sadness it can be compared to another family saga, The Maias (1888), by the Portuguese master Ea de Queiroz (1845-1900).Why is this long book, largely concerned with trivial family procedures, one of the finest novels written? It is not concerned with great events, causes or philosophies. It has little concern with the war Japan was fighting with China, and then the USA, when the book was first published. Indeed its characters don't think about the war, and in a positive way, which doesn't trivialise their concerns at all (most people in fact don't think about the reasons for a war: perhaps it's better that way). This doesn't mean the book is escapist or superficial, just as the concern with women's lifestyle, dress, makeup, etiquette or social vanity make it something written just for women (books and films were once made - by men - to capitalise on what were considered women's 'little' concerns). Tanizaki does that wonderful thing a great artist can do, he finds the universal in the most exact examination of the particular, and makes a work of relevance to us all. Read another family saga, The Brothers Karamazov (1880) and my candidate for the greatest novel yet written (though I'm more than cynical about the word 'great') and marvel at the many routes artists find to the universal.My review is impossibly partial: The Makioka Sisters is the most beautiful novel I've ever read. The language (translation) is so smooth and flowing, the characters and situations so gentle and muted, yet precise and meaningful, that reading the book is like seeing the universe in a drop of water - you see, which is moving, and awareness of where and how you see brings amazement and then a real pleasure.In this beautiful book the characters have a greater degree of reality than many real people - Tanizaki is a great master of characterisation. I know more about them than I do about most of the people I know. It is done by the accumulation of enormous amounts of detail, but detail which, trivial though it may appear, is just right. The result is the creation of a most ethereal and delicate beauty, a lovely world crumbling to extinction yet all the more precious because of its inevitable passing away.Sachiko, the second sister and her husband Teinosuke are that rare achievement, a convincing depiction of really good and admirable people, though in no way heroic. They are very ordinary people, but their goodness, their little troubles and worries, their faults, even weaknesses, all serve to charm and captivate. Of all the characters in the book these two are the loveliest. It is a real affirmation of humanity to have created two such kind and gentle and sensitive people, and to have made them so real and convincing.The careworn life of Tsuruko (first sister), the hesitations of Yukiko (third sister), the unhappiness of Taeko (Koi-san, fourth sister) all gain from contrast with the stability and happiness of Sachiko and Teinosuke. And what an evocation of the old ways of Japan. Changing rapidly even as Tanizaki writes of them.Detail by detail - Etsuko's games with the German girl Rosemarie, Itakura's leather coat, the 'old one', Koi-san's mimicry and mingled love and resentment of Yukiko...there are literally thousands of details. Teinosuke's love of Spring in his garden, the vitamin injections the sisters take, the forthrightness of Itani - all, everyone, is so precise, not random at all, chosen to evoke mood, reveal character, show milieu.So powerful and evocative has the book been - yet nothing really happens, except to Koi-san. The war approaches, the old Japan changes, Yukiko gets married - unforgettable!I've seen advertised a TV serialisation of The Makioka Sisters, but can't imagine how it could succeed. So much of the book's effect is through language. Visually, certain scenes stand out, such as the cherry blossom viewing or the flood. The narrative though is largely uneventful, small actions that dramatically and convincingly reveal a character's state of mind, early history or personality.Written with love, a strong love of people and place, the book creates love in the reader. Because of Tanizaki I have loved Osaka in the late 1930s and have learned to treasure and respect its people. For those hesitating to undertake reading such a 'Japanese' work as The Makioka Sisters there is the perfect bridging novel The Wind-up Bird Chronicle (Nejimaki-dori kuronikuru, 1995) by Haruki Murakami, which does mention the war - and Charlie Parker and 'hard-boiled' detective stories and Jungian archetypes and the surreal: a roller coaster of a novel and one of the best as well."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters is a special novel for two reasons. Much of Japanese literature this century is very taut and relatively short. One thinks of Soseki, Mishima, Dazai, Kawabata and the two most important of Tanizaki's other novels, Some Prefer Nettles and Diary of a Mad Old Man. Instead of being 150-200 pages, this book is around 500 pages. The popular description of this book, about a merchant family in decline, might imply a book like Budenbrooks. Yet this book is very different from Thomas Mann's fine novel. For a start it only covers four years, not a couple of generations. More important the theme of decline is not a primary one, and Mann's theme of cultural enervation is absent.What we have instead is a book that seeks to be a work of &quot;photographic realism.&quot; It seeks to be &quot;real&quot; not in the sense that Flaubert or James or Tolstoy are realistic. Instead of portraying complex themes and ideas while keeping an eye on what would be actually plausible, Tanizaki seeks to describe what actually happens. This sort of realism is not highly valued since it is often unimiginative and often psychologically shallow. And indeed in this book it can often appear tedious and unrewarding. But a closer examination reveals certain virtues.In a sense Tanizaki's book is &quot;like life.&quot; The story of Taeko of of the youngest sister who cannot marry because custom dictates she must wait for her older sister Yukiko to be married. The story of her two possible fiancess and the eventual pre-marital pregnancy appear, not as part of a complex, organic scheme as, say, the story of Anna Karenina, but as a series of discrete events, moved often by coincidence and chance. A flood becomes a crucial event, one character is killed by a quack doctor, Taeko becomes ill with dystentry at a crucial moment, a proposal is botched because Yukiko cannot summon the courage to answer the telephone. Since this is often how life happens it is not unrealistic and indeed has a special value of perspective.Tanizaki's sense of style and detail are also interesting. For example there is little on food (by contrast one remembers the Christmas dinner in Buddenbrooks). There is the Japanese emphasis on the intense aesthetic absorption in a taut, sparsely described expression of nature. Two of the leading incidents in the book describe watching cherry trees bloom and having a firefly hunt in the night. At one point Sachiko, the second sister and the most important one in the novel, watches her young daughter and her German friends plays with dolls and the German girl accurately tells where babies come from. It is interesting that Sachiko approves of this realism.Most interesting is the fact that this book takes place from 1936 to 1940, during, of course, the Japanese invasion of China. Tanizaki itself stared writing the book during the second world war, and his publication was delayed on the grounds that it apparently did not help the war effort enough. It was not actually published until 1948, when Japan was occupied by the American occupation. How much did this change the political tone? Perhaps not as much as one might think, since the Makiokas write their German friends that they are pleased that their ally is doing so well in the summer of 1940. Yet at the same time the absence of ideology and fanaticism is striking. The Makiokas naturally agree with the austerity campaigns, they refer to the invasion as the &quot;China Incident&quot; like everyone else, and they vaguely wish for peace. This is not unrealistic per se (the Makiokas are probably too old to worry about conscription) and the absence of politics is also not unrealistic. After all women did not have the right to vote at this time. Before commenting on how the Makiokas have escaped the trap of ideology, and before making comparisons to Jane Austen, one should consider while reading this novel the idea that such privatism is essential to such a regime. Instead of totalitarianism smashing individuals and transforming themselves into empty masses, one should consider the insights of Rudy Koshar and William Sheridan Allen that regimes feed off this sort of privatism and political isolation."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"THE MAKIOKA SISTERS tells the story of the lives and relationships of four sisters in the late 1930's and early 1940's in Osaka, Japan. Tsuruko, the oldest, who is married, acts as the head of the household by nature of her age. Sachiko, the second oldest, also married, is a sensitive and intelligent woman who watches over her younger sisters. Yukiko, unmarried, is extrmeley shy and reserved, and extremely dependent upon Sachiko. The youngest, also unmarried, is Taeko (nicknamed Koi-san), a free spirit who finds that she must break with tradition to be happy. It is the responsibility of Sachiko and her husband Teinosuke to find a suitable husband for Yukiko, who must marry before Taeko as custom dictates.The book takes us through several years in the lives of the Makioka family (curiously, since there were only daughters and no sons, both sisters' husbands took the name Makioka), as they experience the joys and disillusions of life in an extremely close-knit family. As their wealth and prosperity wane, they realize that you sometimes must make sacrifices.It was wonderful to read this book knowing that not only was it written by a native Japanese, but that it was also written in that time period, in the early 1940's. Knowing that every description and every conversation was authentic made this an amazing book.I would highly reccomend this to anyone who has an interest in Japanese customs, society and way of life. It was fascinating."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The first time I read The Makioka Sisters, I called it \\"fragile and lovely.\\" Recently, I read it again. It's not really fragile and lovely. Actually, it's very matter-of-fact. The narrative mostly recounts events and the characters' reactions to the events. There isn't much description or imagery, like in Kawabata. Even big events like the Osaka flood are recounted straightforwardly, with precision instead of lyricism.But the book is very perceptive about its characters. Tanizaki knew everything about the social class of the Makioka family. The book is full of countless trivial little details about their daily habits, mannerisms, styles of dress and conversations. For example, during one of the family's attempts to marry off the third sister Yukiko, the prospective husband is concerned that she seems moody, and the whole family tries to dissuade him in writing and on the phone. Tanizaki perfectly captures the frantic, businesslike quality of the negotiations, simply by describing their arguments at length. He is so perfectly attuned to the routine of a family of this class that, just by describing it, he can recreate a whole period of history. And his extensive knowledge of small details also makes the narrative very lively, and often funny. The book moves slowly, but I found it addictively readable, both the first time and now.The book is much more than a period piece. It captures the superficiality and transience of a sense of closeness between people. The four Makioka sisters are surely very close to one another. They've been together since they were little, and they get along very well. The three younger sisters live under the same roof until they're all well over thirty. Basically they're each other's closest friends. And yet, the second sister Sachiko has no idea whatsoever about what goes on in her youngest sister Taeko's life. She spends much of the book misinterpreting Taeko's motivations. Taeko also remains friendly towards Sachiko throughout the book, which of course does not in any way prevent her from telling Sachiko nothing of her inner thoughts.Similarly, Sachiko has a very good husband, by any standard. He's very capable, treats his wife well, agrees to support her sisters even though there's really no good reason why he should do so, and engages in self-sacrifice when the situation calls for it. Sachiko should be very close to him, and their marriage is overall harmonious. But their relations are \\"comfortable\\" more than they are \\"close.\\" Sachiko is closer to her younger sisters than to her husband, and we already know the real value of that.The oldest sister Tsuruko grows particularly estranged from the others, since she lives separately from them and also has the formal duty of managing the family. Possibly the most touching moment in the book is a tiny episode in which Sachiko visits Tokyo and goes to the Kabuki without inviting Tsuruko to come along. And Yukiko is the most \\"traditional\\" of the sisters, but she's not particularly fragile. Actually, she's the most physically resilient. And in the ending, she rewards her family's efforts in trying to find a match for her by acting grumpy and aloof toward everyone. Tanizaki subtly points out that she comes to be excited by the prospect of marriage, but what makes this observation so amazingly accurate is that she's excited by the prospect itself, not by any individual man.All this is perhaps the root of the feeling of \\"fragility\\" that I had when I first read the book. It is true that Tanizaki's characters are members of a declining noble family, and that the setting is just before World War II. We know that the Makiokas' comfortable lives will shortly be obliterated, and this is poignant knowledge. But the true \\"decline\\" in the book is not so much one of material wealth or social standing, because Sachiko's husband is still very successful, and Yukiko can still find an attractive match, and hey, their chances of surviving the war are as good as anyone's. The true \\"decline\\" is in the way the book gradually reveals that its characters are not really all that close to each other. Furthermore, it suggests that this particular decline is not a product of modernity, war, or lack of tradition, but rather that it is simply the natural state of things."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Junichiro Tanizaki's &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; (MK) has been hailed as a classic of postwar Japanese literature. In style and content, it resembles Naguib Mahfouz's masterpiece of Egyptian life, &quot;Palace Walk&quot;. The novel relates how the once grand Makioka family clings desperately to the past as it copes unsuccessfully with its declining fortunes and social status, and the encroaching tide of modernity. The Makioka sisters' growing desperation is evocatively captured in their endless shuttles between their beloved hometown Osaka and the increasingly dominant but alien metropolis Tokyo, and in their many failed attempts to marry off the third sister, Yukiko, which according to Japanese tradition, must precede any marriage proposal for the rebellious youngest sister, Taeko. I lost count of the number of miais the unenthusiastic Yukiko had to attend because they all ended the same way. In rejection and tears. These repetitive events that lead to dead ends give the novel a claustrophobic edge, though this has a tendency to wear the reader down. Written in flowing prose and plain narrative, MK offers a richly textured picture of a crumbling order, a society in transition as it begins to take in foreign influences ranging from western fashion to a working lifestyle for women. It is also a time of war and upheaval around the world. Non-Japanese readers may be amused by the plethora of Japanese rituals (eg, the meddling of matchmakers and the customary investigation into the social background of suitors, etc) and their stylised manner of speech and thought, but that's the way it was and to some extent is today. Osaka and Tokyo are metaphors for the old and the new. The Makiokas reveal their parochialism when they complain endlessly about the inferior lifestyle they have to suffer in Tokyo. As a family epic, MK is strangely less than compelling. The plot is static. It goes nowhere. The novel's lack of momentum may not be incongruous with its own artistic ambitions but is ultimately tedious. Characterisation is on the whole shallow, though Sachiko, the second Makioka sister through whose eyes the story is told, is pretty solid and comes to life. So does the rebellious black sheep sister, Taeko. MK is an important but not always engrossing read."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"As in &quot;Buddenbrooks,&quot; we are introduced to a bourgeois family in decline, and through them we enter deeply into their society, so different from our own--and both societies, Germany in the late 19th century and Japan just before World War II, are about to undergo tremendous changes. And as in Jane Austen, the plot is propelled by the search for a husband, in this case for the third Makioka sister. This book is absolutely enthralling. It's long, but the pages fly by."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Amen to the reviewer who compared this work to Pride and Prejudice. After the first chapter, all I could think was that Jane Austen had been reborn as a Japanese man named Junichiro Tanizaki. This work is intelligent, subtle, and carefully observed. I especially enjoyed the distance Tanizaki kept from his main character, Yukiko. We only understand her from the viewpoint of other characters in the novel--but despite her silence, she dominates the story."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Tanizaki set out, during the war years, to write a book like The Tale of Genji, in tribute to what was best about the Japanese past. The amazing thing is, that he succeeded. He was able to transfer the spirit of the Japanese masterpiece (which is also a world masterpiece) in modern times and delicately describe a whole civilization which had really been destroyed, even before the war was lost, in the dreadful militarism that caused the war in the first place. This book is beautifully written. As other readers have noted, it does go slowly. So does War and Peace. So do a lot of the other novels that really make you think about life, and love and important issues. The book echoes the leisurely pace of the Makiokas' lives and is very nostalgic--but it is realistic too and does not depict the old society as perfect. Each sister has her own, fascinating character. They do not easily fit into stereotypes. Particularly interesting to me is the character of Taeko, the youngest 'modern' sister who will not (or cannot) behave like her more decorous sister Yukiko, the perfect 'traditional' Japanese woman--who can't get married. Taeko behaves very badly by the standards of her time--and very normally by our standards today. It is interesting to see the tension, and the ways in which her behavior affects everybody around her. Not only are the sisters interesting, but there are many very wonderfully drawn secondary characters, like Saeko's cultured husband, and the foreigners, the Russians, the German family with the two children--Just as interesting as the people though are the customs and the culture. There's cherry-blossom viewing, and a firefly hunt and descriptions of how to wear kimonos and many very wonderful descriptions of Taeko's traditional dance-- It's all a whole different mindset than the way we live today. Really civilized. And yet, at the same time, the Japanese army is committing the horrific atrocities in Nanking--I would read this first, and then Genji, if you haven't done that (you'll really go back to another time). Also best, I think, in the Seidensticker translation.Someone who likes this will probably also really like In the Shade of Spring Leaves, a translation of the stories of Higuchi Ichiyo, along with a biography of a fascinating woman who died way too young."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This has to be considered Tanizaki's masterpiece. It is a beautifully written, deliciously observed tale of the decline of a privileged upper middle class Osaka family, told through the lives of four sisters. I have read this book three times and learn someting new each time. It is a thoroughly modern story with elusive and ghostly antecedents. Although the tale takes place only 60 years ago, on the eve of pre-war Japan, it describes a world now vanished. Tanizaki's writing is fluid and clear. His description of Kyoto during cherry blossom viewing makes me sorry I've never been there at that season. The sublety Tanizaki brings to the emotions and motives of each of the persons attending Yukiko's many miais is amazing. Unfortunately, the film of about a decade or so ago doesn't do the book justice. Thank you, Tanizaki-san, for giving us the Makioka Sisters."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This book offers a wonderful glimpse into the pre-war life in Japan among aristocratic women. Four sisters, Tsuruko, Sachiko, Yukiko, and Taeko struggle to maintain the family honor and to construct satisfying lives. This is made especially difficult by Yukiko's inability to find a husband and a tradition that prohibits younger sisters from marrying until the older sisters marry. Addictively engaging, this book takes the reader to Japan to spend some time living in the Makioka sisters' world."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"Just read it! The translation is georgous, the spirit of the Tanizaki's style comes through perfectly."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and echo California and Hawaii's descriptions. There really is no concrete action in the book--maybe you need to be a Japanphile to appreciate the wonderfully descriptive detail of Meiji era Kyoto/Osaka.

Perhaps Alfred Birnbaum could redo it?"},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"This is a fantastic book - just wish I had bought a paper copy rather than the kindle version. This book is riddled with spelling and punctuation errors on just about every page.

The film version (in Japanese, with English subtitles) is called &quot;Sasame Yuki&quot; (A Little Snow), but it is marketed in the United States as &quot;The Makioka Sisters.&quot; The film captures the beauty and melancholy of the book, with fantastic photography of the Japanese seasons as they pass during the stories of the sisters. If you enjoyed the book, you'll love the movie."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"The Makioka Sisters, though long and sometimes tedious, gives it's reader a real and descriptive view of another world.

I could go into details, but it's interesting to read and find a totally different lifestyle from the present."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"After reading the book..or rather, reading what I could of it, I simply can't agree with what everyone's been saying. I found it tedious, and horribly boring. The author failed to make me interested in ANY of the characters, let alone care about what happened to any of them. The pace is horrendously slow, painfuly descriptive, and at times confusing about who is who. There is practically NO dialogue, and character development is entirely narrative if there is any. All the reviews I've seen so far just seem to be shallow regurgetations of people who were told the book was SUPPOSED to be good. It boggles my mind how &quot;The Makioka Sisters&quot; won ANY awards at all. It is more of a rambaling history of every little thing that happens to a family who you really get no attatchment to at all, wether the details are relevant or not. If you insist on reading this book, check it out from the library, and save yourself some money."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"I bought this book because Min Jin Lee, authore of \\"Free Food for Millionaires,\\" identified it as one of her favorite books (along with more well-known Western classics like \\"Vanity Fair\\" and \\"Jude the Obscure\\"). \\"Free Food for Millionaires,\\" \\"Vanity Fair,\\" \\"Jude the Obscure,\\" and \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" are all \\"novels of progress\\": they follow a protaganist (or, as in the case of The Makioka Sisters, a family) through social class struggles; these novels are about oppportunity, lack of it, economic reality, and personal dignity.I find The Makioka Sisters to be a less than compelling novel. The central question, \\"Who will the third sister marry?\\" is just not very interesting; the young woman seems completely uninterested in any of her suitors, and they in her. Marriage is nothing but a way to secure social status; the only things that matter about the suitors are age, any previous marriages, existing children, salary, employer, and family status. None of them seems particularly passionate, opinionated, funny, ambitious. None of them has any discernible personality.The Makioka sisters are similarly bland and lifeless. None of them seems to have been touched by sexual desire (except possibly the youngest sister, whose scandalous romance, a family embarrassment, is referred to as a social liability for the family and not as a glorious fling or a fulfilling passion).None of the sisters seems to want anything out of life except to cling as much as possible to the prominent social status their family once enjoyed. None of them seems to love their husbands or friends or children. They seem to desire only \\"proper behavior\\" from those closest to them. The remote possibility that a woman might actually want something for herself is hinted at in the youngest sister, who has a bit of a career of her own, a little spending money, and possible secret liasons; but her main job is to contain her indiscretions in the margins of her sisters' more formal and acceptable lives.Honestly, I love Henry James's novels, so no one can accuse me of needing a fast-paced plot, or a lot of steamy sex, to stay interested in a book. I can be hooked by beautiful writing alone. But the main characters in this book are so stiff and lifeless, and the things they care about so dead and hollow, that -- despite my admiration for Min Jin Lee -- I just can't stay focused on it. I keep picking up other novels, and then trying to force myself to get back to this snooze-fest.The only thing about this book that I can recommend is its anthropological value. In The Makioka Sisters, you learn curious details about the bizarre vetting process to which prospective brides and grooms subjected each other in 1930s Japan. At one point, a suitor thinks the prospective bride looks thin and pale, and worries she might have TB, so she submits to a chest X ray to prove that her lungs are clear. Then her fmaily hires an investigator to find out more about the suitor's family, discovers that his mother is senile, and calls off the match because of \\"insantiy\\" in his family.This intrusive, clinical, ruthless approach to matchmaking is completely unlike anything I've encountered in Western culture. The notion that you might want to like your spouse, or at least tolerate them physically so that you can have sex and possibly children with them, does not even appear on the horizon (except obliquely, in the form of the concern that the suitors not look too much older than the bride). The Makioka Sisters is a curiosity, sort of like The Tale of Genji: something you read just to get a glimpse of how other cultures play the mating game.But if you want a great read, go buy Free Food for Millionaires."},{"Title":"The Makioka sisters","review":"When taken into context of the environment, this book does afine job of portraying the demise of the aristocratic class.

What, you didn't know about this hole? Or are you thinking, 'Silly person, do you mean a hole in the ozone layer?'. Nope. B. Alexander Agnew knows about this hole because it's the entrance to our Hollow Earth!

Not even his buddies at the History or Discovery Channels, which broadcast & sometimes produce nonsensical \\"documentaries\\" about topics like this, were willing to pay him for this \\"educational adventure\\" opportunity.No wonder the United States continues to sink lower & lower on global lists of general knowledge by the public on such topics as the sciences and mathematics!Books like this one connect with that group of people who whole-heartedly believe in alien abduction, ghosts & psychics, and that ALL cancers can be cured by lowering (or is it raising?) the pH of your blood and lots of veggies.Pa-thetic!"},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years: New Discoveries and Light on the Creation","review":"This is a great book.

The Nephilim did not come from another planet, they were born here in a rebellious act against God by the sons of God and the daughters of men. Yes, the church has not fully understood Genesis 6 because the time was not right. But with the advent of human cloning, our understanding is increasing.

It didn't take me long to read several pages of each chapter in this book before I tossed it back upon the book store shelf. As someone who is extremely knowledgeable of the Scriptures (I have actually read the Bible), I can always discern the difference between those who \\"allege\\" to have read the Bible and those who really have. People who buy into the outrageous claims made in \\"The Ark of Millions of Years\\" have quite simply and quite obviously never read so much as a single chapter of the Bible, otherwise they would instantly recognize the author's unsubstantiated hype and fictitious claims.

He entered the Air Force in 1973, where he graduated top in his class in electronics engineering. As a physicist, he is the most accomplished pioneers (sic) of ground probing radar technology in the world. This technology is currently utilized in the Mars Express program.An author of thousands of technical papers, booklets, or video documentaries Dr. Agnew has joined with veteran archaeologist EJ Clark to produce the most comprehensive book ever written on Intelligent Design and the creation of the Earth. Thousands of readers call it the greatest story on the universe. Their self-published non-fiction work became a national best seller in less than 60 days. His philosophy is, \\"Everything we do will eventually affect the universe. Do it on purpose.\\"Wow! What a smart guy. Yet when I do an internet search for my dad, who is a real PhD in plant physiology, I get dozens of entries despite the fact that he has been retired for ten years. When I search for Brooks A. Agnew (or variations) I only get the one entry; his book Arc of a Million years. Kind of strange for a guy who invented a cool radar technology and published \\"thousands\\" of scientific papers, etc. But the fact that he is lying about his bio should come as no surprise. Why else would someone mention they were raised \\"near\\" the Jet Propulsion Laboratory? His credentials are as bogus as his book and his book is only for the gullible."},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years: New Discoveries and Light on the Creation","review":"The authors go far beyond Z. Sitchin's research. They quote from recently discovered ancient texts which I am not familiar with and reference native prophecies as well. They also frequently quote from the Zohar (kabbalistic work) and manuscripts found by Joseph Smith (founder of the Mormons). Certainly makes for a lively mental upheaval, depending on how wedded you are to your current mind set!In essence, they propose that there were TWO EARTHS. Both experienced a great flood/destruction. The more celestial globe was the home of the primordial Adam and descendents down to Noah who prepared his ark on the celestial Earth. Meanwhile on the terrestrial Earth, nearly all people perished (most likely due to a cometary/planet fly by and its disruptions). The two earths and human cultures merged. The first part of the book explains how Noah's earth could have traveled through a higher dimension into this one, based on black holes, time warps, etc.They plan another book (volume two) early in 2006. Possibly the process of Earth changes we are currently experiencing are symbolized by the two Earths coming out of synch and eventually splitting apart. Sounds to me like Lynn Grabhorn's Planet Two. (This is based on their radio interviews, probably to be included in Volume 2.)Best wishes,Frances McKenzieMinneapolis MN"},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years: New Discoveries and Light on the Creation","review":"Firstly, I don't trust any of the other reviews for this book as they are just too enthusiastic. Either this was the first book of cosmogony they all ever read, or they are in league with the sales dept. That being said, I would also point out that I never trust a supposed \\"academic work\\", where the type and spacing are designed for a four year old. Obviuosly the target demographic welcomes such large type and spacing, but I find it insulting. Now, this is the second book of this nature that I have encountered which attempts to camoflage religious dogma by throwing in some quasi scientific jargon, in this case lofty concepts like magnetism and polarities, real heavy stuff right? It goes on in this highly technical fashion to bolster the Noah and the ark story, of which it spends a good portion of the book on. So, there is the big tip off, as it were. This is not a book about the ancient secrets of humanity, but an affirmation of Jewish adopted Sumarian fairy tales.It also goes on about the heavenly dimensions, and the planet Kolob, a planet I've never heard about in any astronomy course. So, we know now the the Mormons are behind the book, and that pretty much ruins the day for me. I'll still slough through the thing because unless I really find a book horrible, I always finish it. It's good to get an idea of the mindset behind the Mormons at any rate. I had no idea they were so cosmic, so to speak. I'm mean, there are a lot of people out there walking around with these bubble headed extradimensional concepts in them. I thought Christians were bad, but this is a whole different level of fanciful planetary consciousness. And one of them is running for pres.!The key my friends, is objectivity. Observation and objectivity. Is there enough water on the planet to cover the whole planet and then disappear? No. Did the Chinese race, and all the other diffenet races mutate in the last 9500 years since the ark? No. I have no doubt that their have been cataclysms and meteor impacts that have caused devastation to the planet. Or that similiar instances gave rise to these stories. But like most Bible tales, they are used to captivate and ensnare young minds into a life of obedience and thoughtlessness. So, don't count on this book opening any unlocked treasures of history for the truly objective mind."},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years: New Discoveries and Light on the Creation","review":"Mr. Burton of Colorado, who gave a one star rating to THE ARK OF MILLIONS OF YEARS, was apparently careless in his reading.On page 333 of The Ark of Millions of Years, it reads:\\"The Nephilim were the fallen angels, cast out of heaven after rebelling against God. The word Nephal means, \\"to fall\\" and means \\"the fallen one.\\" Their leader was also a fallen Son of God, Lucifer (Satan). The Nephilim came from a class of angels called \\"the watchers\\", and not all watchers fell. The souls derived from the union of the Nephilim and mortal women were called the \\"mixed multitude\\" and consisted of five categories: Nephilim, Gibborim, Anakim, Rephaim and Amalekites. All giant tribes were of one of these categories or of one of a branch of these categories, which were of different names. When these angels were cast out of heaven, they came to both the spiritual and temporal creations.\\"This all seems pretty clear to me. I gave the book a five star rating and ordered two more!!

If you suspect that 2+2 isn't always 4 and are willing to \\"keep an open mind\\", this book is for you. If at the end of your reading you find that 2+2 is really 5 and that you have been lied to all your life, then this book has done its job...at least in your case.The fact that this book is only \\"Volume One\\", has to be some kind of perverse attempt to test the limits of just how much nonsense the rational human mind can tolerate without causing spontaneous human combustion.Of the dozens and dozens of available books that lend significant verifiable clues to the subject of creation, that are coherent, well documented, thoughtfully written and that are careful in their attempt to separate fact from fiction, this book stands apart as being, instead, an extreme example of the absurd, and as such, eliminates itself from inclusion in the category of rational thought."},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years: New Discoveries and Light on the Creation","review":"I'd like to preface by saying that I have not, and do not intend on buying this book, although I did have a chance to flip through some of it online. Also, I consider myself to be religiously tolerant since I know what its like to experience bigotry, so Ill try to tread lightly. That being said, I don't know who could take this book seriously after that asinine synopsis. The summary provided sounds like its just trying to sell as many copies as possible with no concern for faith, and in the grandiose exaggerations manages to promise the answers to life, the world, and even the universe!! And all this is claimed to be supported by science and research, mind you. You'd think that if truly accurate and supportable answers to the universe's questions were available, more people would have heard about it. Maybe its not as obvious to others.. Oh well. The point here is not to bash this book though, as much as it is to plead for people to stop fighting for or against a religion or religious beliefs on an amazon book review. Even this book deserves the right to exist, so don't attack the ideals that it speaks of, but rather leave it be and quietly snicker to yourself about how poor the actual scientific rigor is in this book.

Another important character is the knight Gawan.The epic is written in forceful, violent and colourful sentences, sometimes worth the surrealistic demoniac paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. It paints the not always heroic or galant deads of the chivalry of the Middle Ages with ordinary brawls, tournaments and other (love) contests. The highlight is the masterful and vivid description of the nearly unsurmountable difficulties for the capture of 'Chastel Merveile' (the Marvellous Castle).This epic is also not what Nietzsche said about Wagner's opera 'Rome without the text', for the author states that 'today very few people want to change earthly wealth for heavenly glory. I do not know one man, or one woman.'This ambitious and impressive work is by any means one of the highlights of world literature."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"...the Grail - or Gral - was a stone. Yep. It had the magic power of filling your glass and providing you with high quality cuisine.Wolfram Von Eschenbach's Parzifal, written in the 12th Century (when knights still really did joust and women still really did wear wimples), will disappoint anyone determined to discover the hidden secrets of the Templars. Instead it illuminates in rich and exhuberant detail the desires and concerns of the aristocratic Germans of Wolfram's class while telling a timeless story of spiritual development. Parzifal, the child who knows nothing of knightly ways makes mistakes, but slowly, by learning to understand them, grows into the not-too-perfect knight who achieves the Gral through compassion.For a modern reader who is really interested in the period it is full of fun insights into Mediaeval life - have you ever considered how rusty one gets in armour? Wolfram's ideas about women, people of colour and Muslims might surprise you too.If, however, you're not patient enough to deal with many a joust or details of kinship lovingly described, I think this won't be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"Wolfram von Eschenbach gives us a glimpse into the fantasy life of the 12th century noble. His romance of Parzival, based on Chretien de Troyes Arthurian works, is the modern day equivalent of an action movie - the plot is unbelievable but the settings, ideas and characters reveal much about the society for which it was produced.The story tells the tale of how Parsival is born, becomes a knight of the Round Table and ultimately achieves the Grail, which, it turns out, is not Joseph of Arimathea's chalice but is rather a stone. The text does not actually dwell on the description of the Grail, and aside from this oddity, follows the usual myths about the Grail quite closely. And while the Romance is entitled Parzival, he has to share his screen time almost equally with Gawan (Gawaine) who looms large in the book and generally gets all the interesting action.The Romance is often less than romantic. No stodgy Victorian drama this, it revels in violence, dirt and sexual encounters, often much more explicit than later Arthurian writings. Parzival definitely does not fit the \\"my strength is as the strength of ten because my heart is pure\\" knightly mold. One of his first acts is a rape. Gawan, noble knight that he is, basically falls in love with anything that moves including a girl who is little more than a child. Death and destruction are all part of daily life for these guys and it becomes very difficult to tell the difference between tourneys and battles. Wounds are described in detail, including the unfortunate Lord of the Grail's rather private injury.The plot largely concerns itself with tourneys and jousts, although there are definitely some interesting moments. The description of the Grail, the mystical Bed Marvelous (translated as Wonder Bed in this version) and the horrifying appearance of the sorceress Cundrie add some magic to the daily grind of hand-to-hand combat.The Arab world also plays a large role in this novel, revealing a much more complex and enlightened medieval view of Islam than is commonly thought to have existed. Of course, the author seems to think Muslims worship Jupiter but, that aside, several of the main characters are Muslim and they are usually cast in very positive roles. Clearly, being a good knight had little to do with Christianity, and Feirefiz's (Parzival's brother) conversion at the end of the book seems almost an after thought by the author. The author's approach to Christianity is none to orthodox either and Parzival actually denies the existence of God at one point only to be led back to the the truth sometime later by a kindly cleric.This translation of Parzival, originally written in German, leaves something to be desired. It often seems that the translators attempted to leave the German grammar intact. Perhaps they were seeking to leave an impression in English of the convoluted German sentence structure. Indeed, they often leave footnotes indicating that certain phrases were too tortured to translate directly and they have added information to make them more readable. The end result is that the book reads a bit like the King James Bible if you only modernized the vocabulary and left the grammar alone.The book is also published in a rather unusual format, a very narrow paperback, with two unattributed illustrations that seem to have been added at random. It also contains a fairly extensive introduction, an extended set of text notes, a list of persons, and a set of family trees. The packaging seems intended for a general audience with some attention to artistic book headings and \\"Gothic\\" fonts on maps and elsewhere.Overall, the story is fascinating both as a tale and as a way to understand how real knights viewed their ideal role models. The translation is tolerable, if difficult. The lack of an index or bibliography would not make this the best book for a scholar but, for fans of Arthurian legends who have the desire to study the early manuscripts and the persistence to get through them, this is a good read."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"An ecellent way to meet this kind of literature (I did read it also in the original mediaeval German text), in a more understandeble version!"},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"Wolfram's story of Parzival is the best of all of the &quot;quest for the Grail&quot; legends because it is the most complete and incorporates all of the older elements of a highly derived tale into one wonderfully written work. The Grail scenes are fantastic, mysterious, and captivating. The development of the characters is by far the best of all of the many versions of the tale. The adventures of Parzival are filled with fantastic creatures and outrageous events. When Parzival completes his quest, the reader is left exhausted but satisfied by Wolfram's engaging story. Highly recommended for the student of Arthurian literature or for anyone who wants to know the complete story of the Fisher King and the knight who saves him."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"There seem to be currently available three complete English translations of Wolfram von Eschenbach's Middle High German \\"Parzival,\\" an early, and slightly eccentric, version of the Grail Quest. Wolfram, both a knight and a (slightly eccentric) poet from thirteenth-century southern Germany, is the author of this long Arthurian romance, of a long Carolingian epic, \\"Willehalm,\\" and some shorter works. His complaints about rival poets, and their replies to him, have turned out to be clues to relative dating of their works. On this and external evidence, Wolfram's poetic career has been dated between about 1195 and 1225; with the almost 25,000 lines of \\"Parzival\\" being composed between about 1200 and 1210.The most recent translation, Cyril Edwards' \\"Parzival: With Titurel and the Love Lyrics,\\" I have not yet seen. It includes a fragmentary related work, and Wolfram's contributions to the \\"Minnesaenger\\" (love poetry) tradition, which makes it attractive. The price of the hardcover is against starting with it! A more reasonably-priced paperback, aimed at the student market, would be a winner, if the translation is good.Of the other two, both rendered in prose, the older is \\"Parzival: A Romance of the Middle Ages\\" (usually cited without the subtitle, in my experience), translated by Helen M. Mustard and Charles E. Passage, and published by Vintage Books (Random House), in 1961. With an Introduction, Additional Notes, an Index of Persons, and a Genealogical Table, I found it an attractive entrance to Wolfram-studies, and Middle High German literature beyond the \\"Nibelungenlied.\\" The language of the translation is relatively colloquial, and has been criticized as both inexact in its use of hunting and heraldic terms, and perhaps too American. A more valid criticism, in my opinion, pointed out that a good deal of the introduction is spent discussing discarded theories floated by Jessie L. Weston (of \\"From Ritual to Romance\\") in connection with her verse translation at the end of the nineteenth century. Since Weston's version was the one most likely to be familiar to Mustard and Passage's original readers, this made a certain amount of sense, but they might have mentioned that her views were no longer taken very seriously. The cover art is a medieval \\"portrait\\" of the armored Wolfram, anonymous under his knightly helmet.Almost twenty years later, A.T. Hatto (on whose review of the Vintage translation I have been drawing) produced his own version, in the Penguin Classics (1980); the cover art uses manuscript illuminations of scenes from the poem. Like Hatto's \\"Nibelungenlied\\" translation, it is in prose, and has, instead of an extended discussion before reading, an appended \\"Introduction to a Second Reading,\\" along with a Glossary of Personal Names, and a List of Works in English for Further Reading. The critical discussion is excellent, and postponing it until a reader has a chance to form an opinion is an interesting idea. At least the student won't be quite so tempted to substitute reading the editorial commentary for a reading of the text, if one has to look for it.Hatto's English is a bit obviously British; and some of his \\"corrected\\" readings are actually more difficult to follow, unless you are already familiar with the technical languages of hunting and blazonry. Otherwise, for example, \\" a pair\\" of birds is going to be clearer than \\"a brace\\" of them. This was not the case with Hatto's translation of the \\"Tristan\\" of Wolfram's rival, Gottfried von Strassburg (also from Penguin). The \\"Tristan\\" tradition makes a great point of how its hero uses the correct -- meaning fashionable -- hunting language, and Hatto was there, obviously, correct to reproduce the impression of mastery of an esoteric art. Either version is enjoyable, although Hatto (obviously) seems a bit more concerned with precision, and Mustard and Passage a little more with immediate appeal to readers.Wolfram himself was translating, in his own fashion, Chretien de Troyes' unfinished \\"Perceval, or, The Story of the Grail\\" -- although he himself claims to have an additional source, the mysterious \\"Kyot,\\" who had a better, truer, version. Since Chretien himself claimed to have been working from a source provided by a patron, this has at times sent scholars searching in many directions. Jessie Weston's theory, emphasizing Wolfram's references to Anjou and the Angevins, whose dynasty of Counts had come to rule England (see Henry II), was as plausible as most, and just as much a blind alley. It looks very much as if Wolfram had some sort of additional material -- there are odd resemblances to \\"Morien,\\" an apparent interpolation in the medieval Dutch translation of the Lancelot-Grail romances, for example -- but mostly to have used his imagination quite freely.We have an entire opening section with the hero's father, Gahmuret the Anschevin, having adventures in a vaguely-conceived Near East and North Africa, where he leaves a \\"pagan\\" wife and son, the latter, the multi-colored Feirefiz, crossing paths with Wolfram's main hero years later. (It is worth noting that, although Wolfram is a snob, and is fascinated by physical differences between human beings, he is in no sense a racist; color is no bar to aristocracy.) This is followed by Gahmuret's second marriage and death, the birth and upbringing in forest isolation of Parzival himself, his fateful encounter with Arthur's knights, and the splitting of the story to include the exploits of Sir Gawain (recognizable under German renderings, variously handled by translators over the years), and Parzival's first adventure at the Grail Castle, all derived from Chretien's account of Perceval and Gauvain, all retold in Wolfram's quirky style. Then Wolfram returns to what seems to be new material, writing his own conclusion. (Eric Rohmer's film version of \\"Perceval\\" is a splendid visualization of Chretien's version, and works almost equally well for parts of Wolfram's retelling, too.)As in other versions, Chretien's very mysterious \\"graal\\" is drawn into a Christian conception of the universe. But Wolfram explains it as a sort of magic stone that fell to earth during the War in Heaven, not a relic of the Last Supper. That more explicitly Christianized version seems to belong to the Old French cycle of \\"Joseph of Arimathea,\\" \\"Merlin\\" and \\"Perceval,\\" attributed to Robert de Boron, and was later picked up and amplified in the \\"Vulgate Cycle\\" of Arthurian romances (centering on Lancelot, and introducing Galahad as the Quest hero, alongside Perceval), the version known in English through Malory, and, so far as the Chalice interpretation, also used by Wagner.Wagner plundered Wolfram for names and a certain \\"German\\" quality for his Grail opera, \\"Parsifal,\\" besides using another version of a story Wolfram alludes to in \\"Lohengrin,' and the poet's name for a character in \\"Tannhauser.\\" Personally, I suggest tossing aside all Wagnerian preconceptions, if any, and allowing Wolfram's real personality to have a chance. Sarcastic (especially about competitors), sentimental (especially about wives and children), full of pride in the knightly caste (a new phenomenon, which its members wanted to be very old), arrogantly announcing that he is completely illiterate in the company of poets who boasted they could read anything ever written, he is both annoying and lovable. A living personality, in fact, appearing in a time used to anonymous authors.For those who find \\"Parzival\\" a pleasure, or who would like to try a more military, rather than chivalric, work, there are also translations of his \\"Willehalm,\\" based on the Old French *chanson de geste* of William Curt-Nose, or Guillaume l'Orange, one of the heroes of the legends of Charlemagne and his descendants. I am familiar with two, both into prose. One, by Marion E. Gibbs and Sidney M. Johnson, was published by Penguin Classics in 1984, and is currently in print, as \\"Wolfram von Eschenbach: Willehalm.\\" Charles E. Passage, one of the co-translators of \\"Parzival,\\" had earlier translated it as \\"The Middle High German Poem of Willehalm by Wolfram von Eschenbach,\\" published by Frederick Ungar in 1977. Although it is out of print, used copies of the trade paperback edition seem to be available.Curiously, the supposedly illiterate Wolfram seems unusually aware of the idea (if not the facts) of history. The \\"Pagan\\" Saracens of his French source are connected by him with the Romans (as descended from the followers of Pompey, rather than of Caesar, and heirs of an old feud), and also with the extra-European characters he had already invented for \\"Parzival.\\" He rather neatly brings into the correct sequence his versions of Arthurian and Carolingian Europe."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"Well, that's how Joe Campbell describes it, anyway. And, for those who find the language and style one finds in literature like this tolerable, Parzival is rich in symbolism, peppered by it's author's private concerns, and has a convincing account of battle here and there (Von Eschenbach was himself a tried knight at the open of the 13th century-- in fact he not-very-credibly claims to be illiterate.) If you managed Mallory, you owe it to yourself to read something with a little more depth."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"Hatto gives his usual accurate, precise and elegant English prose rendering of this classic German epic poem of the early 13th century.Wolfram's Parzival is a more coherent and well-structured narrative than the Niebelungenlied, and is more courtly and refined than the Icelandic sagas of the same era. It is a lively, colorful insight into 13th century European culture. This, along with its place in the evolution of the Arthurian and Grail legends, is its main source of interest to modern readers.Wolfram is particularly knowledgeable about military affairs and you can learn a lot from this story about what it was like (or supposed to be like) to be a knight at the time.The Grail of this story is a stone. In Chretien's earlier story, on which Wolfram's is based, the Grail was a bowl. In other stories, it doubles as the cup used by Jesus at the Last Supper and the vessel used to catch the dripping blood at the crucifixion. In our own time it has served as a boon to conspiracy theorists and an excuse to cast Sean Connery in an Indiana Jones movie. Next...well, who knows what's next?Parzival combines folk traditions - the Grail's power of providing unlimited food and drink is a favorite folk motif, most famously with the magic porridge pot - with knightly adventure, and adds a dash of mysticism. It is no more than a dash, and I think subsequent commentators have read too much into this aspect. Certainly it is a coming-of-age story and a tale of redemption, but the spiritual edifice that has since been built around it seems to me a bit of a stretch. At the time of writing this review, youth counselors in Britain are using Parzival as an allegory to teach the true meaning of manhood. Good luck to them.Although Parzival does not have the continuity errors of the Niebelungenlied, individual sentences are sometimes mangled beyond comprehension. Presumably they sounded more acceptable when recited as poetry. Hatto wisely avoids the temptation to tidy these passages up and translates them warts and all.History books can only take us so far in an understanding of a previous age. To get beneath the skin, to understand the anxieties, hopes, prejudices and beliefs of the people who lived then, we must share the stories that they told. In Parzival, we see how medieval man related to his own masculinity, his fellow man, his womenfolk and his god."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"Note: This review is from the 1961 Vintage paperback with a translation by Helen Mustard and Charles PassageWolfram von Eschenbach's early 13th century poem (rendered here from the Middle High German into modern English prose) chronicles the events of the title character's life from childhood to knighthood, and of his quest for and attainment of the Grail. Along with two chapters devoted to Parzival's father Gahmuret, and several throughout the middle of the story concerning Gawan, the book is a celebration of knighthood, most likely written from the point of view of one of its practitioners. More abstractly, it also approaches Jungian archetype territory and Joseph Campbell's ideas about Hero mythology; wrongs committed in ignorance block Parzival from obtaining the Grail when it is first revealed to him, and only after the quest's hardships have purged him of ignorance and sin is he rewarded with the earthly and spiritual sublimity of achieving his goal.The Grail of this version is interesting in and of itself: Wolfram writes before the object had become wholly associated with either the last supper or Christ's crucifixion, and long before Mallory and Tennyson (or Terry Gilliam) stamped it into the culture's consciousness as a holy cup. Instead, here it is a stone, one that has both life-sustaining properties and the power to dispense enough food to supply the entire contingent of knights and ladies stationed at Munsalvaesche (the castle of the Grail's keeping). The king of this castle, Anfortas, (also known as the Fisher King), is gravely wounded - it is only the Grail that keeps him alive, albeit in excruciating pain. In Munsalvaesche, both king and subjects wait for someone to come who will ask the king the 'healing question' ('What is it that troubles you?'). Parzival, in his youthful ignorance, stumbles upon the castle and is shown the wonders of the Grail, but in order not to appear foolish, keeps his peace instead of asking the question that will bring the king relief. The following morning, he awakes to find his host gone, and as he rides out after him, he discovers that he can no longer find his way back to the castle. For the next four and a half years he wanders, dishonored, searching for the Grail. Only when the Grail calls to him, by virtue of Parzival's name appearing in writing on the stone, does his quest end.There are several different translations of 'Parzival' available, including this one by Mustard and Passage written in 1961. A.T. Hatto translated it forPenguin Classicsin 1980, and in 2009,Oxford World's Classicspublished another version by Cyril Edwards. Using the look inside feature, I compared several paragraphs side by side, and, although I suspect that they all have strengths and weaknesses, if I were forced to pick based on this tiny sample, I would probably go with the Hatto. But, as they are all priced similarly, the Oxford edition has the advantage of including a secondary work, which may make it the best value.Translations aside, the question remains as to whom to recommend this work, aside from medievalists and scholars. Grail researchers will also be interested, but anyone attempting this book should know it not an effortless read - nowhere near as difficult as Chaucer's Canturbury Tales or Beowulf, the translators do still attempt to reproduce Wolfram's style, and all three translations I looked at mimic an older structural and syntactical arrangement. A brief example, as Parzival rides into Munsalvaesche for the first time:'Little gaiety had there been here for many a day; the knights were too sad of heart. Yet they did not let Parzival feel this, and welcomed him, young and old alike. Many pages ran out to seize the bridle of his horse, each one trying to be the first, and held his stirrup for him to dismount. Some knights bade him enter the castle, and led him to his chamber, where they quickly and skillfully removed his armor. When they then looked upon the youth, with his boy's face, still beardless, and saw how beautiful he was, they confessed that he was indeed richly blessed.' (Mustard and Passage)Some readers may find the re-telling of 'Parzival' byLindsay Clarkeeasier on the eye and ear (although there is no 'look inside' to see for sure) - and evenKatherine Paterson'sversion for younger readers may be all the 'Parzival' that anyone really needs. Still, there is an inherent medieval atmosphere in the translations that attempt to replicate the original author's style which is missing in Ms. Patterson's re-telling, although it's difficult to know how much currency that carries with it. I would probably recommend the others over the re-telling simply because it feels more 'authentic' - but these are translations we're talking about, so none of them are really any more authentic than the other.In the end, I found 'Parzival' worthwhile mostly because I appreciate the familiarity with a foundational piece of Western literature, and also because I find it enjoyable to recognize links between modern era literature and its source material. I realize that that is a very narrow recommendation - I did like the book, but I wouldn't have considered it a five-star experience. But, then again, as far as star ratings go, it seems ludicrous to assign a value to a work that has survived over 800 years. My way around it is to give everything over 500 years old an automatic five stars, even if I feel four is a better reflection of how it affected me - so there you have it."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"Is this the greatest \\"novel\\" ever written? - the most beautifully written insight into the threefold nature of mankind via the Grail journeys of Pazival, Gawain, and Feirefiz."},{"Title":"The Romance of Parzival and the Holy Grail","review":"I became interested in this book through the works of Joseph Campbell who often made reference to it.

(If only the British and German package tourists who have colonized and defaced Mallorca in the 20th century had read Sand beforehand!)An added pleasure in this edition is the sniping and meticulous footnoting by Mallorcan expat Robert Graves. He gainsays and qualifies nearly every contentious little gripe of Sand's, providing the reader with an interesting cross-generational literary (and personal) cat/dog-fight.My guess is, if you enjoy the withering observations of Paul Theroux and his disciples, you will enjoy Sand's nasty little book.

It is the compelling diary of a Dutch Jewish journalist who was imprisoned for over a year in a transit camp in Westerbork, Holland, where thousands waited to be channeled to an unknown fate in German and Polish concentration camps.Westerbork was run, from its inception, almost entirely by the Jewish inmates. Mechanicus documents in his diary the tragic result of this autonomy: harmony and solidarity were replaced by animosity in a futile and demoralizing power struggle to gain key positions and thereby escape the dreaded deportation lists.Arrested in September, 1942, for not wearing the compulsory yellow star, Mechanicus assigned himself the role of camp chronicler and secretly kept this journal throughout his stay at Westerbork. When he was brought in, the camp was officially called a \\"labor camp.\\" Later, the name changed to \\"transit camp,\\" and finally to \\"dispersal camp\\" as its purpose became horribly clear.Mechanicus' diary outlines the bizarre social and political structure of Westerbork, and his own unwitting involvement in the frequent intrigues. As the war progressed, subtle changes in mood and attitude ran through the camp. The early optimism and faith in a quick peace (\\"Britain and America could put an end to the war in a short time, but they don't want to...\\"); the early smugness of the German Jews, which later turned into panic as they learned they were going to an even more hostile country; the sporadic bursts of interest in concerts, tea parties, burlesque, sports; the disgust and triviality of communal life; and the final bewildering realization that there was no exit.Philip Mechanicus was deported on March 8, 1944. On October 9 he was sent to Auschwitz. From statements made by survivors, it is assumed that Mechanicus was shot along with 120 fellow prisoners on October 12, 1944."},{"Title":"Year of fear;: A Jewish prisoner waits for Auschwitz","review":"Philip Mechanicus uses his journalist's powers of observation to paint a painfully real portrait of life for people who were so soon to be robbed of theirs. I do wish he had written more about himself, his personal torment as he watched his friends deported week after week, but the book is nonetheless an exceptional account. So many voices were lost to history during the Holocaust; Philip Mechanicus brings those voices back to us in his diary. You must read this book, if you have any interest in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Year of fear;: A Jewish prisoner waits for Auschwitz","review":"The diary of a middle-aged Dutch Jewish man in Westerbork, the Nazi transit camp for Dutch Jews en route to the East. Philip Mechanicus, a journalist by profession, deliberately recorded in detail all aspects of camp life, and his diary is one of the major sources for Westerbork.The camp sounds fairly okay, as Nazi camps go. Food appears to have been fairly sufficient, for example, there was recreation, and families were allowed considerable contact with one another. Mechanicus notes: \\"The great multitude live on as they did at home, in the midst of all their suffering. They eat and drink and make love. The food is frugal, the drink is ersatz [artificial] and the love is unnatural. There is music... Artists, usually dilettantes, exercise their talent... Men and women play bridge together or skat... Men and women go visiting, just as at home, and have tea with one another.\\" But there was the terrible overcrowding and resultant noise, filth and disease, and the ever-present threat of being put on a transport to Poland. Everyone knew that to be put on such a transport was bad, but no one seemed to realize that it was synonymous with death. Mechanicus managed to remain in Westerbork for a year and a half, an extraordinarily long length of stay, but eventually he too was sent to Auschwitz and killed.The diary was difficult for me to read and took a long time, given its length. I wish it had been broken up by the month. There isn't even a demarcation for the year; the entries for December 1943 and January 1944 are on the same page without any comment on the turning of the year, besides the change in dates. I wish also that the introduction had provided more information about Mechanicus. I know from the diary that he had an Aryan ex-wife and at least one child by her, but nothing whatsoever is said about his personal life in the intro.I learned a lot about Westerbork from this diary. I would recommend it, especially for comparison with diaries from other camps and ghettos like Theresienstadt, Lodz, etc."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette is a young woman entering a monastery.

Ten stars!"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Upon her entry as a postulant into the Priory of the Sisters of the Crucifixion, 17-year old Mariette Baptiste corrects a nun who mispronounces her name. The first syllable, she says, doesn't sound \\"like a [female] horse,\\" but rather like a \\"flaw\\" (p. 15).This interchange sets the stage for the mystery that lies at the heart of this skillfully crafted novel, which I recently reread and enjoyed even more than I did the first time around. After just a few weeks in the convent, Mariette begins to experience visions (\\"ecstasies\\") that eventually culminate in stigmata. Some of her sister-nuns, as well as the ancient priest who says mass and hears confessions at the convent, take the stigmata seriously, and soon fall into a near-veneration of Mariette. Others, either out of envy or credulity, believe that Mariette is mutilating herself. Regardless, though, the entire convent community's quiet, regular, low-keyed life is so disrupted that Mariette is finally expelled from the order.The obvious question raised by novelist Ron Hansen is whether Mariette's experiences are really \\"spiritual\\" or merely \\"psychological.\\" There's good reason to think the latter: Mariette is under great emotional stress (her father disapproves of her religious vocation, her older sister has just died, she wants desperately to become a saint), and the erotic tension throughout the celibate convent--not to mention within Mariette's own body--is palpable (at one point--pp. 82-85--the sisters perform a skit based on the Song of Songs that clearly allows them to safely act out their sexual desires). Mariette, seething with religious fervor and sexual frustration, is indeed \\"flawed.\\" So it's easy to surmise that her visions and stigmata may indeed be hysteria.But more profound questions raised by Hansen's novel are these: could it be that physical and psychological flaws are catalysts rather than disqualifications for genuine spiritual experiences--that God works with broken vessels? If so, why? Because such vessels are poor in spirit? And if God does work through human flaws, how can one distinguish hysteria and histrionics from genuine visions and somatic manifestations? Surely not all human flaws are used by God.In raising these sorts of questions, Hansen moves the reader beyond simple black/white thinking--religious ecstasies are either real or fake--to a more subtle, more complex, and more authentic examination of the spiritual life in particular and human experience in general. And he does it with such grace, mystery, and occasional poignancy that the characters quiver with life.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette in Ecstasy is a wonderful piece of long poetry; though it is refered to as a 'novel' on the cover.Each scene is finely and exquisitely detailed from the weather down to the little noises within the silence of prayer. Ron Hansen has written a feast for the senses, the imagination and even the soul in it's vague, yet insigtful descriptions of devotional religious ectasy. -That's what I really liked about this novelWhat bothered me was the lack of action. pages and pages would go by without anything really significant occuring, the story seemed to be going stagnate near the middle.. In my opinion, the novel does little to keep the reader interested, to keep them turning pages and reading. There are no mystery's to be unraveled and very little fresh blood to keep the narrative interesting and moving.But the above, of course, is partly due to my own biases. I love stories with intense emotion and unique characters and while the authors super-sensual poetic style of writing theroghly engaged my imaginatioin and put me right there into each scene, the lack of action and intense emotion failed to keep me there. However, despite all of this, I think any religious person with a relationship with God would really appreciate the the spiritual aspect of the book. Sometimes after readind it, I felt a little closer to God myself.If you're in to stories that get your blood pumping and engage your intellect while firering your emotions, Mariette in Ecstasy probably isn't for you. But if you want to relax and read some most beautiful and poetic prose, to fully live in each scene of this story; then by all means get this book, it should give you hours upon hours of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I'm not even quite finished reading this fine book, but had to comment! It's a poignant work, and so descriptive that I feel like I'm not even reading, but am there! I'm no longer just 'reading a book' but really present, almost like a ghost shadow following Mariette. Bravo! to this fine author, fellow Nebraskan and best yet, fellow \\"Omahan.\\" I would hope there would be more like this coming from Ron's insightful,thoughtful,reflective and creative genius."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I was initially intrigued by the premise of the book: a nun with stigmata. But the first thing that captured me was the gorgeous writing of the author, Ron Hansen. Then there is the amazing story of Mariette, a young girl, totally in love with Christ, who wants nothing in life but to join the cloistered nunnery where her older sister is the Prioress. She is admitted and soon astounds the other nuns with her saintliness, her kindness and humility. She prays constantly and soon goes into ecstasy in her prayers. Soon, it is discovered she has bleeding hands and feet, like the wounds of Christ, the Stigmata. Now the division comes, as some nuns venerate her, but others think she is faking it, among whom is the new Prioress. She is physically tormented by the devil and bears all with humility. Eventually, she is expelled because she \\"stirs up\\" the other nuns too much. 30 years pass, till her final letter to the new Prioress in which she writes that she still follows the convent's rituals, and loves Christ as much as ever. Then, what puzzles me, is the final few words in which she says \\"Christ tells me to surprise Him.\\" I have no idea why Christ would say this to her and I wish the author would explain."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This was ambitious of Hansen, who has labored skillfullly but without distinction in general. Worth the read, though without the profundity the subject matter might suggest. I am waiting for Hansen to break out with his masterwork (and beginning to worry that he is satisfied to interest and intrigue us without realizing his full potential)."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen certainly went about a lot of research in order to put this book together, which as far as I can tell is a fairly accurate portrayal of an early 20th century convent in upstate New York. Unfortunately for me, I tend to like books that have some closure, and therefore I was not overly fond of this novel. The enigma that surrounds the main character, while enchanting at first becomes merely annoying, in that a reader isn't sure of what is really going on. Perhaps Hansen has a reason for this, but to a reader who is also a writer, I felt as though Hansen wasn't always sure himself what was happening to his characters."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Magical. Ignore the amazon.com reviewer's comment, &quot;Since the reader never doubts...&quot; That's not true. This is one of my favorites of All Time, on my lifelong top ten. Up there with &quot;The Discovery of Light,&quot; by J.P. Smith, and &quot;Was,&quot; by Geoff Ryman."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I listened to the taped version of Mariette in Ecstasy, read by Barbara Caruso. Caruso's mellow, British-accented voice is easy to listen to, and in this book she reads with pretty much the same intonation throughout the story, rather somber, and an unvaried rhythm. This gives the story a subdued, somber tone. I never sense a smile in her voice, nor can I ever remember a smile or humor mentioned in the plot.Yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, the story is well written, but I found it boring at times, as the new nun, Mariette was droningly instructed on the rules of religion and of the convent by the elder sisters. The story became more interesting when her stigmata appeared, and as the reactions of the other nuns became stronger, their emotions ranging from belief and adoration of her, to jealousy, disgust, and rejection. The inspection of her body as she stood naked before the priest and nuns was compelling, but just when it seems you should be sympathizing with this injustice, the results of the inspection suddenly force you to doubt Mariette's entire experience.At the end of the book, as Mariette is contemplating her days as a nun, there is still no indication if the experience was real or not, and this is probably as it should be, since the author wasn't there himself to inspect her &quot;wounds&quot;. So the question of whether stigmata is a real phenomena or not is never answered. Rather, more valuable in this story is the exploration of the varied reactions of the nuns and priests... some believers in Mariette's experience, and some not; some kind to her, and some bitter, and not displaying a very &quot;Christian&quot; disposition.This short book could be a good introduction into the phenomena of stigmata, and the life of a convent, but if I really wanted to know more about these subjects, it'd probably be more profitable to go to a non-fiction source, or a longer novel that explores these subjects in more depth. I enjoyed &quot;Atticus&quot; by this same author much more."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Much to my surprise, this is a book very easy to set down and down and down. The structure of the book is innovative and effective. Each of the three sections begins by setting the scene not through coherent sentences but through sentence pieces which describe precisely and poetically the scene. The sense is very similar to how a participant would observe the scene.The plot is built through a series of short entries of days identified by their religious calendar designation. Interspersed are snippets of an after-the-fact investigation into the events surrounding the postulate Mariette. The excerpts of spiritual readings (lectio divina) accompanying the meals are used to establish the mind-set in which the events occur. This complex structure melds into very readable prose that presents the characters and plot in an interesting and effective manner.Unfortunately, the characters, even prominant characters, are not given sufficient personality to become truly human - they state their emotions rather than display them. This causes the reader to question if the author knows whether the events at the center of the novels - the stigmata of Mariette - are real, the result of hysteria, or self-inflicted. This causes the multiple responses to the stigmata to appear arbitrary - not the outgrowth of experience and personality.Reading this novel never causes one to care about the characters or reflect upon the questions raised by the novel. Only the writing style keeps the reader's attention."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen is among the best writers delving into unusual real-life historical situations, and trying to make sense of them. Mariette is a pretty 17 year old drawn to the convent, who immediately becomes a special, vision influenced, faith inspired, stigmatized True Believer. Many of the older nuns are skeptical (to say the least), while the younger ones are in awe. Mr. Hansen's guides us right into the heart and soul of this Catholic community, and of course Mariette. After reading this book, one feels a certain understanding of this potential saint, and how religion may become an obsession. I would personally agree with her physician / father, the scientific skeptic, but Mariette's story is certainly believable in the hands of a fine writer like Mr. Hansen!"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"With the advent of the year 2000 and with our thoughts turned to the other-worldly it may be time to remember that &quot;God gives us just enough to seek Him, and never enough to fully find Him. To do more would inhibit our freedom, and our freedom is very dear to God.&quot; Read this novel and find out how God's showing too much of Himself can cause a split in a community of His most faithful."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"There are two types of bad books. Reading the first type is like pulling teeth - each page is a chore. Reading the second type, like Mariette in Ecstasy, goes quickly. You rapidly turn pages, thinking something will happen any paragraph now. But it never does. At the end of the book, you feel cheated and teased. Such is this book."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I was so disappointed with this book.The style is too precious, almost painful. In parts, it feels like a take-off from the many books written on the life of the Little Flower (including the character of an indulgent father). So Mariette's story is hardly surprising and not as inspiring as that of the original Saint Therese.I'm not so much bothered by the novel's hanging ending as by the lack of worth of the alleged mystical experiences. Charismatic gifts of the Holy Spirit - whether mystical, contemplative, prophetic, or active charitable works - are given for the good and service of the Church. There is no hint of that whatsoever in this novel. This is a soft erotic novel dressed in a contemplative habit."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I am going to make an absurd comparison without any absurdity and with the utmost in relevance. Pornography is defined as being sexually explicit material that has the sole purpose of causing sexual arousal. However, what is not defined with it is the fact that such arousal has not the preferred means of indulgence, meaning that one has to seek efforts by oneself to release the tension of sex. Now for the absurdity (which I shall approach from my usual standpoint of faithless cynicism and utter lack of belief in the common \\"miracle\\"): Mariette in Ecstasy is about Religious Porn, and a convent full of nuns indulging in Religious Masturbation to said Religious Porn. How this works is simple, especially through Mariette. She spends her time at the convent doing nothing bad, then going to the priest for confession and seemingly dreaming up all of these amazing terrible sins that she committed (terrible being that she had negative thought about dinner, or forgot to flagellate herself, or something). All of the nuns do this, this is their masturbation. Their porn is in the stories of saints, or their Latin prayers and songs, or when one of their number turns up with a stigmata.Mariette in Ecstasy is brilliantly crafted book. Ron Hansen does a spectacular job of setting the stage for the really interesting contrast between human pleasures and spiritual pleasures, and the even more interesting point of how similar they really are. The infrastructure the convent in the book is thorough and in everyway complete, and the precision of the individual characters of the nuns is spectacularly demonstrative of Hansen's writing ability. The monotony of the book gets old really fast, though the use of it is such that it helps in the understanding of the convent life, and how much the appearance of the stigmata really shook all of the nuns out of their dull schedule. It is a very original book, and one worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen's Mariette in Ecstasy was very strange and intriguing all at once. You are really being inundated by eroticism, blasphemy and evil all mixed up in religion, yet through Hansen's elegant prose the novel is transformed into a beautiful love story between Mariette and Christ. Hansen carries his readers through the Communion railing and into the church of Our Lady of Sorrows.We are never informed as to whether Mariette was merely lying, insane are truly chosen to suffer for Christ, we are only left to discern that for ourselves. For me the last two paragraphs was a wonderful summary for this whole novel. Mariette truly suffered for Christ in her own mind. Mariette's decision to dedicate her life to Christ was a matter of mind, body and soul. She would do whatever she had to do to be a servant of Christ. For this Mariette was despised and envied. All of this from other nuns: the brides of Christ?Some thirty years latter she still hobbled (injury to her feet?) and would lose the hold in her hands (injury to her hands?). On the outside of the convent Mariette reflects on what she believes to be God's confirmation that she suffered then and suffers now (by being despised) for Christ. Now instead of finding the beauty of God inside the cloister, Mariette is seeing God's beauty in his creation (he still sends her roses) and she realizes that in return for her love he has given her freedom from \\"RELIGION.\\""},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"That Ron Hansen has a career as a writer is beyond my comprehension. The only thing worse than this book is the B movie based on it."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I was quite surprised at this book after reading it in a single day. It's not a long book (only 179 pages) but it wasn't what I expected. I wanted a more intricate story with sub-plots and more controversy. It's clear that Catholic convents had strict rules in the early 20th Century. It took me into a loop when Mariette has a stigmatic experience that no one took seriously; whereby, she was dismissed from becoming a nun. The story really lacked a good plot and there were too many SISTERS in the story. One is better off finding the excellent film, THE MAGDALENE SISTERS (which is based on a true story). The writing by author Ron Hansen cannot be overlooked as he does have a special style. This was a National Bestseller in 1991. I think a lot of readers were intriged and 'let down' by the title alone. Oh well...it added a completely new subject as a follow-up to my last book (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN--Haha)."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen's MARIETTE IN ECTASY is yet another work that I have stumbled across (is there really such a thing as an accident...?) that will go onto my mental shelf of the finest books I've read. It's a testament to Hansen's imagination and writing skills that a story set in a convent in upstate New York in 1906 could be so compelling, so deeply moving, so filled with achingly crafted images that reveal everyday things in such a new light. The cloistered sisters, seen by outsiders as drab and similar in appearances, blossom in Hansen's hands as distinct individuals, their characters as varied and deeply developed as any in fiction. Their devotion, their hopes and fears, their humor, their emotions are all brought to life vividly -- and with the arrival of seventeen year-old Mariette into their midst as as aspiring postulant, everything about their lives changes.Mariette -- blood sister of the current prioress -- is a very devout girl, given to episodes of ecstacy. Her father, a physician, decribes her as being perhaps 'too highly strung' for a religious calling. She is a naturally beautiful young woman -- and this fact alone arouses a bit of jealousy and suspicion among her sisters-to-be. As her ecstatic experiences increase in both frequency and occurrance, some of these suspicions deepen -- and we can see a veritable wall rise up dividing those in the order who love and adore her, taking her experiences as fact, and those who are certain that she is a charlatan, taking them all for a ride.Which group is correct? The reader must come to this conclusion in his or her own way -- Hansen tells this story so wonderfully, leaving us to decide. He draws no firm, easy answers for us. This is not a Hollywood film story, all tied up nicely with a bow -- this is a story intended to make us think, to consider its events for ourselves, filtering it as we must, each through the beliefs, imaginations and intellects which we have developed over the courses of our lives. This is that rare level of writing that is honoring to its readers -- it tells a beautiful, meaningful story without hammering home a preconceived point. It respects our intelligence, at the same time being enormously entertaining."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Each day is the same for the cloistered Sisters of the Crucifixion in the early 1900s in upstate New York. The nuns pray, work, study--day after day. Each nun has a specialty, a job that she does best: candlemaker, wine maker, cook, arts teacher, seamstress, gardener, etc.The book begins as the lovely, elegant, 17-year-old Mariette enters the convent to begin her probationary/postulant period. She lived nearby with her widowed father, a doctor, and we later learn that her much-older sister is the prioress, Mother Celine. Mariette's father is very much opposed to her becoming a nun. In fact, he has written a letter stating all of the reasons that she is not suitable for convent life.It seems that Mariette is adapting well to life in the convent until she begins falling into trances and emerges with bleeding wounds (stigmata) on various parts of her body, wounds that cannot be logically explained. The community of nuns becomes divided in their opinion of whether these are signs from God or self-inflicted by Mariette.In this book, Hansen paints a complete picture of life in the convent and the doubts that assail all people of faith. His characterizations were very well done, in the sparsest of prose, yet in great detail. The book was beautifully and lovingly written and read almost like poetry rather than prose.&quot;Mariette in Ecstasy&quot; provides an examination of faith and miraculous/divine happenings. Hansen also looks at the way these happenings impact those who are &quot;blessed&quot; by them, as well as how the communities around them are affected. Hansen draws no conclusions, makes no judgments, and attains no closure. This is left up to the reader after closing the book.It is hard to believe that this is the same author who wrote &quot;Atticus&quot;.

In so doing, he raises fascinating questions about how we would react to miracles, were we to witness them, and about why those miracles might occur.In 1906, seventeen year old Mariette Baptiste enters an upstate New York convent, joining the order of The Sisters of the Crucifixion. Pretty, pious, and personable, she quickly becomes the darling of the place, even though these same traits, and the fact that the Mother Superior is her sister, inspire some jealousy and even forbidden lusts. Since her confirmation, at age thirteen, Mariette has had a calling and has heard the voice of Christ speaking to her, preparing her for some great events. So she, and some of the nuns who love her, are prepared when, upon the death of her sister, Mariette is afflicted with stigmata. But others, particularly those who have resented her anyway, are less willing to accept the miraculous nature of these happenings, suspecting Mariette of an attention-seeking hoax. And when the wounds are healed just as suddenly as they appeared, both sides see this as confirmation of their own, very divergent, beliefs.Hansen recreates the atmosphere and daily life of the convent in convincing detail. He allows the remarkable occurrences to speak for themselves for the most part, and allows just enough wiggle room for more dubious readers to question whether Mariette is a saint or a charlatan. One of the most unlikely facets of the story, for a believer, is that this young girl in the middle of nowhere would be chosen as the recipient of these manifestations of God's presence. Equally perplexing is why these signs should be made so ambiguous and left open to doubt. Hansen answers these questions as Mother Saint-Raphael explains to Mariette why, even though she personally believes in Mariette, she is willing to let the matter be dismissed by church officials :Skeptics will always prevail. God gives us just enough to seek Him, and never enough to fully find him. To do more would inhibit our freedom, and our freedom is very dear to God.This idea, that God purposely leaves the decision of whether to have faith in the hands of men, rather than to force them to believe, is fundamental to the view of Man as having Free Will. Of course, it can also be easily ridiculed as an easy way out of ever proving God's existence. Regardless of which side of the argument you come down on, this is a beautiful, thought-provoking, novel about the awesome power, and the inevitable limits, of faith.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"When I am asked what my favorite book of all time is, I can never name just one. But this is one of them. It isn't for everyone. Read the first three pages. If the quality of the writing - its spareness, its contemplative power, its absolute rightness for the subject matter - doesn't move you and seduce you, move on. On the other hand, if you find yourself feeling, as I have, soothed and quieted and taken up into a kind of literary forest refuge, close the book, buy it, and find the right time to sink into it and let it take you over.It is the story of a young nun in a cloistered convent in upstate New York at the turn of the last century. It's the story of spiritual rivalries, and of family relationships in their emotional and psychological complexity. It's a mystery. And it's pure poetry on the page, like seeing a ballet and knowing for the first time what beauty can be made by moving a human body.I haven't read Mariette for years, but its images and language still haunt me. I will read it again some day. Hansen has the gift. You will look for his other books after reading this one. They also have their virtues - he's not commercial in the sense of repeating a successful style and making a formula out of it - but I find this one clear as a morning bell."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I agree with those who say the prose is wonderfully sparse and the novel gripping and seductive. However, I find much of the writing too studied -- to the point of pretentiousness. Sometimes,the descriptions seem so carefully, almost painfully crafted that one is more aware of the struggle of the writer than of the imagery itself. That awareness actually comes between the reader and the story at times, jarring one awake with a great desire to tell the novelist, &quot;Oh, puh-leeze. Just say what you mean and stop trying so hard to be clever.&quot; Unlike some reviewers, however, I am not troubled by the enigmatic ending, because it reflects the very nature of such events and the human response to them. I like the fact that the author did not insult the reader by attempting to neatly wrap up the story by coming to a firm conclusion about Mariette's stigmata at the end."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I don't remember who recommended this book to me, but thank you. Ron Hansen's story about a shy, devout 17-year old girl who willingly, in fact obsessively, gives herself to God and enters a convent entranced me. Mariette is in her own mind not devout enough, not pure enough yet is described by some of the order's sisters as being almost a saint and absolute in her devotion to God. But when she exhibits the signs of being a postulant, our logical minds think she must be faking it, because how could God give her such a power? Ironically some of the same people who unquestioningly love and accept Christ as the son of God can't believe that a girl would have some similar or inexplicable connection as well. In a short period of time her devotion and motives are questioned. Some say she is a liar or nutcase seeking attention and others think she is a saint.When a person presents herself honestly and with integrity and is challenged on every front, whom do you believe? The person or her detractors."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"As a former contemplative nun in a strictly cloistered monastery, I feel I have personal insight into the setting of this story. As other reviewers have stated, the prose is a feast for the senses, and for me, especially, it brought back vividly my years in the convent. While I would differ with the author on many points of convent life--there isn't nearly as much free time or freedom as he imagines, and because of the silence, very few opportunities to develop friendships or get into \\"trouble\\" as some of the nuns seem to do--I will say that he has beautifully captured the essence of monastic living. His picture of very flawed humans attempting to live a perfect, superhuman life is spot-on.What I like most about the story, however, is the ambiguity with which he approaches Mariette's phenomenon, carefully drawing a plethora of human responses from the sisters and others involved with her. I will not spoil the ending, but I will say that the basic idea I got from his last chapter is the levelling of all experience. To me, he is emphasizing that life is beautiful everywhere; \\"God\\" is everywhere equally. I find this a very \\"Zen-like\\" theme, and one usually lacking in Catholic literature, which tends to raise the religious life to such exaggerated esteem.In any case, bravo for a well-written, sensitive novel!"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Hansen does an excellent job - better than anyone I know- of rendering a &quot;description&quot; of a convent life, in a convent in which silence is coveted and required. He does this by setting a scene so well, so carefully, so that you feel you have also entered this stark, minimalist, yet spiritual existence. I also loved the fact that he truly depicts a young devote woman who was completely focused/obsessed with service to God, to the point where she developed stigmata. Yet, did she fully develop it? That is what is so wonderful about this book - it is full of mystery, yet we feel intensely for this passionate young novice. A wonderful, beautiful read."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This is a book by an author best know for western's however this is not a western. It is a spiritual story and a spiritual story with a major twist. It is the retelling of the life story of Saint Terese Martin aka Terese de Lisieux. But this story is told in a generic religious order set in Quebec.This book deals with many large questions:The StigmataFaithHealingLoveScienceAnd how these five things meet in the life of Mariette with ambiguity and how that ambiguity mirrors our own lives. The interesting thing about this book is it is about the world of women, the convent is a microcosm of the real world. The only two men in the book are Mariette's father and the priest at the Convent.Mariette received the stigmata while a novice at the convent, the Prioress was her older sister. This is a story of faith versus adversity even in one's own tradition. It is the story of a girl who desires to love God with all of her heart. Yet the depth of her devotion arouses the suspicions of those around her.A film was made of this move with many big name star's Rutger Hauer as the priest, Geraldine O'Rawe as Mariette, Mary McDonnell as the prioress. Michael W. Higgins was the Historical consultant on the film. Though filmed in 1996 it has never been released. The studio did not like the ending and the author and producer would not change it.Dealing with many deep questions this book leave's the reader with more questions than answers but with a sense of hope and a desire to know more. Hansen has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"A mixed bag. I found the ending frustrating, not satisfying at all, though that may be the point of it, that certainty eludes us as long as we are on Earth. Hansen avoids the foreseeable ending (the Scooby Doo one where Mariette takes the mask off and it becomes obvious that the whole thing is a hoax). Instead, he gives us reasons to believe and reasons to doubt, making the whole experience much more interesting.The prose, though praised by many smarter people than me, I find difficult. Half the book has no verbs or is written in sentence fragments of some kind. Even the parts of the book that are written in actual sentences are still choppy, as Hansen cuts from one time and place to another once every paragraph or so. I found myself having to re-read paragraphs to remember where I was.With that said, it is refreshing to read a book that is not COMPLETELY anti-Catholic or atheistic and at least treats with respect people with sacramental worldviews. This book could easily have slipped into propaganda either for or against the Church yet it deftly tip-toes the line between, which is no easy task.I read it over 2 days, sick in bed, and will probably re-read it sometime."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"\\"Mariette in Ecstasy\\" is the story of a young woman who joins convent life, and how her \\"experiences\\" with Christ change her life and the life of those around her. Her religious fervor, although compelling to some, is viewed skeptically by others. The novel leaves the reader with much to think about. One of these is the idea of being \\"jealous\\" for Jesus. Mariette at least supposedly had such a profound connection with Christ, that she experienced him in ways that none of the other sisters had even dreamt of. This left many of the sisters bitter and jealous. To me this was reminiscent of how women become jealous about a man they care about who is spending time with another woman, which plays into one of the huge themes of this novel: the connection between spiritual ecstasy and sexuality. At some points in the novel, it appears as though the nuns have sexualized their devotion to Christ, especially as they fixate on the physical manifestation of Jesus. This bears connection to an experience I have had around people of my own faith who claim to be \\"drunk\\" off the Holy Spirit.The sisters who do not attach bitterness to the thought of Mariette's special relationship with Christ, seem to long to be close to Mariette, in order that they may be closer to Christ himself; it's almost as though Mariette, like the Pope, is a vicar of Christ, especially through her stigmata experiences.One of the other many questions I found myself asking had to do with Mariette's relationship to God as a \`father', and whether or not she used that relationship as a sort of replacement for the uncomfortable relationship she had with her earthly father.For anyone who has grappled with spirituality, especially in a Christian/Catholic context, this novel may dig up the questions you yourself have secretly (or not so secretly) been asking, but it will not leave you with any answers."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I would say that \\"Mariette In Ecstasy\\" by Ron Hansen is an accurate representation of the sequestered life of cloister nuns, but I have no basis of comparison, since I am not a nun. What is very clear, though, is that if this novel demonstrates the typical attitudes and actions of cloister nuns near the beginning of the 20th century, then it is a hard way of life indeed. Deprivation, sacrifice, hard work and most difficult of all - mortification of the flesh - seem to be par for the course for these women. There is a lot to be said about an honest day's labor and a disciplined way of living, but coming from a Protestant point of view, I think the only truly endearing trait apparent at the end of the day is the intense faith and dedication to beliefs that Mariette - the novel's main character and protagonist - demonstrates on a consistent basis.Hansen paints the picture of Mariette as a young yet oddly sophisticated and world-wise teenaged girl - very pretty and conscious of her beauty, and seemingly aware of the effect she has on other people, although it is not an overt characteristic. She is hyper-focused and completely intent on living a sort of life she believes will bring her closer to Christ - and like the other nuns in the abbey, thinks that self-denial and the suffering of intense and prolonged pain is what paves that path to the Divine. There are certain places, though, in which Hansen plants a bit of doubt as to the extent of Mariette's understanding of what exactly she is in for as she prepares and then enters the extremely isolated and sheltered life of the cloister, but in other parts reinforces her gazelle-like intensity of faith and desire to suffer for the sake of Christ.The conflict that ensues after Mariette allegedly is inflicted with stigmata - physical manifestations of the wounds of Christ - is infused with a wide mixture of belief and worship as well as an utter disbelief and a harsh questioning of both Mariette's character and motives. Hansen does a good job of showing what would surely be the full range of emotion and reaction were this a real-life situation, although it might differ somewhat due to the time period and the current proliferation of mass media involvement that would most certainly be present.What I enjoyed best about the book was simply the imagery Hansen skillfully and poetically uses to show the tranquil setting of the nunnery, contrasting it with the harsh and unrelenting lives and attitudes of the sisters. I think this is what makes this novel as good as it is - although it's not the best book I've read, it is quite interesting and a talented presentation of an extremely difficult situation that puts both faith and the rigors of Catholic cloister life up for serious scrutiny."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"\\"Mariette in Ecstasy\\" seems almost as if it's written for the screen. The absurd, seemingly cinematic quality of the writing only enhances the strangeness and intrigue of the story. Ron Hansen beautifully pieces together the tale of mystery and mayhem in a monastery, leaving you guessing throughout the entire novel. It's a very interesting read on many levels, though it's difficult to get into at first due to the unique writing style and the foreign world of Catholicism that is portrayed (it was foreign to me, at least. I realize it may not be totally foreign to you). If you have any curiosity about this book whatsoever (and even if you don't), I would recommend picking it up and giving it at least one read through."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"In Mariette in Ecstasy, Hansen illustrates a story, situated in an abbey, where a postulant, Mariette, creates a stir amongst the otherwise peaceful monastery scene. Hansen artfully depicts vivid scenes of natural beauty surrounding the abbey, while invoking a plot thick with themes of religion, spiritual sexuality, and physical pain to become more spiritual. Mariette's presence in the abbey inspires contention amongst the other nuns as they struggle with the validity of Mariette's ecstasy experience, and Hansen's poetic novel causes the reader to sit back and grapple with the meaning of every carefully chosen word. An excellently written novel."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette in Ecstasy is a beautiful read. The short, poetic descriptions dispersed throughout add character and mystery to the story. The plot itself is interesting and engaging, although Hansen's choice in how to present it is personally a little problematic. It wasn't until I was a third of the way through the novel that I began to understand what was going on, and not until I reached the last section that the plot was made clear.However, the book was an easy read, which provided interesting criticism on life in a convent as well as a relationship with God in an engaging, creative manner. I found the book edifying, and led me into contemplations of my own spiritual life and the Christian life in general. I would recommend it to anyone interested in convent life, God, or simply beautiful language."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette is a nun who is a true believer. She is close to God, has visions and can bestow blessings.As is the frequent human reaction to anyone who is gifted or special, jelousy runs rampant. The normal or average or non-gifted plot to bring her down.The only flaw in the book occurs when Mariette exhibits behavior that borders on blasphemy. This is inconsistent with the flow of the story."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This is a book by an author best know for western's however this is not a western. It is a spiritual story and a spiritual story with a major twist. It is the retelling of the life story of Saint Terese Martin aka Terese de Lisieux. But this story is told in a generic religious order set in Quebec.This book deals with many large questions:The StigmataFaithHealingLoveScienceAnd how these five things meet in the life of Mariette with ambiguity and how that ambiguity mirrors our own lives. The interesting thing about this book is it is about the world of women, the convent is a microcosm of the real world. The only two men in the book are Mariette's father and the priest at the Convent.Mariette received the stigmata while a novice at the convent, the Prioress was her older sister. This is a story of faith versus adversity even in one's own tradition. It is the story of a girl who desires to love God with all of her heart. Yet the depth of her devotion arouses the suspicions of those around her.A film was made of this move with many big name star's Rutger Hauer as the priest, Geraldine O'Rawe as Mariette, Mary McDonnell as the prioress. Michael W. Higgins was the Historical consultant on the film. Though filmed in 1996 it has never been released. The studio did not like the ending and the author and producer would not change it.Dealing with many deep questions this book leave's the reader with more questions than answers but with a sense of hope and a desire to know more. Hansen has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This is a beautiful story rife with poetic imagery, only to name two of myriad: &quot;cattails sway and unsway&quot; and the picture of a nun rolling out dough &quot;like a slow, white pig.&quot; If you enjoy the language of the story as much as the tale itself, this book is a definite treat. The ending will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This is a book I've read several times. The layers of meaning of the story are different each time. The emotions are touched and the ending unexpected. Questions are raised on the way that can be answered only by each one's heart. I've bought several for gifts and will buy more. Ah Roses."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"\\"Mariette in Ecstasy\\" is a work of passion, a work of ecstasy, of faith, of doubt, of commitment, of agape love, the Devil, the sublime.Mariette Baptiste becomes a postulate in the Convent of the Sisters of the Crucifixion in New York in the early 1900's. Her sister, twenty years older, is Mother Superior. The convent is a place of religious devotion, days filled with prayer and service, farm work and quiet times devoted to the arts of keeping house. There is study for the postulates. It is a quiet life, a contemplative life. Everyone is part of the flow.Then comes Mariette and gradually the peace is disturbed. Not intentionally, mind you. Gradually. For you see, Mariette's palms begin to bleed, her feet bleed, her side bleeds. She goes into trances. Stigmata? Here in our simple cloister? Why would God visit such a miracle on us here in this obscure place?Ron Hansen has written a book of sublime faith, or is it faith? The prose is as lush and beguiling as Mariette's young body. He creates a kind of word art, designing his sentences to resemble single lines of nuns going into the choir loft, outside in the fields, going to the barn, picking grapes.Gorgeous prose takes away your breath: \\"Horsetails of gray smoke rise from the candles at Vespers.\\" \\"Blood scribbles down her wrists and ankles and scrawls like red handwriting on the floor.\\" \\"She hears firewood wheezing and thudding apart inside the iron stove.\\" \\"Easy water rustles over stones beneath a Queen Anne's lace of ice.\\"The hush of deception begins early. Again, wordsmith Hansen provides just a few lines at a time suggesting support of stigmata or its deception. The reader is held in quietly building suspense. This is a cloister. Expect no car chases here.That is all I can tell. Oh, one more thing. The last paragraph, the very last paragraph holds the key. The ending is absolutely stunning. I gasped and tears poured from my eyes."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Every book I read I am able to put down to accomplish chores and that sort of thing. Not Mariette in Ecstasy. I read it straight through and was dazzled by the richness of Hansen's words, by Mariette and by the cruelty of some of the nuns. It's an amazing read and it will take me forever to get over it."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"There's really no point in describing this small ruby of a book, so wonderfully written, and with such a great finish. Just read it; you'll think about it for a long time."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette in Ecstasy is an intriguing story of a woman and saint, who seems to be affected by works of Christ such as stigmata and overall ambitious acts of devotion to her religion. But the church becomes divided as Mariette's acts and \\"miracles\\" could be viewed as self-inflicted. The story delves into the life and mind of a woman who displays wounds that seem inflicted by either Christ or the devil. What was so intriguing to me was the fact that there are indeed great figures throughout religious history displaying these same claims as Mariette. The book keeps you guessing as to whether or not she is a saint or an insane, devout extremist. I have always been interested in these \\"signs\\" from Christ or the devil himself, so the book really delved into the mind of a woman claiming to be devout."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette in Ecstasy is a stunningly beautiful exploration of the many questions and unknowns that accompany faith and belief. I hadn't the faintest suspicion that a story about convent life could have so many direct correlations to issues that every human must deal with at some point. Through finely crafted and delicately woven imagery, Hansen confronts the reader with timeless questions of faith in the face of doubt.Life in the convent flows like clockwork. In an endless cycle of prayer and labor, each day fades quietly into the next, devoid of any significant challenge or disruption. The arrival of Mariette sends the lives of the nuns into a whirlwind of scandal and doubt. Mariette's fiery, passionate expressions of belief stand in sharp contrast to the calm routine of faith that the nuns have established. The women question whether this is the work of a divine hand, or simply the frantic actions of a madwoman. When the clarity of their beliefs becomes obscured by Mariette's zeal, they must each discover where their faith will lead them.As Hallmark-card-esque as it may sound, life really is a constant journey of discovering whether your head knowledge aligns with your heart knowledge. Is what you believe in your mind really what you believe with the rest of your being? Hansen deftly asks this question but leaves us with no direct answer. The answer is something we are left to figure out for ourselves."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"The first decade of the 20th century in a small town in New York. Mariette is the beautiful, intelligent daughter of the local doctor, a very confident, overbearing man. Against his wishes, she has gradually become deeply, disturbingly religious, and enters the convent as soon as she is of age. As in any other society, Mariette's ethereal beauty and unshakable devotion incite jealousy among the good sisters. Some fall in love with her, but others are suspicious. When Mariette begins falling into trances (ecstasies) as she communicates with Jesus, the unity of the convent is split in two. When she manifests the stigmata - the wounds of the crucifixion - it is nearly destroyed. Is Mariette a saint, a deluded and disturbed young woman, or a fraud?Ron Hansen is a writer with considerable descriptive and narrative skills. The book's chapters are related in accordance with the \\"hours\\" of the day and the feasts and commemorations of the Catholic calendar. A meditative, contemplative quality infuses this novel, as do frankly sensual scenes that show how closely connected to nature were those who lived in this more simple time and place. The narrative is hypnotic, leading the reader to feel almost a member of the convent community.Mariette in Ecstasy is a tour de force, lyrically written, mystical, and original. Read it and make your own decision about whether Mariette was saint or sham."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette in Ecstasy by Ron Hansen is about a passionate 17-year-old girl who enters a convent in 1906. Mariette prays fervently and is often \\"transported\\" into a state of bliss--which arouses both the jealousy and admiration of the other sisters. Eventually, she bears the wounds of Christ and everyone wonders, \\"Is Mariette a stigmatic saint or is she a hysterical sham?\\"The real beauty of Hansen's novel is in his marriage of the natural and supernatural. This book is full of cinematic descriptions of nature and the simple convent life. Then, set within that familiar simplicity, Hansen brings to life supernatural experiences. He maintains his sparse tone--perhaps reflecting the sparse convent life--and often brings his prose to the point of poetry. The result is a magnificent, sensory experience.Hansen also handles the material extremely well. It is easy to fall into the extremes of mocking religious experience as fodder for fairy tales or proselytizing blind faith in untrustworthy religious accounts. Hansen rises above both extremes, treating the supernatural with respect but also placing it within the dissonant natural world. This forces the reader to question what, and why, it is they believe or disbelieve.Mariette in Ecstasy is a beautiful and challenging look at the supernatural religious experience and its place within our natural world."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"An aspiring Catholic journeys the difficult path to nunnery.Ron Hansen is poetic in his literary voice to say the least. He has taken a well-conceived tale of religious controversy and, controlling our emotions with his acutely descriptive forms, has placed his audience in Mariette's reality. He has allowed us to feel the cold, stone slabs the protagonist walks on, to smell the cattle milked in rising sunlight burning the dew off pasture grass, to feel the exhaustion of dedicated pre-morning prayer after sleeping on unforgiving wooden beds, and to tense with the conflict of devote nuns in controversy.Written for those with appreciation for lyrical style, imaginative creativity, and introspective contemplation that outweighs any lust for the cheap thrills of some more action-filled novels popular today."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen, in his novel Mariette in Ecstasy, zaps a spell over the reader. The reader is introduced to a secluded life which is behind walls from the reality of the real world; the life of a nun. The nuns live in a structured and strict environment, but their peaceful life is interrupted when Mariette enters their convent. She stands out as different from the beginning of the novel, her passion for Christ is something that some of the nuns are not used to-they find it hard to accept her as genuine. She disrupts their life when she begins to go into spiritual trances, experiencing spiritual ecstasy, and coming forward with stigmata, bleeding wounds in her hands and feet. These things cannot be logically explained away by the nuns and begins to split them, forcing them to form sides concerning whether they believe her stigmata and visions to be truly of God or whether they don't.Hansen does an amazing job of representing the spiritual doubts that come upon people of even great faith in this period of rationalist philosophy and modern thinking. They have so rationalized the world, rationalized God that they cannot truly accept the possibility that it is simply a miracle. They determine to look for every possible natural explanation except that it is a miracle until that is the last one remaining. The sisters are torn between believing and trying to find an explanation, as all people of faith are when something seemingly unexplainable occurs in their life. Hanson manages to create this same doubt in the readers mind with subtle hints and unanswered questions. He makes no judgment, answers no questions, and it is left to the reader to discover the answer within themselves. He encourages the reader to examine their own views of faith and miracles, engaging them long after the novel is done.Even without the depth and power of the story, the novel is worth reading for the beautiful and almost poetic use of the language alone. Hansen manages to write in prose that is more like poetry than anything else. His descriptions are sparse, yet they hold such detail that the image is painted vibrantly within the mind of the reader. In small snapshots of the nun's lives he manages to show the reader the world the nuns live in, there fears, constraints, desires, etc. Their simple faith and living is reflected in his simple words and sparse writing. Mariette in Ecstasy is a novel that is worth reading for the authors excellent ability to write fluently and poetically."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Imagine for a moment you are called, compelled, and are faithfully obedient to the voices of your entire life telling you to become a nun. You will live in the same town as your family, and your sister will be in charge of you at the convent. The only difference is your family no longer visits you, your sister cannot recognize you as her sibling but now, coldly as a pupil, and you are only 17. Welcome to the life of Mariette Baptiste. Mariette in Ecstasy is a mysterious little book about life in a cloister. Life that is tightly scheduled, ruled with dignity and authenticity to the Catholic faith.Upon the arrival of Mariette the Sisters are all aflutter while trying so diligently to stay focused on God. To each Sister, Mariette evokes a different emotion; some see only her youthful beauty, and perhaps their own lost youth. Others see her as a menace to their well-oiled machine of contentment, and for the Sisters, who are fervently seeking God, see her as a gift sent to their cloister directly from God. Mariette in time experiences Stigmata and is met with mixed responses from the Sisters. Ron Hanson leaves the reader to decide for themselves if she indeed did have Stigmata, in addition to provoking the reader to examine questions of faith and miracles.This book is extremely engaging and well written, and I am confident the reader will find this book was well worth his or her time."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Who am I to say whether Mariette's stigmata was indeed real? Self-sacrifice and a longing toward selfless service could have been her calling. As Mother Superior suggested, we may need only be willing to serve in cloistered life; not necessarily be expected to carry out that willingness. Thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This book is beautifully written- tapping into the spiritual lives of these cloistered women, although fictional somehow helped me tap into a more spiritual side of myself."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen's Mariette in Ecstasy is brilliantly written. One might judge it as slow, droning, boring even, but this reader is not looking at the details of Hansen's workmanship for that is where the unparalleled beauty of the novel lay.The story focuses on Mariette Baptiste, a beautiful and pious seventeen year old girl whose lifelong dream has been to become a nun. The story begins with her wedding celebration to Jesus Christ, thus her entrance into the convent. There, she begins to experience the phenomenon of stigmata which leads to conflicting opinions about the girl-is she deranged, a great deceiver, or a saint?The novel is sectioned into three parts and each part records the days of saints or events pertinent to the Christian faith. I found myself wondering if Hansen researched each of these saints and events to parallel in some way the events taking place in the novel. He writes Mariette in Ecstasy so delicately, it is not difficult to imagine he might plan the novel as such.One must see Hansen's intentional attention to detail-to the small moments and perfect scenes-as paralleling the detail, complexity and nuances of the Catholic faith. Each word spoken is intentional and meaningful."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"The arrival of a young, eager and devout postulant throws a country convent into turmoil.She becomes a mirror of truth within the convent walls, revealing to all the motives of their own hearts.Hansens evocative prose conjures the earthy smells sounds and colour of an idyllic country convent setting. I enjoyed tremendously his keen appreciation of the minutiae of life, the tiny details that are so important and potentially explosive in a closed order.The setting never once overwhelms the characters but gives meaning and support and indeed sense to their harsh draconian lifestyle. The atmosphere elevates the simple, the everyday and ordinary to the level of rite, ritual and liturgy.What I can only call the organic \`oneness' of the sisterhood is marvelously portrayed as their daily, seasonal and even menstrual cycles merge. It is this harmony which is threatened by the arrival of Mariette Baptiste. As she travails in her own devotion to God, she is favoured and feared in equal measure. The juxtaposition of sexual and religious ecstasy is clearly evoked by Hansen, allowed to evolve but never endangers the story.Within the convent Mariette is the catalyst that stirs reaction. To some she is the image of not just a youth, but a life left behind. To the complacent she is a threat to the routine they have come to accept. To the luke warm, she is an offence. But to those who seek genuine devotion, she is a gift from God.Descriptive, evocative, sensuous and beautiful.

In contrast to other reviews I have read, Hansen does indeed give you reason to doubt Mariette's claims, but only circumstantial evidence is given and an &quot;argument&quot; for it is never made. It is truly left for you to decide the validity of her claims. A beautiful novel. Court is in session!"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"The book is well written and engrossing, but the author uses his Catholic religious knowledge to build a ruse.

I'm not interested in reading more of Ron Hansen's works."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"While The Sound of Music may not have made it cool to become a nun, at least it opened the doors to writing about them and focusing on one as the central character of a plotline. Ron Hansen must have taken the aforementioned movie as a challenge, because he instinctively went about writing a book that simply blew The Sound of Music out of the water in terms of how people view nuns and, dare I say it - gasp, aesthetic value. Yes, I just used the \\"A\\" word and I'm not ashamed, nor will I be dissuaded: Mariette in Ecstasy is a work of art.In order to be clear and as fair as possible I must note that I am not declaring that I passionately loved this novel (can someone passionately love a novel?), only that it is very well written. Better said, Mariette in Ecstasy is a beautifully crafted story of life in a very religious and simple community. It took what could have been a dull and tedious subject and turned it into a vibrant study of the life of one extraordinary girl and the people she impacted.My biggest complaint about the book relates to the way it ends. Explaining this without giving away the ending is difficult, but let's just say that I was expecting something a little more fantastic. I mean, the front cover of the novel quotes the New York Times Book Review as saying, \\"Exquisite...a cliff-hanger of a story...the finale is a stunner.\\" While there are some pretty dramatic circumstances that occur, I don't feel that the book lives up to this assessment. Maybe whoever wrote this was just trying to get a quote on the book cover.As far as the whole \\"nuns gone wild\\" part of the title of this review, you will just have to read the novel to find out what I mean and if you agree with me. It's not a very long read. My paperback is 179 pages in length so you don't really have a very good excuse not to read it. I'm sorry if I didn't tell a lot about the plot of this book. Let's just say it is about religious/sexual ecstasy, stigmata, lies, betrayal, and nuns. How's that for a cliff-hanger?"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Ron Hansen, in his novel Mariette in Ecstasy, weaves a spell over the reader.

The writing is lyrical and precise. Some chapters --- divided according to the hours of prayer observed by Catholic monastics --- are like meditations. One of the things that struck me in the descriptions of the nuns reactions to their daily life, was how sensual their lives were, particularly considering they were cloistered virgins. But the fragrance of the hay in the barns, the touch of the dough as they kneaded bread, the play of light on a cow's hide as they milked. Everything was sensual and lush.This is a haunting story about a young stigmatic who may, or may not, be what she seems to be. She is both revered and despised for her beauty and for her devotion. Some think her a saint, others an attention-seeking fraud. I found the varied emotional reactions of her fellow monastics to her fascinating --- jealousy and resentment are certainly not banished by taking Holy Orders.The ending was, in my opinion, shattering and brilliant. This is a book I have read a number of times and I am always mesmerized by both the beauty of the language and the mystique of the story. Was Mariette a mystic or a beloved of God, or a very, very clever fraud?"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This book captivated me with the first set of small, image laden vignettes and only got better.

It's highly evocative and beautiful in describing the winter desolation of a rural convent in 1906. The plot has to do with a young trainee who experiences unusual and controversial spiritual phenomena (which I'd rather not belabor so as not to ruin the plot). In my opinion this book is so excellently written that even people who don't care at all for organized religion or spiritual pursuits will still like &quot;Mariette in Ecstasy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"The written word has a unique property among media: it can show without telling; it can present an incomplete picture that only the reader can finish.There are precious few books that have achieved this end as beautifully as Mariette.

It's none of those things.Mariette in Ecstasy grapples - perhaps like no book written since the Bible - with the curious notion of faith versus reality. Despite its Catholic theme, the book is thematically agnostic, which is, in no small part, what makes it such a wondrous achievement.In all of my years of reading, this book remains the apotheosis of \\"show but do not tell.\\" Writing any more about it here seems self-defeating....."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"\\"Christ reminds me . . . that he loves me more, now that I am despised, than when I was so richly admired in the past.\\"(179).

These mysteries travel throughout the novel and leave the reader wondering whether Mariette's experiences in the convent were real or not. Through this novel one can only look at the tiny details and know that those are real and from there everything else is left.Ron Hansen writes, noting the details from the hundreds of yellow butterflies to the single grass stem. These are the simple things in life that can be seen and that are true. They can be explained and noticed but they are all within this realm that is left unanswered. But in all these miniscule details there lies order. Just like the lives of the nuns of devout faith. Mariette is introduced as the somewhat disruptive element of this novel.

This story brings out the honesty in each individual. In conclusion, as a reader, I focus on if it was real or not, but the real question lies within each nun. The examination of truth and faith within each individual."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"A book so vividly written -- on a subject so removed from most of us -- that I alternated between being astonished by the story, and astonished that it could have been written in modern times and by a man. The images are painted with a light brush and make a delicious counterpoint to the rigid structure of the lives of the characters. A unique and innovative treatment of a rare story line."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"My bookclub read this book, and it provided the basis for excellent discussion of the prose (beautifully written, especially the achingly acute descriptions of physical surroundings), the plot and the story. The club spans all religious preferences, and each member had a different idea about what happened. Some found it a book of true sacrifice; for others, it was a book of relationships and obsessive love. It made me want to read the rest of Hansen's works -- each of which is very well written, and oh so different from the other."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"The artistry with which Ron Hansen crafts this story is remarkably beautiful and the true treasure of this novel. But was Mariette a saint or a psychotic delusional religious fanatic? Was she a misunderstood saint or someone trying to represent herself as a saint? The author never reveals the answer to these questions. We, the readers, are left to make our own decisions. What I found enjoyable and interesting about this novel was its portrayal of convent life at the turn-of-the-century. The unique format of this book, based upon the Catholic liturgical calendar as well as correspondences, makes for sometimes interesting revelations, and sometimes clipped, terse entries that reveal little. No matter, this is an interesting read which demands a second reading."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Devotion or delirious? Divine or disastrous? This short novel explores the fine line between what we call pure faith and demonic destruction.Young Mariette is a postulant nun in a monastery in New York state at the turn of this century. She is passionate and extreme in all that she does; she longs to be supremely wedded to Jesus--in fact, she goes through a wedding ceremony while joining the convent. She is carried away with devotion, prays constantly, and even begins to show signs of stigmata.The convent becomes split in understanding her inspiration and soon factions form, some adoring her and others calling her a charlatan. When she is finally challenged to show her stigmata, the wounds have disappeared--Christ has taken them back--and she is expelled from the fold of the faithful. (Telling this much still hasn't given it away.)This simple, elegant, precise novel has been written in such a manner as to remain ambiguous regarding her faith or foolery, and therefore, Hansen respects the reader's judgment in deciding just what is going on in Mariette's heart and head.Hansen deftly portrays the mysteriousness in faith and touches on the line between the narrow extremes. A fascinating book of inner exploration, Hansen has written a hagiagraphical novel for our times."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This book is a celebration of passion and longing and beauty, and is now one of my favorite novels. It might very well be the best novel published in the 1990s."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Mariette in Estacy is as others have described it a beautiful and poetic book. However, most of the reviewsI have read(I have not read all of them)see the book as a battle between Faith and Unbelief. I rather see it as an examination of the question, where is the world of faith and spirituality?The reveals that the world of the convent is no better than the secular world for the faith life.... The revelation is the spiritual life of monks and nuns is no different, no better from that of the laity. Ultimately it asks the question... who was true to her vows? It looks as though it was Mariette."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I love the story about this wonderful Saint.It kept me reading from beginning to end.Excellent story of a beautiful women"},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I'd heard such good things about this book. I was nervous to read it, as a born atheist with a big gaping hole where a normal person's fundamental knowledge of religion might go, but I never had a problem following what was happening. Actually, the book made me much more curious about Catholicism in general, and I've been reading and researching about the things I didn't readily know about or understand since I finished it.The prose is just gorgeous. Simplistic, heartfelt, and amazing. Easy answers aren't provided, which may frustrate some readers but which I felt was a good choice on the part of the author. Even though it is short, the characters are as well-fleshed-out as a book of this type could make them, and the motivations behind each of their actions are some things I still think about. This book will make you review your own passions and moralities in life, but in a good way. Absolutely worth a read."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"A BEAUTIFULLY written, stirring book. At times gentle, at times reflective, at times so full of humanity these characters seem alive. For those buying this book for a spiritual read, I found it absolutely inspiring. For those buying it for a solid story- it is THAT too.... so engaging. It made me realize why I love reading, why I love writing, and why I love my faith.A classic."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"What a treasure! Mariette in Esctasy is more than a novel; it is a work of art. Ron Hansen not only tells the story of Mariette, a 17 year old postulant in a cloistered convent in 1906, he transports us there.The language is simple, beautiful, and perfect. For example, \\"Blood scribbles down her wrists and ankles and scrawls like red handwriting on the floor.\\" This is one of many such examples, whether the author is writing about his flesh-and-blood, pious, but oh so complex characters, the wonders of nature, or religious rituals and feast days. All are beautifully woven together in this tapestry.One of my favorite features, at the beginning of the book, was the chart that introduced all the sisters, along with their job titles and their ages, and a timetable of winter life, from rising to the Great Silence. My other favorite comes at the end: the last paragraph, from one of Mariette's letters, brought me to tears. Oh, yes, then there is everything in between.For those not yet familiar with Ron Hansen's work, I would recommend this book, along with Atticus, and A Wild Surge of Guilty Passion. All are so different, yet equally worthwhile. There is a world of difference between Mariette and A Wild Surge..., but that only proves the scope of the author's talent.Another line from the book is as follows: \\"May they renew and strengthen their souls by good actions.\\" Mariette in Estasy will strengthen your soul...and mind...and heart. It is a blessing."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"The book revolves around Mariette, an eccentric young girl, giving one a rather weird and dark image of convent life. For a reader that is seeking an insightful portrait of religious life, I would recommend \\"In This House of Brede\\" by Rumer Godden."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This was a very interesting book. I'd never heard of either the book or the author, until it was mentioned in another book I was reading,Beauty Will Save the World: Recovering the Human in an Ideological Age.Mariette is a young girl who joins a monastery to become a nun. While there she experiences the stigmata. The question of whether she actually experiences stigmata isn't necessarily resolved. What is most interesting about the book is how the different residents of the monastery react to her stigmata. Their hearts are truly revealed by their reactions to the stigmata.The writing style was different than I was used to, but having experience reading Cormac McCarthy, I am prepared to adapt to any style of writing.All in all, Hansen does a good job of peering into monastery life and the hearts, good and evil, of its residents."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"Yes, it did lack intense emotion or action. But I really learned from the characters in this book. I'm a tad skiddish about such orthodox religious practicing but the facts about the bible and the worship of it not only make precious sense to me now but can be applied to any loving appreciative belief out there. I love the simplicity of the nun's daily life. I love their appreciation for the truly amazing gift life simply is and the devotion to constant gratitude. I get it now. I could totally see how these women stay in 'Ecstasy'. I'm envious : ) The ending, hmmm. I'm thinking I missed something... I was a micro-tad disappointed but I adore Ron Hansen's writing. Off to my next Ron Hansen book -Hitler's Niece."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"I have loved everything I have read by Ron Hansen. I read Atticus many years ago and I found it profoundly moving. However, this must be his masterpiece. I have given away several copies--I like it so much."},{"Title":"Mariette in Ecstasy","review":"This is a very good book. I have now read three of Ron Hansen's books: Mariette in Ecstasy, Atticus, and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Atticus is the best of the three, but Mariette is a close second and may be the more impressive. How Hansen weaves a gripping story out of the ordinary lives of religious sisters and their new postulant is truly remarkable. I don't want to give away anything, but the way the book leaves things open to interpretation is intriguing. I am not sure I understand the book fully, but that ambiguity is part of the point, I think."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This book is a great testament to the fact that children can in fact be potty trained early in life, as soon as they are able to sit on a potty the author attests. Unfortunately she spends far too much time \\"selling\\" her readers on the idea of early start potty \\"learning\\" and not enough time actually teaching parents how to implement the practice. It is a great reference though and I intend to attempt the early start potty learning with my next child. It seems to be a bit too late for my nearly 2 year old this time around. I'm going to try Teri Crane's Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day instead."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"As you may have guessed, this book advocates earlier potty training than is common in Western cultures today. At least half of the material is dedicated to making that point. Much of the argumentation is very aggressive and direct, with no evidence behind it. For example, the author scares you by stating that your child is likely to have more bladder infections if not potty-trained early and doesn't indicate where that statistics comes from, what she means by \\"more\\" or whether you can trust that point.As far as actual potty-training advice, it's very limited. It made me feel like I must've missed something because there were pages and pages of information, but what did she actually say you should do to potty train? I went back again and again and found that there was almost nothing. A handful of anecdotes was all that I could use in practice.I started my toddler at 14 months, armed with the advice that early potty training is a good idea, then quickly found it didn't go very well. I stepped back and waited. It took a couple of months before he was willing to use the potty after that first week. Finally, I started again. More obstacles - but no solutions from the book...I guess the book is written from the perspective of the person who thinks that potty-training is a natural thing and all you need is dedication - it'll just happen by itself. I am still in favor of early potty training. But now I am shopping for a book, which will teach me how to do it.I gave the book two stars instead of one because the author doesn't teach you anything bad or harmful. She just doesn't help very much."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This book was not what I was expecting, and I would never recommend it to someone. Although the author makes frequent mention of elimination communication/natural infant hygiene, please don't be confused that her approach has many similarities, at least when referring to children older than 6-12 months! Although I agree with the author's premise that the potty can and should be introduced early as a natural fact of life, rather than waiting for \\"toddler readiness,\\" the methods she describes for older infants/toddlers are frequently quite authoritarian, veering toward harsh! Not at all in line with the mutuality implicit in elimination communication.I recommend \\"Diaper Free before Three\\" as a better option for those looking to start potty training on the early side, who perhaps weren't into elimination communication in early infancy or who practiced it in a \\"lazy\\" or part-time manner. \\"Diaper Free before Three\\" will offer encouragement and the basics for starting up early (6 months plus) or - what I needed - the encouragement to move to the next step, cloth training pants."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This book is a great resource. I sort of skimmed through until I reached the age where my daughter was when I ordered the book, and then began really reading. There's a lot of information in the introductory chapters; and the author is very pro-EC. BUT she does not force EC down your throat nor does she insist it is the only way to go. She is also rather pro-CD, in a way that could be a turn-off if you love your disposable diapers. I didn't have that problem as we CD, so I got a lot out of it. I found the book intelligently written and useful. I think anyone contemplating potty training or who needs to change strategies because what they're doing just doesn't seem to be working would benefit from this book. But unless you really want to read it all, just skip ahead."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I thought this book would be interesting and informative. It wasn't. I practice attachment parenting and was turned off by the pushiness of the author. Her reliance on operant conditioning is carried too far as well (and I have 2 masters degrees in psychology.) She also suggests that if you don't have a rigid schedule, you'll never potty train your child. My 10 month old went on the toilet today, and I don't have a rigid schedule, so the anecdotal evidence is against her already."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"It was a good price and came in a very short time. It was very helpful for the task at hand."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I am glad that I borrowed this book from the library rather than waste good money buying it. There is so much about this book that I found ridiculous that to be perfectly honest, I didn't even finish reading it.Let's start with the absurd airplane references through out the book. It's pretty hard to take a book seriously if it needs to rely on gimmicks. Not only are the airplane references silly, they are convoluted and largely irrelevant. Take chapter five: Smoother take offs and landings, reducing jet lag. What does this have to do with Potty training? Do we really need to dance around the topic with fluff and analogies. It's toilet training, you can use the actual terms, it's ok. Not only that, she can't even keep her analogies straight since in a couple of spots she switches from airplane references to train references (eg. derailed) and then back to airplane references again.Her knowledge and understanding of cloth nappies is embarrassingly out of date. Does she honestly believe that this is how cloth nappies work? Clearly this woman has not used cloth nappies at all in the last 15 years and she certainly hasn't laundered any. Even for 2005, when this book was first published, her knowledge is out of date. If something as simple as this can be so wrong it does make you question how much of the rest of the book is wrong.The disposable diaper industry conspiracy theory. What is it with crack pot's and their conspiracy theories. The author would have us believe that parents are incapable of independent thought, brainwashed by Pampers. Never mind that disposable diapers are easy and convenient and favoured by most parents for that reason.At the end of the day, once you get past all the smoke and mirrors this book comes down to put your kid on a potty at timed intervals. Reward desired behaviour. Not exactly rocket science or anything new. Unfortunately the details are sketchy and padded out with too much fluff to be of any real use."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Recommended by some friends, helpful tips, but just like many other things with children, so much is touch and go. Personally I recommend this book, but might want another resource as well to find what fits for you and yours."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I had been trying out Elimination Communication on a part time basis with my 8 month old daughter, but was getting discouraged by my lack of time to invest (as a working mom), a lack of participation/support from family and caregivers, and the lack of tangible short-term results. I appreciated the average time frames given for potty training, start to finish, at various ages. Since EC generally discourages goal-oriented thinking in the context of their philosophy, it was hard for me to stay motivated. But Early Start Potty Training is different, and helped me stay focused. Your baby will be out of diapers!! ...Hopefully sooner, rather than later!So, no matter your baby's age, go ahead and take the plunge! You owe it to her to help her recognize and respond to her body's elimination signals. Keeping her clean and using fewer diapers is a definite bonus, and best of all, she will have potty independence before you know it.I love books that help me get in touch with my child's needs and respond to them better. If you're the same way, you might also appreciate the bookHealing Our Children: Because Your New Baby Matters! Sacred Wisdom for Preconception, Pregnancy, Birth and Parenting (ages 0-6)by Ramiel Nagel."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"The first few sections of this book has some good conspiracy information about diaper companies and why we wait so long to train, but then has a fairly negative tone for parents who do wait to train. Talks a lot about just going forward and not worrying about \\"mental readiness\\" but actual training sections have a different opinion. This books seemed to be very negative towards parents who aren't training by 5 months and then LESS than helpful information for everyone else.Try Toilet Training in Less Than a Day instead."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Although I had amazing success with my first child without books or other advice, I decided to read as much about the potty training process as possible before I started with my second child.I didn't come across the ECing concept until recently, which is a shame since my little girl is now 2 and I feel like I missed an important window of opportunity. \\"How to potty train - and prevent bedwetting - at any age\\" lured me in and I checked this out from the library despite knowing this book was mainly geared toward infant training. There are some really nice sections on how to deal with older children, but the majority of the book focuses on training infants and younger babies and pointing out the dangers of diapers and the dangers of waiting too long to potty train.There are quite a few great ideas I will take from this book and apply to our own potty training process, but there are a few major problems that I HAVE to address. The first being that \\"research shows that babies and toddlers comprehend less than their parents think.\\" Under the \\"Travel Dictionaries\\" section, Sonna stresses the importance of using the same words so that children don't become confused. Personally, I believe parents underestimate their children's abilities and give them less credit than they deserve. Children DO have the ability to learn different words having the same meaning and we see this when we look at bilingual families. Young children are capable of understanding two different languages simultaneously, yet Sonna suggests that they are confused if someone says \\"potty\\" and someone else says \\"toilet.\\" Our children have an AMAZING capacity to learn and understand different words and I think that should be recognized. Moms shouldn't stress because they say \\"potty\\" and grandma says \\"bathroom\\" and dad says \\"restroom\\" and the older sibling says \\"toilet.\\"At the same time Sonna is suggesting that our children don't understand as much as we think they do, she claims that a fully trained 21-month-old can handle all toileting responsibilities. This includes making it to the potty in time, removing clothing, going in the potty, cleaning themselves, replacing clothing, emptying and rinsing the potty chair, cleaning up any splashes, and then washing hands. All of this may be supervised, but these are things the FULLY trained child should be doing without assistance. Although I recognize the amazing mental capacity of children, I just don't think a barely-two-year-old has the physical coordination required to do all of these things as well as Sonna suggests. I get the impression that at this age, the child should be taking care of her potty needs by herself and no longer needs the parent and it's an impression I don't particularly care for. It makes potty training seem like something that eases the burden of the parent instead of making the child healthier and happier.By biggest concern is found on pages 22 & 23. \\"Keeping your child's bottome covered, only touching the genital area during diaper changes and baths, and criticizing your todder for running naked through the house all communicate rejection of your child's body and contribute to the idea that it is shameful.\\" Found on page 23, parts of this statement have me thoroughly confused and more than a little worried. While I DO completely agree that parents should teach children to have a healthy, positive view of their bodies I can't think of ANY time where it would be appropriate for a parent to touch their child's genital area other than diapering and bathing. Not one! No, a child's genitals are not shameful but they ARE private and should not be touched by anyone other than themselves for anything more than what is necessary for hygiene. Touching for any other reason would be inappropriate and WRONG. Sonna walks a slippery slope with this statement and could potentially cause a lot of problems with some parents. It would have been more helpful for her to suggest other reasons for touching besides diapering and bathing... even though I can't possibly imagine what those reasons might be. At least it wouldn't leave things so open-ended.The general lack of suggestions is also something I didn't care for in this book. She says to show disapproval during accidents, but doesn't suggest how to display it. Do you shake a finger and say \\"no\\", do you yell or spank, do you put them in timeout? Although these are not things I would personally do, there are parents that do these things and suggestions for alternative ways of showing displeasure would be extremely helpful to them. Some just don't know what to do and then lash out.All of that being said, there are ideas I like and will use with my child. I like the idea of a potty sit in and I like the idea of letting children go undiapered to learn what their body is doing. I especially like the way she stresses the importance of gentleness, patience, and consistancy.I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book as the sole source of potty training knowledge, but I would definitely recommend that you read it at least once."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I started potty training my daughter at the age of 10 months. All I've read about this book, promised that I would find guidance and tips on how to make my baby comfortable with the potty, but it's all theory there with \\"Hallmark\\" type stories. Some quotations are aggressive against modern American society and parents using disposable diapers. It even made me feel guilty and ashamed rather than enouraging. I come from culture where children are potty trained from birth. My parents started it when I was 3 months old. This book made me feel like I was lazy to postpone it till my daughter turned 10 mo. I found no guidance and no real tips. Only theory about how going in diaper is bad for health and Pampers corp. is evil.

I will keep this book and begin my next child right away! I think I'll have to find a different plan for my 20 month old. It almost has me convinced to use cloth diapers for my next child. Also, my son responds to the removable potty seat instead of the actual potty chair this book swears by. I completely agree that it's possible to train children much younger than 3, because yes they have to in 3rd world countries!"},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I am easily one of the people in her anecdotes. I bought this book after my mom, who lives in Eastern Europe, asked if my 8m old was using the potty well. Uh, hhmmm. Silence on my side. She explained that at this age neither I, nor my sister were soiling & wetting diapers during the day, so I was late.This book really opened my eyes about how brain-washed we have become thanks to the aggressive marketing from the diaper companies - wait for a toddler to decide he wants to use the potty? No one asks a 4m old if he wants carrots. Sonna explains the dangers of letting our children wear their waste with them. I also liked the fact that the author never makes you feel guilty, never preaches or puts pressure on you. Just well-researched facts as they are, you draw the conclusions and decide for yourself.The book gives a good history of training, reasons to train early and how to do it. There is a lot of flexibility, with many options to suit your style. Training techniques are not harsh by any measure, on the contrary, the author advises to be very respective of your child's reactions and modify the process according to his/her responses. There is advice on how to deal with setbacks and answers to some common problems that parents have encountered.I find the book very useful and a must read for every parent."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Before my daughter was born I started looking into information about elimination communication (infant potty training). I have been too overwhelmed to start, but this book convinced me that it was time to try. This book is not a very good how-to manual, but it gives great information about the benefits of early potty training. For how-to advice I recommend the DVDPotty Whispering: The Gentle Art of Infant Potty Training. Best of luck!!"},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This is one of those books for which I wish I could give 2 1/2 stars.On the positive side, Sonna gives an enlightening history of how the 'readiness theory' of potty training evolved. We shouldn't be surprised that the motivation for it was economic--Dr. T. Berry Brazelton's study promoting the theory was funded by Proctor and Gamble, makers of Pampers, back in the early 1960's. Society's collective swallowing of this theory has been highly profitable for the makers of disposable diapers, as the age of training keeps getting later and later.Every once in a while, Sonna provides helpful pointers as to how to handle the 'hows' of early training, such as how to respond to accidents. However, I think the average family would likely find intiating training with newborns patently ridiculous, as well as much of Sonna's psychobabble.She blames Christians and Victorians for making us all 'hung up' on eliminating waste and advocates that we allow our children to run around naked. I'm not opposed to a limited amount of 'naked time' for a young child, but I can't live with the implications of a terminally unclothed baby or toddler who is not fully potty trained zooming all over my house. Additionally, Sonna goes off on this absurd diatribe about how we're going to communicate negative associations to our children by only touching their genitals during bathtime. ??? I don't usually touch my child's ears except when cleaning them. Is he going to develop hearing difficulties as a result? Sadly, the book is peppered throughout with similar absurdities.I agree with other reviewers that Sonna's understanding of cloth diapering is terribly outdated. We use cloth and find it to be pretty easy. We use fitted diapers with velcro tabs and wash every third day. The labor and 'yuck' factor are both pretty minimal, and we have had no problems with diaper rash or leaking.I'd say 'Early Start Potty Training' is worth a read if you borrow it from the library, but I wouldn't spend money on it. 'Diaper Free Before 3' by Dr. Jill Lekovic, MD is a far more reasonable read."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This had some very good information to get introduced to the idea and method of early potty training. I found many of the other books she references to be a bit more helpful, but the background on why children seem to be potty trained later in life was encouraging and helped me to keep at it.*My main caution is on the chapter which discusses touching. Please be very discerning here, she mentions casually touching aside from toileting times to make acceptance of this part of your body okay. I hope this has not created instances of child abuse! I hope she writes a new edition and takes out this chapter."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This was an interesting book. I read this one and two books on elimination communication when my son was almost 1. Some good ideas if you want to give early potty training a try, but just keep in mind all children are different. It might work for you. It might not. I wound up giving this book away as it didn't work for us.Long story short, my son is now almost 3 and a half and is not fully trained yet. I have tried so many tactics, but he simply does. not. care. I went into this process fully believing that I could teach him how to use the potty before he turned 3... I was even hoping for closer to 2. Well I did teach him. And he is capable. But he has always been lacking the motivation. I'll admit that after over 2 years of working on this, I am frustrated and I regret that I even tried it so early. Just my personal experience. I know other children who were trained at 2.

This book is comprehensive and suggests many approaches to potty training and to diapering in general for infants and children of tender young ages. As a first time mom, I would have loved to have found this book sooner! Some of the methods described in this book are most practical for stay-at-home moms, while others can be accomplished by nannys or sitters in a small group environment. Not very practical for kids in a typical daycare setting, although the author points out that it can be done.

He pooped on it every morning for about 6 months, and we were both proud.

I would recommend reading this book if you have children that are not potty trained yet. The earlier that you read it, the better! Good luck."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I am usually a person who catches things like this during researching a book, especially a book on child rearing, so I'm furious with myself for missing so much about this author and this book before handing over $10! There are a few good take-aways, but the glaring problems with this book, in my opinion, make it practically worthless:1) the author is NOT a medical doctor, she's a Ph.D in 'counseling psychology'. Her non-medical background is most clearly expressed through her hostility towards doctors in general and her dismissal of the American Academy of Pediatrics' advice on potty training. Silly me, I trust my pediatrician. Apparently I've just been duped by the medical profession.2) the author is opposed to all disposable diapers. In fact, she thinks all diapers are bad. Per Sonna, parents should use cloth diapers if they have to use diapers at all. But we really should have never put them in diapers at all but should have carried a bowl around under their bottoms from the moment you arrived home from the hospital. Silly me! Episiotomy stitches and figuring out breastfeeding aside, what I SHOULD have been doing was potty training my one week old infant! This is completely unrealistic, as is the page after page rant against disposable diapers. Her argument against disposables is basically \\"we didn't use disposable diapers before we had disposable diapers therefore we shouldn't use disposable diapers(map that one out in symbolic logic!), they're terrible for the environment and they contain chemicals that will kill your baby or at least render them infertile\\". If you were a mom who was terrified by the hypercautious language in 'What To Expect', then THIS BOOK will scare the living daylights out of you. I am sensitive to the environmental argument, and I think using a cloth diaper service may be a great alternative to filling landfills. But writing a guide that tries to guilt or scare you into not using diapers at all is just counterproductive and in most folks will be a waste of time, especially families with two working parents like ours.On a briefly positive note, I think she does make good points about making sure kids know that all parts of their bodies are good, that their private areas aren't 'bad' or 'dirty', etc. And from what I can tell the gist of her version of how to train an actual toddler is pretty much like everyone else's - don't force them to sit on the potty, praise them when they do, praise them when they go, reward them and increase the rewards as they master each skill, don't shame them or get angry over accidents, use stickers and picking out big boy/girl pants as rewards. WOW. Groundbreaking, Ms. Sonna. (I'm old fashioned and only call MEDICAL DOCTORS by the title Dr., sorry!)Essentially, if you're like us and are looking for a guide on how to start potty training a little earlier than is standard these days (before age 2) and just want some tips or advice, then this book isn't it. Sorry!We're still looking too."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This book advocates that you let your child crawl around constantly without a diaper and look for signs that they may have to go...Ummm maybe the dumbest thing that I have ever heard! Who wants to clean up a million accidents all over your house umpteen times a day???? NOT US! Who has time to watch their child every single waking hour that they are alive and not asleep??? NOT US!It may or may not help training early...but it's a pretty dumb idea nonetheless!"},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I am a stay-at-home mom of a 15-month-old. I am also a trained Montessori teacher. I have used cloth diapers with my son from the time he was one-month-old. I have seen many children toilet train before age 2.So, I came to this book agreeing with some of what the author had to say. I think she makes a good case for changing our society's preconceptions about toilet training, but this book is short on extensive practical advice that parents (and teachers) need.The author does not approve of any sort of diaper, particularly disposables. However, she recommends cloth diapers as a lesser of 2 evils sort of thing. Her advice on laundering diapers is laughably out-of-date (treated wet pail, wash 3 times(!), etc.). Washing machines are far more evolved than the author realizes, and I would not use cloth diapers if it were as much trouble as she describes. She even thinks you still have to pin prefolds.Some of the ideas in this book are useful, but it will have to be supplemented with books that go into greater detail. It cannot be the only book you read for potty training info.If you want to read a book written by someone with very strong opinions about early potty training and the problems with diapers, then you may like this book. If you want a more balanced approach, I would pass over this one."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Someone gave me this book. I'm not big on the self-help book craze, but I must admit that this author (she also wrote some other child development books) opened my eyes to the cultural differences in potty training, and does a great job of detailing why here in America our children take longer to potty train than anywhere else. This book isn't just a manual and a \\"how to\\" but it's also an expose on the diaper industry. I'm suprised this hasn't been picked up by the news agencies. This so called \\"self-help\\" book is actually a fabulous read. I HIGHLY recommend it."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I thought this book was great. I'd been told that 18 months was early to introduce the potty to my daughter, but this book gave me the morale boost and the information that i needed. In less than a week my daughter has made great strides and we are well on our way to being diaper free.I found the section on the history of potty training and the role of the disposable diaper industry in delaying toilet training very interesting. I used disposables, but did not feel at all rebuked by the author's tone. However I am seriously considering cloth now for my second baby. Regardless of the diaper debate, the instructions and advice were just as relevant for me as they would be for a dedicated cloth diaper mom.Also, this book has specific advice for those starting potty training at any age level, but it's mostly for those interested in starting before age 2. pros and cons are given for starting at different ages, and i didn't feel that there was a pushy tone about starting training very young (although the arguements are persuasive for at least doing a little \\"elimination communication\\" during infancy).For my 18 month old, I followed much of Sonna's advice while trusting my own insticts and following my daughter's cues. We moved a little more quickly than her timeline because that suited us. For our \\"potty sits\\" we ended up close together with me either behind her potty seat w/ a book in her lap or me on the step stool next to her reading picture books, and we didn't set a timer. The best thing that I did (on the book's advice) was to spend long mornings with my daughter running around pants-free and diaperless so that she could learn about elimination and she could see for herself why the potty chair is a good place to go - and so i could learn her patterns. Messy, but it really taught us a lot in a short period of time. Books and dolls were also a big help as well as serving as a potty role-model. These are basic concepts that I'd also seen in Sears' Baby Book, but Sonna goes into much more detail.So, I would highly recommend this book as a good read and a positive, motivating force as well as for a source of practical advice. This was the only potty training book that I bought, and it has served me well so far."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"I heard about EC (or elimination communication) about four years ago, when my son was 9 months old. (He is now nearly four.) I didn't have any books on the topic at the time, but decided to try it anyway at home with my son as soon as he started to walk. When he started to walk two weeks before his 1st birthday, I started leaving him without diapers in the daytime, or putting him in cloth and pointing out to him when he was peeing. He was trained by 15 months. (He could go to the bathroom when it was time without reminders. I only needed to help him with some clothing for about three months more, then it was elastic waists for a while.) He was peeing and pooing on the potty, and going all day without accidents.Three years after my son was born I gave birth to a daughter. The christmas before her birth my brother gave me this book. I read it cover to cover. At two weeks old I started to catch her pee in a pot. It was easy a first. Then as she was able to go longer between eliminations, I couldn't catch it on a regular basis anymore. I left her in diapers and just put her on the potty when I changed her. Sometimes we caught some sometimes we didn't. But she began to associate the pot with elimination and with the word \\"potty\\" and the sign for toilet.I am proud to say that just yesterday my daughter crawled up to me saying \\"mamamama\\" I was wondering what she wanted so I picked her up, and asked her if she wanted to eat (while showing her the sign for eating), she stared at me blankly, so I took a chance and asked her if she wanted to go potty (and showed her the sign). She became very excited. So I put her on the potty and she peed! My daughter is almost eight months old. I hope that by twelve months she will be asking for the potty consistently, so that we can eliminate diapers all together.This book was an invaluable resource to me. I appreciated all the back ground info about why we use disposable and why people believe kids can't use the potty till two or three. I would recommend this book to others in a heart beat. Only down fall is that there isn't quite enough practical application. I would love to have heard more stories about HOW mothers did this with their kids. There is practical application, just not enough.Mrs. Meg Logan"},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Sonna's approach is simple and practical and she presents terrific approaches for starting potty training at any age from early infancy on up. I especially enjoy the way she presents pros and cons of starting at each age.My daughter, for example, is now 9 months and can sit up well on a potty... this is a pro; a con is that she has become somewhat used to diapers over the last 9 months.Sonna is quick to reassure parents that whatever their child's issues with potty training, and even if their child experiences a small setback, it's not the end of the world. Considering that a lot of child-directed anger and even abuse focuses on pottying accidents, this is extremely important.Sonna includes, as do most authors on early potty training, descriptions of practices at other times and/or in other parts of the world. Yet she does not dwell on these but moves right on into the practicalities, applying these practices to 21st century North American life.Sonna uses little anecdotes to introduce of each section and age group - mostly interactions between parents and others who seek to influence their potty training practices, like a traditional Russian grandmother who is surprised and sorry her young grandson is still in diapers - which I found a bit corny. But again, she doesn't linger on these and the chapters themselves are not corny at all, and full of helpful tidbits.I was a little amused by Sonna's descriptions of using cloth diapers. She seems somewhat aware of diapers that close with velcro but in other places writes exclusively of pins and prefolds. She also has some funny ideas, as a previous reviewer pointed out, about the rigours of washing cloth. Believe me, CDing is a lot more fun than Sonna makes it out to be!Nevertheless, I found this a most helpful and insightful book - far less \\"all or nothing\\" than several other EC and early potty training resources I've found and far more realistic and reassuring about typical setbacks.I don't know if Sonna really told me much I didn't know already. But for its reassurances and its detailed description of the practicalities of pottying at any age, I think it's an excellent resource."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"REVIEW UPDATE TWO YEARS LATERAt the time of my initial review of this product, my youngest was barely 2. We'd had the book for over a year and had started using the method with her at birth.The results: she was reliably toilet trained at 13 months for daytime; she'd been pretty reliable at about 8 months but not completely. Because she never woke up in the middle of the night, I didn't take her potty in the middle of the night, and so she wore a diaper until she was over 2.The last time she wore a diaper during the day was at 15 months, when we drove to Florida for a family vacation and needed to not stop as frequently as she needed to go. It took a couple of weeks when we got back to untrain her from using the diaper.I can only think that the reviewers who gave this book a poor rating *based on theory* instead of practice just highlight that most other potty training books are also just based on theory, as Dr. Sonna points out in the book. Those of us who have actually followed her method know that it is anything but harsh, and it works--quite well.I'm very happy to have been able to put the money I saved on diapers and ammonia burn creams into my daughter's college savings account.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~There are several really wonderful things about this book:1) It is research-based, unlike 99% of potty-training books out there that recommend late training, which are based on theory.2) She gives a history of the average age of potty-training in America.3) Dr. Sonna gives researched-based health reasons to EC (elimination communication, or infant potty-training), and how it isn't just training the parent. Finally,4) Dr. Sonna gives research-based instructions for starting at birth, starting at 6 months, and starting at 18 months, because how you train has a lot to do with the child's age. If you missed the early training window of before 6 months, she tells what to do and why. She also has chapters on bedwetting and special situations.Why did people start late training? She explains why this is--did you know that T. Barry Brazleton was the spokesman for Pampers when they were first introduced in 1957? Yup. :-P He has been largely responsible for brainwashing people into late potty training. In 1902, the year my grandmother was born, the big debate among doctors was whether it was ok to start at 2 months instead of at 2 weeks! With the introduction of the electric washer in the late 30's (it wasn't widespread until about 1946), the age was pushed back to about 4 months, as it was much easier to do the laundry. Dr. Spock shocked people by recommending 7-9 months when his book came out--most people thought it was way too late (and we know they were right). Then came Pampers and Brazleton recommending 18 months. No wonder my Grandma hated diapers!Dr. Sonna says that ECing trains a child's sphincter muscles; it keeps them aware of the sensations of eliminating before, during and after. She also tells why late potty-training isn't just \\"caring\\". It's unsanitary, contributing to the rising incidences of cryptospora, giardia, e-coli, and bladder infections. The later kids are potty-trained, the more likely they are to have accidents both day and night, and a \\"new\\" condition called unstable bladder syndrome. This is simply a combination of an incompletely emptied bladder that is prone to accidents and infections. \\"After passing waste while walking about in diapers for so many years, many children have difficulty figuring out how to work their muscles while sitting down\\" (p.8) is a reason for this. Chronic constipation is on the rise. Even seemingly-innocuous \\"diaper rash\\"--the old name was \\"ammonia burns\\" and was considered a sign of neglect, not an inevitability!What just amazed me is the average age that kids are now trained: 35 months for girls and 39 months for boys. And these are the lucky ones: some doctors are now recommending waiting till age 4 1/2!!! Teachers are now seeing kindergartners and first graders that are still in Pull Ups. Talk about setting kids up for problems with self-esteem. Honestly, is a two-year-old up to making this kind of a choice for herself, as the late-trainers advocate?Some reviewers have mentioned that she only mentions pinning prefolds. I did see a mention of a couple of other types of fasteners they must have missed. But the cloth diaper market changes, as any market does, so it's a good idea to do your own research on this anyhow. I don't see this as a drawback.I am going to have to buy more copies of this to lend to friends having babies. When I asked \\"is it just me, or are most parents potty-training later?\\" on a homeschooling web forum a few months ago, parents my age (in their 40's, some with new babies, like me) said yes, they are, and gave reasons for earlier training, if not outright ECing. Younger ones, in their 20's and 30's, echoed the theory-based late training and even said it was cruel to \\"take the choice away from them\\". Now I have good, researched-based information to tell them."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"This book has been very useful while training my 16 month old daughter.

Sonna gives helpful advice for introducing the potty to youngsters according to their age: 0-6 months, 6-18 months, 18-24 months, and 2+ years old. She suggests that \\"early\\" potty training can be done in a very healthy, positive way that is beneficial to the child. Her opinions do clearly come through, but her conclusions about \\"early\\" versus \\"late\\" potty training are well supported by good research. In the early 1900s the big debate over potty training was whether to start at age 2 months or wait until age 3 months; and in the 1940s, the big debate was whether or not to wait until the \\"late\\" age of 7-9 months. She also talks about the study that supposedly concludes that it's better to wait much later, until the child shows \\"readiness\\" signs. She reveals that this study was conducted by the paid spokesman of Pampers disposable diapers!I introduced the potty to my son at 18 months, without having any ideas or advice about potty training. At 19 months, he surprised me one day by pulling down his pants and peeing on the potty. I continued on with potty training, which mostly involved running around bare-bottomed and having many many accidents, as is expected. At 21 months, I finally read \\"Early-Start Potty Training.\\" Her suggestions really helped, and within a week I saw major improvement. Soon he began letting me know when he needed to go-- with both pee and poop! He is still 21 months, and accidents still happen. But we are well on our way. He almost always pees when he sits on the potty; he is starting to feel when he has to go; and he is beginning to communicate this to me. This has been a very positive process. I never knew that potty training could be so fun!"},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Dr. Sonna provides an excellent road guide for introducing the potty at a young age. I picked up the book when my daughter was 18 months, knowing that I did NOT want her to spend another year and a half in diapers like many of her peers will and are. We had already bought a potty chair and so we started right away. The methods outlined in the book are clear, easy to follow, and they WORK. Yes, this method takes a little more effort on the parent's part, but I was more than willing to do it. We were diaper free about six weeks after her 2nd birthday(and that was with a \\"late\\" start at 18 months).The book provides methods for a gradual introduction to pottying. I would reccomend that parents of both genders be comfortable inviting their child in to have a potty sit while they use the facilities themselves. I am sure this has made our potty journey much smoother. Our daughter has learned to recognize her own body's signals and we didn't even have to \\"night train\\" her - she did it herself easily.I would highly reccomend picking up this book."},{"Title":"Early-Start Potty Training","review":"Just read this book and when I got to the end I was like, \\"so where are the instructions?\\".I have a 13 month old that I wanted to start slowly working with and I was looking for a little more \\"how to\\" then what this book gave me.

As a fourth grader, I was drawn to the title as well as to its apparent 'novel-like' format relative to the slimmer picture books that were on the lower grade shelves in the school library.

The children in the book were hesitant at first about moving to a potential haunted house, but they looked for positive ways to cope with the situation. In one instance, with their father's permission, they thought about building a tree-house out of old wood from the barn. The children in the book also found and picked up clues along the storyline that was originally set up by their father via the children's former next door friends. This makes the story interesting with many thoughts about ghosts because they did not know who or what were writing the clues until the very end of the story."},{"Title":"Sacagawea Dollar Folder","review":"Whitman Coin Folders, long known for quality, archival products, continues its legacy with the release of the Sacagawea Dollars coin folder.

All collectors anticipate the release of a new product, and the Sacagawea Dollar is sure to pique the interest of collectors old and new. The Whitman folder provides an economical, practical way to store these new coins."},{"Title":"Sacagawea Dollar Folder","review":"This review compares the standard blue Whitman \\"Sacagawea Dollars\\" folder and the H. E. Harris folder also published by Whitman.Both the standard Whitman and the H.E. Harris & Co. coin folders are published by Whitman Books, so one question naturally arises, are the differences significant enough to favor one folder over the other? I believe the answer is yes, and that for me the differences favor the Harris folders. However, I can understand how others may favor Whitmans's standard blue style folders, and I do have to concede that I have used the standard Whitman folders for so long, that they just seem 'right' when seen or held.The standard Whitman Sacagawea Dollars folders have exteriors made of paper and the back of these exterior paper covers also provide the back for the coins inserted into the interior coin slots. There are twelve slots for each of the three pages in the folder, yielding thirty-six slots in total. At the time of this review, the slots in my recently purchased edition of the standard Whitman Sacagawea folder had printed dates through 2010-D. The printed dates extend completely through the first page and most of the second. The last page has twelve un-designated slots.On the-other-hand the front covers as well as the inside back of the coin slots of the H. E. Harris & Co. folder is heavily plasticized. Perhaps because of this the Harris folder is slightly thicker. In one case, I inadvertently placed too much pressure in removing a coin from a Whitman folder and the paper punctured. This would appear much more unlikely in the case of a Harris folder. Additionally, the plasticized finish means that the exterior of these folders are much easier to keep clean. The Whitman folders have a medium-blue colored background against which the coin information is printed, this compares to the Harris folders which have a light-toned background. This makes the printed Harris folder coin information easier to read.Conclusion. The plasticized finish of the Harris folders makes them sturdier, and easier to clean. Their lighter background makes the printing easier to read. Their slightly thicker size and larger spine printing makes them easier to distinguish on a shelf. In my opinion the advantage is to Whitman's H.E Harris & Co. folder rather than the standard blue Whitman folder."},{"Title":"Sacagawea Dollar Folder","review":"if you are only collecting the P & D coins this folder is fine, however if you plan to get the S coins there are no holes for them"},{"Title":"Sacagawea Dollar Folder","review":"My grandsons and I enjoy looking at the dates and matching them to the folder.

However, readers interested in the genesis of Lave's two decade long effort to critique a reified understanding of cognition created in the narrow confines of a sterile experimental room by situating the study of learning within the everyday activities of social life may find Cognition in Practice (and also Everyday Cognition (1985) with Barbara Rogoff) insightful. Though the cognitive sciences themselves have moved on from the \`information processing' or \`transmission' model of learning that is an artifact of the experimental method and a 1960s fascination with the computer, this model of cognition remains endemic in formal educational today and particularly in educational policy decisions such as the No Child Left Behind Act that reveal a belief in the infallibility of science, so Lave's critique remains relevant today, two decades after the book was written.However, Cognition in Practice aims not merely at critique but at developing a new framework for thinking about cognition - respecifying a \`psychological theory of cognition' as an \`anthropological' one - and the book is divided into two sections to address each. This endeavor of theory creation does make the book a cumbersome, though not difficult, read at times. The greatest challenge, Lave notes, is involved in depopulating reified meanings of the vocabulary of cognition that we no longer question and respecifying them in specific social/anthropological terms. Lave, in Cognition in Practice, makes the effort to address such dualities as theory/practice and mind/body, revaluing the latter concepts with respect to learning (cognition/learning is another such duality). Yes, two decades later, this is no longer groundbreaking.Though Cognition in Practice is derived from anthropological ethnographic fieldwork and is therefore empirically-based criticism, it shares many of the goals if not the particular focus of literary critical theory. Indeed, in the two decades since the book was written, the lines have been blurred between what Gee (2000) identifies as more than 20 research programs within the great \`social turn' in the social sciences and humanities, as ideas and methodologies have cross-populated within critical communities of practice - Gee's (1999) own \\"Big D\\" Discourse is Lave and Wenger's (1991) \`Communities of Practice,' for example.Cognition in Practice lays the groundwork for Situated Learning (1991), and though the latter is probably more familiar to readers and the concepts more refined (e.g. \\"whole persons acting in social worlds\\" becomes \\"legitimate peripheral participation\\"), readers interested in the cognitive basis for sociocultural theories of cognition that place learning as an activity located not exclusively in the brain but socially constructed in interaction with others and artifacts in everyday contexts will find Cognition in Practice useful."},{"Title":"Cognition in Practice : Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life (Learning in Doing S.)","review":"One part uncontroversial cognitive psychology and five parts lit-crit bluff--the kind the author clearly doesn't understand, and hopes no one else in the seminar will admit they don't either.

A bit includes:Evelyn Montgomery Hazen was born on November 8, 1899, to Alice Elizabeth and Joe Hazen. Alice's mother was from a wealthy family of good heritage. Her father, Joe II, had great dignity and was in the grocery business with R. S. Hazen. The Mabrys were well respected citizens, while the father was publisher of the 'Knoxville Whig' newspaper, and president of the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad before the Civil War.There was much resentment between Southerners and the Carpetbaggers after the War, and still is to this day. Mrs Ryan is from Maryland and deliberately set out to sully the reputation of someone she did not knw, had never met, and had important papers from an infamous trial of the 1930s because one of her cousins had worked as a maid in the Hazen family. Joe II was very intelligent and a friend to the Indians, but he trusted the wrong business partners. He and his son were assassinated by a double crossing partner who had doctored the books and stolen money, causing the Hazens to fall on hard times for a time.\\"Newcomers\\" to the South after the War resented the wealthy, aristocraticlocal land owners. R. S. Hazen married Alice Mabry, granddaughter of Joe, the parents of Evelyn Montgomery. She had been educated at a private school for girls as befitting their financial status, like Belmont in Nashville, before enrolling at the University of Tennesseee at the age of fifteen in 1914. Like me and most Knoxville young girls, she was timid, shy, naive, and very vulnerable sexually and had not been allowed to have a boy friend during high school.Evelyn was extremely intelligent like her dad, and became a lady with formal Victorian manners as befitting the wealthy of that era. Her family attended the First Presbyterian Church not far from their mansion on a hill overlooking the Tennessee River as it runs through the town. Evelyn wasn't a beauty and was very flattered when attractive Ralph S. paid attention to her. At UT she took part in plays in 1916 with the UT players at Staub's Theater and acted the part of Ralph's wife in the play. After a few months of courtship, she trusted him as a best friend and protector and felt like she was in love with him. She was eighteen by then and not knowledgeable about unscrupulous men nor their intentions. He proposed to marry her and she mistakenly thought that they were engaged.Ralph joined the army in 1917 and appeared very handsome in his uniform.Women always fall for a guy in a uniform. She had a final year ahead of her at UT when they decided to get married. He told her that the bureau was closed for the day and \\"convinced her that a license and wedding were unnecessary formalities for people who truly loved each other.\\" He had his way with her which was not pleasurable but revolting. And that was it, he left her and went back to the army. Her reputation was destroyed and to her dying day, she was not able to live it down.In her later years, she worked as an assistant to Dr. Hodges in the English Department (my husband's favorite professor when he was working on his Master's degree) and they developed the 'Harbrace Handbook' used extensively at high schools and colleges as a guide to better grammar. She was a grand lady and a good person. The reason she is remembered today is the court trial for breach of promise (before I was born) which she won, but her name became a joke on the UT campus. A person I know told me that he and his group always made fun of Evelyn even after her death. Now, this woman from Maryland, has come here to cause hurtful memories and to air the dirty laundry of a prominent person from a good family for financial reasons. The book is dirty and a grand lady I knowwhose family knew Evelyn in her elder years and had must respect for herwanted to burn it. However, she shared it with me and her two daughters. I felt dirty just touching this paperback.Some years back, Gregory Macdonald wrote 'The Native' and spoke about it to a literary club meeting to which I belonged and he apologized for thatparticular chapter which was explict. I always criticized his writing something he had to apologize for, and refused to read it. He did write a lovely story about our town in which he parodied the townspeople (me included). Mrs. Ryan owes an apology to the memory of Evelyn Hazen and to this town for the sacrilege she has brought with this scathing account of the trial and the details she divulged about oral sex back in the Thirties. Who would have thought they did that back then? I thought it was something modern, as my generation would not have stooped that low. That part could have been left out of the trial sequence."},{"Title":"The Fifth Column (Complete Works of Ernest Hemingway)","review":"One of Hemingway's best!

Apart from the book which is to be reviewed shortly, I have read but four other novels. Yet most of them easily rank among my most unforgettable reading experiences. \\"Julian\\" (1964) and \\"Creation\\" (1981) are examples of superb historical fiction, not so much because they are well researched and well written, but because they make you look at the world from unusual points of view (Julian's apostasy and the Persian civilization, respectively) and thus stimulate you to question values you thought beyond reproach (the virtues of Christianity and the Athenian democracy, respectively). \\"Kalki\\" (1978) is a very different matter. It has been accurately described by the Time as \\"an apocalyptic extravaganza\\". It's a fascinating and shattering novel, crowned with one of the most chilling conclusions I have ever read. It is sad to say, but Myra Breckinridge (1968) turned out to be very much like \\"Live from Golgotha\\" (1992): lame satire, deplorably written, mercifully short.Before going any further, two important points. First, be aware, should you care, that the following review is rife with spoilers. Second, since this is a pornographic novel, be also aware that this, naturally, is going to be a pornographic review. Gore's prose is almost Victorian in its passion for decency, but I am afraid mine is not.I have read with interest the writings of reviewers who claim that the book is magnificently written and extremely amusing; also very superficial on the surface but actually providing a lot of food for thought. I can't say I have sensed either of these merits. Let me start with the plot, the characterisation and the writing.The plot is indeed a \\"plot\\". It is so thin that it can be summed up in a single sentence. After the mysterious death of her husband, Myra Breckinridge goes to Hollywood in order to claim a large share from a prosperous acting academy which is rightfully hers, but she has a somewhat unexpected success as a teacher in this fascinating facility. That's just about all. The great surprise of the plot - here comes the biggest spoiler, in case you don't know it - is that Myra is transsexual, indeed she has once been Myron, her \\"deceased\\" husband. This is all very well, but is it enough to make a novel out of it? In some other hands, in some other world, in some other universe, perhaps. Not here, not in Gore's hands.The book is written in very short chapters which are, to say the least, disjointed. This is to be expected, as they pretend to be diary notes Myra scribbled here and there, on the spur of the moment, when the events were still fresh in her mind. The approach does have a certain vividness which is not without merit, but this is quite obliterated by the confused, careless, affected and overblown writing within the chapters. To say it's tedious is a monumental understatement. If that's not enough, there are many chapters which are called \\"Buck Loner Reports\\", apparently pretending to be audio recordings of the Hollywood mogul who runs the academy Myra craves for, and which demonstrate how important such inconspicuous things like full stops, commas and semicolons are; the \\"reports\\" are completely devoid of such tiny details and that makes them nearly unreadable. Unfortunately, one can't just skip them; they are essential for the plot, such as it is. On the top of all that, there are tons of references to actors, actresses and movies, for Myra is of course an incorrigible movie buff, and that also adds significantly to the boredom. As for her famed wit, if that's the word, here is a typical example of it:\\"...beneath my window the Strip (Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California) is filled with noisy cars, barely moving through air so dark with carbon monoxide that one can almost hear in the drivers' lungs the cancer cells as they gaily proliferate like spermatozoa in a healthy boy's testicles.\\"Nor is the characterisation any better than the \\"plot\\". The only character that comes out with any appreciable degree of completeness is Myra herself; the rest are perfect mannequins to participate in her naughty games, but they are nothing more. Unfortunately, Myra Breckinridge, \\"whom no man will ever possess\\", with her constant harping on her own \\"divinity\\" and \\"uniqueness\\" and \\"genius\\", is so outrageously overblown that she is totally incredible. And when you don't believe in a character, he/she (literally in this case) is done. Perfect example of her mentality is the claim, made in all seriousness, that the movies of the 1940s have surpassed everything previously achieved in art, Shakespeare and Michelangelo included. The best that can be said about Myra is that she is mildly amusing, occasionally, and that her chapters - with one notable exception, to be discussed below in detail - are short enough to be finished quickly.There are at least two clearly defined issues that the book might be said to address using the (normally) effective rapier of satire. One is the nature of our sexuality, the other is Hollywood's passion for super-stardom. In both cases, the failure is complete. Apart from her direct bisexual inclinations, fantasies and actual conquests - which unfortunately take some 80% of the book - Myra's grandest ambition is merging the sexes, thus reducing the population and increasing the happiness of mankind. Now, theoretically at least, that's a fascinating and stimulating notion, if only to be demolished with relish. I only wish Myra had provided at least something more than one naked statement. As for the satire of the Hollywood's production of run-of-the-mill superstars, it is so crude and so blatant that, much like Myra's personality, I don't buy it at all.Instead of some penetrating discussion of human sexuality, its essence and its apparently overwhelming importance in human relationships, we get here a lot of pure penetration indeed. Chapter 29 is the glorious climax of the novel. It is some thirty pages long, just about five times longer than the average length, and it describes in simply staggering detail Myra's physical examination of a gorgeous stud - human one, I mean - whom she desires to humiliate as much as possible. The whole scene ends with a rousing climax when Myra \\"balls\\" the hapless fellow with a huge dildo until he bleeds. Charming, isn't it? To be fair with Gore, the scene is nowhere near as nasty as it might sound. But it is not a bit worth reading, either, still less is it worthy of being the central part of a novel. Do you know what the greatest problem with pornography is? Let me tell you: it's excruciatingly boring. Now and then, to add flavour, it's fine, all the more so if it's an integral part of the plot. Here it is neither occasional nor essential.Such cheap use of pornographic stuff, just like making the protagonist transsexual, might have been scandalous enough to be popular in 1968 - \\"#1 Coast-to-Coast Bestseller\\" boasts the front cover - but why should such crap be still in print today I can't imagine; indeed, I am not sure it is, and if it isn't, this is all for the better. For any discussion of anything above pure descriptive pornography is either painfully superficial or simply non-existent, mostly the latter.I should like to believe that Gore knew only too well that he had produced pure rubbish. In the last chapter he manages a very neat, if very fantastic, twist in the end. After a horrible car crash, Myra is taken to hospital where she reverts back to Myron. This is an excellent opportunity to introduce the shortest chapter in the book, the forty-first and penultimate one, which consists of a single sentence repeated twice, the second time fully italicized: \\"Where are my breasts? Where are my breasts?'' Too bad, Myra, but your silicone works of art are nowhere to be found. The real bombshell comes in the forty-second - and last, thankfully - chapter. This is told by a man, now happily married, who has discovered Myra's diaries and finds it hard to believe that he was once she and wrote these \\"demented pages\\". Gore doesn't tell us how he could be happily married without - to be tactful - being able to have children, especially since his wife (once a \\"character\\" in the previous chapters) was supposed to be very keen on becoming a mother, but the more important point is that he \\"can't make head nor tail\\" of Myra's old New York manuscripts, another bizarre find from the attic wonderfully described as a \\"pretentious phase\\" of her development. I must admit that this final chapter does pack quite a punch. But was it worth enduring 270 pages of nonsense for that?Incidentally, there are some interesting parallels between this novel and \\"Kalki\\". Both are told in the first person singular by a woman. Both women are not just bisexual, but have meddled with their sexualities as well. Myra has changed her sex, or at least has tried to, while Teddy Ottinger has defied hers by renouncing motherhood. Alas, here the similarities end. Though she is not completely immune to sentences with awkward structure or lots of once topical references, Teddy is a much more believable creature and a great deal better writer than Myra. Plot, characters, dialogue, humour, depth - in short, everything - in Kalki is embarrassingly superior to Myra Breckinridge. It's really difficult to believe that both books were actually written by the same man.Since \\"Myra Breckinridge\\" was Gore's eleventh novel, and it post-dates the brilliantly written Julian, I am sure that the careless writing and the preposterous satire were deliberate stratagems. In general, there is nothing wrong if a serious writer unbends from time to time by writing some sheer light entertainment. This can provide the reader with some insight into the mind of his favourite author which is otherwise difficult to obtain; and being a serious writer does not at all mean writing only serious things, as Bernard Shaw well knew when remarked wisely that \\"there is nothing more serious than great humour\\". But consider few parallels. When Somerset Maugham unbends, he produces superbly crafted tales with exciting plots and vivid characters such as \\"Up at the Villa\\" (1941, not to be mistaken with his propaganda books from this period which are nowhere near as good). When Oscar Wilde unbends, he produces gorgeously written fairy tales which delve into the human condition more deeply than many works of \\"serious\\" fiction; just check \\"The Happy Prince and Other Tales\\" (1888). When Arthur Clarke unbends, he produces highly entertaining sci-fi tall stories such as \\"Tales from the White Hart\\" (1958). All these make superb reading and are absolutely essential if you happen to love other books by Maugham, Wilde and Clarke. When Gore Vidal unbends, he produces \\"Myra Breckinridge\\": abominably written attempt for a satire which is neither pornographic enough to shock nor interesting enough to be worth reading. Above all, dare I say it, it is thoroughly inessential for fans of Gore Vidal.I have bought this copy of \\"Myra Breckinridge\\" for the considerable sum of one euro. It was actually sold for 50 cents, but since I was told it was for charity and a good cause (which nobody could tell me anything about but no matter), I was happy to pay twice the price. I don't regret the one euro spent, of course, but I must say that even the original price wasn't low enough to equal the book's value, if any. The best thing about the novel is that it is fairly readable and agreeably short. Also, it has reminded me that I have on my shelves a collection of essays about sex by Gore Vidal. I might conceivably read the rest of them one day, but now I'm even more afraid of doing so than I was after perusing with huge disappointment \\"Maugham's Half & Half\\". Be that as it may, Myra Breckinridge has a very good chance to become completely lost and forgotten on the shelves, too."},{"Title":"Minnesota juvenile residential facilities: A description (House Research information brief)","review":"I recently re-read both Smith's original &quot;The Russians&quot; and &quot;The New Russians.&quot; The first book was a landmark, a riveting inside look at the USSR during the Brezhnev years, though Smith's conclusion (that the Soviet system would endure indefinitely) was dead wrong. (No shame in that. Predictions by NYT writers about the future of Russia are generally wrong.)The second book, though written by the same man, using the same reporting techniques, is completely different. It is less about Russia (or the rest of the former USSR) than it is about Mikhail Gorbachev and the wonders he had performed and would surpass in the future. Gorbachev comes from Lincolnesque beginnings. Gorbachev does no wrong. Gorbachev has no antidemocratic side -- unless circumstances force him to act in such a way. Gorbachev is the driving force and visionary architect of the restructuring and opening of Russian society. It's as if one of Stalin's old apologists had been resurrected and put back to work -- with &quot;Stalin&quot; inked out and &quot;Gorbachev&quot; inked in.&quot;The New Russians&quot; came ten years after &quot;The Russians,&quot; and the Russian world had changed utterly in that decade. Ten years after &quot;The New Russians&quot; was published, the outlook for and course of the New Russia has altered radically from what Smith foresaw in 1991, and -- sadly -- not for the better.An adolescent mash note to the last Soviet dictator when it was published, &quot;The New Russians&quot; is now a period piece.

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand Russia today!"},{"Title":"Minnesota juvenile residential facilities: A description (House Research information brief)","review":"at Russia during its modern transition era. Hedrick Smith bequeathed two impressionist journals of his Russian/Soviet experience. His first, \\"The Russians,\\" was a \`70s eye-opener for Americans used to silly cold war stereotypes. Though better information had long been out there, only top correspondents like Smith or Harrison Salisbury could ever get their works funded before a wide audience. Along came Gorby, glasnost and perestroika, and Mr. Smith followed up with \\"The New Russians\\". As with so much of the optimistic reportage of the period, Smith could not know the phrase would become a sneer both at home and abroad.Smith was (and remains) a cheerleader for this era of \\"democratic free market reform.\\" Time has not done well by the hopes of the era nor the reformers he lauds therein. Not to become simplistic, but one example will suffice for the book's theme and tone. In Chapter 23, \\"City Hall: The New Political Entrepreneurs,\\" he portrays Vadim Tumanov, a construction contractor, whose performance repairing a section of Moscow's Ring Road was touted as \\"a classic lesson in free-market productivity\\" (p. 547). Mr. Tumanov had been running an off-the-books \\"firm\\" for 35 years with the state looking the other way. This was, of course, not a start-up \\"entrepreneur,\\" but an artel, a traditional contract-labor collective. Such arrangements were a functioning part of the unofficial gray economy throughout the USSR's economic history. Tumanov could not have survived so long without the highest government connections, so it was no wonder that he was recommended and awarded the Ring Road contract by Moscow's City Council.Only, the city subsidized his trucks (with gasoline) and supplied his asphalt. Rather than a textbook Horatio Alger capitalist success story, we see a well-connected contractor receiving government subsidy. When \\"accused\\" of \\"making a profit,\\" his shrugging reply was that \\"there is no secret\\" - and he was right: get some level of government to pay for your operating costs and reap the profits. This is not a failure of the capitalist model, of course, but how it really works in practice. There was indeed no ideological catchup with the West required. The reformers of Moscow and Leningrad City Hall were, however, much more candid than their Western counterparts in how they began their free-market kickback ventures. Said Deputy Mayor Sergei Stankevich: \\"We help create them [new independent enterprises] and give them a legal basis, and they give us part of the profits\\" (p. 549). It took the West a full decade to begin catching up to this pioneering contractor-outsourcing model, like a cold war space race.Russia of the period was a Chicago School vanguard experiment, trying out its nostrums upon a crumbling Soviet economy that couldn't dare be pulled off at home without the direst political consequences. But this was the Communist USSR - so, in Strobe Talbott's memorable term, bring out the \\"wrecking ball.\\" Of course, the consequences could not be avoided, even in Russia. The young midlevel government free market reformers allied with the ambitious Boris Yeltsin, to seize control of the Russian Republic out from under an increasingly entrapped Gorbachev. \\"You see the same kinds of things going on in other cities where democrats are in power,\\" Stankevich is quoted further, trying to \\"control administrative buildings, local newspapers and establish radio stations.\\" Once in power, they and Yeltsin were as single-minded as their Bolshevik predecessors, and so Russia embarked on one of the wildest eras of corruption in its history, ending in the Great Crash of '98 and the financial and political disgrace of the entire cadre of perestroika reformers whose \\"energy, new ideas, and noble objectives\\" Smith lauded in this book - up to and including Tzar Boris himself.Smith and many others have bemoaned the rise of Putin as bringing these good times to an end. But those who didn't stuff dollars into foreign bank accounts had quite different experiences. Smith writes in conclusion that many rank-and-file workers regarded market reforms \\"as simply a means to line the pockets of a new Soviet bourgeoisie\\" (p. 551) which \\"saw openings to exploit\\" as it hammered away at the Soviet state and economy. Thus the reformers' popular support was not as pervasive as Smith wrote elsewhere, even in 1990. Hindsight demonstrated that those simplistic, Stalinoid Soviet workers had clearer insight into reality than - shock! - a veteran NYT foreign correspondent. It was exactly this kind of free-wheeling looting during the early NEP period of the 1920s that brought on the Stalinist backlash of Five Year Plan statism - and explains Putin's nagging hold on post-reform Russia."},{"Title":"Look Slimmer Instantly!: Poems","review":"I never noticed the Amazon feature that gives \\"Text Stats\\" for the books under observation, and this one is a pip! It reveals that Jerome Sala's new book has more words per sentence than practically every other book it tried to read. At the same time, you get a concordance about which are the top 100 most used words in the book and it looks to me as if \\"ones\\" was right up there. Funny, because I've read LOOK SLIMMER INSTANTLY several times now, in all sorts of moods, and never noticed the word \\"ones.\\" Next time I'll look for it.In the meantime I'll rest on my memories of a thoughtful, at times laugh out loud crazy collection of lyric and theoretical statements. Sala has the energy and the propulsion to launch rockets out of his pockets, and he's got everything going for him, including a firm grasp on the essentials of the old DICK VAN DYKE SHOW and also its successors, THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW and DIAGNOSIS MURDER. He spins the age-old elements into a new, lacerating vision of the way even the very best TV is a desecration of the sacred, and poetry comes like rain to fill up the dry patchy holes in the asphalt.There were maybe one too many belly laughs as the book neared its end, and the surreal began to hang a little heavily in the patchwork sky. Remember that poem about \\"The Moon Was Wondering\\"? \\"The moon was wondering/ /if it would keep its job/ when all the rest of the night shift/ had been laid off/ /did they really need it to stay around/ and light an empty street?\\" That IS sort of a long sentence, isn't it, just one question mark at the end of what amounts to a sentence (a whole narrative) and a question (in the form of an interior monologue). Typical of Sala's brilliance and indefatigability. He keeps you going even when you just want to lay down and surrender to sleep."},{"Title":"Look Slimmer Instantly!: Poems","review":"If you're tired of art about art, philosophy about philosophy, poetry about poetry, etc., tired of stuff that nobody other than fellow practictioners can get any sustenance from, this book is for you.

However the book description on Amazon is misleading. It is not about Calabria but \\"Old Calabria.\\" To the ancients the area between northern Apulia (Puglia) and Calabria, and of course Calabria itself, was Calabria. The first half of the book is mostly about the area which is called Tavoliere di Puglia, which is in current-day Puglia, and parts of Basilicata (the old Lucania). Only the second half deals with current-day Calabria.Norman Douglas's knowledge and grasp of Southern Italy is unsurpassed.

At first I got it to look into the nature of the Calabrian people but soon realized it was the story of one man's interpretation of his own travels through Southern Italy in areas that may at one time have been part of Calabria. Interestingly San Giuseppe di Cupertino was mentioned in the book but he is from Le Marche, far north of Calabria if old. Still a witty and sarcastic endeavor that was fun to read."},{"Title":"Old Calabria","review":"'Old Calabria' is a travelogue reporting a British aristocrat's journey to Southern Italy and Calabria at the turn of the 20th century. For readers interested in Calabria, its real value lies in its depiction of how Southern Italy must have appeared to a foreigner's eyes at the time. Aside from the literary ability of the author, the book's subsequent success has depended more from the paucity of other accounts on Calabria in English than for any other intrinsic merit. Indeed, the book is much more interesting as an account of how Calabria has been represented by foreigners. There are a number of other accounts by English speakers on Calabria that are more nuanced and therefore more interesting. 'Old Calabria' reveals more about the common prejudices held by educated English speakers on Calabria than the region itself. In this book Norman Douglas perpetuates a number of mythologies regarding the South of Italy that are still current today as exoticising motifs, both in the negative and the positive: the \\"wildness\\" and \\"impenetrability\\" of Calabria, its deployment as a borderland between the great constructs called \\"Orient\\" and the \\"West\\" and so forth. For those people of Calabrian origins who have read the book in search of a sense of identity and feelings of self worth, this book may have loomed the larger, the greater their actual alienation from their origins. Rather than bringing them closer to an understanding of their identities, I would argue that the book has distanced them even further. It is through the very discourses that books such as these have perpetuated and legitimated in the English speaking world, that diasporic Calabrians have been alienated from themselves."},{"Title":"Old Calabria","review":"The book was not as I expected and rather dated in content, so it was no help to me in my current search for information on Calabria.

Maupassant's novel is set in Normandy, in a manor house with the surrounding countryside. It is a political and social microclimate. Paris is a very long way away, and the larger events of France, as it emerges from the turmoil of the Revolution and the Napoleonic period are not related. The novel is primarily a character study of Jeanne, the woman born of the manor, and a coterie of friends and relatives, who disappoint her, and ultimately lead her to ruin.Philandering, political or otherwise, is not a monopoly of the United States, in the early 21st Century. It was the accepted norm of the French countryside, and even the prudent priests looked the other way. Jeanne is truly disillusioned when she realizes that even her own mother was guilty of it. Religious fanaticism? Maupassant draws a telling portrait of a priest who believes he truly is God's personal agent on earth, and manages to manipulate particularly the women in a most vindictive manner. One of the priest's classic lines, as relevant today as when it was written: \\"In order to be powerful and respected, we must act together. If the church and the mansion go hand in hand, the cottage will fear us and obey.\\" A hierarchical society? As the gap between rich and poor continues to increase in the United States, accompanied by the propaganda that this is the natural course of \\"free markets,\\" it's important to reflect on a society that still had serious economic disparities even after its Revolution.With the hype and sometimes fraud that accompanies numerous \\"best sellers\\" pushed the publishing industry today, particularly \\"memoirs,\\" for me it proved much more beneficial to enjoy the study of a society and its characters that was written a century and a half ago. Maupassant clearly has insights into \\"Man's Fate,\\" particularly when it is a woman's."},{"Title":"A Woman's Life","review":"What are the secrets, most carefully concealed, of those with whom we share a life? What are the limits and depths of our ignorance and naivet&eacute;? When the final twilight falls and disdains to tarry, what will be left to see us through? Upon what can we pour out the last of our days? These are but a few of the cavernous questions which yawn ahead with a reading of this book. The heroine is likeable to a fault, yet even as we like her--and we do so to the end--we begin to wonder if she's really quite all there. Can she have done nothing to prevent some of the horrors which assail? Is she the innocent victim of those who decide her fate and have made her what she is? Perhaps, strange to say, the most endearing of characters in this novel is the family estate where most of the action occurs. Perched upon a cliff near Yport, in the Pays de Caux of Haute Normandie, it gazes out over the sea in fair weather and foul, loved by its inhabitants, yet much disserviced in the end. Still, it knows tenacity and moderation and its place. If only those it shelters could take a lesson from its lines, from its silent sense of measure, from its order and repose."},{"Title":"A Woman's Life","review":"The first time I read this novel, I thought that the naturalism was bored, because there was no elan vital like Stendhal's novels. Twenty years later, I have now re-estimated it. It has no fantasy and little romance, but some important reality.This is a story of a woman living as a falling aristocratic landowner in some French country. It may be supposed that if readers don't have the exotics against the past French country, they cannot find any significance of this novel. It is, however, not the case. While talking a woman or looking at her gestures, suddenly I have remembered some plots of this novel to find their resemblance. At the same time I have begun to wonder if she is strongly responsible and doesn't believe in love and give up almost all trivial pleasures.The boredom of the naturalism at my adolescence has gradually turned out its applause, as I have experienced much. This novel doesn't make readers happy, but widens their ability to understand women, in particular, rural and naive girls.Although the importance of this novel is hard to see, it should be evaluated fairly."},{"Title":"A Woman's Life","review":"A story of a typical 19th C. woman in rural France.

I found the stories about development of various clubs, the APBA, suburban stockers and cottage racers to be fascinating reading. The author even lists all the different classes as they developed. The chapters on collectibles like toys and accessories make you want to go out and start buying stuff. Overall, this is a rewarding book.

It covers the onset of stock outboard racing with the advent of Mercurys and Quickie lower units, and tells the reader of a peculiarly northeastern phenomenon, 'cottage racing'. The evolution from cottage racing (runwhatchabrung) of family rigs to built for racing stock outfits was very quick, and foreshadows the analogous transition from Pleasure Craft Racing to full blown OPC racing in NOA, 1957-1960. I'm competent to comment here, I was a factory trained Mercury mechanic in 1958 for my parents' E. Ky. dealership, and raced OPC in NOA 1958-60. I worked on KG-7s, Mark 30s, Mark 55s, Mark 75s, Mark 58s, and Mark 78s, and for a short while played with a traded-in KG-7H on a super lightweight old semi-V 'B' Speedliner. It ran an honest 40 mph. Then, I had the local foundry make me an adaptor (by ruining a KG-7 crank and Mark 30 driveshaft-apologies to AOMCI, of which I'm an active member) to run a Mark 30 powerhead on the KG-7 downhousing (the powerhead bolt patterns were identical). On the high flying Speedliner, with the KG-7 Kaminc prop, it hit 53 mph and ran nose-high like an old DeSilva runabout. I nearly blew it over running into the wind one day.It's correct, as I understand it, that Strang designed the motors, Kiekhaefer was too busy playing with NASCAR to care. The magnificient man was 'asleep' from 1957-1960 while McCulloch and then OMC made headway in OPC. In 1959 a Scott 40 held the NOA straightaway record in the 40-50 c.i. Pleasure Craft Class at 41.5 mpg, and a hopped up Scott 60 ran nearly 52 mpg for the Unlimited record. The statement on page 60 about Mercury bulletins and getting modifications approved fast is correct, the Sportsmaster gearcase for the Merc 800 was sent to us in Aug. 1960 and was approved by NOA at the same time. Earlier, in 1958 (the year we informally received two cupped Quicksilver props from Oshkosh), my Dad had complained about the too-high water pickup on the Mark 78, which he raced in NOA, so Oshkosh quickly sent him a low water pickup that ran out the exhaust snout. That was approved by NOA before the next race! The cupped props we got from Mercury in 1958 were 19\\" and 21\\" pitch for the Mark 78, and I immediately cupped all the props for all our motors. Paul Allison had discovered cupping by accident about a year earlier while hauling the trailer up the driveway to his house in Alcoa. He'd been river racing on Ft. Loudon with a 25 Johnson on his first homemade boat. In 1958 in NOA no pleasure craft boat was competitive without a cupped prop and the motor jacked up to 18\\" or higher.The squishy soft 1954 Johnson 25 shocks complained about by '36 Class' drivers (pg. 65) appeared (with exactly the same restrictive leaf plate system) on the 1976-1993 OMC 35, which is raced today in Minnesota under the label of 'GT-Pro Class'. And they still have even worse problems with the motor shimmying, because instead of 5000 RPM and 39 mph they turn 6800 RPM and run 46 mph on 11' tunnels and V-bottoms.The twin Scott powerheads mounted on the Italian gearcase is mentioned on pg. 80. I saw the strange outfit (pretty unusual hydro, with very long, pointy afterplaners) at the Chicago Boat Show Feb. 1858, and saw the failed run for the 100 mph record at the Knoxville Boat Club later that spring. I was afraid of the run, Scott was then our arch enemy!Hunn's coverage of Claude Fox (I knew him) and the break with APBA ca. 1950 is interesting. OPC/Pleasure Craft racing is mentioned but not covered in the book, although interest had exploded for both manufacturers and drivers by 1960. It's correct (pg. 79) that NOA-OPC was strongly supported by McCulloch (largely through Gateway Sporting Goods in Knoxville) for advertising purposes, but the dream of Scott's winning races died competely by 1960 when the Scott 75 failed miserably against the Merc 800 and OMC 75. 1960 was the year that OMC reentered racing, the standard OMC V-4 75 came with a high geared, Quickie-looking gearcase with full gearshift and was competitive with the Merc 800 until we got the smaller, higher geared Sportsmaster gearcase in Aug., 1960. The shift from pleasure craft (family rigs) to OPC began with the advent of the glass-covered flat bottom wooden Allison-Craft boats in 1960. The Allisons were racing runabouts that passed the specs for family boats, and in Oct. 1960 Allison boats held all of the records in every active classe. My Dad, Paul Allison and I held 4 of the 5 records with Mercurys (the 80-90 record was held by a Johnson, and we didn't think about 'stepping up' with our 57 mph 70-80 rig and taking that record too!). So the transition to OPC began in NOA in 1960.The book is very good, no author can write without making some mistakes, so I now offer some friendly corrections:pg. 79: In 1978 OPC did not consist mainly of 50 hp and up, the OMC fat fifty was too embarrassing a thing to be raced. There were three very active classes in 1958, 40-50, 60-70, and Unlimited. In the former the Mark 58 trumped the Scott 40. In the latter two classes the Mark 78 trumped the Scott 60. But as a sign of Allison's talent, the Scott 40 held the 40-50 Class speed record AT 41.5 mph, and as a sign of McCulloch's dedication the Scott 60 held both the other two records. The 60-70 record was 44.5 mph (Crestliner Boat), and unlimited was nearly 52 mph with a highly modified, factory-supplied Scott 60 on 13' Rose Boat (made in Knoxville). My Dad could run 48 mph with his box stock Mark 78/14' AristoCraft but the boat was shorter than the required 14' by about an inch. Claude Turner (Atlanta) made him a special 14' 2\\" AristoCraft in 1959 that ran 48.5 mph in 60-70, and then NOA disqualified it for 60-70 Class as a 'specially built boat', all the while leaving the 40-50 record to the Scott on a homemade 1958 Allison! Boy, were politics involved. I should now add that our 5 1960 OPC records never saw the light of day in an NOA record book: at the Jan. 1961 NOA meeting the drivers voted to outlaw wooden boats. However, we still have the official record certificates, and my dad, Paul and I were the first (Oct. 1960 at Three Rivers Boat Dock) to break 60 mph in OPC (we all ran Merc 800s with the Sportsmaster gearcases).pg. 83 gives the APBA standard version of the very late beginning of OPC in APBA, but OPC had already stabilized in NOA by 1960, having exploded onto the scene there in 1957-58. In 1961 Paul Allison made a glass boat (molded from a Rose). From 1961-1975 Allison boats powered by Mercurys typically dominated OPC monohull racing (the Evinrude 75 in 1975 then took over EP Class). So the attempt to outlaw Allison boats in 1961 failed, Paul simply switched gears and got ahead of the crowd again. His boats (by 1970 he'd invented the pad V-bottom) dominated V-bottom racing in OPC up to about 1985. From 1977-1985, I ran Allison boats (with Evinrude motors) in OPC in both NOA and APBA. Claude Fox died in 2007 at age 99, and by 1978 had died his hair red. He was glad to see me back.pg. 90: all turns in closed course (with few exceptions, like Havasu) were right hand turns.pg. 99 inspections: 1977-1985 in OPC. In APBA, generally only at the nationals (including especially weighing), and in NOA never in my experience. There was no weight limit in NOA by 1978, and it was clear that in the 40-70 Classes (tunnel and V) the winning motors were highly non-stock. I know this for a fact because I know who made and ran the different modified powerheads.I apologize for writing so much about OPC, but from 1958 onward that's where the action was in bozt racing (witness Billy Seebold a bit later), and that's (understandably) what's missing from Hunn's fine book. I do fully understand the author's love affair with the \\"H\\" model stock racing motors. I still remember watching painfully and wistfully in 1957 as we unpacked a green Mark 55H, and then a local lawyer hauled it off. I saw him run it once at about half throttle on his C Speedliner with 2 guys in front. The bottom had been glassed and was wavy so the boat wouldn't run without porpoising. In the 1970s I talked the then-retired lawyer into letting me take the rig out of his drive-in cellar and run it. I cupped the Mercury prop, jacked up the motor, adjusted the two big Carters, and got it up to about 52mph with the boat porpoising unpleasantly. The acceleration of that motor was lovely and impressive. It's still my second favorite, next to the loop charged 1975 3 cyl. red-white-blue Evinrude 75 (49.9 c.i.) that I raced 1977-1985. That motor is shown in my avatar. I tried to locate the 55H and buy it, but the lawyer's dead and his family doesn't know what happened to he rig."},{"Title":"Women Philosophers: Genre And The Boundaries Of Philosophy","review":"Yes, women have written philosophy, and they're done it for some time. (Just see Mary Ellen Waithe's 4-volume work,A History of Women Philosophers: Volume I: Ancient Women Philosophers, 600 B.C.-500 A.D..) Their contributions and works are slowly being rediscovered.However, there are a number of famous women who have traditionally been thought of as \\"writers,\\" not as \\"philosophers,\\" and several of such women are the focus of Gardner's book. Specifically, she treats Catharine Macaulay, Christine de Pisan, Mary Wollstonecraft, George Eliot, and Mechthild of Magdeburg. Gardner admits that \\"Their works do not have the formal and stylistic hallmarks which characterize what we now think of as 'standard' philosophy.\\" Nevertheless, Gardner argues strongly that many previously overlooked works of such women writers are indeed \\"philosophical\\" in their nature; e.g., \\"part 1 of Macaulay'sLetters on Education 1790 (Revolution and Romanticism 1789-1834)) can be understood as a sustained discussion of the topic of social reform, rather than a collection of comments on a variety of subjects.\\"Gardner's books is filled with important historical insights and details (e.g., Macaulay wrote a \\"Whig\\" answer to Hume's The History of England (1826), which \\"drew fire from Hume\\"; she was also a significant influence on Wollstonecraft).In the chapter, \\"George Eliot and How to Read Novels as Philosophy,\\" Gardner notes that George Eliot is \\"one of the few women philosophers to be accorded an entry inThe Encyclopedia of Philosophy (8 Volumes in 4)\\"), and that she was the first English translator of David Friedrich Strauss, as well as Spinoza.This book is an excellent supplement to Waithe's books, as well as a compelling argument in its own right."},{"Title":"My Dancing White Horses, The Autobiography of Alois Podhajsky","review":"I enjoy all of Podhajsky's books but this one seems the most in-depth and has been very useful to me in researching what REALLY happened in May 1945 in St Martins.

The explanation of how the School operated during World War II is told with honesty and without apology."},{"Title":"My Dancing White Horses, The Autobiography of Alois Podhajsky","review":"This book reveals the fascinating story of Alois Podhajsky's extraordinary efforts to save the magnificent Lipizzaner horse of the Spanish Riding school during WWII. The book is a testament to one man's devotion to these horses and his willingness to make tremendous sacrifices and exert great effort to preserve the regal bred and an old classical institution along with it.This is a book that any horse lover is bound to enjoy.J.B. Broussard"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"the charachters depicted in this novel were very real and easy to identify with. relationships established while in college, i believe, maintain a stronger bond and therefore are longer lasting. i did not quite understand the strong emphasis on the gay relationships and how it tied into the dreams and goals of the main characters. i wanted so much to relate my experience with a new love to Yolanda's and Basil's but could not because of his gayness."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Harris brings the characters to life once again, leaving me feeling the joy, pain and day to day living of the 4 people. I love the way he describes everything to the tee, so you feel as though you too are right there. I can still taste the chicken wings at &quot;Ms Thangs Wings!&quot;"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This novel is the best of Harris' work! I finished the book in one day, and I must have gone through every emotion known by man. And I'm glad most of the difficult situations were resolved. I immersed myself totally into those characters, so much that I could probably tell you what they look like. Harris has done it again!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This book is the best of them all. I could not put this book down for nothing. Anyone who reads this book will want to tell someone about how good the book really is. I have read all of his books and cannot wait for the next one to come out. Good Job Mr. Harris!!!!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"ONCE I STARTED READING THE BOOK I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. THE BOOK CONSTANTLY HAD ME WANTING TO KNOW WHAT SECRET WOULD COME OUT NEXT ALL ALONG I FIGURED THAT &quot;LONELY BOY&quot; WAS REALLY SWELYN. AND WAS JOHN EVER WRONG FOR NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WHEN HE GOT BUSTED THE DAY HE GAVE IN TO MONTY FOR &quot;ONE LAST TIME&quot;. I GUESS THE TRUTH HAD TO COME OUT SOONER OR LATER. IN CLOSING I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS THE BOMB!!!!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"E. Lynn Harris provides a unique flare to literature. This man's life experiences have created a new african-american male voice. As a current Chicago dweller, it is uncanny how he describes the sites and scenes so vividly. He cannot be compared - his voice is new, fresh and unique. Even his dealing with hard subjects is light and gives a naive and/or close minded individual a new perspective. CHEERS!!!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"E. Lynn Harris has a genius for creating real, fleshed out characters. Like you and me, they're not perfect--but human. You care very deeply about each of them. Despite the fact all the characters are Afro-American, this book is trans-gender, trans-racial...a mark of a truly talented writer is to be able to draw in readers of all walks of life! Note to Terry McMillan readers--you've got to check this guy out"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"An interesting premise, and an easy book to read. It was just all too neatly wrapped up; it was too obvious and just too gooey to be given any higher rating. Even though the characters go through some pretty rough events, one never gets the idea that they are really suffering. Of course the coincidences in the story are just too much. How could one woman possibly be so closely associated (independently) with three different bisexual (gay) men who just happen to have their lives so related! And it all turns out so neatly! You won't be bored but don't expect the story to make you think"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"If you enjoyed &quot;And This Too Shall Pass&quot;, you will absolutely enjoy &quot;If This World Were Mine.&quot; Harris writes about friends like yours and mine. His characters are real people that you can identify with from every policical and social class. I can certainly appreciate his works from a fictional standpoint and also from the way that he describes the life of gay and bi-sexual individuals. He gives you what seems to be the real life of these people and not the media hype. If you are looking for an exciting, funny, real, and sometimes makes you want to cry book, this book is for YOU!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"To write an accurate review of this sensitive, laughter causing, 4th novel of E. Lynn Harris, we must make mention of the first 3. Invisible Life, Just As I Am, And This Too Shall Pass and of course our subject, If This World Were Mine. His books are most importantly about relationships, deceit, love, and hot spots. HOMOPHOBICS beware! Grow-up and read his books for the marvelous, vivid, possibly insightful writing. Are we all family? Can we talk? Just go out get them and READ!READ!READ! This writer definitely deserves two-snaps and an around the world. However, let us note that it is a shame that it took us so long to be exposed.....to this marvelous writer."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This man astounds me more and more. I've read everything this man writes and every time he seems to be getting better. In this novel he takes you into the lives of four friends, who have held there friendship together since college. I must say Yolanda and Leland were my favorites. Yolanda was such a strong black woman. Even when she's faced with some stressfull situations she still held here head and came out on top. Leland was such a sweetheart, I loved the way he held tight relationships with is Uncle Doc and with Yolanda. Riley was so irritating to me, but I was happy she delt with her problems and now is content with her marriage. As always I love the endings to his books and in this one, I felt so good for all the characters espacially Yolanda and Leland."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I have read every one of E Lynn Harris's books. I have laughed,cried cheered and been angry. Harris's book opened my eyes to what gay relationships are really about. True love and passion no diffrent from any other. After reading his books I feel as if I know each charcter first hand. I have felt their pain, anger and happiness all through his style of storytelling. If you have not read E Lynn Harris you must start at the very first book up until the last. If This World Were Mine was as good as his very first book. I read each of these books in one night because I just could not put them down. But in this book the character Basil which he is in his previous books.This one answers a lot of questions that ran through my mind about the kind of person he was. YOU MUST READ !"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"As a fan of E. Lynn Harris I have been able to identify with his writings although it makes me ill that he doesn't start from where he initially leaves off. Towards the end of his stories it gets good but then you have to wait several years in passing to see what happens next with the original characters. In reading his materials it helped me find out who and what I was and it taught me to love myself unconditionally and that I was not alone in my feelings, and thoughts. I now know what I felt wasn't voodoo but that it was reality that many of us have to experience in order to actually deal with whom and what it is that we actually are. Thanks Mr. Harris for work well done!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This book was GREAT! I could not put it down. I read it in two days. This book is all about the consequences of sneaking around in the dark. You have to realize that everything done in the dark will come to light. A must read for all! (especially men)"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I love Mr. Harris and the way he writes. Compared to his others this read like he had to meet a dead-line and breezed through it."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I have read all of his works. This one lacked passion and energy.What is the deal. All of his other books were good and &quot;And This Too Shall Pass&quot; was exceptional. It's as if he wrote this one in a couple hours of thought.The story formula is generic and uninspired. I wish I didn't buy it. Where is the passion or heck even the story telling?!Anybody can write this story. Harris seems to have put no heart into this writing. As a fan I am disappointed. And from reading all of the &quot;positive&quot; reviews, I wonder if they are true fans of E. Lynn Harris.I am and I expect more."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"E. Lynn Harris is a genius! An incarnation of the Bard, he is not. No Pulitzer or Nobel winning stuff here - just pure commonsense and escapist fun. And what is wrong with that? Again this is not a &quot;gay&quot; book, although as a gay black man it has special meaning and pulls at my heart strings, rather it is universal in its depiction of life in the fast lane at the end of the twentieth century. Highly recommended to all precisely because it educates without any arty-farty pretentions. You can easily finish it in one sitting. Mr Harris tackles some thorny issues but does not take himself seriously - and this, in my view, is the ultimate strength of his writing. Kick off your shoes, sit by a fire, sip some wine and disconnect that phone. Who could ask for anything more?"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This is the first time that I have ever written a book by this author and it was a total &quot;wake up&quot; call!! I have yet to read his other works. A must read for all African Americans!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"i have just finished this book in less than 24 hrs - i couldn't put it down. i truly enjoy the writing of mr. harris, the characters are all people that we know, love &amp; dislike - this last book left me hungry for more &amp; a trip to chicago for some wings- thank you e lynn for your wonderful ability to make us &quot;feel&quot; your characters."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Having read the three previous novels by Mr Harris, I could not wait to sample this. This book is a definate must read, intruiging, thought provoking and funny!!! Harris definately has a knack of drawing the reader into his stories without fronting or the use of vulgarity!!Itis a book that will hit you with your own prejudices right in your face. You will either love it or hate it!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I'm a newcomer to E Lynn Harris.&quot;If This World were Mine&quot;-was the 1st book that I've read of his. I found it to be for once &quot;real.&quot; I really identified with the characters, who by the way was very well written. I can't wait to get started on the others."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Very informative reading. This book/author is making me look at men in a whole new light. Hoping the light doesn't come on without &quot;Me&quot; flicking the switch on."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This book was not at all what I expected. It was not nearly as good as Just As I Am. If This World Were Mine was just okay in my book. The first two books by E. Lynn Harris I was not able to put them down. I read them both in a total of eight days. My suggestion to the author would be to write more books like the first two."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"IF THIS WORLD WERE MINE IS AS WONDERFUL AS MR HARRIS'S OTHER THREE BOOKS. I ENJOY THE CHARACTERS, THE ISSUES THAT ARRISES WERE VERY REAL. WE UNDERSTOOD WHY BASEL, AS RICH AND SUCCESSFUL AS HE IS , HE IS ALSO VERY CONFUSED AND HURT BY HIS PAST. FOUR WONDERFUL PEOPLE WITH SUCH STRONG BOND OF FRIENDSHIP THAT KEPT THEM TOGATHER IN THEIR TIME OF NEED. AS ALWAYS MR HARRIS, YOU KEEP OUR LIGHTS BURNING ALL NIGHT AND THE PAGES TURNING . THE GIRLS AND I AT WORK ARE IN ANTICIPATION FOR YOUR NEXT NOVEL.."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This was the first E. Lynn Harris novel that I read. I refused to read the other three novels a year ago when assigned by my Book Lovers' Club. I was not ready. Then my 20 year-old daughter, a junior at Hampton U. searched for it this past fall semester... I bought it as her Xmas gift. She left it @home for me to read,and I did. I laughed out loud a couple of times, but the plot was too predictable for me. Yet, I will read any future sequel about the complex John Basil Henderson."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"If this world were mine is the first that I read, but it definately won't be the last. This is a book that draws you in like a movie! I did not even want to put it down to use the restroom! I never knew a writer could be so powerful on paper. This book shows a side of society (even if ficticious) that many authors won't touch. If you haven't read it, go back to the bookstore and buy it! Thanks for my new adventure with E Lynn Harris."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Mr. Harris has done it again! His latest novel is a joy to read. The lives of the characters are believable and he makes you feel as if you are a part of the journal writing group. He changes the lives of these 4 characters carefully to keep it all real. E. Lynn Harris does something different in this book by focusing on a variety of lifestyles. Showing us how we all need a close group of friends who we can count on and share with. I enjoyed the ride along with each of the members of the group but what I enjoyed most was getting close to who Basil Henderson really is!!!! MORE MORE MORE. Basil Henderson has been a main stay in each of the three previous novels by E. Lynn Harris. This time Basil's true side is a little more exposed. We get to see what's really inside of this complex brother. His anger takes on new meaning and you end up feeling for him. I am now wanting to know more about Basil, his past, his future, his heart!!! In the end all I could do was smile !!!!! I will be anxiously awaiting book 5, Mr. E. Lynn Harris. D.Johnson"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I read this book in less than a week. It was so good I just couldn't put it down. Mr. Harris I tip my hat to you for such a wonderful collection of books that you have written. All of which I have read.just wonderful. For these books I say Thank You!!!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Mr. Harris has truly outdone himself! He has managed to give interesting, yet different lifestyles to contemporary characters and allow the reader to become caught up in each of their dilemma's. We should all be so lucky as to have good friends like the characters in this novel. It takes a lot to admit to anyone, let alone one of your best friends, &quot;Okay, I was wrong. I'm sorry and I still love you. Period&quot;. I love how Mr. Harris brought back characters from previous novels and intertwined them with this story. I was wondering what Raymond was up to. Hopefully we will find out in Mr. Harris' next novel. As for Basil, I knew there had to be a reason as to why this man was so confused. Maybe confused is too strong. I think he knew what he really wanted. He just hadn't come to terms with issues from way back. I hope in future novels he is able to come to grips with himself. At least in this novel, I know he is on the way. I know this review makes it sound as if these people are real and folks I can call and check on, but Mr. Harris has a style of writing that makes you embrace each character and accept them just as they are. I also must admit this work was also highly emotional for me. At times it was entirely too funny and toward the end I sent my daughter to the bathroom for more Kleenex. My husband thought I was losing my mind! The minute I finished this piece, with Kleenex in hand, I called one of my girlfriends who had this book and told her to drop everything and read &quot;If This World Were Mine&quot; ."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I have personally bought all of Mr.Harris' books and the joy of reading this book was the same. I truly love the descriptions he gives to cities and restaurants and the characters. So much so that I feel I'm right there with them. I became a fan of this author after his first book and will remain so. I anxiously await his next book!! You go boy!! I also feel I have a better understanding and respect for gay life and appreciate Mr. Harris' desire to get it out in the forefront. We all need to open up and understand different lifestyles and respect them, even if we don't join in or agree with it. It's all about acceptance and understanding in such a diverse culture that we live in. This review comment section is great!! Thanks amazon!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I've read the first two books, &quot;Invisible Life&quot; and &quot;Just As I Am&quot; and I must say this book is excellent just like the others. I haven't read the 3rd book, &quot;This Too Shall Pass&quot; but I plan to in the near future. E. Lynn Harris you definitely have a fan club in the Chicago Area as well as all over the United States. This book, like the others, was read in a matter of a few days. I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. It's like the soap operas on TV the only difference is that the characters are all black. Thank you for allowing me to have to opportunity to endulge in your fictional writing. Please keep me posted when the next book comes out!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"E. Lynn Harris' new book was one I had to read in a day. I could not put it down. First of all, the characters drew me in to all aspects of there lives. I felt I could feel their happiness, their pain, and their frustrations. The characterization that Mr. Harris develops is so true to life that anyone can look into their own life and identify with each person. Leland, the sweet sole that he is, all I wanted was for him to find love. Dwight, this brother made peace with his past. In doing so, he opened his heart to receive love. Yolanda, now this sista, I felt for her. Basil pretty much swept her off her feet and I do believe he loved her. I knew that she would be alright, but you could not help feeling sympathetic towards Basil. I am waiting for the sequel to this book because I want to know if Basil can actually tell his father what his uncle did to him. All I can say is DEEP. As much as I loved this book, it was not as good as his first. However, Mr. Harris is still a very talented writer and I will continue to look forward to anything that he does."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This is a great book. It is not as good as his other three, but it still can hold it's own. It's amazing how Harris come put nonfiction characters into a fiction book. Everyone of these characters remind me of someone I know. Riley is a character that everyone can relate to and don't know a Dwight. Dwight is the black man he WILL NOT let the white man rule his world, we all have one of them in our friendship cirle. I LOVE Yolanda, she has it going on! She's her own boss, have a wonderful friendship with Leland and for a while a relationship with my favorite character Basil. Harris describes him as one of the brothers you dream of having, to bad he is confused about his sexuality. His books wouldn't be the same without John Basil Henderson. I love E. Lynn Harris, he is a superb author and I love that he can put straight and gay people into one novel so it can be a book everyone will enjoy"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I have became a true fan of Mr. Harris. This is a wonderful book, it is both emotional and funny. The character are so real! I have people in my life who are exactly like the characters. I laughed so hard at Riley and her limited talent and I cryed with her when she felt her marriage was gone. Thank you, Mr. Harris, for not writting her husband as an adulter but just as a marriage that had lost its spark....... and of course Basil is great he is growing in his own way. I would like to read more about Dwight and Yoland later on. Leland is focused and funny!!!Much LoveMs.P"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This is a very good book. I have read most of this authors novel and I think he is a beautiful writer and story teller. I really enjoyed this novel."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I will read all of E.Lynn Harris' books that he writes. I love his characters and how they continue on in each book. It makes me feel as if I know them. Keep up the great work!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"&quot;If This World Were Mine&quot; by E. Lynn Harris is a well paced character driven story highlighting the trials and tribulations of four college friends almost twenty years after graduating from Hampton University. The plot revolves around a journal writing class the four friends form. Harris again proves a master at developing strong distinct characters and gripping dialogue to keep the story flowing. As usual Harris sprinkles the story with just enough surprise and scandel to keep readers completely engrossed"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"A cute love story of struggle and triumph, each character in this book learned alot and so did the reader. He is a skilled author and he keeps us wanting more. I never knew love could be that way."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This was another book that I did not too much care for. One reason because the characters had too much going on. But then again this book did keep my interest. And I was shocked at the outcome of this book too. This book was on a different style and I really like that."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I liked this book. I'm not saying I absolutely loved it nor that I couldn't stop reading but I can absolutely say I liked this book. I liked the way Harris gave the readers in in-depth look of a gay man and a bisexual man. Yolanda was truly a great character, she was witty and I think alot of woman can relate to her. I enjoyed this book. However; I wasn't engulfed. Reading it became on and off when the plot thickened so much I could hardly see clearly where it was going. But I'm glad I kept reading because it got exciting again.There was a suprising ending and it was very unpredictable."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Mr Harris is more than an author his is a magical storyteller and a truthful one. i have read everybook that he have written for invisible life, just as i am, and this to shall pass, and now if this world were mine. mr harris give a good account of how it is to be a young black gay man in a world that already looks down on being black. to be gay and black is a double problem, but mr harris shows that being black and gay or bisexual means that you can be independent and successful. it take time for many of us to see that a good thing is right in our face and go else where looking for it. mr harris also covers this topic in one of his book with zurich. i am eagerly awaitng to read the next book in mr harris line of great stories. when i read the first one i could not put it down. now i read them from time to time over and over to let me know, even thought his characters are fiction that some of the same problmes that they are having and working through that i can work thorugh them to. all of mr harris's books are of good quality and i will read any book he publishes because he is a superb author."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"'ITWWM', is the first book of E Lynn Harris, that I've read, I found it to be very thought provoking and quite intense. The lives of 4 friends and how they shared the harsh realities of life was the bases for this story. The characters were believable and the storyline was good. I did not know Basil from Harris' other works, but I started to understand his dilema as the book progressed. And, I felt his suffering more than the other characters. Harris allowed us to see people as just human beings, opposed to 'straight, gay or bisexual' people. I must confess, this book will make me take a different look at men. Not in a negative or sterotypical way, just with more scrutiny. I do like Harris' writing style."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I began to read this book while I was waiting for my plane in SFIA to Vancouver and this modern story captured me. I went on reading it when I took the plane to Amsterdam, flying away from &quot;mon Canada&quot; for the second time and it was delicious, staying awake in the plane, using the little light above my head to know what these friends were going through. This is a real anthem to friendship and to the way of getting in touch of these days, c'est-&agrave;-dire internet and e-mail. Love, loneliness, sadness and comfort together: things of our lives that will always be with us. The meeting of old friends through the years is a good theme, even if I'm only 21 years old, and the way Harris lets each of them speak of their feelings about the people they know and the things they do, well, it made me cry when I finished it, right on the last piece of land of Qu&eacute;bec, with Atlantic Ocean close to me. This book reminds me the fantastic summer '98 in Canada (plus Washington D.C. and SF) and the beautiful people I've met over there, hoping to never say goodbye. Friends will be friends!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I just finished reading this novel and I found it extremely difficult to put down...I just had to find out what was going to happen next. As an African Canadian female it is always exciting to read books that I can personally relate to. I would most certainly recommend this book to anyone . It made me laugh out loud, it made me cry and overall it made me 'think'. In all honesty I found it to be the best of the series. Mr Harris only gets better with time."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I read this entire book in less than 24 hours. That says something for the author. As usual, Mr. Harris spins a tale that you can't get enough of. He introduces characters that you can stand and characters you can't. Then he weaves them in one story while they each have something else brewing on the side. He doesn't completely satisfy your hunger one sitting in his books. This hunger is what pulls me across the gap to his next book. So Mr. Harris, I am waiting.I have seen Mr. Harris' work seriously criticized, but his development of the character John Basil Henderson has been excellent. He was a secondary player in this edition, but wanting to understand him is part of what kept me reading the book. He is a scoundrel that gets what he deserves, but you still don't hate him. I hope that Mr. Harris will continue to expand on this character."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I read this entire book in less than 24 hours. That says something for the author.

I took this book from my mother after she gave me her word it was good--too bad my mother and I have two different tastes. Now, maybe I didn't give the book a chance, but if you can't pull me in after seventy pages...you're not going to pull me in. I expected a great deal more from E.

WARNING: If you don't have someone special, it will make you wish you did!! (: Happy Reading"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"E. Lynn Harris has done it again! He's written another book that is HARD to put down, with characters you want to know better. For those who are familiar with the John Basil character, you will be pleased to know he's baaack, and with another dimension which I hope is explored in future novels. I now understand the scars which have created the person that he is, although now I see, that once he finally confronts those demons he'll be a decent guy. Hey Leland, are you listening? Above all, there is a deeply spiritual thread which runs thru all of Mr. Harris' writings which always leave me with a renewed affirmation on life and relationships.Overall, E. Lynn has come up with another winner, and i personally cannot wait for the next novel"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"As usual ELH does his business of writing very interesting novels. If you haven't read the books in sequence it definitely puts things into perspective w/Basil and others."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"What a depiction and testament of how to deal in and with relationships and life issues. I've grown so fond of the characters from INVISIBLE LIFE to ABIDE WITH ME to IF THIS WORLD WERE MINE. They're old acquaintances of mine! I've felt their joy, pain, longing and shared their struggles. IF THIS WORLD allows more insight into the gay/bisexual male life-and all that it may involve. IF THIS WORLD makes obvious the truth that we all, whether gay,straight,bisexual, whatever, have the same needs,wants and desires-share the same life experiences. Ultimately, the message is that truth, to self and others, will render freedom."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I enjoyed the book for what it was worth, it was not the book that will change my life or how I look at people. My problem with Harris' books are why must almost every man either be gay or have gay lust. I understand that from his perspective it would be nice, but damn can the sisters get a break! Of all of the male characters in the book only 2 wern't gay! Harris' writing is entertaining but at sometimes confusing."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I was able to read this book in one night. I think it is more due to a very predictable plot than to any innate reading skill on my part. At times, I felt as if I was reading And This Too Shall Pass with different characters. The similarities are obvious: Leland is a proud homosexual just like Sean from ATTSP. Dwight is a male Tamela and Uncle Doc is a male twin of Mama Cee. Harris has significant skill as a writer, I would like to see him use it for something more constructive than these predicable, sophomoric, sensational plots and characters. Harris is gay, and proud of it, but in order for me to read another one of his books he would have to tackle another subject than the plight of black homosexuals in this country. Furthermore, he can be truly over the top with his characters. Monty, the sex-crazed singer comes to mind on this subject. Overall, this book is a fun read, but if you have read Harris before it is just the same old story."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I initially read this book on a whim on a slow afternoon in one of my friends house, what slowly started to draw me in was the authors particular attention to the intricacies of relationships, many people complained about the book being convoluted and the plot too thick but in essence arent all relationships? Thats exactly what the realistic even somewhat romantic approach to this book was trying to present, that love and relationships arent segmented into such easilt difestible bits. I recently picked up another book ofhis after the completion of this addictive novel and found that the characters rotate in and out of focus with each one. If you read this book you will see just how much friendship and love can mean through Mr Harris'sdepiction of all it's troubles and it's gossamer beauty. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I guess I'm Late but I'm just starting to read the E. Lynn Harris but all that I read I loved. he is the bomb with his descriptions."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This is a good book... I recommend it to anyone... though I was getting a littled tired of the book... it's very interesting... it talks from the lives of racism, homosexuals, and heterosexuals..."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"How does E. Lynn Harris continue to come up with such beautiful work. This novel is written so nicely, expressing almost every detail in such an explicit way. I loved it.Congradulations again which I'm sure has been expressed by many."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Of E Lynn Harris' books, If This World Were Mine is my favorite. I started with Invisible Life as a whim... I saw it on the shelf of a local bookstore. I thought it was a good book, but with each progressive book, E Lynn gets better and better.This novel follows 4 college friends as they come back together to establish a journal writing group. What I liked best is that the characters were wonderfully developed, so there were 4 stories intertwined. Chauncey, Dwight, Yolanda and Leland all grew in the book, and we also got a good peek at our continuing character-friend, Basil. There's laughter, tragedy, revelation and romance all in this 318 page book.I would definitely recommend this book to ANYONE. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I loved this book, as well as any other E. Lynn Harris Book. Even though his work deals with the gay lifestyle, there are real life situations that everyone can relate to.&quot;If this world were Mine&quot; deals with four friends who start a journal club. They write down what events in that week they would like to share with each other. In the course of these events one friend knows something about the other friends significant other and won't tell because of the patient confidentiality. which leads to big blows when the friend finds out that the other friend knew about the secret life of her boyfriend, which leads to name calling and them not speaking to each other.Until a fatal event happens when the friend is shot in a grocery store and is near death. This brings the friends closer together.This book has its funny moments, and makes you think how you should value each other's friendship. It also shows you how to be careful of what you say, becasue you don't know when the last time you will see that person."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This book kept coming into view &amp; I finally took it home to read. What a homecoming! Friends from their college years, four African American Chicagoans face a year of change and tragedy, memories and a testing of their friendship.

A great gift!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"IF THIS WORLD WERE MINE HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!!

The characters are so real. My girl Riley is a SCREAM. I can not wait for the next book by Mr. Harris."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Actaully I would give this book 2.5 stars. The best part of this book are the journal entries written by the characters themselves because they actaully allow you to get into the character's head and into the emotional context of each character. We get some more insight into the character of John Basil Henderson but it is not enought to make me care. Ever time I read a E. Lynn Harris novel I say \\"NEVER AGAIN\\" after I finish it, and yet like a glutton for punishment, I go back time and time again. Why? Mr. Harris is not a strong writer but tries to make up for his lack of writing ability with his plot twist and turns. While black gay men and straight black women gush and early await the next book in his mutli-seller book chain,the rest of us scratch our heads and wonder \\"what all the hoopla is about.\\" There must be good, black gay writers out there somehere. Yet E. Lynn Harris get national accliam for his writing. How sad.Also I very tried of E. Lynn's sanitized views of gay sex. If I read one more time \\"his sex. . .\\" I think I'll throw up."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I guess I finally had to read one of E. Lynn Harris's books. I can't recommend this one. The multiple first-person narratives were needlessly confusing (and lazy writing, in my opinion). Dwight's \\"militant\\" character was a too cliched to be believable. Riley's passive aggression was annoying. Still, the plot was just captivating for me to finish the book. The happy endings seemed a bit too contrived to resolve all the multiple plot threads.I can't speak with any authority on the bisexuality. I don't think Harris adequately explained (is that the right word?) why a man would be alternately attracted to both men and women. He seemed to be saying that homosexual liasons in this context were either the result of a past history of sexual abuse or opportunity. I don't think either explanation held water in the context of the two male bisexuals in this book.I think Harris is a writer that needs to be published. The subjects in this book do exist in the real world and deserve to have a voice. Could this particular book have been better written? Absolutely. Was it worth the week it took me to read it. Maybe."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"An African-American co-worker shared this book with me, and I couldn't put it down. The characters were accessible and I feel closer to those around me. I was turned on by the fresh approach of writing from each character's point of view; very innovative! Can't wait to read another of Mr. Harris' novels."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Being a big fan of Mr. Harris and his previous novels (all three, of which I own), I could not wait to go out to purchase this one. He more than lived up to my expectations with his fourth novel. The drama was sooo real. The Characters were real and very well developed. I was glad to Basil come back. (Who knew he has so many issues.) I am eagerly awaiting his fifth."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"All I want to ask is if anyone knows when E.Lynn Harris'next book is to be released?

He weaved a complex and interesting storyline that actually made the characters come to life. i found myself missing them days after i had finished the novel. I loved it!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I came across this book in library, not knowing what I was in for. I would love to buy this book and read it again. I found myself telling everyone about the book and they all seemed interested and wanted to read the book also. The characters were all excelent. If you want to read a book that you won't want to put down read this book!!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"This is a knockout book written by one of America's successful African-American authors. I started reading E. Lynn Harris's books several years ago and his writing style has evolved with each novel. &quot;If This World Mine&quot; is DEFINITELY the best book he has penned since &quot;Just As I Am.&quot; His latest novel shows how people can change for the better and the importance of friendship among your peers. Agains, ten cheers for talented authors like E. Lynn Harris! Looking forward to the next novel with great anticipation."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I have read all of E.

I look forward to reading more from him."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"After reading two of Mr. Harris previous books I was more than ready for this latest installment.

Lynn ya don good.&quot; A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I have read all of Harris's books, they are all phenomenal. They make you think about your life and your friendships. I would like to see &quot;If this world were mine&quot; as a movie, that would be really interesting. I recommend this book for anyone to read. I'm waiting for his next novel, hopefully using the all of some of the same characters of his last book."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Years after graduation from Hampton University, this circle of friends keeps in touch through periodic meetings and journal writing. This is E. Lynn Harris' fourth novel so you know that at least one of the main characters is a gay man with a good heart. The infamous Basil Henderson appears in this story as well and adds twists to the lives of many. This time, though, E. Lynn sheds a little more light on Basil's background and you can, at least try, to understand why he behaves the way he does.I liked this book because it is real about the friendships it portrays. Nearly 20 years after college, these characters are still fighting, loving and learning from each other. The familiarity of the families, college life and professional pursuits make this book very easy to read and relate to. For those who love his stories, this is a good one.If This World Were Mine is crying for a sequel to tie up lots of loose threads."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Really a good book. It was a page turner, it's got dramma, love, friendship, all that stuff that makes a good book. I recomend it if you want a relaxed read."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I've read all of Mr. Harris' novels and I anxiously await his next release. I never thought that I would enjoy reading about the gay underworld and how it relates to the heterosexual community. Mr. Harris' novels have helped me to keep an open mind when dealing with and accepting differences.I also enjoy how the character Basil slowly but surely creeps into Mr. Harris' novels. With this book I was able to finally realize what issues Basil was dealing with. I hope the character, Basil and his healing is explored in furture novels. A great, great book."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"First and formost let me warn you that if you pick this book up, be prepared to call in late the next morning. It is that good. The book focuses on the lives of four individuals from very different backgrounds and perspectives and how their lives come together to form a bond that violance, feelings of being deceived or even bad siniging can not break.It is a book that as a man I can assure you it will make you laugh, think, cry (not that I did mind you), and simply smile. There are stong male charaters in the book as well as women who don't lose their minds while they are waiting to exhale.So buy it. . . and think of a good excuse for your boss tomorrow."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"You would be hard-pressed to find an unlikelier cast of characters or a thinner premise within the annals of literature than what you find here in Mr. Harris' latest offering. Getting together monthly to read your journal entries, and, which is worse, listening to the entries of others? Come on. I'd have a hard time with such an assignment if it were part of the curriculum of a required college course much less voluntarily submit to the ordeal. Harris should have come up with a more believable pretext for getting these disparate people together. As usual, the prose advancing Harris' storyline is flat and uninteresting, peppered with Creative Writing 101 descriptive phrases which render the whole exercise hackneyed and trite. Fans of E. Lynn Harris must not get out much, nor read much other fiction if they truly believe &quot;This is the best book I ever read!&quot;. Among black authors, Toni Morrison is a vastly superior writer; among gay black authors, James Baldwin is without peer. Come on, people, broaden your literary horizons!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"I READ THIS BOOK IN ABOUT ONE QUICK WEEKEND AND I FOUND IT TO BE ONE OF MR. HARRIS BEST WORK SINCE &quot;INVISIBLE LIFE&quot; IT'S WONDERFUL TO KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE STILL MAINTAIN COLLEGE FRIENDSHIPS INSTEAD OF GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS. I CHEERED FOR EACH OF THE CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEY EACH TAUGHT ME SOMETHING. RILEY IS LIVING PROOF THAT MONEY DOESN'T ALWAYS BUY YOU HAPPINESS, LELAND IS STILL A STRONG PROUD GAY MAN WHO DIDN'T GIVE UP ON LOVE, DWIGHT CAME TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT HIS HATRED FOR WHITES CAME FROM A PAIN FUL EXPERIENCE FROM CHILDHOOD AND YOLANDA STILL MANAGED TO HAVE FAITH IN HER FRIENDS AND STILL GO ON DESPITE THE MOST CRUEL BETRAYAL THAT ANY PERSON COULD IMAGINE. I ALSO FAMILIARIZED MYSELF WITH BASIL HENDERSON AND ALTHOUGH HE GOT HIS PAYBACK BIGTIME THE WAY HE DESERVED IT, WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT BEHIND THE FACADE OF BEING SUPERSTUD, THERE LIES A VERY LONELY AND EMBITTERED MAN WHO WILL NEVER FIND LOVE WITH ANOTHER MAN OR WOMAN BECAUSE DEEP DOWN HE DOESN'T LOVE HIMSELF AND HE STILL WRESTLES WITH THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDHOOD.

If you are E. Lynn Harris fan and liked Just As I Am, you'll love this book. It was written in a similar manner. This book seemed to be a little more humorous than his past books are. Added bonuses are characters from past books show up in this one. My only critiques of the book are that it started out a little slow and has journal entries written by the characters that tend to drag on a little."},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"After reading books mostly for educational purposes - to dive into a E Lynn Harris book is truly a pleasure. I read this book while on a 2 day business trip. Then made my way to the nearest bookstore to purchase his previous novel, &quot;And This Too Shall Past&quot; and finish that book on the flight back home. Mr. Harris has a unique style of writing that, apart from the sexual issues, whether you agree or disagree, his characters create a lasting impression upon his readers. March 16th (the release date of his next novel) can not come soon enough! Hat's Off!!"},{"Title":"If This World Were Mine","review":"Wouldn't it be great if more folks who DID NOT like certain books took the time to reveiw them on Amazon? Well, here I am. And let me tell you E. Lynn Harris is not worth your time. He is, unfortuantely, a marginal writer with little to say. The only redeeming factor of this book, which I read while on vacation in St. Maarten, is that it gives a human face and voice to black gay men. But that was not enough. The characters and plot are superficial, trite, predictable and soap opera-esque. I felt my mind was turning to mush while I read this; eerily similar to the feeling of watching too much TV or eating too many potato chips. If you like Terry McMillan, you'll love this drivel. If not, read authors that challenge, teach and inspire. Harris does not fit the bill."},{"Title":"The Stylistics Reader: From Roman Jakobson to the Present (Hodder Arnold Publication)","review":"This exciting volume organized by Jean Jacques Weber provides an overview of this subarea of linguistics. As he says &quot;the book focuses on the main problems that have fascinated scholars working at the interface between language and literature: What is literature? How does literary discourse differ from other discourse types? How do we read and interpret literary texts? What is style? What is the relationship between language, literature and society?&quot;Fine essays written by a few of the most important scholars of the stylistics area are edited as chapters of the book. One can choose while reading them all or just a special one. Each section introduces a particular approach, thus covering the major tendencies in stylistics in the last 35 years: formalist, functionalist, affective, pedagogical, pragmatic, critical, feminist and cognitive. The aim is to provide a full sense of what stylistics is all about.The reader will find out who are the main stylists up to the presente and what do they think about the discipline. Readers are encouraged to take up their own position in the fundamental debates. To grant this task, the early chapters introducting approaches current in the 1960s and 1970s are each followed by a more recent paper which takes issue with some of the assuptions behind these theories. The second part of the book presents the main currents in contemporary stylistics: pedagogical stylistics and the differents types of contextualized stylistics practised nowadays.There are suggestions for further reading, and notes and references are provided for each essay. I would recomend this book for all that work with linguistic criticism, not just literary stylistics studies. It is also a good &quot;guide&quot; for students, who are seeking for information and discussion about the interface between language and literature."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"After I read Lubos Motl's review below, I became interested in this book. After I saw that Lubos called Woit and his collegues crackpots in Woit's blog, I became even more interested. As Lubos is a String Theory researcher, one could expect a reaction. But not of this dimension and depth. I have a background in Physics and still love Physics. If this book makes an active Hardvard physics professor spend time on it and call its author a crackpot and the author is an active Columbia physics professor, then it must have something worth it. As the only game in town, String Theory should be challenged. This book does it."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"I've been reading popular accounts of physics, esp. cosmology and quantum physics, for the past 30 years. Inevitably, the past 10 - 15 years or so a lot of these books contained many pages extolling the virtues of the new miracle theory (perpetually) on the horizon aka \\"string theory\\".I was always led to believe this theory would finally merge quantum field theory and general relativity, and soon the very first moments of the Big Bang would be a mystery no more.I should have known something was amiss. Whereas one (a non-physicist I mean) can at least understand the gist of quantum physics and general relativity with at least a minimal understanding of calculus or topology, no such luck with string theory. The message always seemed to be: \\"string theory involves very, very complicated mathematics, and except for a very few lucky people everyone is just too much of a moron to understand any of it\\".After reading Peter Woit's book, I understand why none of the popular books on string theory seem to make much sense. String theory is a dream that someday the magical formula that explains everything will pop out of the vacuum (sorry, infinite number of vacua).I will continue reading popular science books, including those of the string lovers. But this book is certainly a must read for everyone interested in the frontier of physics."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Before I begin, let me just mention that my PhD supervisor was (and is) a leading string theorist and author of the recently published 'A First Course in String Theory'.It is interesting to read the review by Lubos Motl, who is a somewhat extreme example of an outstanding young 'establishment' theoretical physicist who like so many others has been lured onto the string theory bandwagon, which for him has now become an obsession. While attacking Woit's blog, he fails to mention that he himself also has a well-known blog which panders to the cravings of fellow string theory devotees.His review of Woit's book, like many of his writings, is an exercise in intellectual nit-picking, where the underlying argument can be summarised as, \\"my (our) mathematical ability and knowledge of theoretical physics is far superior to yours, therefore I (we) are right, and you are (not even) wrong\\". Motl is the kind of person who would have considered Einstein to be a mathematical lightweight who most likely stumbled upon his theory of relativity more by chance than skill. Indeed, Motl would certainly have been amongst those who poo-pooed Einstein and his ideas until his death. While it is probably true that Motl and many other string theorists like him are technically more sophisticated than Einstein ever was (or could even hope to be back in those days), in terms of originality, creativity and raw insight, Einstein really would put Motl and his ilk to shame. That is why Einstein will always be 'Einstein', and Motl will always be plain 'Motl'. Motl is nothing but a sheep in wolf's clothing.Putting such things aside, it is certainly true that string theory is by far the most beautiful and complex physical theory that man has ever contemplated, so that it is hardly surprising to find so many young researchers drawn to it. It is also one of the very few theories currently under serious investigation as a possible 'theory of everything', with the potential to unify gravity and the standard model. There was a time long ago when string theory was thought (or rather, hoped) to be a single unique theory, but the proliferation of string vacua (the 'landscape') and the consequent complete lack of predictiveness should, for any reasonable-minded person, dash any hope of it being the 'theory of everything'. Rather, the huge number of manually tunable parameters make it a 'theory of almost anything'. Given any particular universe you can imagine, the chances are that there is a string theory (or more likely, lots of them), which describe it. To still hold on to the vain and distant hope that maybe, just maybe, there is some deep, as yet unknown, underlying symmetry principle which will somehow manage to pick out our particular universe as the only possible one out of the infinite number of possible stringy universes, is beyond wishful thinking - it is an exercise in pure self-delusion. Unfortunately, \\"all that glitters is not gold\\" - mathematical beauty in and of itself simply does not imply correctness.Of course string theory should continue to be studied, but the physics establishment is in a state of crisis when an extraordinarily disproportionate number of people are investigating a model which potentially has nothing useful to say about the real world. Time, money and effort are surely better spent elsewhere.Even though it may leave a bitter taste in the mouths of the more fanatical string theory advocates, Woit's book remains an important contribution, and for the sake of scientific advancement we would do well to take note of the issues he raises."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Looking at the various popular science books published on the topic of fundamental physics in recent years, one might be forgiven for getting confused between what is scientific fact and what is science fiction. We have grown used to seeing top theoretical physicists enthusing about Superstrings, extra dimensions, wormholes and time travel, all of which - on the basis of current evidence - belong in the latter category, but rarely do we get an assessment of the state of this particular art that concentrates on what is known rather than what the speaker/writer would like to believe.Dr. Woit takes the view, as do I, that if we want Science Fiction, then we can watch Star Trek or read Isaac Asimov - these people, after all, are the professionals, and do a better job at this than Harvard Professors.What I would like to concentrate on therefore is not, \\"Where can I let my imagination take me?\\" but the ultimately far more interesting - to a scientist at least - \\"What is Mother Nature trying to tell us?\\"To do this requires a certain humility, a certain coolness, and above all the ability to exercise judgement. It is easy to be critical of other people's ideas, but to be critical of one's own without causing the creative flow to dry up altogether, is the real challenge.The title of the book derives from a comment made by Wolfgang Pauli - one of the founders of quantum mechanics, and arguably someone who took the criticality too far - who, upon hearing a half-baked idea from a student, remarked, \\"Your theory is not correct. In fact, your theory is not even wrong. Your theory makes no predictions at all.\\"Unfortunately, though, however much the enormous efforts expended on Superstring theory in the last twenty years may have pushed back the boundaries of mathematics, \\"not even wrong\\" is a fair and accurate assessment of its worth as a physical theory.If theoretical particle physics is to dig itself out of the rut, it must start with an honest assessment of its achievements to date. This is the main thing that Woit provides in this book. The first part is spent describing the so-called \\"standard model\\" of particle physics. Most of this material one may find elsewhere - most entertainingly in Crease and Mann's excellent, \\"The Second Creation\\" - but it is when the book gets to the chapter entitled, \\"Beyond the Standard Model\\" that it really starts to get going. Woit is not just about saying what these attempts were, but also why they were tried, and where they led. Although Superstring theory is the main focus of this analysis, it is by no means the only one: also explored are such topics as Grand Unified Theories (GUTs), Technicolor, Lattice Gauge Theories and many others, and all with an honesty that the advocates would admit only if wired up to a Polygraph.This book is not the end of the story. It is, on the contrary, a beginning. It forms a basis from which the younger generation of scientists can decide what is and is not worth examining. The point is just that if you are going to heal yourself, the first thing you have to do is to acknowledge that you are ill in the first place. To have an account of the state of the art free of hype and unwarranted self-promotion is a major contribution.I should also add that, like \\"The Second Creation\\", \\"Not Even Wrong\\" generally avoids mathematical equations and can be read by anyone.It should be required reading for every researcher coming into the field of particle physics."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Woit has written a very good book! Having studied strings since their inception (following on the duality work of Veneziano in 1968, and then many others) my work fortunately took a different path... The unique position that now appears is that of one who knows what strings are all about, but who enjoys seeing how long it'll take the rest of the physics fraternity to catch up - this claim is backed up below with a few solid predictions! Unlike a large proportion of stringy 'aficionados' (seemingly driven by egos rather than desires to advance physical understanding) Woit has taken pains to be unemotional (unlike Motl) and to present the hard facts (both in reality and as conceptually hard) to an intelligent readership. Woit has completed a difficult task well without relying on the 'descriptive' cover of mathematics - even though he has the maths tools to have done so.A vital aspect of Woit's book is that it approaches the strings debate scientifically; that is, from its conceptual basis, although words are used to decribe the physics instead of mathematics. In my opinion this was hard. The well-chosen phrases that Woit uses to explain the physical concepts have an effective mathematical shorthand, but that's just another language; you don't need math to make useful contributions to physics - although to be heard it certainly helps. Woit's book is the first to ask the very 'hard' questions of a fraternity that does not liked to be questioned - he allows the readers to form their own views after presenting most of the hard facts.The problem with strings (it is not a theory since nothing about it can be falsified - just as there is nothing falsifiable about a pretty picture even though it can be said to be descriptive of what the artist was thinking at the time) is that it attempts to describe physical reality from the side-in. The concepts of both quantum mechanics and general relativity describe reality from a top-down perspective, but reality is only generated from bottom-up in a very simple way. Looking in from the side one sees many things, depending on one's field-of-view; all different and parts of the whole. What strings attempts to describe is othogonal to reality as seen from above or below; thus, it is not surprising that the number of edge-on views available to strings is nearly infinite and so the true landscape of reality unseeable from its stringy perspective.As promised above, some predictions that come from a bottom-up view of reality. The Higgs energy is 34.25 TeV, supersymmetry is true, but to see it needs high resolution, not high energy; a good example is the energy space between electron 510999 eV and selectron 512104 eV, and between proton 938272194 and sproton at just 7429 ev up-scale at 938279623 eV and spin-zero. Every mass is able to be calculated easily and exactly. The universe that we occupy is uniquely described by a very simple mechanism, and it cannot be any other way! I enjoy seeing how difficult all the stringy people are making things; they need to revisit 1972 and find the proper path. Woit's words will win in the end. He has had the courage to tell the story how it really is, and the truth is all that really matters in the end..."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"The \\"science fictional\\" elements of string theory have a tremendous appeal to me, frankly, so the physics presentations I've gone to and seen on video were virtually always string-theoretical in nature. Since I'm not paid to do physics, I only paid attention to the most exciting stuff. We were lucky enough to have Fenyman lecture to a couple of my physics classes, but the presentation I went to by him later was on nanoengineering, for instance, because that's cool and scifi-ish. I read the Feynman Lectures and lately worked my way through Penrose's Road to Reality. I have to say, the periodic admission or criticism that string theory, M-theory, branes+string etc. had not progressed made me wonder why it was so prominent, but I basically assumed that it was the high cost of testing it at fault, and also assumed that, frankly, the top physics researchers, including people like Hawking, knew what they were doing. I can't blame my professors, my physics study was very basic, Standard Model stuff in my 1st year of grad school (after which I stopped taking physics courses). And then and undergrad I wasn't that big on cosmology, I was into energy and thermal statistical physics and basic math tools. It was after that when a lot of my reading was popular physics books like The First Three Minutes that I basically assumed string theory had won out.Thanks to this book (kind of the straw that broke the camel's back, frankly), I am going to look at and attend no more presentations on tachyon theory and smeared branes and so on. (You could do a whole geek-zombie comic book, I think, about students who turn into zombies studying the d-braned theories of inarticulate p-branes, shambling around calling out braaaanes.).If you haven't read it, NEW's not stumping for anything else, not twistor theory, not steady state, not loop quantum gravity, nada. Purely establishing the negative. That's a tremendous plus. Also, I don't feel qualified to make the kind of metascientific judgment it would need to arrive at Peter Woit's position.It seems to me more likely that the people who say you can reconfigure string theory as a convention of some sort are right. That does not mean I support the idea you can directly make string theory match conventional spacetime 4-dimensions field theory, but rather that you can PROBABLY find ways to model all the things that the string theory program gets when it uses extra compactified dimensions or branes.I think Academician Prokhor Zakharov should have the last word, however, since his analysis was prescient:\\"A brave little theory; and actually, quite coherent for a system of 5 or 7 dimensions. If only we lived in one!\\""},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"\\"Not Even Wrong\\" is a critique of String Theory, written for the non-specialist. Its criticism of String Theory is very effective, even devastating. But the book is much more than that. Woit presents the development of modern fundamental physics, in terms that a non-physicist can understand (there is not one equation in the book).Of course, as Woit explains, a real understanding of physics can only be attained by those who understand the mathematics in which it is expressed. But Woit does the best job I have ever seen of conveying as much of an understanding as is possible without math.As a former research physicist, I would question some of Woit's assertions about the path which development took. For example, it was clear even before the discovery of the charm quark that a quark model required at least 6 quarks. But this is a very minor quibble. Overall, Woit's presentation is masterly."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Excellent book. There are hard parts and easier parts. But the main point is that diversity is needed in the study of physics, I agree. Peter shows that string theory has not lived up to its hype, our research dollars can be better spend by providing funding for a portfolio of studies into various areas not only ST. See Penrose for some further ideas here. I vote Peter, Lee and Roger are the board of review for Physics funding based on there excellent approaches."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"I've been following the arguments made by Peter Woit against String Theory for quite some time, and it's a pleasure to be able to have them all in a single volume. His arguments are very persuasive, and his writing clear and to the point. This, however, is not a book that the general audience will find easy to follow. The earlier chapters recount the canonical story of the success of the particle physics in the 20th century, and if you are familiar with that story you can safely skip these chapters. The later chapters are the really interesting ones, but unless you have at least some familiarity with theoretical particle physics and the modern mathematics, you might find yourself lost. Even with that caveat it is still possible to appreciate the central theme of this book: theoretical particle physics took a wrong turn somewhere in the late 70s and the early 80s, and has never been able to recover from this. Woit is appealing in this book to the practitioners in the field to be more honest with their assessments of the direction in which the theoretical particle physics is headed, and the lack of any meaningful progress.Unfortunately, I am very skeptical of the potential impact of this book on the field of particle physics. The Emperor is naked, but he is perceived as irrelevant as well."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"The impact of the book such as this on young minds, including me, is enormous. This is because to the eyes of untrained physics students everything seems convincing given that the argument presented tells only positive sides of the story. The very book which influenced me greatly is of course 'The Elegant Universe' and 'The Fabric of the Cosmos' by Brian Greene, a well known string theorist. It convincingly argues why string theory has to be 'The' grand unified theory, and anyone who has an ambition to make contribution in this field are easily drawn in. But be warned that this is merely a story told by someone else. Physics is a subject which you have to think for yourself and make final conclusions yourself. In this regard, the book 'Not Even Wrong' not only adds balance to the controversy but demands readers to think about these issues themselves, free from any outside influence.The reason author bothers to go through the development of physical theories since the time of early 20th century is so that readers can see the apparent pattern in establishment of physical theories. That is, the constant interaction between theory and experiment and how this allows one to modify and refine older theory into better one such as standard model. Then reader can clearly see how this trend has deviated since the development of string theory which saw not a single experimental verification which will surely raise the eyebrows even if you are not an expert in this field.Surely, the lack of experimental verification does not necessarily mean the string theory is wrong. And of course that is the attitude most string theorist take, that we are only seeing a tip of an iceberg so be patient. On this nobody knows the answer, hence the debate goes on and on.The author argues there is more to the story and discuss how string theory has influence on social aspect including the job opportunity, narrow choice of research topics in order to 'survive'. This is more or less true and to me this is a very important issue because in few years time, I will be the one who will be experiencing such situation myself.Overall, I found the book well informed to read, but I must warn the general public who does not have solid physics background will find most of the material too technical. This book along with Brian Greene's book is a 'must read' for those who intend to go into high energy physics, so that reader can decide for themselves what 'they' think is right. I'm glad to see that now the controversy is not one sided because of this book and the effort of Peter Woit on his blog."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"I haven't read the book (yet), but I have followed Peter Woit's blog for the better part of a year on a regular basis, so I have a pretty good idea about what the book covers. I have also, from time to time, attempted to read Lubos Motl's blog as well. Lubos has also reviewed Peter's book here--in highly negative terms. All I can say is don't take Lubos's seriously without checking Lubos's blog yourself; as smart as he might be, he occupies a unique, alternate universe with regard to the conventions of civilized discourse.The math involved is far too abstuse for me to form a judgement on the core issues of string theory itself. Instead, I wish to make a point about Peter's philosophical stance: he's far too quick to wish that theoretical physics would continue to make testable predictions. In the golden years (by which I refer to the years leading up to the formation of the standard model) that was indeed how physics worked. It's no longer clear to me that physics *can* return to that idealized modus operandi. I never felt reading Peter's blog that he pondered that possibility deeply enough.There's a major distinction to be drawn here between a theory that can't be tested in principle, and a theory we simply can't *afford* to test, considering the cost of the equipment required (a supercollider the size of the solar system would be a good start in stocking any modern experimental physics lab).What Peter points out abundantly well is that the nature of the game has changed: the experimental checks and balances that existed a generation ago are presently in a state of shambles. Part of the problem here lies with the standard model itself: it is simply too good already. We are mostly seeking to augment the standard model on theoretical grounds, not practical grounds. If the standard model were failing on practical grounds, there would be no shortage of testable remedies proposed.The elephant in the room, as far as I'm concerned, is the question of just how much is there left to predict that can be measured/tested by machines we can reasonably afford to build/operate. The string theorists would like us to believe that we fund their activities because they are on the scent of another set of discoveries as momentus as the standard model itself. This is quite simply not going to transpire. Even in the best case scenario where a predictive theory emerges, the vast majority of what it predicts will remain outside of experimental reach; the best we can hope for is a few tantalising glimmers of experimental corroboration, whereas the standard model was far more broadly corroborated during its formative years than we can ever hope to replicate concerning its ultimate successor.The philosophical question this raises is this: why does society continue to support the theoretical physics enterprise when it has long become clear that future successes--whatever form they might take--will not resemble any template of past success? Much of the core of Peter's book is that the general public as yet fails to understand that this is the proposition we face.Unlike Peter, I'm prepared to accept that wrangling string theory into a testable configuration is not a twenty-year task; it could well be a one-hundred year task. It is my belief that the future of physics will increasingly consist of long hopeless voyages into the theoretical weeds; the physical world no longer speaks to us in the price range we can afford to stump up. I have no problem with society continuing to support speculative theory. I accept that very few or no testable propositions might emerge over many generations of work. Experimental validation was a tremendous luxury while it lasted. The next forty orders of magnitude in the energy scale won't give up their secrets half so readily as we fondly recall.The difficulty this brings about--and here I am entirely with Peter again--is that past standards for deciding which working physicists were making positive contributions and which physicists are publishing rubish have gone far by the board. We now have this giant abstruse literature which contains large amounts of pure rublish (of that I harbour no doubt whatsoever), yet there is presently no viable frame of reference for determining which 50% (or 90%, or 99%) is the rubish, and what remaining fragment is worth keeping. The string theorists cite each other, no outside party understands anything, it has all become highly cabalistic. Lubos, in particular, loves to point out how the outside parties lack the IQ points to appreciate this beautiful theory. That might well be the case, but it is *not* the case in the animal kingdom that the low-IQ outsiders continue to indefinitely foot the bill because the high-IQ insiders ooh and aah ever so persuasively; Lubos should be careful what he wishes for.If string theory is to become an intellectual venture of many hundred years, and it might take that long to get anywhere, why are we pouring so much money and talent into it now, in this generation? There are other areas of physics that might have more immediate promise. With every new discovery in string theory, it only seems that the weeds become that much taller and thicker. How many people are left who believe that string theory is primed to burst out into the sunlight with an experimental prediction any day now? Not many, that I can see.Like Peter, the landscape is what really gets my goat. To my ear the landscape is quasi-religous speculation. I'm not opposed to people speculating about the landscape, nor am I opposed to departments of religious studies. I am, however, strongly opposed to the use of funds earmarked for physics being put to this purpose; such work belongs in a department explicitly organised to recognize and promote expertise in quasi-religious speculation. Physics has no such tradition, and I sincerely hope it never does.Peter is great in promoting the case that string theorists have deviated far from the historical norms of physics as a discipline. He isn't so good at confronting the philosophical question of whether historical physics (the semi-lockstep march of theory and experiment that we so fondly recall) continues to exist in any practical sense. If it doesn't, string theory might be the best we can do. However--if that is the case--there's a lot to be said for the general public (who ultimately foot the bill) understanding that this sea change has indeed taken place, and in that cause I regard Peter's contributions to the public debate as an excellent first step."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"String theory is crackpot because it doesn't do anything useful. We don't say UFO's cranks are scientists because there is no connection with reality. UFO's are not real until \\"falsified\\". Science doesn't merely require that you predict fairies or that matter is made of strings. Science requires evidence, of which there is not one shred in string theory.What's exciting about extra dimensions and strings? People are more likely to believe them than UFOs, because there is allegedly some evidence in equations. What equations? There is no mathematical model connecting anything stringy to anything observable that survives scientific inspection. As 't Hooft says, \\"string theory\\" doesn't exist: it is as big a fraud as selling people a chair, minus arms, legs, seat and back.Peter Woit is interested in finding a final theory that produces predictions, and the purpose of this book is to investigate mainstream ideas and some alternatives. Lee Smolin comments that Not Even Wrong 'is a courageous and necessary book that should spark a debate about the future of theoretical physics', while Roger Penrose states: 'The hold that string theory has ... is very remarkable, considering the lack of any observational support ... Woit supplies the first thorough and detailed analysis...'Woit acknowledges on page xi that most stringers are 'not likely to be very happy with this book.'Chapter 1 begins with Winston Churchill's advice in war, the version I'm familiar with being simply: 'Never surrender!' But should this advice apply to speculative mainstream ideas?Woit discusses this in the context of stringy speculators. They too will never surrender: too much depends on their speculations. Surrender will mean loss of prestige, power, control of arXiv.org, journals, etc.Chapter 2 briefly defines (in words) state-vectors and Hamiltonians and then gives a history of experimental particle physics.Chapter 3 explains (in words and illustrations) quantum theory, symmetry groups, Lie algebra unitary group U(1), representation theory, Weyl's theory, symmetry unitary groups SU(2), special orthagonal group SO(3) and its relationship to SU(2) by rotations, particle spin, all in historical context.Chapter 4 explains the history of quantum field theory from the inconsistency of Schroedinger's quantum mechanics with relativity, through Dirac's equation that solves the problem and predicts spin, antimatter and the electron's magnetic moment. Woit briefly discusses renormalization, which is physically understood by the polarization of Dirac's sea of virtual charge created by the strong field around a real particle. The polarized charge tends to shield out most of the charge as seen at large distances or in low energy collisions. Renormalization is required because there must some kind of cutoff (reason unknown) that prevents the entire vacuum being polarized by a single real charge, but Woit does give the detailed history which makes at least the mathematical side of the problem crystal clear to the layman.Chapter 5 is gauge symmetry and gauge theories. Woit explains Weyl tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism by extending the general covariance of general relativity (general covariance is the property whereby covariant laws of nature don't depend on either the velocity or acceleration of the observer) into a new symmetry principle of gauge invariance, giving Maxwell's equations. Einstein immediately found experimental objections to Weyl, so that closed down that speculation. However Weyl later introduced the maths of spinor fields. Woit introduces the Yang-Mills weak force isospin symmetry SU(2), noting that the name derives from isotopes (where the experimental data comes from).Chapter 6 is the Standard Model. This is what you're buying the book for. Chapter 7 explains the successes of the Standard Model in experimental particle physics. Chapter 8 lists the few outstanding problems of the Standard Model like gravity and, 'Why does the vacuum state break the electro-weak gauge symmetry? If the origin of this really is a Higgs field, then at least two new parameters are needed ... One [only] is determined by the observed properties of the electro-weak interactions ... This is why the Standard Model predicts the existence of a Higgs particle, but does not predict its mass.'The first 101 pages, just described, are worth the price of the book. Chapter 9 onwards sadly gets into the boring and useless stringy speculations: Kaluza-Klein 5 dimensional unification, supersymmetry, supergravity. Sense is restored from page 120 with lattice gauge theory in quantum chromodynamics, which makes predictions that are tested. Woit explains that Witten made the decisive breakthroughs which allowed calculations to be made using the current algebra model of pions.Page 180 gives Feynman's published statement about superstring theory:'nonsense ... not calculating anything ... maybe there's a way of wrapping up six of the dimensions. Yes, that's possible mathematically, but why not seven? When they write down an equation, the EQUATION should decide how many of these things get wrapped up, not the desire to agree with experiment ... So the fact that it might disagree with experiment is very tenuous, it doesn't produce anything; it has to be excused most of the time.'Feynman added: 'String theorists don't make predictions, they make excuses.'The next hundred pages explains boring stringy pseudo science dominating the media with hype. I pray for the day when it will be possible for Woit to bring out a new edition renamed 'Not Wrong!', with those last 100 pages replaced by a discussion of naturally checkable theory, hopefully something from Lee Smolin or someone. Overall, this is the best book I've ever read.Page 227 describes the some silly attacks on Woit by string theorists:'... some superstring theorists have chosen to attack me personally [via the Not Even Wrong weblog comments section] ... One of the more excitable of such superstring theorists, a Harvard faculty member, [commented] that those who criticised the funding of superstring theory were terrorists who deserved to be eliminated by the United States military.'Woit spent the years 1984-7 as a postdoc at Stony Brook, during which the 'first superstring revolution' took place (the one where either 10 or 26 dimensions seemed likely). By 1987, superstring theory had closed down most of the opportunities for investigators interested in understanding the Standard Model in 4 dimensions. Like Feynman, Woit considered it premature to introduce extra dimensions merely in order to address speculation about graviton and unification guesses. If the introduction of extra dimensions was addressing an experimentally fact, then that would be science. Similarly it would be science if a speculation have a checkable, definite prediction.However, to invent a speculation about extra dimensions merely in order to justify other speculation about gravitons and unification of forces, without a checkable connection to reality, is not physics."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"I am writing this blurb in reply to Lubos Motl's (you guess it, another String practitioner whose livelihood is being threatened by this book) comment.The fact that Peter Woit runs a blog critical of String only shows that he is consistent with his opinions. It should shock any impartial observer that in the eye of String practitioners--Lubos Motl being by no means exceptional among String people--this somehow automatically qualifies Woit and his readers as \\"crackpots\\". But what is even more shocking is the comparison to William Dembski's ID blog, because String itself actually provides the perfect analogy to Intellegent Design.Let me elaborate. At the height of the recent Pennsylvania ID trial, many education experts came forward to defend the theory of Evolution. One of the hotly debated issues was the definition of a \\"theory\\" in science. The ID people, including Mr. George W the Decider, have argued repeatedly that, since Evolution is just a theory, other theories such as ID deserve at least some mention in the classrooms. The defenders of Evolution rely on the rebuttal that a theory in science actually means something that provides the best framework to explain a multitude of independent observations or experimental results and therefore has been accepted by scientific community at large. This, of course, is a lie. String has been paraded as a \\"theory\\" in every physics department for over two decades, and yet not only has it produced no testable prediction but it will almost certainly never be able to do so. This puts String squarely in the company of ID. Furthermore, just like ID has morphed constantly, free of the constraint of experimental confirmation, String has changed constantly ever since its inception. In other words, not only does String produce untestable predictions, but these predictions also change from year to year, often dramatically and in a mutually contradictive way. (Have they settled on the dimensionality of space-time yet? Is it 26, 10, 11, or all of the above?)Other similarities exist, chief among them the religious ferver driving both groups to influence popular opinions and police dissenting thoughts, as exemplified by Lubos Motl's criticism of this book. But there is one big difference between String and ID. The String practitioners are insiders of the science community. They hire their own and make sure String-related papers get published. When a group dominates the peer-review process, it controls the career of every physicist in related fields. It then gains the power to influence, bribe, coerce and intimidate.Of the five supposedly String supporters in general physics cited by Motl, I have not worked with Gell-Mann, Hawking or Arkani-Hamid, so I don't know what their excuses are (or if they actually need one, since String people tend to misrepresent general enthusiasm for high-energy theories as specific support for String). Prof. Weinberg is the head of a large String group even though he did not publish many real String papers himself. I would certainly count him in the String camp. Dr. Randall made her name by publishing a series of well-publicized String-inspired papers, thus can hardly be called a disinterested third party either.The rest of Motl's criticism can be condensed into two simple arguments. The first is that the author does not know details in String as well as he does. This is probably correct technically, particularly in light of the freely changing nature of String's \\"conclusions\\". But the core message (as well as the title) of the book is not that String gets the details wrong but that String has no details that can be proven wrong (or right). In this sense, Motl's straw-man argument is irrelevant.The second point Motl made is, \\"The problematic statement that string theory makes no prediction is repeated hundreds of times, and in many particular contexts, such a statement becomes not only boring but also patently false.\\" But Motl did not offer any justification why that statement is false. He simply proceeded to throw out more buzzwords and correct more details. One has to conclude that these buzzwords are nothing more than smoke screens meant to obscure the fact no justification could possibly be offered for his claim.String is a unique phenomenon. It is the most \\"successful\\" pseudo science in modern history. Its catalyst is the unprecedented absence of real experimental input in high-energy physics during the past 30 years. Like a cancer, it turns otherwise worthy members of a formerly proud body into the self-promoting endlessly-propagating automatons sucking all resources dry. Later generations of historians of science will surely make their careers studying this bizarre event. Yet it has not begun. This book is not perfect, but as the first formal effort to recognize and document this historical phenomenon, it is a must read."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Need cheering up? Get this book after reading the review below by Lubos Motl, then try to find out how he fabricated his \\"review\\". I'm a string theorist by the way, which is why I'm hiding behind a pseudonym (I don't want to be called a \\"science hater\\" by my seniors). This book makes a surprising effort to explain abstract mathematical concepts."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"This is an exciting discussion of a few problems facing mainstream theoretical physics. The Standard Model was developed in the 70s. It describes the strong nuclear force mediated by gluons between quarks, and electroweak symmetry. The latter at low energy collisions (i.e., not too close to particle cores) is broken into a short ranged weak force mediated by three massive gauge bosons, and an infinite range photon force which gives rise to the inverse square laws of electromagnetism for charges and magnets.Peter Woit points out that the Standard Model is very useful science. It can predict decay rates for a whole range of particles like muons very accurately (0.1%), it predicted the masses of the massive, weak force gauge bosons (W and Z particles) which were discovered at CERN in 1983, and it also allows a quantitative prediction of many other things. Quantum electrodynamics, part of the electroweak quantum field theory of the Standard Model, makes predictions for lamb shift in the energy levels of the electron in hydrogen, the magnetic moments of leptons (eg. muon and electron), which agree to experiment to many significant figures (more accurately than any other theory in history, including general relativity).String theory is usually presented (without evidence but with excess hype) as being the \\"best candidate for the final theory\\", an extension of existing well-accepted ideas of the Standard Model to produce a complete theory. However, as Peter Woit states in this book, the actual problems of physics which are known to be real are simply ignored by string theories, while various speculative or imaginary solutions are invented in string theory which contains neither useful quantitative predictions, nor physical dynamics of a scientifically useful kind.The actual major problems facing physics concern (1) dynamical (predictive) unification of gravity/general relativity and the Standard Model (string theory is merely consistent with a spin-2 graviton force boson, and makes no predictions that can be checked), (2) the quantitative masses and gravity strength (these are all a related problem, since gravity acts on mass rather than charge, so the Standard Model doesn't describe any of this), and (3) the actual mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking, i.e., how the vacuum polarisation (or other phenomena relating to a speculative Higgs field) give mass to three out of four of the electroweak gauge bosons at low energy, hopefully predicting an exact value for the key particle involved such as a Higgs boson.String theory fails to even tackle any of this. String theory instead postulates 10 dimensional superstrings with 6 dimensions rolled up into a complex Calabi-Yau manifold (Witten showed using M-theory that this can be unified with 11 dimensional supergravity). String theory includes supersymmetry (SUSY) which attempts to demonstrate unification of forces at a massive energy - far beyond anything achievable (even with a particle accelerator the size of the solar system) - by the extravagant addition of a superpartner for every existing particle. None of these superpartners have been observed. Nor does string theory predict anything quantitatively checkable about them, such as the exact energy of superpartners.Claimed successes for string theory such as \\"predicting gravity\\" are vacuous because there is no prediction, no connection between abject speculation and reality. The mathematics for string theory is clearly what defends it from being dismissed out of hand as crackpot speculation by the media and by its own practitioners: because of the complex mathematical nature of the Calabi-Yau manifold, it yields a \\"landscape\\" of a spectacular number of different possible metastable vacua for the ground state of the universe, about 10^350 solutions. This uselessness, far from proving string theory is \\"not even wrong\\", is usually interpreted as meaning it covers everything conceivable and is a safe bet to stake an academic career on. It's snakeoil. As the position of string theory gets worse, more popularising hype is poured into the media about the \\"possibility\\" of using strings to communicate by telepathy backwards in time across the universe, and other science fiction. (This is just like the band playing cheerfully as the Titanic sinks.)Let's spell it out: string theory is so vague it is consistent with about 1-followed-by-350-zeroes different ground states. So much for the science of string theory. The next thing is that string theory involves group-think. Peter Woit does not unfortunately present his own ideas in this book, which are interesting alternatives to string theory. This book is aimed at a wide audience and his mathematical papers can be found quite easily on the internet for free. But he makes the point that physics is more likely to advance rapidly if there is a diversity of ideas than with almost everyone thinking around the same mainstream \\"fashionable\\" speculation for decades. String theory is a new ether, and has bogged down physics for twenty years. The landscape of vacua is a pathetic end to physics. String theory is not even wrong."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Back in 1988, Richard P. Feynman wrote about string theory before dying:\\"... I do feel strongly that this is nonsense! ... I think all this superstring stuff is crazy and is in the wrong direction. ... I don't like it that they're not calculating anything. ... why are the masses of the various particles such as quarks what they are? All these numbers ... have no explanations in these string theories - absolutely none! ...\\" (Davies & Brown, \`Superstrings' 1988).String theorists hate Feynman and want to destroy the credibility of physics by turning it into a religion (check out the $1 million Templeton Prize for religion which has been awarded to string theory advocates including Davies and Barrow). String theorists will be BITTERLY disappointed to discover that the book - as actually printed and published (someone bitter has reviewed a two-year old draft version of the book here on amazon) - has been proof read very carefully and does not contain any errors of fact.But some string theorists may be offended if they are confused about the difference between facts and opinions (seeing that string theory does not contain even a single hard fact or checkable prediction!). String theory contains 10 dimensional superstring-supersymmetry speculation, 11 dimensional supergravity and spin-2 graviton speculation, so-called brane speculations and the more sensible and predictive speculation that the string theorist's special \\"mathematical skills are assumed to derive from a special 'mental vacuum state'\\", made by Nobel Laureate Brian Josephson in his arXiv paper number 0312012: \\"String Theory, Universal Mind, and the Paranormal\\". The nonsense injected into this science by such \\"string theory\\" is very worrying for us all.I found the book to be, if anything, too weak in arguing its finding that there is nothing scientific in string theory. Being too constructive, the author is apologist for the state of the art, and blames the sluggish developments on a mere over-concentration of talents in a single far-fetched design. This reader feels that the author should have placed the blame squarely on what Josephson called the 'mental vacuum state'.This is not a book which was written specifically for the great advocates of string theory mathematics like Professors Brian Josephson (who won his Nobel Prize for work in electromagnetism, a practical and therefore totally different subject), Edward Witten, Lisa Randall, and arXiv trackback dominating personalities like Jacques Distler and Lubos Motl. If the book was about these people, it would not be of interest to science.Instead, this is an exciting book written by a real world physicist who understands a lot and doesn't raise a warning unless he has a very good reason. The author was educated to post-doctorate level and developed applications for Edward Witten's quantum chromodynamics solution. He is Lecturer in Discipline and has taught quantum field theory recently.Readers will find the best ever popular introduction to the Standard Model, written by someone working on its applications at the time it was being bedded in. Readers will also find in the book a clear and well balanced guide to string theory.The author is constructively critical and does produce insightful suggestions for improving the current situation, difficult as it is for string theorists to find funding. He explains the facts about the \\"landscape\\" of solutions to string theory and other fundamental problems which prevent it from making any unique statements.But the book is worth buying if only for the lucid summary of the Standard Model the author understands so well... A book to really treasure? Definitely! A classic and a turning point in physics? Yes (if the media can learn to ignore stringy hype)."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory & the Continuing Challenge to Unify the Laws of Physics","review":"Reading the so pretending harvard professor \\"review\\" made me drop a few lines. My personal feeling is that all reviewers including book's author are wrong. String theory is not wrong. Any formal mathematical construct that can be proved is correct. Does it serve any practical purpose because of that? Not necessarily. Same with string theory, it describes what the laws of physics would be if the world just happened to function as string constructs specify. Does it? To the latest evidence it does not, but if there existed somewhere a world formed by tiny strings, perhaps string theory would describe it much better than any other."},{"Title":"The Homemade Sausage Cookbook","review":"Easy to follow and concise for the novice.

Beyond its value as a historical document, 'Living My Life' is also a gripping read. Goldman was a real adventurer, a real revolutionary after a design that seems forgotten today. The stories that come from her rough and tumble experiences in America, the still-born Soviet Union, and Europe, are breathtaking, heartbreaking, and pertinent in our own age of political and economic instability.I firmly believe that this book should be required reading in American high schools or junior highs, especially for young women. The very fact that Goldman still comes off as so dangerously radical is testimony to both her brilliance and courage, and to the lack of change that typifies most of the world's social systems.I agree with other reviewers' assessment of Goldman's writing abilities, but she was an ideologue more than an artist. Where her political philosophy is concerned, she is definitely uncompromising. However, Goldman seems to me much more human than many of the era's major revolutionary figures. Her devotion to the liberation and well-being of women and her renouncement of terrorist tactics in her later life demonstrate this quite sufficiently. The long relationship between Goldman and Alexander Berkman reveals the personal cost of revolutionary activity and is probably worth a book of its own."},{"Title":"Living My Life (Civil liberties in American history)","review":"The Autobiography of Emma Goldman was a fascinating read.

The Navajo universe was created and organized through language as the thought, conceived by Holy Beings, was projected onto the primordial unordered substance through the compulsive power of speech and song. Language then, is an energetic medium that affects the very entrails of reality. Thought then, for a Navajo, is a creative tool for ordering reality. That's why the ability to speak eloquently, and think beautiful & creative thoughts, is highly praised. A child acquires human status only after it has started to speak.In this book i've found excellent descriptions of the Blessingway ceremony and various other curing rites (designed to recreate the world through myth, song, prayer and language). This includes the best (by far) explanation of the famous Navajo phrase \\"sa'ah naaghaii bik'eh hozho\\" that Navajos use to refer to a \\"beautiful, pleasant and healthy environment\\". The phrase which represent a maelstrom of meanings is firmly rooted into Navajo mythology and thus often considered untranslatable. Moreover, Clyde Kluckhohn (the 'grandfather of Navajo anthropology) often says that English lacks terms that have simultaneously moral and aesthetic meanings and hence cannot be used to comprehend Navajos.Witherspoon tells us that the principal verb in the Navajo language is not \\"to be\\" like in many other languages (including ours); \\"to be\\" is of minor importance in Navajo. Instead, the Navajo language contains some 356,200 distinct conjugations of the verb \\"to go\\", reflecting emphasis on movement and change. Movement, song, speech and life are, for a Navajo, inseparably linked. What does such ordering of the world - in terms of change and movement, instead of the emphasis on the \\"self\\" - mean for the Navajo sense of being in the world? W. explains it all in this fascinating, hard-to-put-down book.The book includes much analysis of genealogical terms and their relationships based on sex, generation, relative age and relative distance. Being born into a clan fixes the social context of the person clearly, precisely and unalterably while the language terms used to negotiate the social and spiritual interactions change depending on the context (the brilliant discussion of k'e terms in Chapter 3). In other words, the Navajo language is analyzed and investigated by W. as an organic aspect of a culture, its evolution and its mythos. This is cultural anthropology & linguistics at its best. A few quotes to get the sense of the book (P.151):\\"For the Navajo, beauty is not so much in the eye of the beholder as it is in the mind of its creator and in creator's relationship to the created. The Navajo does not look for beauty; he generates it within himself and projects it onto the universe. Beauty is a creation of thought....[...]..the Navajo experience beauty primarily through expression and creation, not through perception and preservation. In the Western world beauty as a quality of things to be perceived is, in essence, static; to the Navajo, however, beauty is an essential condition of man's life and is dynamic. It is not in things so much as it is in the dynamic relationships among things and between man and things. Man experiences beauty by creating it.With regard to the two different views of art it is not surprising that Navajo society is one of artists (art creators) while Anglo society consists primarily of nonartists who view art (art consumers). The Navajo find it incomprehensible that we have more art critics than we have artists, and more art collectors than we have art creators (sic!). Nearly all Navajo's are artists and spend a large part of their time in artistic creation. All Navajos are singers and most Navajos have composed many songs.\\"A healthy resepct for language, its relationship to thought and natural environment also allows for intimacy between man and Earth. Witherspoon writes: \\"Four times I observed the rain ceremony performed on days with clear skies, and each time it rained within 12 hours of the conclusion of the rite, which lasted only a few hours. Only once, however, was the rain significant enough to be of some help\\"and so on. very cool. very informative. The book is prefaced by no other than Clifford Geertz! One conclusion reached by GW is that Navajo art and thought have much to offer contemporary philosophy, art and spirituality and to our understanding of connections between mental and physical phenomena. by looking into the symbolic dimensions of language we dive directly into the primordial origin of thought and its relationship to reality, to what is real. Witherspoon knows this & presents it beautifully. highly recommended."},{"Title":"Language and Art in the Navajo Universe","review":"Witherspoon approaches his study of Navajo culture with the assumption that there exists some basic tenet of the Navajo cultural system that is all-enduring, but that it is the surface dynamism of this culture that characterizes the adaptability of the Navajo people. Witherspoon spent fifteen years living with the Navajo, and his experience in their language comes more from his work as a teacher and in other personal roles than from anthropological research. He sustains that there is a cultural chasm that separates Navajo culture and Western culture. Different languages contribute to this chasm, as does ritual, a large part of the behavior that non-Navajos do not seem to understand. The question of why rituals are carried out in the way that they are garners typical responses of non-Navajos. Most often, non-Navajos claim that ritual continues because of religious prescription. The curing of ailments by ritual is dismissed as coincidence and psychosomatic effect. Witherspoon argues that these conclusions are not valid because they are made in the viewer's frame of analysis rather than that of the Navajo. &quot;Navajo acts arise out of their world and make sense within it&quot; (15). Language and Art in the Navajo Universe aims to bridge the gap between Western and Navajo cultures."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book changed my life.

He also explains the foundations of current evolutionary theory and how it has progressed since Darwin's time.More importantly, he explains that biology is not destiny and that we humans are now in a position to use our brains to subvert the blind instincts bequeathed us by our selfish genes and instead build a society based on pro-long-term survival, evidence based morality."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is an excellent book.

It explains why animals, humans and ideas are born, how they interact, and what the world looks like in wake of their cooperation and competition. It explains why we are nice and forgiving, and how we live in harmony as if protected by a higher being, despite our fundamentally selfish encoding.

There is no joy in winning, no sorrow in loss. You and I are here because we played the game well - so far. What you do, what you feel, what you will most probably do is all controlled by mathematical statistics. You are in a boat with your son and a friend of your son. You can save only two people - who will you save? No matter what you think- you are nothing but an answer to a high school probability question. This is the premise of the book. It presents some statistics concepts, not too Math heavy, presents examples from real life, and lets you think. But in the mathematical matrix, Dawkins suggests there is some hope of redemption - if not physically, at least philosophically. But that is not the focus of the book. The focus of the book is statistics, some math and how nature follows these laws unfeelingly.Some people misunderstand the book - that we are inherently selfish. That is not the message of the book. It is a book of science and evolution and math and how the gene was built to survive. Would you blame a lion for killing a calf? There is still choice - perhaps points of singularity in this mathematical matrix. But overall, we still appear to be pieces on a chess board, controlled by the rules of the game played by some unseen player."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Genes are the fundamental entity in evolution, not the survival machines. I believe that evolution strongly influences our behavior, but we have come to a point where WE can decide our behavior and reject our genes. \\"We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism- something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\\" (p. 215) And recognizing evolution is merely descriptive, not prescriptive. \\"I am in danger of being misunderstood by those people, all too numerous, who cannot distinguish a statement of belief in what is the case from an advocacy of what ought to be the case... But unfortunately, however much we may deplore something, it does not stop it being true... Let us try to teach generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish.\\" (p. 3)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins says for itself... His books are always a great reading, always a great discussion and after 30 years, I might say: specially The selfish gene!!!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I've read a half of this book and found Dawkings' view on humans as solely 'survival machines' really disappointing and provoking. He could be less passionate about his own ideas.The facts in this book are nice and fascinating, like any scientific truth. It is their interpretation that can disappoint the reader, but luckily, interpretation validity fades out as we look further into the past and future, and of course, in the light of other facts.Feeling need to soft the impression left by the book, I found the following nice paragraphs from the Genome Project papers:\\"As we enter a genomic era in medicine and biology, perhaps the greatest danger I see stems from the enormous emphasis placed on the human genome by the media. The successes of medical genetics and genomics during the last decade have resulted in a sharp shift toward an almost completely genetic view of ourselves. I find it striking that 10 years ago, a geneticist had to defend the idea that not only the environment but also genes shape human development. Today, one feels compelled to stress that there is a large environmental component to common diseases, behavior, and personality traits! There is an insidious tendency to look to our genes for most aspects of our \\"humanness,\\" and to forget that the genome is but an internal scaffold for our existence.We need to leave behind the view that the genetic history of our species is the history par excellence. We must realize that our genes are but one aspect of our history, and that there are many other histories that are even more important. For example, many people in the Western world feel a connection to ancient Greece, from which arose fundamental features of Western architecture, science, technology, and political ideals (such as democracy). Yet, at best a tiny fraction of the gene pool of the Western industrialized world came from the ancient Greeks. Obviously, this fact in no way diminishes the importance of ancient Greece. So it is a delusion to think that genomics in isolation will ever tell us what it means to be human.\\" [[...]]That paper also argues that genome literacy can teach us how to get rid of racism, cruelty towards animals, and some other bad habits. So, everything gonna be alright. :)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"It took me almost my whole life to find this book. Richard Dawkins words describe a new way of viewing the evolution process, a view that describes genes as the principal contributor for the survival and progress of species. This selfish gene behavior can be explained, in part, thanks to mathematical's game theory, which is something simple to understand since the author provide a serie of examples. He also punctuates that the selfish gene can cooperate with other genes in order to be a evolutionary stable strategy (survive through time), so in that way Nice guys can truly finish first.An interesting theory to explain the marvellous process of life."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Every sentence of this book is a powerful statement.

Maybe it's just me, but I find this hardly an earth-shattering premise. If you, like me, have ever had a genetics class in college, you will likely find most of the material in the book boring, like I did. Whether Dawkins had put together a water-tight argument did not concern me since I more or less bought into the premise from the start; however, the way Dawkins approaches his \\"proof\\" can grow tedious. And anyone would have to admit that it's scarcely a proof more than a proliferation of plausibility arguments. There aren't any definitive experiments that set out specifically for this purpose. Rather, there is an interminable array of anecdotal observations where Dawkins loosely applies his new favorite tool, Game Theory, to show that his theory can equally explain the observation as well as any competing theory (e.g. that genes select for group survival as opposed solely for gene survival), and then with invocation of Ockham's Razor, he implores us to adopt his theory over all others.The fact that this text is loaded with words like \\"selfish\\" and \\"altruism\\", and is littered with anthropomorphic metaphors imparts a degree of sensationalism that I could have done without, and frankly, detracts from the science. Like I said, whether this theory is 100% correct seems to be of little importance to science, but I wish the book were a bit better written and concise. It is far from horrible, but in the end, I just felt like saying, \\"Big Deal. Why is this book so popular?\\""},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"If you want to know how life began and how it progressed, just the facts, this is the book.

No worries about hereafter or religious reward or punishment. Thank you Mr. Dawkins, for opening my eyes and my mind."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins does a masterful job of teaching some elementary biology to the layman. The first three or so chapters do a great job of teaching the basics of evolution and the origins of life, while the rest of the book brings to the table a whole new way of seeing life, not as an attempt from individuals to survive and pass on their genes, but as an act of selfishness on the part of the genes themselves.This is a very fascinating read, and I highly recommend it to anyone, whether you want to learn about evolution, about the incredible mechanisms which are responsible for life, or the captivating \\"selfish gene\\" theory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I read the 30th anniversary edition of the book, from what I can tell the anniversary edition only contains a new short introduction and some review extracts. I kind of wish that Dawkins would have added some new additional footnotes, because the notes from the second edition were great, Dawkins better explained some things and even admitted in a few places where he was wrong. With this being 20 years after the second edition, surely even more has changed.This book so far is my favorite from Dawkins. His tone is far less assertive and arrogant than his later books, he'll often times admit when something is just his idea and that it very well could be wrong. In this one he's trying to bring more attention to the selfish gene theory, he takes a more cautious approach and tries to convince the reader this is correct and not so much that anyone who disagrees with him needs to be conquered. Also until the end his usual religious rants are completely absent and even then its only a few brief pages.This book helped to popularize the gene theory and introduced the concept of the meme and regardless of anyone's views of the two ideas, Dawkins influence from this book is enough to at least be a little respected. For me personally, I do think the selfish gene theory is plausable and Dawkins does present a good case, although I don't know near enough to actually have a valid opinion. In the end I really wish Dawkins would have stayed more like this, he seems to ramble more in later books and is more concerned with eradicating the world of creationists and theists than writing books for people who accept evolution and want to learn more about it. I have high hopes that The Extended Phenotype is more of the same (even if the reviews I've read seem to indicate that it will be over my head)."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A biological concept explained is surprisingly easy way. In nutshell, it is about Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection at gene level. But book does contain a lot more details and useful observation at gene as well at individual organism level."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"The Selfish Gene\\" is Richard Dawkins most notorious book. Many have heard about it and read disjointed quotes from it. Few have read the whole book. Parts of it do live up to the bad expectations, as when the author says: \\"Let us try to teach some altruism, because we are born selfish\\".Indeed, this anniversary edition has a foreword of the mea culpa type, in which Dawkins points out that he voted Labour at the time of writing the book (i.e. he voted Wilson and Callaghan) and later opposed Margaret Thatcher's Tory government. He also admits that the metaphor \\"selfish gene\\" can and have been grossly misunderstood, and that the book should perhaps have been titled \\"The Eternal Gene\\" or \\"The Altruist Vehicle\\". The problem with the book, really, is that Dawkins - despite the best of intentions - isn't always clear on whether \\"selfish gene\\" *is* a metaphor, or whether it's in some sense to be taken in the vernacular sense (as in the quote above). Besides, in a competitive-capitalist society, it's inevitable that the expression will be taken in its vernacular, literal, everyday sense, rather than in the more philosophical sense sometimes intended by the author. Selfish genes do conjure up pictures of a Hobbesian war of all against all, or at the very least of Adam Smith (the Adam Smith of \\"Wealth of Nations\\" for those versed in the Adam Smith Probleme).So what does Dawkins mean, then, when he talks about \\"selfish genes\\" or \\"the tyranny of selfish replicators\\"? The idea of selfish genes does mean that there is no pure altruism among living organisms, at least not among non-human animals. All cooperation is ultimately based on the self-interest of individual organisms or their genes. Essentially, there are two kinds of \\"altruism\\" in nature. Genetic altruism is directed at close kin, as when birds act as helpers at the nest, aiding their parents and siblings (and hence their own genes). Another classical example of genetic altruism is the curious phenomenon of sterility among the worker castes in social insects. Reciprocal altruism is directed towards non-kin, such as flock members. Gregarious birds warning one another of an approaching predator (or bird-watcher) are a good example. Here, the altruism is based on \\"I scratch your back, you scratch mine\\". Thus, all cooperation and seeming altruism in nature is really nepotism or the give-and-take of favours among competitors.In contrast to more doctrinaire sociobiologists, Dawkins admits that pure altruism is both possible and desirable among humans. Humans are products of natural selection, but they are unusual in the sense that their intelligence makes it possible for them to counteract the very same natural selection when they see fit. Dawkins have been criticized for being philosophically inconsistent on this point, but this *is* his point. His political opinions are (by US standards) \\"liberal\\" or even \\"radical-liberal\\", so he clearly believes that it's desirable for humans to cooperate in truly altruistic ways.Personally, I'm not so sure whether pure altruism is absent from non-human animals. Just one example: what about brown bears adopting orphaned bear cubs? Isn't that pure altruism? Dawkins and other Neo-Darwinists believe that natural selection only works on individuals or individual genes, but things could get more interesting if we also acknowledge group selection and selections on even higher levels. If nature is viewed as a holistic system, the question of altruism would have to be posed anew. Besides, the fact that genetic, reciprocal and \\"real\\" altruism are balanced in nature, is a positive discovery, not something to deny, frown upon or commit intellectual suicide over. Had I been religious, I would have dubbed it Providence!Unfortunately, all too many Neo-Darwinists have taken a somewhat different tack on the matter. Often, they deny that individual acts of \\"pure\\" altruism can exist at all, even among humans. They paint genetic or reciprocal altruism in a bad light (since when is reciprocity bad?) and contrast it to the pristinely pure Sermon on the Mount. Since natural selection doesn't favour the latter, we supposedly live in a dark, Hobbesian world without end. Am I the only one who detects a certain perverse glee in the writings of such people?I don't believe Richard Dawkins belongs to that crowd. However, his private philosophy doesn't square very well with his scientific convictions. And as long as they don't, I'm afraid Dawkins will continue making up self-contradictory metaphors..."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I'm an avid math/science pleasure reader, so I picked this book up one day when I was at my local bookstore. I'm glad I did.Dawkins' main thesis here is that the gene is the fundamental unit of biological reproduction and that all biological phenomenon can be better understood if we look at what benefits genes as opposed to individuals. While arguing his thesis, Dawkins discusses biological relatedness and how it ultimately guides the behavior of individuals; why 'kin altruism' is so prevalent, for example. He also discusses the conflict of interest between certain genes and how that dynamic ultimately plays out from an evolutionary standpoint. He also introduces the concept of 'memes', which is interesting, if largely speculative.The writing style is also pretty good and usually interesting, though it lags occasionally.This is a good Dawkins book and certainly recommended to anyone who has an interest in biology/evolution. While I won't say this is the absolute best book I've ever read, it's probably one that I'll end up re-reading at some point.4.5/5"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Almost anyone is impressed by life's immense variety. Back in the 19th century only a few educated people ventured how this diverseness came about. It was not even deemed necessary. Life had probably been the same at least after the Great Flood. God had mysterious reasons for designing the world as it was. Amateur naturalist and keen observer Charles Darwin was to offer an alternative explanation. His ideas overturned all views about the subject, but evidence to support them was scanty.Mendel's studies on heredity, the discovery of molecular genetics, and a constantly growing body of paleontological findings have nurtured neo-Darwinian school of thought: life's diversity in Earth is the result of billions of years of hereditary evolution through natural selection.Thirty years after its first edition, The Selfish Gene, by Richard Dawkins is still exciting and inspiring reading. It raises an intriguing question: what does natural selection pick out? And it gives a riveting answer: natural selection chooses those genes that outdo their pairs (alleles) regarding longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity, to achieve this, genes collaborate with other genes in making and sustaining vehicles likely to survive and reproduce, thus passing copies of the gene to their progeny. Genes are different from vehicles in that they are able to make exact copies of themselves. Diversity among analogous genes (portions of DNA big enough to have a definite genetic function but small enough to avoid splitting and recombination), and the resulting diverseness in their phenotypic effect is a precondition for natural selection to promote evolution.The catch phrase selfish gene, underlines the fact that if one takes the gene's point of view nothing really matters that does not maximize the number of faithful copies of each particular gene that are produced and passed to the vehicle's offspring.The book is an all-times classic, still totally up-to-date. It is in no need of any restorative work whatsoever. The 30th anniversary edition adds no new material to the 1989 second edition, apart from a new introduction by the author. Chapters 12 and 13 and end notes where an opportune addition to the first edition after a 12-year exposure to praise and criticism and Dawkins' 1982 book The Extended Phenotype. If you have not read The Selfish Gene you will surely find it instructive and pleasing; if you already did, it will be thought-provoking to do it again. The anniversary edition is in any case a good add-on to your library."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Hacia el Buda desde el occidente: Sus Ensenanzas sin mitos ni misteriosI read this book for the first time in the 80's and found it excellent; it is quite well placed in number nine of the Discover Magazine 2006 list of Greatest Science Books of All Time. When Dawkins first published his book back in 1976, he wrote that, though the theory of evolution was generally recognized and barely doubted then, \\"the full implications of Darwin's revolution had yet to be realized.\\" I feel positively that those implications are now absolutely realized and only religious fanatics dare to question natural selection. This quantum leap in universal understanding is due in a large proportion to The Selfish Gene. Dawkins not only explained Darwin's selection but also expanded it backward in time with sound clarifications to the emergence of the first self-replicable molecule and forward to the recent time through imaginative elucidations about the replication of cultural characteristics through what he calls \\"memes.\\" Memes, the social equivalences of biological genes, is a word the author created and is nowadays of common use in social sciences.When I became seriously interested in the Teaching of Siddhattha Gotama, the Buddha, there were a few notions in common between the Teachings of the ancient sage and the assertions of the modern biologist--the inexistence of metaphysical essences in living beings, the purposelessness of life as a phenomenon, the \\"undivine\\" nature of morality--that I decided to read once more The Selfish Gene. In a material universe, how or where does Buddhist reincarnation fit with Dawkins's biology? Here I have my own interpretation (which the bright English scientist most probably does not share). Each gen or, better said, the design in it coded, is eternal. Says Dawkins: \\"Each gen leaps from body to body in its own way and for its own ends, abandoning a succession of mortal bodies before they sink in senility and death. The genes are the immortals, or rather, they are defined as genetic entities that come close to deserving the title\\". So, the much talked reincarnation or rebirth of some Eastern religions could be well assimilated to body-to-body transmission of genetic information, instead of some kind of mysterious energy or metaphysical essence. Enough of that! My biological interpretation of Buddhist reincarnation does not add a bit to the wonder of this book. The Selfish Gene is just superb."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Given the sloppy research and broad proclamations in Dawkins' more recent books (a tendency I'm tempted to attribute to arrogance, for a variety of reasons I shall not get into here), it is something of a shock to go back and read his older work, which, despite being a work of 'popular science,' is rigorous in its logic and actually contributed a great deal to changing the modern understanding of how evolution works in the long haul. People could debate all day about which of his books are the 'best,' but certainly nothing more provocative and influential has issued forth from his pen than his first work, The Selfish Gene. Even a cursory glance through the negative reviews here will serve as a testament to the power of its ideas: this book forces us to rethink so many of our fundamental assumptions about life, the universe, and everything (rest in peace, Douglas Adams!). Many people on here find the implications of the ideas on display here frightening, and perhaps even dangerous. This is to be expected: it provoked much wonderment and thought in me, a staunch atheist. I can't imagine how alien the world of the selfish gene must seem to the religious temperament. But I digress. Many of the positive reviews are VERY positive, and this is a cherished book for many people. My point here is, first, that the ideas introduced here are important, and, second, they're introduced very well.It would be impossible for me to do justice to the ideas contained in this book, and so I won't even bother. But the fundamental argument and worldview of this book is worth discussing briefly, if superficially. When this book was published in the late seventies, naive ideas about evolution, such as group selection theory, were wide-spread, and so a distorted image of what Darwinism really amounted to was continually encountered. Enter Richard Dawkins, who argued that our conventional understanding of life was upside-down: rather than thinking of evolution as groups of organisms or even individual organisms using genes to replicate themselves, perhaps genes were using individual organisms to replicate themselves. That is, Dawkins argued that the primary unit of selection was not the group, or even the individual, but the gene itself, in the long run. Genes are not the tools organisms use to make copies of themselves; rather, replicating molecules build increasingly efficient vehicles for delivering themselves through the generations in any given environment, and this process of increasing efficiency is called evolution. This ultimately reduces organisms from the main actors in the play of life to mere \\"survival machines\\" (Dawkins' term) being indirectly manipulated by their genes.It is obvious that this stabs at the core of the uneasiness and fright some people feel when they are engaging this work: according to Dawkins, we are robots, or puppets. Dawkins uses both metaphors in this work to describe organisms, but the one he really runs with is the metaphor of organisms as robots. Needless to say, people don't like being classified as \\"gigantic lumbering robots.\\" For the religious, the objection is obvious: they believe humans to be animals with souls. But even many secularists have raised their eyebrows as the oft-quoted passages comparing organisms to robots. But, as Dawkins notes, robots are not necessarily the clumsy, mindless clods of old science-fiction shows, and if we are puppets, he says, we can at least understand our strings. Needless to say he goes out of his way to disassociate himself from genetic determinism or the establishing of any kind of morality: Dawkins is not here to preach, but to present a conceptual framework for understanding the mysteries of evolution.The central metaphor of the book, however, is that of the eponymous selfish gene. Of course, genes are microscopic molecules and thus can't be consciously selfish, but they act AS IF they were. So anthropomorphic language runs throughout the work. While Dawkins often introduces extended metaphors, he never lets them run wild and take over the work. In the case of the selfish gene, selfishness is defined in a purely behavioral manner, so there are no real problems introduced by this. The selfish gene exploits every available opportunity to replicate more efficiently and spread throughout the local gene pool.As said before, I'm not going to relay the various arguments in this book, but I do want to give potential readers a basic outline of this book, so that they understand that scope of the material discussed here:Chapters 1 - 3 discuss basic stuff in biology, from a certain theory about the origin of life (he intentionally uses different origin theories in each of his books, due to our lack of knowledge in that area) to basic discussions on cell biology and the function of DNA. Chapter 4 sets up selfish gene theory through a basic discussion of what 'behavior' is. Chapter 5 discusses animal aggression and its relationship to such concepts as dominance hierarchies and ESSs (Evolutionarily Stable Strategies, an application of game theory expanded upon in a later chapter). Chapter 6 explores how individual altruism (a strange observation in the cut-throat world of Darwinian ruthlessness) can be explained through gene selfishness. Chapters 7 and 8 discuss kin selection, with 8 focusing squarely on parent-offspring relations. Chapter 9 talks about sexual selection and exploitation. Chapter 10 focuses on reciprocal altruism. Chapter 11, the final chapter in the original edition, introduces the now famous ideas of cultural replicators, or memes. In the book's second edition in 1989 Dawkins tacked on two chapters to the end, which, I think, are also two of the best. Chapter 12 takes a closer look at game theory and how it relates to our understanding of evolution. And chapter 13 reproduces in abbreviated form the central argument of his second work, The Extended Phenotype, which argues that the effects of genes can ultimately be described as influencing things outside of the individual organism as well, if very indirectly (of course, as Dawkins points out, the genetic influence on the organism is itself indirect, if to a much lesser extent).I hope that this review might serve its purpose of giving undecided customers some hint as to the richness and breadth of scope in this work. I hope everyone reads this book. Now, it isn't perfect: Dawkins has edited almost nothing from this work, leaving it virtually untouched, so that what you read in the first eleven chapters in 2010 was all there in 1976 as well. What this inevitably means is that some of Dawkins' speculations have been shown to be false over time. Most of these errors were pointed out in the voluminous end-notes added in the second addition of the work (Dawkins never failed to point it out when he is wrong about something, which is something I can really respect-- here is a thinker with integrity), although some, such as the correct function of surplus DNA, were only discovered recently, so that they escaped mention in this book. It is fairly easy to get up-to-date on all this, and there are no shortage of people who love to point out where exactly Dawkins is wrong on something. So be sure to supplement this book with some minor research if you care about keeping your understanding current. Also, the chapter on memes is admittedly sketchy (although many see more value in the idea than I do), and some sections of this work, especially when he is discussion the origins of life, are contentious. Keep this in mind. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a more important and readable introduction to both Darwinism and selfish gene theory than this.This third edition of the work, released in 2006, doesn't really add anything to the central text, like the huge overhaul of the second edition, but it restores all previous introductions, forewords, and prefaces, and adds a new one for this 30th anniversary edition. Also included are extracts from reviews of the work. This is really like an Ultimate Edition of The Selfish Gene, and if you've never read before, I advise you to read it now. At worst, it'll give you some interesting ideas to chew on. At best, it'll give you a whole new perspective on life. Read it."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The first thing I will say about The Selfish Gene (TSG) is that it is not the first book on evolution you should read although as a Dawkins book it is not a bad choice but for those unfamiliar with both, then I would suggest Climbing Mount Improbable or The Blind Watchmaker first. Both of those books by Dawkins have a much broader, more generalized, look at natural selection and evolution.TSG is an entirely different type of book because it is particularly academic and a very complex read on specific lines of reasoning that are even aimed at correcting the misconceptions of big name professional biologists. It assumes that the reader will be somewhat acquainted with Darwinism and evolution. If you are not then I would strongly urge that you pass on TSG until you do. In fact, you will bring much more to TSG and get much more out of it if you spend time on his above mentioned works first. I would also suggest Darwin's own \\"The Origin of Species\\" if you can.The reason for doing this is that during the 1970s TSG entered midway into a battle within evolutionary theory to settle some disputes and to make this version of Darwinism accessible to the general reader. If you don't know much about why TSG was needed in the first place then I don't think it will make that much sense to read it now. If, however, you understand what is going on previous to it and how it is presently used, then TSG becomes mandatory reading but it is not like Dawkins other works except for maybe the sequel to TSG, The Extended Phenotype, that should be treated the same way as TSG and certainly not read before this very progressive book on evolution.The Selfish Gene is a massive assault on evolutionary biologists who explained behaviour by using phrases like \\"for the good of the species\\". Dawkins and most of his English contemporaries from the time of R.A Fisher's \\"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\\" (1930) and the modern synthesis had difficulties in trying to explain altruism in terms of Darwinism, like why some organisms in the struggle for survival appear not to struggle for themselves but for other organisms. Many biologists aligned with the work of V. C. Wynne-Edwards on a mathematical model for group selection to explain this problem. This was a bold step away from Darwin's view, and the established scientific evolution model of the individual as the unit of selection, not the group. Darwin had speculated on group selection very briefly in The Descent of Man but to actually incorporate it into Darwinian evolution almost seemed contrary to natural selection. Yet the Wynne-Edwards math that groups could be selected was good on paper and so many believed that altruism could be solved this way.What they didn't know was that an alternative explanation for altruism was emerging around the same time as the Wynne-Edwards model. This alternative explanation for altruism did not require group selection. This alternative was called Kin Selection and was developed by W.D Hamilton in a paper called The genetical evolution of social behaviour (1964). TSG can be best described as a book popularizing an explanation of Hamilton's discoveries. While Hamilton had found a very elegant solution to altruism it came with a price that Dawkins and many of his colleagues are asking us to take and in a way it's not entirely different from the leap that Wynne-Edwards wanted but this jump in evolutionary thought is certainly nowhere near as startling as group selection. The jump is this. We need to develop the concept of the individual as the unit of selection to include the gene.There is much to favour the view that we should take a gene-centred view of evolution but Dawkins stresses that we are not really moving from the individual as the unit of selection at all, just seeing it in a new way. G. C. Williams in Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966) had already challenged group selection. So had the very influential Maynard Smith who was developing the ESS (evolutionary stable strategy) through game theory and applying it to evolution. E. O Wilson had just finished writing \\"Sociobiology\\" and was battling fellow scientists in his own university over whether we should really be subjecting human social behavior to the science of evolution. Dawkins TSG thus emerges in the middle of this poignant moment as a vehicle to see the matter of Hamilton's work firmly through to finish. For anyone interested in evolution, it is not only worth every bit of the effort, but mandatory reading.It makes it all the more interesting that for such an important read there is very little Dawkins in TSG at all. In fact Dawkins writes significantly about everyone else in evolutionary thought except himself. He is like the Francis Bacon of the 20th century, extolling on so much and unselfishly on the work of others that he has little time to say much about his own thoughts on evolution except for the shortest chapter on the concept of the meme as a cultural example of natural selection at work outside of the gene.There are two editions of TSG and the 30th anniversary edition with a new forward. It is important to at least get the second edition as there are two fresh new chapters spanning some extra 60 pages plus a fist of new notations at the back to explain his position more clearly, update us on current findings, correct some errors and validates some hypothesis as now theories. It is actually probably due another update. The first edition doesn't have this and the meme chapter was the chapter that closed the first edition of this book. Anyhow the 30th anniversary edition does it all.Chapter 1 - Why are people?Dawkins brings up morality in relation to Darwinism and defines altruism along with explaining the Darwinian version of behaviour. There is some basic outlines of natural selection and this books sets up the question of why altruism? Wynne-Edwards/Robert Ardrey/ Konrad Lorenz (although Lorenz gets lots of better press for other discoveries later in TSG) group selection is introduced as the alternative to individual selection (albeit wrongly as Dawkins notes). G. C. Williams's work is used to start countering group selection.Chapter 2 - The ReplicatorsDawkins describes how molecules build up in evolution, DNA replication and ideas of competition between replicators.Chapter 3 - Immortal CoilsDawkins looks at the origins of replication, A. G. Cairns-Smith's crystal hypothesis are given as possible candidates, DNA sequences in terms of genes are explained by analogy of books and pages, mutations are brought into the scene along with the unit of selection and the evolution of biological complexity. Peter Medawar's views on gene selection, death and cancer are intriguing.Chapter 4 - The Gene MachineSurvival, multicellular life, genes and behaviour, communication between genes and behaviour, the emergence of consciousness, the brain as a supercomputer, evolving strategies launches TSG into the heart of its subject matter. Here Dawkins as ethologist gives specific examples of these in action. Insects and colonies are his speciality. Mimicry as a strategy is explained along with predator prey interactions.Chapter 5: Aggression: Stability and the Selfish MachineDeveloping more on predator prey interactions the terminology of \`cost-benefit' brings us to Maynard Smith and his Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) that governs behaviour. The ESS is a mind blowing package of evolutionary development that expands the field considerably. Organisms are pre-programmed biological units that are also pre-programmed to behave and respond to situations. This is all about the chance of pay-offs against losses. Various strategies are explained and given examples in nature. Applied game theory transforms Darwinism into a whole new dynamic. Dawkins talks about his mentor ethologist Niko Tinbergen.Chapter 6: GenesmanshipDawkins now moves onto Kin selection. At this stage in the book the reader will have to have their thinking cap on to follow through the strategies that become somewhat mathematical. It also looks at how genes compete or cooperate among themselves. The coefficient of relatedness is explained.Chapter 7: Family PlanningThis is about the evolution of parental care, population sizes, birth-rates and the ecology of David Lack. This is also aimed at dispensing with group selection.Chapter 8: Battle of the GenerationsDawkins expands on parental care and stratagems related to it. R. L. Trivers gene concepts are brought into the picture and parental investment (P.I) is discussed along with parent-offspring conflicts. Zahavi is made known but plays a more important role later. Deception and deceptive traits are brought up so we can see the evolution of cheating.Chapter 9: Battle of the SexesNow it is time for the evolution of sex and how to define sex, most it based on R.A Fisher's work. The role of the sexes becomes evident in that battle. Trivers is used to enlarge on it and again the gene plays a central role in understanding it. Zahavi's handicap principle will stimulate thoughts on sexual selection.Chapter 10: You Scratch My Back I'll Ride On YoursHamilton's work is able to produce geometries that look like group selection based on selfish gene principles. Altruistic signals may even be selfish without invoking kin selection such as in cave theory and \`never break rank'. Next comes what is maybe the hardest part of the book, the evolution of slave-making species with respect to sex ratios. Heads will be left spinning and even Dawkins says his is. The evolution of symbiosis is developed upon this and then the classic puzzle of the Prisoner's Dilemma is played out.Chapter 11: Memes: The New ReplicatorsThis is about the possibility that natural selection is not just limited to the gene and suggests that culture goes through a very similar selection process that becomes embedded in people's minds and is transmitted from brain to brain. These cultural memes can serve their own purpose and may not be to our benefit. Dawkins looks at religion and invokes memes as a possible explanation. The author is clear though that this is a hypothesis and is using it mostly to show how natural selection is not just limited to the gene. Effectively this chapter ended the first edition and Dawkins maintains that humans can fight against any selfish problems that we have to live a better life.Chapter 12: Nice Guys Finish FirstThis is an addition and is part of the second edition. This is mostly about Robert Axelrod's experiments with the Prisoner's Dilemma and how it applies to biology and focuses on the tit-for-tat strategy and how it competes with others. Do you cooperate or do you defect? Great game theory.Chapter 13: The Long Reach of the GeneThis is a synopsis of his second book The Extended Phenotype (EP). You could really drop this chapter and just pick up EP except that he does recap TSG for the last few pages so at least try to read that if you can. It will also give you a taste of. In a way this is not saying anything scientifically new about what phenotypes are and do except to add how the selfish gene extends outwards to interact with the environment and other organisms. Dawkins might be offering an innovative approach to dealing with biological evolution.So, to sum it up, group selection is declared dead, Darwin's principles are still alive, the gene is perfectly compatible with evolution and this view brings much more.TSG is a radically sweeping revolutionary evolutionary thought to see the gene as the unit of selection. Whatever you might think of this, one thing is for certain, the group selectionists didn't see the group rejectionists coming with TSG and even 30 years later haven't manage to displace the selfish gene view. What arguments they have had are as weak as the group selectionist model that they depended on. TSG makes a solid case that the alternative view from the gene strongly infers answers to altruism and may quicken the pursuit for the origins of evolution itself from the view of chemical replicators. For those who can accept it, this is probably the new face of evolution.At the same time we should mention weaknesses as the argument does challenge the traditional concept of the unit of selection as the individual because in some cases the genes need not be in the individual. Apparently duplicate genes in another individual qualify and the concept even goes further to say genes helping other genes symbiotically as per EP are to be considered as part of individual. That's a very big thing to say. Yet Darwin didn't get the concept of genes when he described natural selection. Any scientist who takes the selfish gene very carefully by conserving the unit of selection as the individual would, quite frankly, be on the right side of Darwinian evolution and even the Neo-Darwinian movement of the modern synthesis... but is probably missing out on much. If someone says that the unit of selection is the individual, you cannot say they are wide of the mark, but it looks like they have to turn to the gene to explain certain instances of altruism. In TSG Dawkins is trying to say that they are the same thing However in his next book, EP, Dawkins clearly works to overthrow overemphasising the unit of selection as the individual. He even goes as far to say that it is wrong and gives reasons (such as meioses). The only true unit of selection is the replicator and in Dawkins view that can only mean the gene. What we really need to ask for now though is what is the evidence for the selfish gene?In reality the evidence for models outside of the individual as the unit of selection are quite scant, but the gene as unit of selection does have direct evidence to support it. The evidence for group selection is controversial and after 30 years they haven't made much ground. Simply put, there doesn't appear to be much of a debate anymore even if some group selectionists make some noise (it looks like they just don't understand the concept of kin selection). There is evidence for the selfish gene but does this mean we should accept the revaluation of the unit of selection to include the gene? It appears we should. As a note, group selectionists need to do a lot better to try and match this kind of quality science and do not do themselves one bit of justice by trying to discredit it with scare-tactics and ambiguity. Saying things like every other possible unit of selection except for the gene can be the unit of selection doesn't help anything.We have one other question to ask. Does the selfish gene model include all genetic information and does all behaviour need to invoke the selfish gene? I can't help but remember that even Dawkins shows how Hamilton didn't have to invoke gene selection to explain altruism in terms of the individual as the unit selection. Imagine if all altruism was explained this way. The selfish gene might be relegated to a very small minor role in evolution. You are best to reserve judgement on how far reaching the selfish gene model actually is until you look more at EP. EP really is where the argument is at, but TSG helps set up the basic premise that the gene view of evolution is the answer to many outstanding questions in evolution.Another thing to note is that creationists have never been able to produce an alternative science to this model. No matter how they may critic it, complain wrongly that it is genetic determinism or dislike his use of metaphors, they cannot refute the math in his cited peer-review nor can they offer a substitute science.Not to end with a critic I would like to add that TSG is quite possibly the most important book on evolution next to Fisher's \\"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\\" which is only trumped by Darwin's publications. I don't think I am wrong with that praise."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins uses a very interesting strategy that I've not seen before in trimming down a book that could be a little too long: Putting a lot of statements that would have worked just fine as endnotes as endnotes. This has cut a lot of fat out of the book and made a very dense topic a lot more approachable.In trying to make the text approachable, he has also not used a single equation in the whole text-- even though he could have saved a lot of space by simply taking the route of using an equation. There would not have been much diminshment.Lastly, he gives a balanced presentation by including the contrary arguments of some researchers in the field and by rebutting/ addressing those points (rather just neglecting to mention them). This is done in such a way that it is neither too abstruse nor a dismissal out of hand.Making a 250 plus page text on the whether natural selection takes place at the genotypic level or the phenotypic level is a Herculean (and laudable) task in and of itself.

If you are new to this feeling of realizing the world around you. The book basically examines the dilemma between you and others. In other words how to give others and if it is feasible or not. The book is entitled as the bible for neo Darwinian thought, yet it seems to me how much it adds to the Darwinian source of thought is highly exegerated. As for all the books I have read on the psyche of man, the deep analysis for the human intelligence is lacking. The book also has an ethocentricism, prasing the scientific approach too much.And it also favours the individualism of the 20th century, which is the source of all the evils of our daily life. It gives away fragments of justification for the over powered self of the capitalist mode of production.We are not all survival machines only and we will not make sacrifices just for to pass our genes to future decades.This book heavily focuses on the materialist approach of living a life. But it will not explain all aspects of human beings. It can not explain literature, poetry or art or other manly feelings. And the choice between a materialist approach of life and more feeling full life is still a personal choice. (thanks a millions). Humans are not only calculators. This book however is worth reading. But it will be risky to take this book as a bible or \\"THE BOOK\\" about human psyche. As for the discussion goes, this book will provide you new insights for the daily routine of life.

It is, afterall, his ground breaking work, and it is held in such high praise.I could not put either of the other two Dawkin's books down. This one, though, I could barely pick up. I found the writing style choppy and hard to follow. I found the concepts interesting but jumbled by the writing. Unlike the other works, I found this one unaccessible to the everyday reader.If you want a more straightforward book on evolution, go with the Blind Watchmaker."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins spends a lot of time in his new introduction to this edition trying to persuade us that he is not a crude genetic determinist. He tries to dig himself out of the hole he got himself into when he described us as \\"lumbering robots\\" created by our genes. (Chapter 2.)But in an interview published in \\"New Statesman\\" (26th March 1999), while discussing cloning, Dawkins said: \\"Cloning Saddam Hussein would be horrible. Cloning David Attenborough, or someone we all admire, might be fine.\\"If that isn't crude genetic determinism, then I don't know what is. Does Dawkins really think that the nastiness of the dead dictator and the niceness of the admirable Attenborough are simply the result of their genes, and nothing to do with their upbringing, experiences, social circumstances and life-history?This certainly does not suggest that Dawkins has a grasp of the subtle and complex interaction between our genetic potentiality and the environmental factors which play an enormous part in making us what we are.Nor does Dawkins have a real understanding of religion. He is like the philosophers of the Enlightenment in that he thinks that religious beliefs can be dispelled by directly confronting them with rational, scientific arguments. But any atheist (including myself) will know that religious peoples' ideas are not easily dislodged from their heads by logical arguments. And this is not because they have been infected by \\"memes\\". (Memes are Dawkins' imaginary cultural equivalent of genes - a totally inadequate explanation of how people are socialized into accepting beliefs.)Darwin himself realised the difficulties when he wrote that: \\"...direct arguments against Christianity & theism produce hardly any effect on the public; & freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follow[s] from the advance of science.\\"But to understand why it is difficult to win people away from religious prejudices by direct argument, we need to look at what Darwin's contemporary, Karl Marx, had to say. Marx focussed on the social role of religion. He pointed out that it is used by the powerful to keep the masses under control. (\\"The Divine Right of Kings\\", for example.) But he also pointed out that it can inspire the downtrodden in their rebellions. For example, even we atheists must acknowledge that the Christianity of Martin Luther King was a very different thing from that of George W. Bush.Marx is also known for writing that religion is the \\"opium of the people\\". But the full quotation is: \\"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.\\"In other words, oppressed and alienated people who are prevented from living full lives often turn to religion as a comfort. It fulfills a need for them. It is therefore difficult to win them from their religious views by logical argument.Dawkins does not see that the best way to undermine religion is, as Marx said, to change society in order to remove people's need for religion. In a society without alienation, inequality, and oppression, religion would wither away. (And I don't mean the bureaucratic state capitalist tyranny of the so-called \\"communist\\" states.)To conclude, I have to say that, despite Dawkins' protestations, his opponents within the field of evolutionary biology - Richard Lewontin, Steven Rose, Niles Eldredge and the late Stephen Jay Gould - provide a much fuller account of evolution and of \\"human nature\\".Phil Webster.(England)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene is not a scientific work but an ideological work that precisely embeds capitalist ideology into biology as a new biologism.As science it's nonsense. The implicit teleology in the book (the goal is the replication of the gene, the organism merely the vehicle) would, in terms of the efficiency requirement in natural selection, create a situation where more complex organisms are inherently less efficient at the fundamental goal. So with that teleology there would be no increase in complexity through the natural selection Dawkins is at pains to protect as the driving force of evolution. in Dawkins' biologism, the more complex the organism, the less valuable.This is the same as the capitalist move from use-value to exchange-value as the goal. Rather than the goal being to produce useful products, the beginning of the process is money as capital, which is turned into products only in order to create more exchange-value, more capital. The capitalist fantasy of a \\"frictionless\\" economy, i.e. the creation and sale of products with no cost friction, is mirrored in the idea of a \\"frictionless\\" conversion from exchange-value (genes) to more exchange-value (genes) without the cost of an organism.This embedding of capitalist ideology into biology reduces the value of human beings and other complex organisms to nothing more than an unfortunate cost of exchange, which could ideally be done away with. As a result it also justifies the practical devaluing of human beings in a more fundamental way even than social darwinism. What's the issue with treating human beings as collateral damage in the quest for profit - they're nothing more than a vehicle for self-replicating molecules to achieve their goal of multiplying anyway."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"** THIS IS A VERY LONG REVIEW!***I've watched Richard Dawkins speak several times; at one such event, he was asked: \\"Which came first - the chicken or the egg?\\" and he dodged the issue: \\"The egg - if by that we mean the self replicating mechanism. - the chicken, the body, is the temporary receptacle of the information... that's the essence of modern neo-Darwinism.\\" Presumably, neither came first.It took me years to grasp Dawkins's starting-point. If, like Dawkins, you assume that replication came first, it's natural to adopt a Dawkins-style view. But, speaking as a multi-celled organism, I had assumed more or less unconsciously that proto-life may have come first, into which replication somehow intruded. So far as I can tell, none of this is yet decidable; most evidence must have gone long since, disappearing as food or fertiliser.Anyway ... Dawkins calls it 'neo-Darwinism', because the detail of genes in evolution was unknown to Darwin. (And one might add: Alfred Russel Wallace's priority is unknown to Dawkins).By the 1990s, automatic gene sequencing (based on DNA of course) by machine became easy, with the results all supposedly put online. Dawkins is not a practising scientist in that sense; and the observations of animals - for example, accounts of rather weird parasites and the behaviurs they cause in their victims, are mostly taken from other peoples' patient observations. His professorship was (is?) specifically in promoting public awareness of science, e.g. in 1991/2 Royal Institution lectures, and countless others His manner is very polite. He tends to say the right thing: he even said he was given 'a new respect' for the profession of TV filmmakers, after a 1985 TV programme on evolution.Dawkins lists many general influences, along with individual papers. Niko Tinbergen (1953, 'Social Behaviour in Animals'). W D Hamilton and G C Williams on 'social ethology'. R L Trivers (1970s books on 'reciprocal altruism', 'parental investment', 'parent offspring conflict', 'social insects'). V.C.Wynne-Edwards, e.g. 1962 popularised by Robert Ardrey in The Social Contract of 1970. John Maynard Smith on game theory (simple grids with simple outcomes of actions - which assume there's some common measurement of outcome). Later titles (postdating his first edition) include cultural transmission - as in 'memes'.One has to wonder how much of this is talked up, after the fashion of early popular writers on biology. For example, Dawkins quotes such things as the 'Utter selfishness of the Ik of Uganda', as described by Colin Turnbull, and the gentle altruism of Margaret Mead's Arapesh. He doesn't seem to know about Mead's exposure as a fraud - just one example suggesting he takes sources rather too much at face value.Dawkins writes well, in the sense of describing individual modules of the world; it's pulling things together in an overview that's problematical. I'll try to identify some of these serious problems....[1] MEANINGS OF WORDSAs many people have pointed out, there are problems with meanings. Let's look at 'evolution', 'selfish', 'gene' and 'altruism', and 'meme'.The peculiarity of biological evolution is that its mechanism is built into the organism itself. Organisms are so remote from unliving matter, that they only exist because of ancestors - they don't spontaneously generate. 'Evolution' is the change in the totality of life forms from one time period to the next. But this is NOT the same as the 'evolution of ideas' or 'evolution of language' or 'social evolution'. Of course the verbal issue has been with us since at least the 19th century.Assuming that genes generally operate at a low level - as surely most or all they have to, in order to code the fantastic complications of living things - most of the influences listed by Dawkins aren't anything do do with evolution or genes: he, or at least the reader, can hardly help confusing 'evolution' with things like 'social evolution', meaning change which in some way depends on what happened before. I don't think the issue is ever made clear.Dawkins points out many times that 'selfish gene' - 'thinking of the individual [gene] as though it had a conscious purpose .. is just a figure of speech. A body is really a machine blindly programmed by its selfish genes.' There can't be many authors who admit their book's title is misleading!Dawkins is careful to define a 'gene' 'as a unit of convenience, a length of chromosome with just sufficient copying-fidelity to serve as a viable unit of natural selection. This allows for whole chunks of chromosomes to be selected, which allows the meaning of 'gene' to be stretched out.Another issue is long-term changes in genes; since new alleles can form e.g. by mutation, it seems possible many genes are unstable in the long term. In fact, no genes from the origin of life can have persisted to the present day. This suggests genes may not be as permanent as Dawkins implies.On 'altruism' - here's a typical passage: 'Recently there has been a reaction against racialism and patriotism, and a tendency to substitute the whole human species..' and 'The muddle in human ethics over the level at which altruism is desirable - family, nation, race, species, or all living things..' Dawkins never makes it clear what 'altruism' is. Just a set of well-meaning phrases? Propaganda? The suggestion people should be nice to each other? Genuine action of some sort? The word is often used in a sense which is entirely hypocritical - trying to persuade people to have costs offloaded onto them, as in pop-star fronted begging. It is significant that Dawkins, following others, considers 'altruism', 'lies' and 'deceit' in various forms at a simple level, such as nesting birds, but not hypocrisy and lies at the serious, global, political level; this of course is part of the unmentionable material of 'correctness' which allows politicians and others to bemoan mass starvation etc without foind anything about it.Near the end of 'The Selfish Gene' is an elaborate account of 'memes', and this makes sense as a logical progression, since these having nothing physically to do with genes at all. I saw Susan Blackmore speak on memes, and was struck by her trivial examples - a bit of Beethoven's Fifth, a pop song, an ad jingle, a baseball cap worn backwards. In short, a 'meme' is usually something remembered, but not important enough to be worth considering as an 'idea'. The entire process of learning a 'meme' and interpreting it, relying on a lifetime's memory of language to internalise it, is complicated; it only seems simple because we're used to it. Dawkins's more complex examples of e.g. faith, fear of hell fire, and also injunction to never ask for evidence, may have 'deep psychological impact', but rely on lots of repetition at school or whatever. There's some suggestive matter on 'memes' jostling for survival, but that's it.[2] GENES WITH MAGICAL POWERSMuch of this book assumes there's a gene 'for' something - penis length is one example. I don't think Dawkins ever considers what limits can be expected from genes. There must for example be some sort of determinant of skeleton size and shape; but does every part of it have to be defined in detail? Would each finger and toenail need to be specified? Every blood cell? Surely not. His penis example sounds like a bit of sex put in to excite the punters.A good example is a supposed gene to spread 'altruism'. Altruism in any of the normal senses means assessing some situation, and weighing up all the likely consequences of an action on more than one person (or other life form). This is an elaborate intellectual exercise involving the entire perceptual and memory system; how can there possibly be a gene for it?Another example is survival. No organism in the world is descended from an ancestor that sampled death to see what it was like. How can fear of death be genetically determined? Such 'fear' certainly must exist - the human verbalised form isn't necessary - no doubt through avoidance of discomfort and so on; but at some point there must be some perception that something unpleasant to the organism may happen. How can there be a gene for that?Dawkins gets around this: 'it can be perfectly proper to speak of a 'gene forbehaviour so-and-so' even if we haven't the faintest idea of the ... causes leading from gene to behaviour.' But this is in a discussion on certain bees cleaning up larval cells in their hives, obviosuly a very stereotyped behaviour, nothing like something as abstarct as 'altruism'.[3] DETERMINISM AND INTELLIGENCE'A body is really a machine blindly programmed by its selfish genes' illustrates Dawkins in behaviouristic mode. It's true that animals (like children) are highly egocentric and don't think much about the past, the future, or the universe. But it seems perfectly possible that animal brains are a lot better than Dawkins thinks when he brushes e.g. dog behaviour which he thinks only mimics purposive activity, such as looking for food. Animals are handicapped in the sense of lacking efficient mouth/tongue/ear elaborations. But I'd guess even though mute, animal brains are efficient and active. Since nobody knows what the brain does, apart from clearly being at the centre of nerves and senses, the point is difficult to to argue. It seems realistic to argue that genes define a body's plan and send out in the world to do its best. I'm not sure animals such as dogs are as brainless as Dawkins assumes.[Even tiny animals - flies, spiders - sense danger and run away. How come? Do they think - I see a creature and know that if it contacts me with a large object I may be crushed and die; however by increasing the distance between us, the probability is reduced so I'm more likely to be safe? Can there be a gene which caters for all such situations?][4] SEXUAL REPRODUCTIONThroughout this book, Dawkins assumes organisms want to pass on as many genes as possible. And they should (e.g.) be indifferent between all their offspring. (It seems to follow that incest ought to be common). However all this seems based on a mistake.Why have sexual reproduction? One of its strong points, paradoxically, is precisely that half the genes of each parent are not used. Assume (this is all simplified) the probability of a gene mistake is say .00001. Then the probability of correct copying is .99999. An organism with 100 genes has probability .99999^100 of transcribing correctly. Fairly simple algebra indicates that longer genomes will show errors roughly in proportion to the number of genes. The must come a point where females only will have a significant probability of passing on defective genomes, not reproducing properly. There simple life forms (aphids? worms? bacteria?) where breeding rates are so fast and easy that dead-end lines don't matter. But if women in an asexual world duplicated themselves wrongly, mistakes would build up to the point where costs of defective children would be too great.If half the genes are thrown away, the result is something like regression to the mean. Parents with large numbers of genetic problems will cause many spontaneous abortions. It's also true that indusputably superior specimens will have little chance of having indisputably superior offspring. Sex supplies stability - essential for complex organisms - there's a sort of stabilising mediocrity. A descendant of (say) William the Conqueror may have none of his genes. This stabilising idea, where a small proportion of embryos are rejected as a quality control mechanism, is omitted by Dawkins. He claims parents should be indifferent between all offspring, even with lethal deformaties which parents presumably would wish to not reappear.There's some interesting material on why e.g. eggs should become 'large' and sperms small. And why there should be 50:50 males and females, attributed to R A Fisher - who however relied on the fact that modern creatures have 50:50 sperms from which it seems to follow. Does this prove there couldn't be a different arrangement?[5] GLORIFICATION OF EVOLUTIONThere are (at least) seven types of writers on biology. The rather dim Fred Hoyle types, who seem unable to understand that vast ranges of time and space are usually needed for evolution. (I recall someone telling me: \\"I don't see cats turning into dogs\\"). And the Fabre type, emphasising repetitious stupidity (e.g. caterpillars that follow a leader - around the rim of a plant pot - for days). And the types (e.g. Bergson, G B Shaw) who have a rather fantastic attitude to evolution, expecting incredible new things to 'emerge'. There are also those who emphasise the incredible wastefulness of the evolutionary process: evolution compared with building houses by trial and error of techniques, leaving the world littered with the remains of innumerable incomplete houses. And the D'Arcy Thompson types ('On Growth and Form') who, as with J B S Haldane, consider lengths, areas, volumes, air pressure, surface tension and so on as influences on organisms. And the encyclopaedist types - H G Wells's 'Outline of Life' was brilliant - Faust mythically sold his soul for reference volumes of this sort.Dawkins is influenced by all these types, but leans towards marvelling over the diversity of life, and the process of Darwinism, in my view unrealistically. He praises the 'miserly economy' and 'maximal efficiency' of 'survival machines'. A counter-view is that evolution is insanely wasteful, a series of bodges which just about work, but with numerous weak points.- We saw this in the chapter on aggression. Even thougha 'conspiracy of doves' would be better for \\u000eevery single individual&Auml;\\u000e&Auml; than theevolutionarily stable strategy, natural selection is bound to favour the ESS.[6] GENES WORKING TOGETHERDawkins's oarsman example seems very weak. He talks of a typical university boat. But suppose there were 10o,000 rowers - given colossal numbers of genes, replacing one by a better one surely can be expected to make almost no difference. I'd have thought somehting like a factory or city would be a better exmaple, but with almost no job replacement - if one of the workers did the wrong thing, the whole affair could crash.[7] COMPUTER ANALOGIESDawkins loves or loved his Mac (and incidentally believes viruses are simple to write, certainly a mistake). He seems to think the brain is similar to a computer generated display: 'The evolution of the capacity to simulate seems to have culminated in subjective consciousness. Why this should have happened is, to me, the most profound mystery facing modern biology. .. Perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself.'This seems to be a mistake of the same type as in 1930s drawings of the brain showing vision as something projected on a screen. And/or an overestimate of the ease by which the brain is fooled. Surely, in practice, optical illusions are quite rare and need careful design to work. Dawkins hasn't heard the idea that belief in ghosts fell as electric lighting rose.[8] DISAPPOINTING OMISSIONSGiven an atmosphere of perhaps methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, with ammonia in the sea, and lightning, it's been known since the 1920s that a 'soup' could form - a dilute sea of organic molecules - carbon in almost unique in forming chains of almost any length. Dawkins puts emphasis on amino-acids and proteins, but metal ions, possibly dissolved from minerals by weak nitric/hydrochloric acid, and sulphate ions could be there too. If replicating chemcials appeared, the question is how the hell there could be some coded way for 'instructions' for life to develop from that. One might specualte that a molecule could attract a tiny shell or coating or arrangement of auquatic ions or other molecules, and maybe grow by absorption, and split at some point, carrying primitive instructions to repeat the process. I was disappointed that there's nothing on such possibilities, or indeed certainties.Dawkins says little on the evolution of insects: at first sight, eggs -> caterpillars -> pupae -> flying insects seems impossible to square with evolution; perhaps more difficult than the eye. There must have been intermediate stages, such as pupae able to move (as in dragonflies), and some predecessor stage to eggs. It's easy to see the advantage of the process - an early stage of eating low-value food, followed by a winged phase of looking about to deposit eggs. But it's less easy to see how it could have taken place. Just as with the chicken and egg.Another thing I missed was discussion on the very long term (though the 'ESS' = evolutionary stable strategy' incorporates this). Many books with a biological tinge have scenarios such as: one person having more children than another, and feeling they've won an evolutionary battle. Or people with lots of children, supported by social services, described as 'fit'. Or mass murders of specific types (for example, of intellectuals in the USSR) don't have any effects. It's easy to miss the extreme long-term consequences, especially of course with human beings, who tinker with the world more than any other species.----------------------Dawkins' 'Selfish Gene' without doubt tapped into some need for understanding of the world. But I don't think, in cool retrospect, its influence was very positive. Many Amazon reviews show people interpreting it as sociobiological praise for selfishness, or as showing that ethical beliefs are meaningless, or worrying over determinism. I remember a woman in a radio programme saying \\"some men aren't interested in a loving relationship, because they want an heir; I read about it in a book by Richard Dawkins\\". Maybe they misunderstood it, of course, but the misunderstanding is only possible because the messages are muddled.The book doesn't help much, even with topics which are explicitly discussed, such as 'fast women' and 'philanderers'. The undiscussed problems include killing, or getting killed, under military command; why people dying on the streets don't just desperately grab at money to survive; overpopulation problems; genetic defects. Nor are political group issues discussed much - tribal and other groups working in secret, propaganda and its meme effects, competitin over resources. The book does have the vitally important underpinning of evolution. But the detail of the book is questionable. Three stars?"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The thirtieth anniversary celebrations of Dawkins' best seller reminded me of my disappointed response to its original publication. I was then assembling a reading list for an ethology-oriented course on human nature in a liberal arts faculty. Konrad Lorenz' On Aggression was my over-view book of choice, but I was on the lookout for alternatives. Ed Wilson's Sociobiology had appeared the year previous, but it was unsuited to my course objectives. Then came the Selfish Gene, whose author I knew to be trained in ethology. Might the book thread a path through the bio-behavioral complexity of human behavior? Within minutes of opening it, I realized that far from serving my purpose, the book was a Great Simplifier peddling the worst stereotypes that my social science colleagues entertained about the bio-behavioral initiative. Some particulars. *Attitude. Good teaching requires that students be met where they are and led to the methods and substance to be studied. But here students encounter a gigantic misanthropic insult: they are \`lumbering' robotic slaves to their genes. It gets worse because genes obey the law of \`universal ruthless selfishness' so that \`altruism must be bad and selfishness good'. Oh dear! Haven't we heard this before? Yes, it's the gospel of nineteenth century Let-Them-Perish sociology, which mutated into this century's Compel-Them-to-Perish violence. This is the attitude of aggressive dogma hostile to critical thought. An ethologist should recognize this to be the posture of indoctrination, not of inquiry. *The author's bullying facilitates his substitution of potent symbolic language for fundamental principles of the life sciences. Thus, he confers on genes the status of \`replicators' that build the \`vehicles' (\`organisms', as biologists call them) that make up the web of life. This is at odds with what every biology text says. Organic \`replicators' are CELLS, not genes. The cell division that replicates a new organism (for sexually reproducing species) is MEIOSIS, which joins one strand of DNA of male and female sex cells into a new strand that then multiplies by MITOSIS to become the embryo and eventually the growing organism. This is elementary biology. It's incompatible with Dawkins' reductionist, gene-centric interpretation of life. Genes are not the drivers; they're components of the complex cell phenomenon. *The attribution of \`selfishness' endows genes with a mode of action familiar to common sense, but a light year's distance from what genes actually do. I once asked a molecular biologist his opinion of Dawkins' book. He chuckled and responded: \`He must be talking about British genes. All the genes we see [in Australia] cooperate.' Dawkins excuses his anthropomorphization by insisting that \`selfishness' is a metaphor. He wrote a violent diatribe against a philosopher (Mary Midgley) who criticized it at length. But at an evolution conference at Northwestern University, he declared, after being annoyed by questions about the metaphor: \`I say that it's a metaphor to defend myself; but I really mean that genes are selfish'. On hearing this, I thought that he had hung himself. Journalists were present, and surely they would grab this news line. I was wrong. The audience of about 250 Neo-Darwinians broke into warm applause at his embrace of deception in scientific communication! *'Selfishness' and \`replicator' are indispensable ingredients of Dawkins' popularization of genetics at the expense of reality. One reality puzzling to geneticists at the time he wrote was the phenomenon non-coding genes, also called \`junk DNA' and 'passenger DNA', which comprises about 95 percent of eukaryotic cells. Why don't the working genes, exercising their \`ruthless selfishness', eliminate the free riders? This fact deeply embarrasses geneticists, who tend to think that these genes have a function that hasn't yet been discovered, or that they are relics of once functional genes. Yet redundancy paradox is a door to a long list of paradoxes. In the human genome, for example, the Alu sequence is repeated 580,000 times and comprises twelve percent of the genome. Why? Nobody knows. Moreover, such sequences occur in the midst of functional genes and must be cut out by enzymes before the gene can express--a bizarre arrangement (a \`maladaptation' for an evolutionist). Then there's the \`C value paradox', meaning the absence of correlation between genome informational complexity and organismic complexity (salamander cells contain 40 times more DNA than human cells, and so on for eukaryotics). Next there's the presence of hundreds of inactive viral sequences in vertebrate genomes, the decisive importance of protein folding to physiological function (highlighted by prions, which are replicating PROTEINS), gene networks that coordinate many genes to effect an outcome, alternative protein expression (a single gene may code for many proteins), and the complexity of genes (introns, extrons, transposons, retrotransposons, mRNA, rRNA, and tRNA, etc). These facts and problems are a brief light on what molecular genetics is about. But Dawkins avoids them, assuring his readers that \`all genes look alike'. Yes, they do...if you don't look at them! *Dawkins' theme isn't life phenomena generally but a special subset, the mechanism(s) of evolution. For him it's all natural section: the struggle for existence that only the \`fitter' survive, as they do because of morphological or other variations that give them an advantage that their conspecifics don't have. This explanation was subjected to intense criticism from the moment of its launch by Wallace and Darwin. The criticism continues today. Here are a few items. In the years just before Dawkins published, Motoo Kimura's experiments showed that most variation is selectively neutral (\`neutral theory'). Neutral changes accumulate in genomes and constitute a non-selective \`genetic drift' of organisms. Another change mechanism is endosymbiosis, where prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria, exchange genes (\`conjugation'). Another mechanism, parallel to endosymbiosis, is horizontal gene transfer between eukaroyts. These evolutionary mechanisms are hot topics today (made hotter by controversy about the consequences of genetic modification of crops), but they come after the Selfish Gene was published and were not incorporated in subsequent editions. Nor could they be because understanding them requires specialist knowledge of molecular biology that lies beyond popularization. The consequence is that Dawkins' Handy Andy explanations of evolution make little contact with the scientific literature. *Let me conclude by reverting to the dogma that we humans are \`lumbering robots'. At the end of his book Dawkins finds a redeeming way out: thanks to our cognitive capacity, we humans can rebel against the genes and overthrow their \`tyranny' by acting on choice, perhaps even moral choice. If so, why not say this at the beginning of the book, and eliminate the opening misanthropic insult? Perhaps because it has an indoctrination function. Indoctrination incorporates an initiation phase whose objective is to transform identities. The entry identity is despised and insulted (Marine recruits are called \`grunts') as part of the identity discard process that prepares the new identity, in this case, dedicated Dawkinsism. The old, despised identity is now associated with Others who reject the acquired identity. For Dawkinsites, the Other is those despised Creationists, against whom the charismatic master hurls an unending stream of bigoted insults. Disciplines who absorb his hatred can but admire his liberating doctrine. There you see that Dawkinsism is a polemical, sectarian abuse of evolutionary science."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition--with a new Introduction by the Author by Richard Dawkins is a book written by a author who wants to help the reader understand evolution and natural selection.

It is a masterpiece of choice illustration, finely honed definitions and pedantically nuanced distinctions, all framed by his engaging, pacey style. It has justly made him an iconic populariser. It is his best referenced and most tightly reasoned book.He starts with characteristic confidence: Darwinian evolution is as established as the earth's solar orbit. Blind prejudice or intellectual deficiency alone could misinterpret the data. The debate about his ingenious central thesis, the validity of a gene-focussed and gene-preserving explanation of altruism and other counter-intuitive behaviours, continues 31 years on.Strange then that as an exponent of hard-nosed empiricism, that his second chapter should take flight into the hyperspace of imaginative speculation. From p.12-14 see the brave professor leaping confidently into the realm of pre-biotic evolution. A world of hydrogen and methane, lashed with lightning, in which pre-biotic substrates accumulate to such excess they form a scum on the primordial soup. Serious doubts about the duration and degree of an intensely reducing atmosphere are voiced by geologists, but this is no deterrent to our bold champion. Watch the analytical chemists sucking their teeth and wincing as the author leaps further into the abyss, the bungee cord of tedious documentation and observation already looking dangerously frayed. Where are the pyrimidine nucleosides? (quite impossible to synthesize). What of the instability of cytosine? How can phosphate be preserved without precipitation? What on earth will enable bases, sugars (requiring quite different synthetic conditions) and phosphate to meet, and then miraculously and without enzymes to fuse correctly as even the most primitive proto DNA/RNA. The gaping abyss of data appears unending, yet Poppins-like, our professor seems to assure us, if we wish for it hard enough, however impossible - anything can happen. The difficulties have but just begun, what of chirality, what of the propensity of polymers to hydrolyse, how to survive intense ozone-less UV radiation? But lo! (p. 15) Our seer perceives a miracle - a virgin birth! * No, more amazing still, a virgin Replicator, unbegotten yet always begetting! Intrinsically unstable enough to have been formed initially, but stable enough to fill the whole earth with copies. Despite a studied vagueness here he suggests a primitive form of DNA (now his latest vogue is AATE). In p 18. our mysterious replicator wonderfully accumulates longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity. By p.19, wonder of wonders, it has metamorphosed into a \`simple' cell, with protein synthetic machinery, chiral purity, an intact membrane barrier, metabolic, transport, repair functions and most marvellous of all the ability to reproduce the whole. By p.20 the miracle transformation of \`goo' to you is complete.Here is narrative that makes the wildest encounters of the Enterprise or Galactica look as mundane as Carnaby Street by comparison. Here is drawn out, revivified spontaneous generation similar to the kind Pasteur definitively crushed in 1862, 3 years after the Origin was published. The imaginary link in chapter 2 is indispensable to the chain of Dawkin's whole thesis. But this is not science - it's wishful supposition. Here is a religious materialism that avoids the data, rather than re-examine its assumptions, however increasingly ridiculous they appear.*(Footnote to p.16. Dawkins' over forced distinction between two Hebrew terms is artificial, as 10 min reference to a concordance might have warned him. It suggests over-reliance on doubting colleagues, dubiously disguised as theologians. See the Hebrew of Joel 1.8.)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In a book entitled \\"The Selfish Gene\\" purporting to prove the theory of blind genetic control over animal behavior, the first thing the reader expects is a discussion of genetic mechanisms and the biochemical interaction between said genes and behavior. To this point, I find it odd that only in the first chapter, and only over several paragraphs at that, does Dawkins discuss the A,C,G,T mainframe and protein synthesis.From what I can tell, Dawkins suffers from the basest of Philosophical mistakes - he uses a certain pre-supposition to advance a theory without ever PROVING the pre-supposition at hand. In this case, Dawkins argues that the Gene's desire to replicate is the answer behind evolution...unfortunately he fails to realize THIS IS WHAT HE MUST PROVE! Rather than laying out the direct scientific links between individual genes and their related behaviors, Dawkins speaks only of the later behaviors never once proving that Genes had anything to do with them.In a nut-shell, had this book been entitled \\"The Evolution of Behavior\\" I could have accepted it - unfortunately, as it stands, this book attempts to prove a Genetic theory it never once even considers.Don't be fooled - to prove the existence of a certain behavior and later attribute it to genetic coding is no different than to prove the existance of the same behavior and later attribute it to the will of God. In each case a point is made, but the underlying supposition is never proven."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is a must read for everyone. Richard has done it again with this masterpiece. Apparent and fake purpose is destroyed and replaced with a blind natural selection where evolution takes place at the gene level."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is a GOOD book. The author presents an argument that through evolution, the real replicators and survivors of life (both animal and plant) are the genes. We humans (and all other species) simply provide a \\"survival mechanism\\" for these genes to operate and promulgate. He presents an analogy early in the book about how human programmers write software programs for a computer to play chess. After completion, the computer plays an opponent. The programmers can not intervene in the game. Their work is done. Also, when the programmers wrote the program, they could not anticipate every possible chess move in all possible contexts by an opponent and provide a singular move in answer. The combinations are much too large to analyze in such a way. So, the programmers set up guidelines and general \\"strategies\\". Newer programs even provide the ability for the program to \\"learn\\" by earlier moves in similar situations. This is how the author feels genes program us survival mechanisms to allow them (the genes) to spread (procreate) as often and as successfully as possible. Dawkins gives space to competing theories (mostly philosophic, sociologic, or anthropologic). Some reviewers have expressed pessimistic views; kind of like that old Peggy Lee song \\"Is that all there is\\". One reviewer even blames the book for his bouts of depression. I do not see the message as so negative although some \\"animal rights\\" proponents might be upset about what wild animals do to each other (both inter and intra species).Selfish Gene theory is one explanation (of course Dawkins would say the ONLY explanation) of how we organisms on the planet behave (why we feed and protect our offspring, how we choose when to fight and when to retreat, even why females have menopause and males fertility declines slowly. It may even give the genetic origin of why a courting man takes his date to dinner (and possibly why some men expect a reward for same). I know that Dawkins is a confirmed atheist but I do not find any objectionably strident atheism in this work. I WOULD say that he cavalierly says something like billions of years ago, in the primordial soup, along came some type of composite of atoms that could copy itself (my, what a lucky happenstance - the origin of life just kind of happened). If I were in Professor Dawkin's class, I would ask him \\"well, if the programmers programmed the computers to play chess, then who programmed the programmer? He would probably happily say \\"well, of course, their GENES programmed them\\". And I would say \\"well, Professor, who programmed the genes?\\""},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Behavior is passed along in genes. Richard Dawkins, the evolution biologist, presents a good case and lots of evidence. The book gives the reader a unique perspective of how creature's behavioral patterns propagate and enhance survival. For pleasure reading I still prefer his \\"God Delusion\\", a masterful mixture of logic, incite, and research."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In this excellent book, professor R. Dawkins provides a logical overview of how evolutionary theory works and discusses its various mechanisms in detail. To be sure, prof. Dawkins advances a particular branch of the evolutionary theory - that of the selfish gene. In doing this, throughout the book he routinely compares the selfish gene theory to other competing branches of the theory. In doing these comparisons, however, he always provides a somewhat lengthy and most importantly a fair treatment of the competing theories. Indeed, I would say he goes out of his way to ensure that he doesn't misrepresent the others' theories.Unlike his later books, in which Dawkins focuses on attacking the proponents of the pseudoscience of Intelligent Design, and theists of all sorts, there are no such distractions in this book. Occasionally, prof. Dawkins provides commentary on ethics, morals, society and philosophy, but such commentary is kept to a minimum and are largely somewhat relevant to the theme of the book.Whether you are a novice to the evolutionary theory, or a biologist/scientist, this book was a joy to read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"the book is a masterwork,It defacto changed some of the ways I look at things,the writing is good not over killing any-point but making them felt and each one count.

It's no longer the most accurate theory, but it is certainly the most attractive: simple and consistent from the ground up. It's a solid, practical introduction to metaphysical naturalism.Great for economically-minded individuals, whether you know you are one or not. It gives you tools of critical thinking that can be applied to a myriad situations.A must read for anyone going into a field of biology or economics."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The book is amazing. Dawkins does a great job of explaining the theory of evolution, and goes on to explain how it (or generalizations thereof) can be applied in completely different contexts, like that of memes. I think everyone should read the book to understand some very important aspects of how our world works, and avoid common misconceptions related to natural selection."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book ought to be essential reading for any thinking human being.If you've ever wondered about why humans do the things they do much is explained in this excellent book.Of all the books I have ever read, thousands, this is the one I find myself recommending time and again when people claim not understand why people do the things they do and make the choices that they do.What motivates us?Read this book and it ALL falls into place."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is a classic and a masterpiece. I think that the majority of people misinterpret this book by the title of it. It could've easily also have been given the title 'The Altruistic Individual' for the majority of the book it discusses reciprocal altruisim, and why individuals are altruistic based on what it best for their genes. We are essientially gene machines, doing what's best for our genes; however, the genes have provided us with the ability to rebel against them (i.e contraception)Dawkins also introduces the theory of the meme. Basically, as genes are in natural selection and reproduction - so memes are to human selection and cultural reproduction.Buy the book! Amazing read!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is just as exciting as it is groundbreaking. The idea behind it carries much weight and force, and is very hard to argue against. It is a universal fact that every organism's primary concern is survival, save for a few strange exceptions. Dawkins provides lucid metaphors and in depth explanations as to how evolution works from a genetic viewpoint, and how our behavior is ultimately aimed at propagating our genes.Dawkins talks alot about genes that determine behavior, or 'miss-firing' genes causing deviant or irregular behavior. I would agree that our genes may predispose us to inherit certain traits or behaviors to some extent, but our enviornment and other external influences undoubtedly contribute to effect our behavior as well.One concept I can't entirely agree with Mr. Dawkins on is that of Memes. Yes, ideas are spread from person to person, and they effect our culture, etc, but they are products of our own minds, not seperate entities. Also, a meme cannot be analyzed, nor does it have any specific substance, it seems to me like an imaginary thought replicator. To me the whole idea is so entirely subjective and speculative that I do not feel it is legitimate. However, his example of a meme that causes a fear of going to hell was a very good example. I prefer to name credulity and superstition as the causal factors.Overall, this book is very well written, and the examples given to support the selfish gene theory are superb. I highly recommend this book to anyone considering it, you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The discovery of DNA was one of the major scientific discoveries of the 20th century, and the application of this innovation promises to be critical to the 21st century.This book is rightly regarded as a book everyone should read. There are many misconceptions about Dawkins' position which can only be cleared up by reading what he has actually said. The 30th year anniversary addition includes additional endnotes where he explains (often in humorous detail) how some reviewers apparently only read the title of his book.Altruism is an important theme of the work, and Dawkins is by no means opposed to altruism.This is also the book which introduced the concept of the meme. Whether taken literally or used as an illustrative example, memes are an important idea."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins makes the fascinating point that, of all the sciences, evolution is the only one that laymen claim almost universally to understand. Most members of small town school boards would never feign understanding of quantum theory or general relativity, but when it comes to evolution they somehow know enough to require its teaching alongside \\"intelligent design\\" pseudoscience, or to ban its teaching outright. Thankfully, the book straightened out my understanding of evolution, leaving me not only with a beautifully simple and subtle understanding of how life on Earth came to take the form it now holds, but also with a better understanding of humanity's purpose on this planet.That last point may surprise many readers. Judging by the popularity of Michael Edwards' review (it is quoted in Dawkins' introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition), most people familiar with the book see in it a vision of a purposeless, aimless meandering through the eons, of humans as helpless slaves to their genes. After all, if humans are nothing more than \\"survival machines\\" with no more purpose than to carry the genes they contain down through the ages, what are we worth?To someone used to thinking of human beings as the \\"dominant\\" form of life on Earth, as a species above and separate from all the rest, this book may be cause for despair. This is because the bald, unvarnished truth of the book, and of this view of evolution, is that humans are no more special than any other life form on this Earth. We are no more special than the deer, no more special than the algae, no more special than the simplest bacteria. Neither are we any less special.Why should this revelation be a distressing one? We alone among all the creatures of the world, including humans still living as they did before contact with Western or Eastern civilization, have it in our heads that we must take our existence solely into our own hands. Dawkins rephrases \\"survival of the fittest\\" as \\"survival of the stable,\\" meaning that the species, and strategies unique to them, that survive are the ones that cannot be improved upon under current circumstances. We have tried to improve upon the strategy for living as humans that evolved with us, and the steady decay of the world as a result is evidence that we are failing in the attempt.That we are survival machines for selfish genes does not take away from the purpose of life. It merely changes us from masters of the Earth, or more accurately a rebel species at war with the rest of life, into just one among many, a gem in a mountain of gems, each no more or less precious than any other. If I've achieved nothing more than to confuse the reader, I recommend Daniel Quinn's books, most notable \\"Ishmael\\" and \\"The Story of B.\\" They've shown me a meaning and purpose in life wholly compatible with our existence as gene-operated robots (so to speak.)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I will just briefly mention, that not only was this book composed of interesting information about evolution but it was purely a joy to read. The writing style is imbued with a passion that keeps the pages turning. In addition, the implications will have you considering your place in this scheme with a sense of Saganesque awe. I found myself reading passages aloud to my wife."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A landmark when it appeared 30 years ago, and still great reading. Dawkins is one of Britain's national treasures and writes wonderfully."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"First of all Richard Dawkins is one of the only authors I read with a combination of awe, wonder, and above all pure jealously in his ability to express himself using the written word. He crafts his ideas together precisely, using apt analogies, witty asides, in a way that breaths life into otherwise classically considered 'dry' information. To be honest the way Richard Dawkins constructs arguments, he could sell sand to the Egyptians.I know it is an old book and a few of the points he states are no longer as valid as they use to be, but at the point of writing this book was astonishing, it not only ignited my interest in biology and evolution but changed my outlook of the whole world in general.Read this book first year uni and feel your mind expand into the best popular science book ever written."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is the book that introduces the concept of \\"memes\\". I'd consider this alone enough to justify reading this book. But the main subject, regarding how genes are actually the ones competing on evolution, is amazing as well.The extra pages included for 30th anniversary edition are also very worth reading."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I'm going to keep it short :This is a great book if you wonder \\"Why are animals so complex\\", \\"What are we ?\\", \\"Why is there something instead of nothing?\\". Although Richard does not give a final answer he does answer a lot of questions which (at least in my opinion) make a lot of sense, a lot more then any other answers I have read so far.I must warn you anyhow that this book is probably going to frustrate you if you refuse to question your beliefs (especially if you believe that the earth is only 6000 years old).It's a great book for beginners and experienced people alike."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Very in-depth explanation of genetics. This is an excellent book, but be prepared to digest it a little at a time, if you are not an evolutionary biologist. It is absolutely convincing and wonderfully explained.

The title is often misinterpreted - you have to read the book to fully understand his point. It is an exceptional text."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Before I read this book I only had a vague idea of how Evolution via Natural Selection worked. With the view that genes drive Evolution made everything seem so much more simple and wonderful. I would say this book should be mandatory for all basic level high school biology."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene consistently applies anthropomorphic language and the language of game-playing in contexts other than those in which they are conventionally used. As metaphors there is no question that this language, so characteristic of the way in which humans behave, actually helps quite a bit in understanding very impersonal aspects of biology and evolution. This shows us, I think, that despite the fact that, for example, much of game-playing can be expressed in neutral mathematical language, colorful metaphors from our natural languages can really liven up a subject and awaken us to the weirdness of science, its counterintuitive aspects and even the beauty of nature from a scientific point of view. Of course, the cost of using metaphors is a certain ambiguity, and opens one's viewpoint to being rather easily misunderstood, especially when one uses such \\"loaded\\" words as \\"selfish\\" to describe an inanimate object. This must be counterbalanced by a fresh perspective that can lead to such nice creative insights as the \\"meme\\" concept, and the possibility that inanimate processes can \\"appear\\" to be associated, for example, with \\"strategies\\". In a way, one can almost see this as a subtly sarcastic attack on the anthropomorphic character of many religions. We are accustomed to the vocabulary, methods, and theories of the physical sciences impinging on what one took to be curiously personal space. It is enchanting and startling to see that the language of personal descriptions can be used to enlighten us about impersonal aspects of science. Of course, Dawkins' book in its third edition was not modified over the second, but even so, this wonderful viewpoint he propounds is still new for many of us, and can really open one's eyes to possibilities. This is a demonstration that, strictly speaking, one can progress by merely looking at what has already been discussed elsewhere but from a new perspective."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"After reading The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins I think everyone interested in science should read this book. His logic is undeniable, his arguments are very simple to follow, it makes the reader feel like a scientist from the first page!!!

Good for an introductory read or as new insight to the advanced reader. Would have liked to see more insight on interspecies relationships."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene does not tell the whole truth, and I hope readers will seek other information to balance the \\"dog-eat-dog\\" world in which Richard Dawkins lives. I think of the scientists who once thought light was a wave. They would argue and fight with scientists who thought light was a particle. Finally some scientists came along who said \\"in some circumstances light acts like a wave, and in some circumstances, light acts like a particle.\\"I hope readers will find a similar solution for Richard Dawkins Selfish Gene. Sometimes genes may act in ways that can be described as selfish, but genes can also be viewed as highly creative and very cooperative (and that is how they made you.)I think of the destructive nature of The Selfish Gene. Geffrey Skilling read The Selfish Gene and felt selfishness was an inherent part of nature. He encouraged his employees to act in selfish ways, and as a result his company Enron became miserable place to work. Eentually Enron went bankrupt, devastating the lives of its employees, its investors, and mony throughout the United States.http://www.emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS/empathy/Reviewfiles/Seed.htmlOne reader of The Selfish Gene said he was depressed for 20 years after reading the book.I hope Richard Dawkins view of The Selfish Gene is soon overshadowed by the views of people like Frans de Waal in his book The Age of Empathy.It is interesting how the basic elements of our lives, our cells, can come and go so anonymously and yet it is because of their hard work and generosity toward each other that we have a self and are aware of our lives.How interesting if we view life from the perspective of cells, instead of the perspective of our selves. Our conscious lives are a construct from our neurons. Having a self helped our species, and all animals with a self, survive. A self constructs the prison Einstein talked about, where we feel separate from others and the world. Neurons working together give us The Self and this world view.From the perspective of cells, cells are there to help other cells. Cells form giant societies - 10 trillion of them form you. In these societies, each cells has an intricate job - and if each cells is successful performing its job, then the animal or plant survives.In the individual organism, cells help other cells. Even throughout life, cells help other cells. It is as if the first cells 600 millions years ago said to their children \\"Go out and experiment, and find ways to help each other. Look at how desolate is this earth, with no life but us, just a few cells. There is no oxygen. How will we survive? We don't know, but if you experiment with ways of being and ways of reproducing - there is a slight chance we will survive.And here we are, 600 million years later - and the descendants of those original cells survived, and prospered, and we have them to thank for our lives.Instead of Richard Dawkins \\"red in tooth and claw\\" perspective of a dog eat dog world, the world becomes a loving place where cells help each other survive. The cells of the lettuce help the cells of the rabbit survive. The cells of the rabbit help the cells of the hawk survive. The claws of the hawk may be red from the blood of the rabbit - but the cells of that blood give the hawk life.Are there other social societies in which individuals are generous like our cells? Honeybees form societies, and each honeybee works for the benefit of themselves and all the other honeybees. Perhaps people might evolve to one day form a human society as generous as the society of honeybees and our cells."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Here Professor Dawkins explains evolutionary theory in a way that is at once informative and engaging."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Book is of great quality and I received it on time.

This is a treatise on natural selection at the gene or gene set level.

This book was less. It was a fine academic work and, with some faults, rigorous and philosophically sound - but convoluted and dense.

It is another thing again to find a formula which predicts the share price!\\"The Selfish Gene\\" isn't science: it's in principle like an exercise in curve fitting but without even the rigor of mathematics. In this book Dawkins presents an untested hypothesis - that gene self preservation is the main driving force of evolution. For the rest of the book he states facts and interprets them through the lens of his hypothesis and indicates that by doing so he is providing evidence to support it! Tellingly he cites absolutely no scientific studies which support his hypothesis. Dawkins in \\"The Selfish Gene\\" is exactly the same as a fudamentalist christian stating that their biblical god exists as an explanation for the existence of the universe, and that because \\"The Bible\\" contains facts this proves the god explanation is a fact.The mass acceptance of Dawkins' book by the general public is illustrative of the need for prioritizing science education in society:Most people think that the essence of science is explanation and so they swallow Dawkins' selfish gene explanation of evolution as though it has some sort of scientific support, simply because it is espoused by a \\"scientist\\". The fact is of course that any phenomenon can be given an infinite number of explanations whereas science is in essence about (striving for) successful prediction. To gain any scientific credence Dawkins' hypothesis would need to be successfully tested for any predictive power it may possess.An irony is that organisms, in order to achieve better environmental conditions for their survival, depend on their ability to predict, and then alter their behaviour and their environments accordingly. Even single celled organisms are able to do things like \\"predict\\" where they should move to increase the likelihood of finding food or better sunlight conditions for their energy needs in order to survive and reproduce.The cells in Dawkins' brain seem to excell at predicting how to make money out of pop \\"science\\" but appear limited in their ability to actually do science."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"After 30 years, these groundbreaking insights in evolution stand out as a major landmark.

For many people who aren't very familiar with evolutionary theory, this book will absolutely change the way you see the world. If you are already familiar with some of what Dawkins is talking about you will definitely be in for a treat.The book is the perfect length and covers just the right amount of material and yet feels like its not leaving out too much either.For budding scientists with an interest in biology, or ANYONE who is just curious about the natural world and mankind's place in it this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book puts the body of knowledge in evolutionary biology in the right perspective.

If you are new to science or if you are a young teen, I would recommend starting with The Magic of Reality and then moving on to The Greatest Show on Earth. Reading this one after those first two is a great way to put a lot of the picture together.You will often find yourself nodding along with the book as if these things are so obvious, Dawkins is merely pointing out things we already \\"knew\\".

Richard Dawkins' words describe a new way of viewing the evolution process, a view that describes genes as the principal contributor for the survival and progress of species. This selfish gene behavior can be explained, in part, thanks to mathematical's game theory, which is something simple to understand since the author provide a serie of examples. He also punctuates that the selfish gene can cooperate with other genes in order to be a evolutionary stable strategy (survive through time), so in that way Nice guys can truly finish first."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins is my favorite author.

He is a brilliant and courageous man who works hard to bring his knowledge and insights to all of us. For the record I have read six of his books and reviewed four of them. They are:The God Delusion (2006)The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution (2004)A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love (2003)The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (1982; 1999)The second thing I want to say is that The Selfish Gene is one of the landmark science books of the 20th century, and so I am pleased to see this 30th Anniversary Edition (from 2006) with a new introduction by Dawkins and some new footnotes.Rather than review the book as a whole, however, as has been done many times, in this review I want to concentrate on the central issue of the book, namely the question of \\"at what level does natural selection work?\\"Dawkins believes that the environment selects certain genes, or more properly speaking, suites of genes and therefore operates primarily at the level of the gene. I disagree and believe this is like saying that the public selects certain letters, or words, or sentences of words when buying a book. The words (or more properly the ideas represented by the words) are the reason the public selects a book, but what the public selects is nonetheless the book. Genes are like ideas in books. Ideas must appear in some medium, even if it is just word of mouth. Genes must appear in organisms, which are the products of both the genetic instructions and the environment in which they develop. Consequently genes help to produce individuals (or in the case of social insects, a group of individuals that can be seen as a single organism). Dawkins calls these individuals \\"survival machines.\\" In turn the environment selects certain survival machines that contain certain genes.Another way of expressing this is to say that the environment selects genes by proxy, that is, through the medium of the individual phenotype. The environment cannot directly affect the genes since the genes are safely encapsulated within the survival machine which does not in any Lamackian way communicate with them. The exception is when an electromagnetic particle hits the code and alters it, creating a mutation. The environment does not act on that altered code; instead it acts upon the individual that is born to carry that altered code or lack thereof.The individual gene itself (if we can speak of such a thing which is just a section of code) doesn't work in isolation. It is always allied for better or for worse with other sections of code. Certain sections of code are reproduced again and again because they are handy or work well with other sections of code in a way that allows the survival machine to reproduce and its offspring to reproduce. But the environment cannot select certain selections of code. It can only select the individual containing that code (and a lot of other code besides). In fact, it cannot just select the individual, it must select its possible mates and even much of its environment as well, such as the plants and animals it uses for food and shelter. To speak of selecting genes or even individual organisms is just a convenient way of talking.What is really selected is a group of organisms of some kind. Some consider an important group selected by the environment to be the species or the ecology. Giving a large enough perspective, I would go so far as to say (going beyond Lovecock and Gaia) that natural selection operates on the level of life itself.Another point is that the genes never reproduce themselves by themselves. Nothing in this world that I know of actually reproduces itself by itself, except dividing cells, and they do this only most of the time. As is now known, occasionally bacteria trade genes with other bacteria and thereby reproduce not quite exact copies of themselves. A strand of DNA is replicated with the help of the machinery of the cell. Viruses need cells to replicate themselves. Anything that was one hundred percent effective in making exact copies of itself would not undergo Darwinian evolution and would in fact have died out long ago. The dreaded grey goo of nanobots replicating until they cover the earth is still just a fantasy of science fiction.The problem with the current understanding of evolution and natural selection is the problem of not seeing that everything is connected. Any place we draw a boundary is artificial or arbitrary. Even at the skin. Franklin M. Harold, in his book, The Way of the Cell: Molecules, Organisms and the Order of Life (2001) writes, \\"Organisms process matter and energy as well as information; each represents a dynamic node in a whirlpool of several currents, and self-reproduction is a property of the collective, not of genes.... DNA is a peculiar sort of software, that can only be correctly interpreted by its own unique hardware....sending aliens the genome of a cat is no substitute for sending the cat itself--complete with mice.\\" (op cit., p. 221)For those of you who have read Dawkins' original edition from 1976, this edition is still to be recommended, particularly for the updated bibliography and for the 66 pages of endnotes where Dawkins graciously admits errors and points to new discoveries, most interestingly that of Zahavi's \\"handicap principle\\" which goes a long ways toward explaining some \\"altruistic\\" behavior. See my Amazon review of The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle (1997) by Amotz and Avishag Zahavi."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Scholars pro-evolution can generally be divided into 1) those who believe in evolution at the group level (ie: The reason lions behave in a particular way is because they want to survive as a species) or 2) those who believe in evolution at an individual level (ie: The reason a particular bird behaves in a particular way is because he wants to survive as an individual bird). Dawkins' views are closer to the latter. In fact, he takes it a step further and argues for evolution at the gene level. I think he makes a very convincing case for his views. Of course nothing is certain (except uncertainty perhaps) so he does not prove his theory definitively.The book can be hard to read at times and may be a bit slow for those with no background in biology or science.

I'm glad I did. Dawking is brilliant, and this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Maybe it's a quirk in my personality, but I'm always looking for some great truth, some unifying theory. After all, if the beautiful world around us was not created by a deity (which, as an explanation, explains nothing), but by something as \`seemingly random' as evolution, then surely there must be some great code, some great pattern (essentially a natural order, a natural \`Ten Commandments, if you will) running through everything. We've always heard that \`code' is \\"fit\\", but again, \`fit' in terms of genes doesn't explain much either. I needed a little more, so I cracked open this book thinking it would open my eyes to some genetic truth. I soon found lots of amazing things, but was met with the crude ugly truth about genetics: they are anything but a guide for morality. The \`beautiful pattern' I was seeking was nowhere to be found. We are met with a contradiction, as men and women: the very thing that gives us enjoyment, indulgence- satisfaction of a few evolutionary \\"carrots\\"- is the opposite of what we consider \`good' and \`moral'. Originally I believed our Morality actually stems from resisting our impulses, our genetics, to separate us from lower animals. Dawkins believes that what we consider \`sophisticated society' actually comes from whatever can be sustained in equilibrium; in other words, the reason we can eat meat, but are repulsed by Cannibalism, is mostly due to the fact that, if we were Cannibals, the species would shrink and eventually go extinct. The equilibrium is for us to eat other animals.It's also frowned upon, in modern society, to kill people. From a Genetic perspective, there's no advantage to killing people, even your rivals.. it wastes energy, and may make other rivals even stronger in rank. Reverse rationalization. Pretty much everyone one of today's social taboos comes from Genetic no-nos.How do Genes affect our bodies, and ultimately societies? These human bodies of ours, to hear Dawkins describe it, are like sports teams that our genes \`join' in order to win a championship. You see, genes don't actually have a goal, but they are known for duplication. That's what they do. And sometimes, they do it better by \`getting along with others'. Likewise, Dawkins goes on to suggest that diseases, that ultimately need their host to survive to spread more, may \`dial back' the sickness for a while, so the \`host' (the sick patient) can live a little longer, so they can infect others. This is why effects of AIDS or Cancer don't show up until later in life. This is not a willful brilliant chess move on the part of your last \`runny nose', its just that that \`runny nose' that took a while to show up propagated more than the one that put its host in the hospital instantly.The funny thing is, human personality, something we identify, describe and name (eg. Human Psychology and Personality Development) is backwards, its Monday Morning Quarterbacking. To hear Dawkins Describe Human Personalities, is like the IBM's Deep Blue Supercomputer walking you through its chess moves in the dismantling of the Kasparov. There is order there, we just didn't know it. An aggressive man and a passive woman, those are just two different strategies. The inclination to see the good in people is really just another strategy. It turns out that we too, represent multiple genetic options. He with the better strategy wins- he'll get the money, he'll get multiple sexual partners, spread his genes, and be very strong and confident. And the personalities/strategies, like viruses, that are more effective, spread.Speaking of personality and morality, what about lying? Do animals ever tell lies? It turns out that when baby chicks chirp louder, they get more food. The mum assumes the hungriest chicks will chirp the loudest. That's right, we didn't (sorry Ricky) invent lying. Animals have been doing it for ages. And when an Animal discovers that its colors protect it (because it looks like a vicious competitor), it's lying too. And exploits the lie.Besides spreading genetic code, we like to spread ideas. Perhaps you've heard this term floating around the Internet: Memes. Memes are good, bad, stupid ideas, that either catch on, or they vanish, evaporate. And Memes have a pretty cool feature, that, like Genes, they can replicate (very quickly, like this \`Boy Slams Bully\` Video which caught fire a couple months ago) by replicating in other people's minds. I can even speak an idea, and 50,000 people can hear it, or write something on the web (or in the sand, on a beach) and people can come back later and read it. The Meme, thought, duplicates, and that's why it's powerful.Interestingly, that makes two things that can replicate, Genes and Memes. Memes are the takeoff of evolution, dovetailing into technology, that got us driving 100 miles an hour, and flying up in the sky, not with strong legs, or broad wings, but, technology. Bad ideas are trashed and good ideas are copied and improved upon (patent system be damned).When we die, Dawkins says, we leave these two things behind, Genes and Memes. Is this all we can achieve in this mortal coil? To raise a family, pass on our code, and leave some imprint on the world, make some mark, be a world famous athlete, scientist, discoverer, pop star or military hero? Shall we be judged not by memories of our loved ones, but by our \`meme'-richness (or Cosmic Google ranking)? In the search for eternal life, it would seem so. All that matters is great ideas. In terms of unifying theories, it's a little weak but there is some justice to it.More reviews like this on 21tiger"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The Selfish Gene and The History of Earth should be on the list of everyones favorites.

But, it's no Bukowski."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"No, this isn't an Ayn Rand book urging you to be more selfish.I consider The Selfish Gene to still be one of the cornerstones of Evolutionary Dynamics theory, particularly in its extension of biological dynamics into the non-biological world. Memetics really took general evolutionary theory past a threshold for information and soft sciences. I found its concepts to be invaluable for one of my grad papers on international systems where I made further extrapolations from both biology and memetics, formulating more specific characteristic traits shared by all extreme complexity nonlinear evolutionary systems.Just as Darwin was not perfect, though, Dawkins himself oversimplifies at times. The scales at which these \\"games\\" transpire outside a vacuum include multi-gene traits, male-female trait-complimenting within speciation, role hierarchy, inter-species symbiotic relationships, larger populations, and even whole ecosystems. Furthermore, non-zero sum outcomes are more prevalent than winner-takes-all. Thus accounting for the multitude of levels at which competition occurs and adding, for example, Nash Equilibriums, one can only begin to explore the infinite complexity of how systems evolve.On the religion aspect of this book, I think Dawkins does a fine job showing how biology and the workings of the universe do not necessarily \\"bare witness\\" to a god with the way life works, the planets revolve around the sun, or the rain falls from the sky. Biological evolution is a very specific example of this and case studies in transitional fossils, the newer computer experiments, and showing the prevalence of evolution everywhere help bare it out quite well here. At times, however, he seems to get a little preachy unconstructively to people who will likely just attribute their rationale to faith, anyway.For a more recent and legally interesting exploration of the creationism v. evolution debate, I recommend the Nova documentary \\"Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial\\" for its timeliness and brevity. While I think this discussion is essentially long past over, even for an agnostic like myself I'm not going to dismiss all spiritualism or interest into the nature of consciousness or existence itself. The twisting of science using half-truths and ignorance in support of specific institutional dogmas is fair game for attack, though. And I have to admit The Selfish Gene was as successful as I think one can be in long-form."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins takes up where Darwin stopped; his reasoning and logical proofs sweep the last bit of theism from the mind.

Upon reading it, I cannot help but view the world in an entirely new light, one that is at once unsettling and intriguing. Author Richard Dawkins is quite effective at communicating his opinions to readers in a clear and provoking manner, interspersing short anecdotes in his discussions to further illustrate his ideas. Dawkins is clever in that his work can be read by both the scientist and the layman with great fervor. I, myself, found my eyes hooked onto its pages for hours at a time. From the very first page, one is addicted; these self-replicators are mindless congregations of matter that have been able to construct \\"gigantic lumbering robots\\" within which entire colonies of themselves exist, sealed off from the outside world (p. 19). Their communication with their host is limited, instead opting to deal with their creation through indirect and oftentimes torturous manipulation. It is mind-boggling to accept that these replicators are none other than DNA, and we are merely their \\"survival machines\\" (p. 20). I found it most interesting to see Dawkins' arguments from a philosophical standpoint; how have we as survival machines lost the ability to recognize that we are not one separate entity? Why do we think and feel as \\"I\\" and not \\"we\\"? Dawkins provides an explanation and it is simply that selection has favored genes that promote cooperation with others. This has happened to such an extent that the communal nature of a colony of identical genes is for all intensive purposes unrecognizable. Evolution has seemed to favor a survival machine having the ability of subjective consciousness. This certainly brings us to the paradox of what our individual consciousness entails--what our lives truly mean. As Dawkins so beautifully ponders, \\"...perhaps consciousness arises when the brain's simulation of the world becomes so complete that it must include a model of itself\\" (p. 59). Returning to the topic at hand, what makes The Selfish Gene so remarkable is that presenting its heavily scientific concepts is prose that is almost lyrical in nature. Indeed, this is where the magic of the book grasps the reader like a clenched fist. Instead of describing the movement of cistrons from one generation to the next by describing how the chromosomes align on the metaphase plate, and how chiasmata form, Dawkins chooses a much more romantic route: \\"As the cistrons leave one body and enter the next, as they board sperm or egg for the journey into the next generation, they are likely to find that the little vessel contains their close neighbors of the previous voyage, old shipmates with whom they sailed on the long odyssey from the bodies of distant ancestors. Neighboring cistrons on the same chromosome form a tightly-knit troupe of traveling companions who seldom fail to get on board the same vessel...\\" (p. 33). That is the magic that is The Selfish Gene."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I read The Selfish Gene (2nd edition, 1989) because it is one of the twenty books Charlie Munger recommends in the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (which I have recently read and recommend very strongly indeed).I'm going to quote Dawkins from the preface to the original edition as he provides an excellent summary of the central message of the book and its effect upon him (and me):\\"We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment. Though I have known it for years, I never seem to get fully used to it.\\"Using one of the many excellent analogies utilised throughout his book, Dawkins explains that we are like a chess computer program that has been programmed by its creator to play in its absence. The programmer (genes) takes no part in the game (life) but instead provides the tools for its vehicle (animal, plant etc.) to play the game on its behalf.I am glad that Dawkins says that he never gets fully used to this idea. I find it very difficult to replace the idea of my primacy in my body with the idea above. It requires a sort of \`flip' in one's perception - but it is so different to what our senses tell us that it flips back without a conscious effort (or so I find, anyway). But how many of us have not regularly had to do battle with themselves to do what they know they should do rather than what they feel an urge to do? Dawkins' ideas provide an excellent framework in which to help understand these problems, which I suspect is a major part of the reason why Munger recommended this book.For example, Munger believes that what he calls \`reward and punishment superresponse tendency' is the most powerful of the psychological biases that affect humans (and other animals). Dawkins provides a very convincing explanation of why this should be the case: because it is a method that the programmer (genes) can use to provide rules that its vehicle (us) can use to learn to cope with its environment better in the absence of the programmer. It is thus much more efficient than providing an endless number of detailed rules and copes with the problem of an environment that may be different to that \`expected' by the genes. Even so, these rules do not always help us today - for example it helps to explain why rich societies have a problem with obesity: our genes did not expect us to have access to such plenty that the rule to reward us for putting sweet things into our mouths would cause problems.Our selfish, almost immortal genes do not care about us - their short-term, throwaway vehicles. We should also expect to find that we have been programmed with selfish behaviour in our creators' image. However, he makes two very important caveats, which mean that overall I think the book has a rather hopeful message:1. We are likely to have a statistical propensity towards selfishness, but that does not mean that individually we are doomed to that behaviour. We have a choice.2. In my favourite chapter, \`Nice guys finish first' (one of the two chapters added for the 2nd edition) Dawkins uses the Prisoner's Dilemma gambling game to show that if certain conditions are met (which often are in nature), paradoxically, the best outcome is for selfish individuals to cooperate. And that the \`good' character traits of niceness, forgivingness and non-enviousness can therefore be the most successful.I believe that unless we wish to rely on luck throughout our lives we need to embrace reality as closely as possible, which is what a first-rate book like Dawkins' helps us to do."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Than anything religion has to offer. Forget the fact that Mr Dawkins is an atheist. What this book has to offer goes far beyond the typical banter of creationist vs scientist. This book explains clearly and precisely some of the basic tenets of Darwinian natural selection and how that builds our world.The greatest thing about this book, for me, is that it peaked my interest in science. Throughout highschool and college I never paid much mind to science in general, making statements like, \\"it's too complicated\\". Science can be complex and complicated, but it can also be simply and clearly explained by authors such as Mr. Dawkins.I have to admit that prior to reading this book, I had no knowledge of Darwinian theory. Mr. Dawkins makes great use of simile to explain genes and how they effect animal behavior and structure.**By the way, for those who still think humans are not animals, wake up!!**This book opened up my mind to a whole new world of information. I truly believe that science will one day unravel all of the mysteries of humanity and the universe. At least scientists are willing to question themselves, to admit they don't have all the answers, yet. At least scientists are willing to admit when they are wrong and build on their mistakes. At least science relies on a universal methodology, clearly explained, which anyone can apply. At least scientific evidence has to pass rigorous testing and peer review. The same cannot be said of religion(s) which only re-interpret the same bundle of tired re-worded mythical stories. Religion uses fables to try and refute facts and evidence, of which it provides neither.Science does no harm by explaining things. Who wouldn't want more knowledge about life, the universe, and the hidden causes behind the world. Science reveals to us just how amazing life is, right down to the cellular level. I find it incredibly inspirational. To say science is bad is simply ignorant.I am most thankful for having taken the time to read this book and grasping a basic understanding of genetics and how they effect every being in the world. Thank you Mr. Dawkins for sparking my interest in science!!I recommend this book to anyone who isn't afraid to challenge themselves."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"At about the same time Dawkins first put his pen to \`The Selfish Gene' my granduncle, Albino Luciani, cast his vote for genetic science. Just a month before his election to the papacy, when all other cardinals condemned Louise Brown - the world's first artificially inseminated child - as \\"a child of the devil,\\" the 33 day pope John Paul I, at the time Archbishop of Venice, wrote her parents, \\"I congratulate you on the birth of your little girl. I (the Church) have no right to condemn you for what you asked the doctors to carry out. Be assured, there is reserved for both you and your child a high place in heaven.\\"A week later the cardinal was questioned by a reporter as to why he had defied the papal decree that condemned such experimentation. He told the reporter, \\"My good friend Einstein could not accept the existence of God because of the way God plays dice with His children. Many are born with mental and physical defects only to live unspeakable lives and die unspeakable deaths. How many children are born is not what is important, what is important is that every child that is born has an equal chance at a good and healthy life. Only genetic science can take us there. God played hooky the day that class was taught.\\" This quote is from Lucien Gregoire's \`Murder in the Vatican' the only existing biography of my granduncle.I was surprised that as a layperson I was able to grasp Dawkins's work - particularly as it analyses the world of genes. This is one of his great attributes. He is able to explain extremely complex subjects so that the dimmest of us can understand them.

If you are interested in reading this book, a used second edition copy is as good as this one (skip the first edition -- lacks the last two chapters and Dawkins' comentaries).The information in this book is worthy of five stars. It is the finest treatise on natural selection as the prime shaper of an evolutionary process to date. It clearly shows how a complex biological system (like humans) can arise from simple replicating molecules. It does not refute religious ideas of supernatural creation, but simply provides an alternative explanation via a natural biological mechanism. It isn't, as some think, ground breaking research -- as Dawkin's says himself, if is more a treatise of existing research. It's importance is in Dawkin's magnificent writing ability that bridged the technical fields of evolutionary biology and sociobiology to the layman."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene is a great book for people with all levels of knowledge about evolution and genetics. It seems that Dawkin's use of metaphors in the bulk of the book, could make it harder to understand the science behind his logic. However, this is not the case because Dawkins is very careful about which metaphors he uses. These metaphors prevent people with a vast knowledge of genetics from getting board while reading the book, but at the same time teach people about genetics without them realizing it. The science behind this book is very solid. Throughout most of the books he cites papers and other scientists. Dawkins is also an accomplished zoologist and a professor at Oxford. Dawkins is obviously an atheist and he is not afraid to express his opinions at the expense of others beliefs. In the endnotes there is a section spent entirely on proving religions wrong.In the book Richard Dawkins makes the argument that genes, not humans, are selfish. He says that this is the only way possible because genes are constantly competing for a \`spot' in organisms. If genes were altruistic then they would not be as likely to get passed onto future generations as those that are selfish because the selfish ones would reap the benefits while the altruistic genes would suffer. This means that at some point altruistic genes became essentially nonexistent in the gene pool.His selfish gene logic means that genes that cause selfish phenotypes are the only genes in organisms. This means that all organisms, without conscious thought, will only do things that they gain from (by gaining he means having a higher chance of passing on their genes). He gives examples of seemingly altruistic relationships, like the aphid to ant relationship. Then he shows that they are actually for selfish gain and it just so happens that along with the gain for the individual comes gain for the other.At the end of the book Dawkins shows that having selfish genes could actually result in a \`nice' organism in the chapter \\"Nice guys finish first.\\" He uses Prisoner's Dilemma, a game, to describe how this could happen. In the end he shows that strategies that play kindly end up getting a higher number of points then those that play meanly. (Strategies are like genes they set up a rule for playing, but do not consciously control the organism/game). This means that to gain selfishly you would actually want to be nice. So niceness could occur in a selfish gene pool.Dawkins also says that humans have a conscious and are one of the first organisms that can act independently from their selfish genes in thought and action.In summary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of its scientific teachings and sound logic. Therefore, I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Thirty years later and this classic remains a compelling read.

Other books by Dr. Dawkins maybe an easier read but this is where it all started."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This is the third book I have read by Richard Dawkins. This 30th anniversary edition of the Selfish Gene is the oldest of the books he has written that I have read - the other two have been more recent works. I did not find this book as easy to read and as interesting as the more recent books, but it was still, nevertheless, a good, informative read.In this work, Dawkins discusses in detail the machinations of the gene and how both individual selfishness and individual altruism are explained by the fundamental law that he calls gene selfishness. Dawkins defines the \\"gene\\" as a successful unit of replication. It must have longevity, fecundity, and copying fidelity as its properties. It is the largest entity which, at least potentially, has these properties.I think one important concept to understand in the reading of this material is that of an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). Two characteristics of such a strategy would be:1. When used by an entire population, it is resistant to invasion by new (mutant) strategies. In other words, is stable with respect to evolutionary changes.2. It carries on doing well when it is already numerous in the population of strategies.A classic example given is that the reason lions do not hunt lions is because it would not be an ESS for them to do so.Two other important concepts are replicators and vehicles. The replicators are the fundamental units of natural selection that form lineages of identical copies with occasional random mutation. DNA molecules are an example of replicators. In the case of vehicles, Dawkins stated \\"The vehicles don't replicate themselves; they work to propagate their replicators. Replicators don't behave, don't perceive the world, and don't catch prey; they make vehicles that do all those things.\\" These concepts aid in understanding how genes affect the outcome of host behavior.The book is replete with detailed examples of how these principles work in nature, and contains an extensive notes section to further clarify the information of the original work. If you are a fan of Dawkins works, you will want to add this one to your repertory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary theorist and holds the Charles Simonyi Chair in the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He is also a best seller author of science books, and quite easy to read. His most recent book is The God Delusion, but previously he wrote mainly about evolution. For example, his prior book is The Ancestors' Tale, a brief history of life on earth.The Selfish Gene is explains the basics of evolution in simple and readable language. There is a good reason why this book has a 30th Anniversary edition: it is truly a classic, and will be read for many, many years to come."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"While I was attending college (more than a few years ago) I took a class on evolution. There was no Google at that time so I was searching for books the old fashioned way: the library's card catalog. When I saw the title \\"The Selfish Gene\\" I knew I had to read the book.The book itself was unassuming and plain -- a ragged first addition. The University possessed only a single copy. I figured that this would probably be the beginning and end for Dawkins's literary legacy. The university's copy was 20 years old by the time I checked it out but it was unknown to me or anyone I knew.The Selfish Gene was a revelation of evolutionary extrapolation. Like no other work, it crystallized the theory I knew into a deep understanding of the chain of evolutionary cause and effect. My view of the world was changed forever. As a matter of fact, the world itself was demonstrably changed by the book. \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was the origin of the word and concept of 'meme'. The meme of the concept of 'meme' is de facto proof of the validity of Dawkins' ideas.This book is one of the top 5 books I've ever read (and I've read hundreds). It's an accessible read but it still maintains complexity."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins has influenced public understanding of science and discussion of religion. Whatever he says or writes deserves careful consideration, because he's a brilliant, considerate intellect. You probably know that this book was first published in 1976 and it fueled a fountain of inquiry into the life sciences. Both Dawkins's and The Selfish Gene's places in history are strong.Well I finally got around to reading it. Ultra-short summary: As we consider the progress of life through natural selection, it is useful to drop our focus on the organism, and replace it with a focus on the gene. Genes do not possess volition, but we can understand some important aspects of evolution better if we pretend that genes are struggling to survive and multiply, using organisms as their \\"vehicles.\\" Dawkins also proposes this approach to our study of ideas, for which he coins the term \\"meme.\\"Basically, that's it. These concepts are reiterated many, many, many times in the text. Richard did wear me out. I mean, we got it the third time you said this; a twenty-third time isn't adding to our understanding. I hasten to add that this repetition was probably more valuable in 1976 when the concepts were new. Dawkins has written many books after this one, and I think his thought and writing greatly improved. Therefore, I'd recommend a book like \\"Climbing Mount Improbable\\" over \\"The Selfish Gene.\\"Today many of Dawkins's ideas have been expanded and clarified by other science authors. One book I'd recommend on this subject is \\"The Limits of Family Influence: Genes, Experience, and Behavior\\" by David C. Rowe. As the title indicates, Rowe's book focuses on humans, and it held my interest better, when relating technical information. Talk about ants and I'll listen for a minute; talk about me and I'm yours all day."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"At first, I was quite disturbed by the title, and as a consequence, reluctant to read it. I mean, how could a gene be selfish? And even if this was meant only as a metaphor for higher principles, I could not swallow (and still can't) the \\"gene this, gene that, mutate this, mutate that\\" approach popping all over the place; there must be more to evolution than gene mutation and replication. In short, I am not very fond of the gene-centered view of evolution, except maybe in the case that gene is used as a metaphor, or better yet, if we take genes, memes, and temes, and put them under the umbrella of replicators, then we might have a replicator-centered view of evolution, or, the survival of information.Dawkins hosted an interesting series at PBS on evolution, where he presented the ideas of Darwin to the general public. Apart from this, his two papers, \\"Arms Races Between and Within Species\\" and \\"Animal Signals - Mind Reading and Manipulation\\" in collaboration with John Krebs, made me want to dig into some more high quality ideas on evolution.If you watched the PBS series or any other series presented by Dawkins, you know that he's a calm and patient person. That calmness and clearance of mind flows right back into his writing which is smooth, easy to follow and at times seems warm.It seems like in the evolutionary literature, every new view on the subject, every new theory is bound to tackle all the important questions if it is to be a successful one. Questions regarding animal signaling, aggression, the difference between sexes, rearing of the young, matting preferences and others are all brought to surface by the author with the almighty gene in mind. The book can also be regarded as an anti-Intelligent Design manifesto. The feeling it conveys is that there is no purpose in the universe, that life is merely the bonding of some special kind of chemicals, whose only ambition is to avoid decaying. How does it do that? By coming up with strategies and mechanisms to avoid just that. If only the information could somehow be stored in a kind of fixed unbreakable manner, it doesn't really matter that the present life form disappears, as long as the information on how it was built in the first place, survives past it's personal destruction, and can be used to form a new, identical individual. But there is a compromise; if the environment in which the bit of life has to survive changes, it would be perilous if he would remain fixed in his place in his form and function. Thus, he has to adapt constantly to his (new) conditions, this is does by mutations and changes in phenotypes. Changing as it goes in nature, by trial and error is also risky; if the new form is not better than the old one, it could face extinction; so a large body of the same kind of life is always desirable if new strategies for survival are to be found; many of them will not succeed, but some of them will. This is made possible through reproduction, and every life form will try to bring to life as many copies of himself as it is possible at every given time and place.The writing stands in contrast with the group selection or species selection [see unit of selection] and this I feel is correct from a theoretical point of view. There is always a desire to search for fundamental principles, for elemental building blocks, be it in physics, chemistry, genetics or philosophy. In this regard, the gene is the fundamental unit of information that is passed on from organism to organism in it's original form, and this is all that matters, biologically.The fact that it's a book written for the general public takes away some of it's appeal, the writing is sparkled here and there with catch-phrases that have nothing to do with the theory itself, only maybe, with how well the book will sell. At times, this is really frustrating and you would just want to skip pages to the essential stuff. Also, some background in Mendelian genetics would be really helpful to have, as well as some knowledge of Darwinism ideas, especially reading On the Origin of Species in advance."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I love the way Richard Dawkins writes. Highly logical, and always covering his tracks to avoid misinterpretation as is so likely to happen in this case. I loved the second chapter. For a long time I had wondered how evolutionary theory could explain the beginning of life. That insurmountable mountain is truly difficult to climb. But this book seemed to have a plausible answer. In his second chapter, \\"The Replicators\\", Dawkins gives an account of how life could have evolved in the primordial soup as small chemicals that could self assemble and make copies of themselves. When he says that the purpose of our life is to continue the duplication of these original replicators and that we are but survival machines for these chemicals, I experienced a moment of epiphany.I will recommend this book to every thinking man and woman. I think it has a life view changing impact in the reader. In the 30 years since the book was written biology has made immense advances. However the beautiful theory of evolution was perhaps never better interpreted than in this book. Perhaps no one really understands evolution just like no one understands Quantum theory, but this book is perhaps the best I ever got to understanding the meme of evolutionary theory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"\\"Why are people?\\" This is the title of the first chapter of Selfish Gene. In the first paragraph of the book the author states that Charles Darwin made ii possible for us to answer this question sensibly. The book promises to help the reader answer this question and such others as \\"Is there meaning to life?\\" It delivers on the promise.Dawkins has a unique gift for communication. As you read a paragraph densely packed with concepts and assimilate them, inevitably your mind goes \\"hmm... that's sounds good, but..\\" Invariably Dawkins has anticipated these objections and he deals with them one by one. There are many other good books out there which explain the theory of Charles Darwin but I would be surprised if any of them is as good as the Selfish Gene.A word of caution. Starting to look at the world through Darwinian glasses is very similar to Neo's taking the \\"red pill\\" in matrix. These glasses make you question a lot of \\"facts\\" assumptions and even your sense of right and wrong, which can be disturbing."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I've been meaning to read this book for over a year. It absolutely changed my perspective on how things have evolved and why nature seems to present so many contradictions.Dawkins takes his argument all the way past biological and explains how the same principals that govern how life works can also govern other things such as memes.Throughout, Dawkins style is very accessible and he presents his arguments in a clear and convincing manner that anyone can follow.I now see the world through a different lens."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The book is stellar. I wish I had read it before I went to college, when it first came out. Dawkins's thoughts here illuminate the way we think. In the same way that Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo showed us that the earth revolves around the sun rather than vice versa, Dawkins and the various biologists and ethologists he quotes show that organisms revolve around their genes rather than vice versa. The implications are widespread and profound. If you ever wonder what Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) is smoking when he says humans are just moist robots, it's pure Dawkins.You need to read this.However, the Kindle e-book is an embarrassment. Serious misspellings and notational weirdness are all over the place. They are ever so totally distracting. Plus the footnotes, which are so important for updating the earlier text to this century, don't work on Kindle hardware or on Kindle for iPad (or apparently on any Kindle version). This needs to be fixed. It took me so long to manipulate back and forth, even with the help of bookmarks."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The one star is reserved not for Dawkins' superb seminal work on evolutionary biology, but for the terrible way it has been adapted for the Kindle. It's riddled with typos, and Dawkins endnotes - which he uses prodigiously as a tool to enrich his arguments and supplement his examples - are all but inaccessible. It's a great shame that such an important book has been ported to the Kindle platform in such a cavalier fashion."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"The book provides a gene-centric view on evolution, a perspective complimentary to the most popular &#34;individual selection&#34; approach. Genes, not individual organisms, Dawkins argues, are the replicating entities, so they are the basic units of natural selection. This paradigm is employed to explain certain phenomena (like grandmother altruism, or other particular forms of &#34;altruism&#34; in general), that would be hard to explain from &#34;benefit of the individual&#34; paradigm.In one of the final chapters, Dawkins applies the same theory to the evolution of another kind of replicators, &#34;memes&#34; (or ideas), and points certain striking similarities.The book was not an eye opener (quite probably because it's been 30 years since its initial publication, and some of its ideas are much more widespread nowadays), but it was definitely worth reading.For me, the most value from reading the book came from various insights scattered across its pages. Learning about things like animal manipulation, parasites and their influence on hosts, benefits of altruism, game theory and evolutionary stable strategies was incredibly interesting and definitely expanded my perspective.I strongly recommend the book. Learning and understanding our evolutionary inclinations is the only way to gain control over them."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I just finished listening to the MP3 CD version for the second time. I'll probably do it another 1-2 times because there is so much information to take in. Richard Dawkins (RD from now on) does a simply amazing job of breaking things down into understandable terms; though with the complexity of the subject matter, multiple readings are still beneficial. I have a BS in biolgy so I had a fair ammount of knowledge going in as well as knowing most of the vocabulary. For those without this knowledge, it might take a bit longer but I don't believe will decrease your appreciation of this book.There is a reason that most people consider this his definitive work; RD touches on most of his explanations/theories for how he sees the world. His other books, which I'm in the process of reading/acquiring seem to expand further the thoughts of this one. This is not a \\"believe in my opinion or you're stupid\\" book. It's a carefully laid out and organized group of observations/evidence that allows the reader to make up her mind. Whether you are an atheist, or a creationist, this is an absolute must read (I do acknowledge I'm roughly 30 years late to the party on this one). For atheists, it gives explanations for how things can develop (morality included) without a divine creator. For creationists, it hits on the major aguments against ID so if a creationist wants to be taken seriously, she would have to be able to at least refute RD's theories.One thing no one can say about RD is that he doesn't think things through to the best of his ability (which is considerable).SR"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I bought this book yesterday and started to read it from cover to cover.

Dawkins very carefully reviews the data that supports his thesis and discusses alternate viewpoints. He is also very clear when he is giving his opinion versus stating fact. Dawkins did not write in an interesting or fun fashion and my interest was largely driven by the content, in other word this was a highly intelligent book that was somewhat arduous to read. I cannot recommend this book for the general reader. For these readers I strongly recommend Dawkins's The Greatest Show on Earth."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Selfish Genes = Altruistic phenotypes?Many people who have never read the book (and strangely a few who apparently have) misunderstand the phrase 'Selfish Gene' to mean a gene that causes people to be selfish. Actually, the selfishness referred to a (metaphoric) quality of genes themselves, selfishly causing their own survival and replication.Ironically, as Dawkins discusses, the selfishness of the gene can actually result in altruism at the level of the organism or phenotype. This is because, where altruism is directed towards kin, this can aid the replication of genes shared through common descent among relatives.Nevertheless, Dawkins clearly sees organisms as fundamentally selfish - albeit a selfishness tempered by a large dose of nepotism. To some extent he mitigates this view in more recent ('extended') editions (those published since 1989 ten years after the publication of the original) by the addition of a further chapter on reciprocal altruism (Chapter 12: 'Nice guys finish first') a subject he had already dealt with less extensively in chapter 10 ('You scratch my back, I'll ride on yours'). In this additional chapter, he essentially summarises the work of Axelrod (The Evolution of Cooperation: Revised Edition).This additional chapter, along with Chapter 13 ('The long reach of the gene' which summarises Dawkins' ownThe Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (Popular Science)), though interesting in their own right, unfortunately, tagged on the end, interrupt the flow and conclusion of the work. The book probably works best, in a literary sense at least, in its original form.The 'Genes-Eye-View'Dawkins takes the so-called 'genes-eye-view' of evolution to its logical conclusion. To this extent, contrary to accepted opinion, Dawkins' work is not only a popularisation but actually breaks new ground theoretically.Maynard Smith (1964) talked of kin selection by analogy with group selection. Even William Hamilton (1964) talked largely of the direct, indirect and inclusive fitness of organisms. Dawkins, however, takes this line of thinking to its logical conclusion and looks not at the fitness or reproductive success of organisms - but the replication of genes themselves.Though he stridently rejects group-selectionism, he replaces this, not with the familiar individual selection of classical Darwinism, but rather with a focus on selection at the level of the gene itself.Humans, Memes and Escaping the Tyranny of Selfish ReplicatorsAlthough much of the interest (and no little of the controversy) in this work flowed from its potential application to human behaviour, humans (a \\"rather aberrant species\\" in which Dawkins professes to be \\"not really very directly interested in\\": Dawkins 1981 at p556) are actually mentioned only rarely. Indeed, most of the discussion is theoretical, actual animal behaviour is described only for illustrative purposes, and even these illustrative examples often involve simplified hypothetical creatures (e.g. 'hawks' and 'doves') rather than real organisms.Where he does mention humans, it is often to point out the extent to which this species apparently fails to confirm to Darwinian predictions. For example, at the end of his chapter on sexual selection (Chapter 9: Battle of the Sexes) he observes that, among humans, it is women who seemed more concerned with what he terms 'sexual advertising' (p164-5). (An explanation for this may be that, among humans, male-male competition has historically taken the form of intra-sexual selection rather than inter-sexual selection, i.e. male-male contests (fighting) rather than female choice: Puts 2010.)Chapter 11 ('Memes: the new replicators') - what was, in the original version, the final chapter - also focuses especially on humans. To a large extent this focuses again on the extent to which humans are an \\"aberrant species\\", being subject to cultural as well as biological evolution to a unique degree.However, Dawkins also claims that the principles of natural selection discussed in the rest of the book may apply to cultural evolution as much as to biological evolution and, in doing so, coins the concept of the meme as the cultural equivalent of a gene, passing between minds analogously to a virus (seeThe Meme Machine (Popular Science);Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme;The Selfish Meme: A Critical Reassessment; andDarwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Sciencefor more recent discussions of the concept).While certainly interesting, I doubt memetics will ever be a serious science. One of the main factors governing the infectiousness of a given meme, is the extent to which the human mind is receptive to it and the human mind is itself a product of biological evolution. The key to understanding human behaviour, even cultural behaviour, is therefore how natural selection has shaped the human mind - in other words evolutionary psychology not memetics (Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the Mind (4th Edition)).Finally, Dawkins ends on an optimistic literary flourish, again emphasising the supposed uniqueness of humankind, claiming that \\"we, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators\\" (p201). Unfortunately, this ignores the fact that the \\"we\\" who are supposed to be rebelling (including our \\"conscious foresight\\" in which Dawkins places such faith) are ourselves a product of the same process of natural selection and of the same selfish replicators. Even the (alleged) desire to revolt must be a product of the same process.The problem with Dawkins' cop-out Hollywood-ending conclusion is therefore, as anthropologist Vincent Sarich is said to have observed, that Dawkins himself has \\"spent 214 pages telling us why that cannot be true\\" (seeStraw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals). The preceding 214 pages, however, remain an exciting, eye-opening and stimulating intellectual journey, even thirty years after their original publication.Dawkins R (1981) 'In defence of selfish genes' Philosophy, Vol. 56, No. 218.

It explained how species succeed under Darwinian evolution. But it doesn't apply to modern man! We are dying out. You can attribute it to \\"The Unselfish Gene\\" or more aptly \\"The Selfish Phenotype.\\"Richard Dawkins theorizes that evolution is a matter of genes passing themselves on. The phenotypes - the animals and plants that we see, like us, are irrelevant except to the extent that they are successful in propagating their genes. There is ample evidence in the animal world that the individual doesn't matter. The black widow spider eats her mate after mating. Salmon swim upstream and die after leaving and fertilizing their eggs.Among human beings, however, the phenotype is all that matters any more. We are vastly more concerned with living people than with future generations. Educated, intelligent people are especially indifferent to passing on their own genes.Humankind long ago overcame predators and disease. Other tribes are our most significant competition. Human societies excel at outbreeding and killing off rival societies. Over history those Homo sapiens cultures that did not go extinct had to evolve continually to maintain their competitiveness. Since the Renaissance, European cultures have dominated in the realm of ideas, and not done too badly in population, while the Asian cultures have dominated in sheer numbers of people.Altruism was essential in building large societies. Orientals and northern Europeans especially evolved to look out for others in the tribe. To empathize with them. These tribes coalesced into nations with a high level of trust, and low levels of crime. Intelligence was a necessary ingredient. People had to understand that helping others was in their own long term interest - or rather, that of their genes.Culture spread like peacock feathers once people started living in large groups. Individuals could prosper exploiting talents like management, bookkeeping, singing and acting... anything to set oneself apart from ordinary farmers and yeomen. Of course the pretty girls liked this kind of talent, and women developed their own flirtatious wiles to catch the most attractive guys. Anybody who could do so formed himself into a distinctive individual, if possible an intellectual. A philosopher.Europeans incorporated various degrees of altruism into their philosophy. Rousseau was a wild optimist, Locke and Burke less so. They had a sense that Europe had a better model for living than the rest of the world, and by persuasion or conquest they were going to share it. Western culture reached most of the rest of the world through Christianity, the military and business. We called it the \\"mission civilitrice\\" or \\"white man's burden.\\" We might've been wrong but we were never in doubt. We promiscuously spread our culture, believing that everybody else would benefit from it whether or not they asked for or wanted it.We convinced ourselves that the whole world was one people; that mankind had transcended tribalism. We were kidding ourselves, of course. The rest of the world didn't comprehend why we would believe that, and didn't trust our motives. Did we fight in Vietnam or Iraq for the benefit of those people? C'mon, get serious. Even our supposed allies thought it was all about oil - even though Vietnam didn't have any.Western societies have been swept up in altruistic movements for the last century. Workers of the world, unite! Civil rights! Ban the bomb! End overpopulation! Save the whales! Save the environment! End global warming! Ban genetically modified organisms! Ethical treatment for animals! Adherents support these causes with the evangelical zeal with which their ancestors embraced Christianity. Also, a cynic would add, the same unexamined faith.Like the Christian crusaders of 1000 years ago, we are generous in sharing our convictions with the rest of the world. They in turn look at us much the way they looked at Christians. Weirdoes, but rich weirdoes, good for a handout if you pretend to agree with them. African strongmen, for instance, take a European stand on GMOs because they benefit from European aid. Whether or not GMOs would benefit the people is hardly considered.Westerners are smug about having exchanged a belief in cloudy religious myths which emerged 4000 years ago from the Levantine desert for the grab bag of above-named modern cloudy myths. Our new myths offer a balm for the soul as we pursue our sensual and material delights: Jacuzzis, gourmet foods, huge homes and cars, and so on. Just as we moderns delight in pointing out the obvious contradictions inherent in Christianity, we are marvelously blind to the contradictions in our own belief systems, such as between saving the whales and taking cruise vacations.In this seminal \\"Selfish Gene\\" Dawkins introduced the idea of a meme, an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Religion is clearly a meme. Dawkins, a stout athiest, rails against it constantly. However, all the other above-named cultural detritus is nothing more than memes. We are in the thrall of the half-baked products of our own fantasies and hubris.Our brains and altruism have gotten us ahead of evolution. We believe that having children imposes an almost immoral burden on the Earth's resources, and self-indulgence memes seduce us into spending whatever energy we might have invested in children in satisfying an ephemeral, artificially induced drive for consumption. Nobody needs a Toyota Tundra or an Apple iPad, but some eerie compulsion drives us into their showrooms. We indulge our lhasa apsos instead of our children.For us, the selfish gene is a thing of the past. It has been replaced by the selfish meme. Memes, however, can only infect other minds, and with fewer births there are fewer hosts. The genius of religious memes is that they reproduce both bodies and minds. Evolution would predict that selfish memes eventually die out. The nature of the religious memes which will survive, those which drive people to procreate, is an interesting speculation. I'm sure it would drive Dawkins crazy."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"It is hard to imagine anyone being more capable of proffering a point of view and being absolutely convincing in the process.

I think Dawkins would be the first to admit that many of the ideas presented here are \\"speculative.\\" Despite that, however, the point is that this book stimulates thinking in a powerful way, and that's why this book is rightly considered one of the best popular science books of all time. Dawkins has an outstanding ability to write so that lay readers can grasp his arguments. Dawkins also has the ability (which is very much evident in this book) of inspiring readers with respect to the joy of scientific inquiry, very much, in my view, like Carl Sagan before him.I highly recommend this book.Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Professor Dawkins's book on evolution is geared to the non-scientist and presents evolution, and the underlying idea that it is the gene that is surviving not the organism, in clear, understandable and interesting language.

Many people will not like it because it requires a lot of thinking, but I definitely enjoyed it. It completely changed the way I think about a lot of things that happen as far as how we deal with the world around us.I actually found this book due to one of the Enron founders stating that it was one of their motivations to succeed, and I wanted to see what they saw in this book. I will say that this is one of those moments where an expectation of something bad turned into something extremely good. I loved what I got from this book, and I think you will too.Enjoy, relax, and learn everything you can from this book. You will get a lot out of it.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Wow. When I finished this book, I did something I had never done before: I read the same book again. The second time through, I underlined things and scribbled thoughts on the inside covers and in the margins and wrote emails to friends about questions forming in my mind. After that second pass, I bought and read Dawkins's \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" and \\"The God Delusion\\" and watched his TED video and several other videos of his on YouTube. \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\" and \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" are on my to-do list. I am quite impressed with this guy.\\"The Selfish Gene\\" is my clear favorite of his books so far, and quite possibly my favorite read of all time. I thought I already knew a lot about evolution, but this book refined my understanding substantially. And Dawkins has a gift for writing, an ability to take a subject that in the wrong hands could be quite dry and make it very interesting.Now for some qualifications. First, if you don't already have a reasonable understanding of evolution and the process of natural selection, you should probably get that somewhere else before starting this book. Carl Zimmer's \\"Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea\\" and the accompanying PBS video (which I think you can see at pbs.org) are an approachable choice.Second, this is not light reading. It's readable, but there is a lot going on in these almost 400 pages, and you should expect to spend some time thinking about what he is saying. This is not a book to skim.Finally, if for whatever reason you have trouble accepting the idea of evolution by natural selection, then there is probably little point in reading this book.In this 30th anniversary edition, Dawkins has 66 pages of endnotes which make very interesting reading. Rather than change the original text in subsequent editions, he commented on it in the endnotes. At times he explains why he said something the way he did, or shares findings that have emerged since he wrote the book. In some cases he talks about the flak he got for saying what he did. And in a few cases he admits that he didn't say something in the best way. I found the updates and self-reflection in the endnotes quite enjoyable.If you haven't already read this book (at least once :^), please do!"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"If you want to learn about evolution, this is the first book you should read.

Williams said that \`natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of unending arms races, slaughter and suffering. Its immorality has to be accepted and, at least, to be thought about'. R. Dawkins did think about it. His provocative scientific analysis changed (should change) our vision on mankind. In superb endnotes he puts some points on the i's of former editions.GenesIn a Darwinian world without design or purpose the fundamental unit of selection is the gene (a portion of chromosome material). The predominant quality of a successful and potentially immortal gene is ruthless selfishness.Replicators and VehiclesGenes compose replicators and use discrete vehicles (organisms with specializing cells) for the propagation of their replicators. The qualities of a good replicator are longevity, fecundity and copying fidelity. The master-replicator is DNA. It supervises the manufacture of proteins, which in turn control chemical processes in the cell. A particular gene is all the replicas of a particular portion of DNA distributed throughout the world.Individual bodies (organisms), not species, are the sole vehicles in the evolutionary process. The essential quality of an effective gene vehicle is the possession of an impartial exit channel into the future for all genes inside it (fertilized egg). Genes exert ultimate power over the vehicles through the nervous system and use the vehicle's brain as executive (in a completely unconscious manner).Gene differences emerge only in the phenotypic effects on bodies and the world.Gene pools, altruism and battlesGenes live in gene pools, evolutionary stable sets of genes, which are only occasionally invaded by a new gene (= evolution).Kin altruism, like parental care, can be explained by the fact that close relatives have a greater than average chance of sharing genes. Reciprocal altruism is a win-win solution for all gene participants. In their struggle for domination (survival) genes generate unconscious amoral behaviour in generation and gender conflicts (of interest).MemesIn the soup of human culture the meme is the unit of (un)successful imitation, the new (cultural) replicator.Memes and genes can reinforce each other, but can also be staunch enemies.Very serious warningEven if we assume that individuals are fundamentally selfish, their conscious foresight could (should) save us from the worst excesses of the blind replicators. One of these excesses is a demographic explosion. It the population growth continues at the actual rate, the world is not so far away from the point where its human population, jacked in standing position, will form a solid human carpet all over our planet.In a clear, easily understandable vocabulary with brilliant metaphors (book, boat, (non)zero sum games, gambling, dilemmas), Richard Dawkins simply destroyed scientifically the utmost selfish Right and Left Moral Majority, wherefore eternal thanks.N.B.

I can understand why--the prose is lucid, the ideas are presented in uncomplicated ways, and Dawkins panders to the reader's ego. However, there are major problems with the ways he presents information. While Dawkins gives an accurate description of evolutionary biology and comes up with the stellar idea of memes, the rest of the book is speculative and poorly-researched. Dawkins relies on pre-set ideas and notions that the reader(and Dawkins himself) might have to present difficult ideas. Some points of contention: Dawkins' ideas of women and men, Dawkins' ideas of animals, Dawkins presenting genes as 'selfish' and then believing that a short forward will help correct the misinformation, Dawkins' personal and dogmatic ideas that have no scientific backing whatsoever.This book should really be presented as Aristotle is: history preserved, a stepping stone to the path of truth."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Nothing new - freely taken from George C.

The 30th anniversary edition has more updates and there is a last chapter motivating the reader towards another book called \\"The Extended Phenotype\\" by the same author. This book is very famous over past four decades for its support of evolution theory and how the fundamental replicator called gene supports it. Reading this book is a great experience only to those readers who are supportive of Darwin's evolution theory. Others might disagree and pose more questions on the validity of few tall claims made in the book. As a person who generally supports evolution, I was able to relate most of the contents in this book.There is always a conflict among people regarding the natural tendency of living organisms - selfishness Vs altruism. Though most people believe that altruism is the inherent nature of living beings, the evolution theory by Darwin suggests otherwise. The altruism nature of living beings is supported and propagated by scientists having faith on group selection. Starting from the origin of life, Dawkins argues that every activity of living beings is towards selfishness. The selfish nature of living beings is essential for their survival and replication of their genes according to Dawkins. He illustrates them using examples such as how cuckoo kids destroy other unhatched eggs to get more share of food from their mothers.Dawkins exposes the readers to a primeval soup consisting of replicators to start with. These replicators are selfish by nature as they would want to make identical copies of themselves. Dawkins extends the theory of replicators to more general concept of gene/DNA present in the every living cell of a plant or an animal. Through various illustrations, Dawkins proves that the selfish nature of the gene is inherited even by the body (vehicle) of the living being which is built using them. Most of the examples given in the book are at the behavioral level of organisms and the group selection strategies are vehemently opposed by sufficient counter examples.Dawkins considers why the propagation of their own genes is the primary motivation behind the reproduction. The living beings who fail to do this will go extinct over time as natural selection only favors selfish genes. Basically, Dawkins strives to answer the following questions. How does selfish gene theory account for individual behaviors like aggression, sex, and spreading? How does even symbiotic relationship between two species is still in agreement with selfish gene theory? Why is the balance of sex ratio (male-female) almost the same even though the females put more effort in spreading of selfish genes? What are the ways in which a female selects her male partners for efficient propagation of genes? How come tit-for-tat the best strategy among a group of competing species?To explain the difference between human beings and other living entities, Dawkins introduces a new term called meme as the basic replicator of culture. Memes are responsible for carrying the cultural aspects from one human to his/her followers and successors. Memes are the very means used by spiritual gurus to train their disciples into believing in certain ideologies about God. Memes can also exploited as a means to inculcate altruism among a group of humans and thereby reduce the effects of selfish genes. However, people generally use memes to impose their own beliefs on others without ever caring about the altruistic benefits that can be achieved by the spread of benign memes. In short, Dawkins claims meme may bring altruism into the genes depending on how that meme evolved from a culture.The summary of the book is that as the genes are selfish, the nature all living entities of the world is inherently selfish. One has to teach altruism in humans by other means called memes for efficient functioning of the world. I found this book very knowledgeable and well illustrated. However, I felt Dawkins spends most of the time poking fun at other theories such as group selection which seems a bit digressing and annoying. Dawkins seems to be not that open minded as a popular science writer which may be due to his own selfish gene not having evolved that altruistic because of his memes.The first person ('I') narration in this book does not help in his cause either in inspiring the reader. Dawkins may be a great researcher and supporter of evolution theory. But as a writer of popular science, his arrogant tone makes him fall way behind other eminent writers such as Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, George Gamow, and Simon Singh. Very daring statements made by writers such as Dawkins, though their spread of rational scientific cause is unquestionable, stand the risk of turning off layman's interest towards science. In spite of all these ethical issues regarding the tone of the book, I recommend this book with some reservation as it contains a treasure of novel perspectives on evolution theory. The reader is fed with a lot of interesting insights about his own existence in this world.P.S.: I am not planning to read any of the other books of Richard Dawkins. There are better popular science and math writers such as Carl Sagan, Bill Bryson, Simon Singh, George Gamow, Richard Feynman, John Derbyshire, James Gleick, ET Bell, etc. These writers indeed inspire you on every page of their books instead of being too rude and preachy."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins warns his readers that his language, where it constantly may appear to hold \`subjective' or \`moral' or teleological content, does not really--in fact it is argued to hold no real connotations beyond that of figuratively describing \`programmed machines.' He says, \\"it is convenient for me to use the language of purpose as a metaphor in explaining the behaviour of survival machines.\\" All of biology answers finally, and ultimately, to \\"the \`gold-standard' of evolution, gene survival.\\" When he conjures \\"units of detriment\\" and \\"a generalized altruism investment measure,\\" he qualifies his own language as being less than ideal because it over emphasizes non-genetic influences. \\"In many respects, however, this is just a quibble,\\" he goes on to say, and such descriptions may be \\"well worth using in practice.\\" It cannot go unnoticed that Dawkins fills pages with this fancy philological footwork--indeed he must if he has any hope of deflecting the otherwise all too obvious inevitability that he is contradicting himself. \\"Investing\\" in new generations, \\"life insurance risks\\", etc--these terms are just metaphors, all that's really going on is gene selfishness, which, by the way, isn't really gene \\"selfishness,\\" of course! But, practically speaking, it really is!Any line of argument that has such a difficult time hiding from itself, and must invoke such all-encompassing effusiveness in an attempt to do so, should invite much more skepticism than this storied storybook has inspired in many supposedly \\"scientific\\" sectors! Several well regarded philosophers of science have forcefully rebutted Dawkins, the most enjoyable to read perhaps being the late David Stove, who observed, \\"If the question were asked, then, whether Dawkins really believes that genes are selfish in the ordinary sense, the answer best supported by the text of [The Selfish Gene] would be: \\"of course he doesn't; yes he does.\\" Another philosopher (M. Midgley) has noted that Dawkins presents \\"the useful art of open, manly self-contradiction.\\"This ubiquitous slipperiness is not the only problem here. We are also given the \`problem' of altruism (which, of course, cannot really be altruism). In the first chapter, Dawkins pleads, \\"Let us try to teach generosity and altruism . . . Let us understand what our own selfish genes are up to, because we may then at least have the chance to upset their designs . . .\\" He goes on to reiterate this later. In Dawkins hands, there is nothing but nonsense at play here. He has already stated that \\"the gene's law of universal ruthlessness\\" may be \\"very nasty,\\" but this \\"does not stop it being true.\\" He invokes \\"generosity and altruism\\"--which \\"the \`gold standard' of evolution\\" demands cannot really be \\"generosity and altruism,\\" he speaks of genes' \\"selfish\\" \\"designs\\"--which he will tell us aren't really \\"selfish\\" or maybe even \\"designs,\\" but he does two things that are even weirder. He suggests that what he sees as THE ultimate hard and true \`law' of biology can be set aside if we sufficiently will to do so (ultra-Darwinian \`selfishness' is absolutely true and constant unless we don't want it to be--something that hardly fits with his own arguments!), and, he suggests that organisms (\\"survival machines\\"), namely \\"us\\", who do not actually possess \\"generosity and altruism\\" are to (in our somehow Enlightened position?) \\"teach\\" these mythological qualities to others--who cannot, per the \\"very nasty\\" gene's \\"selfishness,\\" actually receive these pedantic gifts! How is any of this reconciled to Dawkins' core doctrine that, \\"There is really only one entity whose point of view matters in evolution, and that entity is the selfish gene\\" (Dawkins' inevitable winner is NOT our desire to make pretend \\"altruism\\" become genuine altruism!)? He is spitting into the wind. And who can constitute this \\"us\\" of Dawkins', that is to ask, who can impart something that he has been precluded from actually possessing, to another (who, incidentally, is also precluded by \`law' from actually receiving it!)? And what IS this external standard that presumes to identify our putative \`gold standard' as being \\"nasty\\"? Explain \\"nasty\\" without contradicting yourself, Dr Dawkins! Presumably his answer will be that \\"nasty\\" isn't really \\"nasty\\"! The real problem for Dawkins and the sociobiologists is a theory that must insist that altruism and generosity are \\"problems\\". A theory that defines an Albert Schweitzer or a Mother Teresa or a Florence Nightingale as \\"problems\\" to be \`explained away' by appeal to a convoluted canon of infallible doctrine, is self-evidently silly--is, in fact, silly in the exact same sense as variously maligned religious nonsense. Whatever capital the \`selfish theorist' might believe he gains over the theist by invoking a \\"problem of evil,\\" he will soon enough find that he will have to more than repay given the awkward burden of his own \\"problem of goodness.\\" (While one can certainly argue as to whether it is adequate or not, the theist's \\"problem of evil\\" is inherently addressed, and perhaps answered in part, by admitting to any significant degree of freedom [of the will and/or of quantum 'openness'], which is obviously why Dawkins, in his assumed role as atheistic \\"chaplain,\\" has so frequently stated that he is \\"not interested\\" in \`free will'. One wonders if he (a), believes he freely chooses this disinterest, or whether (b), his genes \\"selfishly\\" dictate it! As compared to the possible concomitant implications of freedom, the Dawkins/sociobiology problem of \\"altruism\\" has no similarly logical mitigation, all that is available to IT is the dogmatic demand that \\"altruism\\" MUST be a manipulative expression of selfishness--by mere \`reason' of doctrine alone!)Dawkins may be the most famous living biologist, a kind of \`rock star' we might say, but his fame traces only to a popularizer's pen, he hasn't \\"discovered\\" anything biological--except, some of his myriad fans may counter, \\"memes\\", which he has named and identified as cultural \`units of imitation'. The sociobiologists seem to have been greatly impressed. Less indoctrinated and more disciplined and skeptical minds have not. Some excellent philosophers have had great sport with the meme \\"theory\\". Memes are said to be ideas that \\"propagate themselves.\\" Yes, themSELVES. They \\"should be regarded as living structures, not just metaphorically but technically.\\" They \\"literally parasitize\\" other brains by means of \\"infective power\\". This may be an interestingly artful package of language for describing the spreading of ideas, but does choosing this artful story and package of language constitute biological \\"science\\"? Good grief. If it does, almost anything might! Well, if a man is \\"taught Pythagoras's Theorem at school, his brain has been parasitized by a certain micro-maggot which, 2,600 years earlier, had parasitized the brain of Pythagoras,\\" says Stove mockingly. \\"And if a man already believes that genes are selfish, why also should he not believe that prime numbers are sex mad, or that geometrical theorems are brain parasites?\\"Well, enough of memes, they have gotten more attention than they merit. Although the difficulties for The Selfish Gene are easily recognized by anyone whose brain hasn't been \\"parasitized\\" by Dawkins, EO Wilson, and the sociobiologists generally, the books seminal logical flaw of logical flaws is Dawkins' mythic \`selfish gene' itself. There is a stunning (and strictly human) vanity to the proposal that there is an \\"advantage\\" to an individual organism that is provided by means of replication/ reproduction. Sure, my progeny -might- look after me in my old age, but let's face it, this motivation would hardly fit comfortably into the \\"selfish theory\\"! In case anyone has come up with a logically consistent explanation as to how replication can be an \\"advantage\\" to the parent organism (or gene), skeptical and analytical minds would like to hear it. I certainly haven't. But there is a conspicuously large space for vanity in the \\"selfish theory.\\" If I assume the role of a \`selfish theorist' I can happily tell you that the genealogical studies of my daughter have revealed a family tree containing some \`impressive' personages. For example, Beli Mawr, a Celtic king said to have been a god in pre-Roman Britain, turns out to be one of my ancestors. The obvious question of any clear-headed skeptic is this--what \\"benefit\\" or \\"advantage\\" does my existence confer upon my \`god' father, Beli Mawr (or any other ancestor)? At this point, I may puff out my chest and say something like, \\"well, just look at me--how can you not see it!\\" As if my existence does in fact confer something upon him of individual, even \\"selfish,\\" benefit! How Dawkins and EO Wilson have blessed their ancestors (actually reaching back and providing them a \\"benefit\\" or even an \\"advantage\\")! Well, selfish theorists, unless you've got something a lot more impressive than that, I'm afraid you just look silly. As Stove has written, \\"in reading Dr. Dawkins I have often formed the impression that (in Wittgenstein's phrase) a certain picture holds him captive. A picture, namely, of an exceptionally vain author, or parent, or photographer, who delights in surrounding himself with his own writings, or children, or self-portraits. But genes (it can hardly be necessary to say) can no more be vain than they can be selfish. They cannot delight in the number of replicas that they make of themselves. They are not even intelligent enough, after all, to know when they have made a replica of themselves.\\"At this point, the Dawkins/ultra-Darwinian faithful will be anxious to argue that I've missed the simple elegance of the \\"selfish theory\\" by understanding \\"selfish\\" to actually mean selfish; and will want to tell me, as has Dawkins, about how genes and organisms are blessed by Natural Selection to the extent that they are \`replicating machines.' But this is only a tautology, after all. Organisms more likely to survive and reproduce will probably prove to be more likely to have survived and have reproduced. Obviously yes, this is a true, important and relevant observation, but what has been \`explained?' It is argued that a successful replicating machine produces as many \\"copies,\\" or offspring, as it can. But do you know anyone who has had as many offspring as they CAN? Do you suppose that anyone ever has? If you don't think it's fair to use humans as an example here (Stove tears down this objection), then look at other examples in nature. The very large order Hymenoptera (roughly 18,000 species) includes many groups [of ants or bees] in which exceedingly few individuals reproduce; but Dawkins likes to point to dogs (Canidae) when he thinks they help him make his point (chapter 2 of The Blind Watchmaker, for example), so let's do that here. To a certain rather large extent, wolves (Canis lupus) live (hunt, eat, rear young, grow old, etc) in groups in which only the so-called \`alpha' male and \`alpha' female will reproduce with any regularity, while many, if not most, of the individuals in these packs will infrequently, rarely, or never reproduce (although they will devotedly help protect and feed the offspring of the \\"alpha\\" animals). At this point I suppose it is again necessary to appeal to \\"altruism\\" that isn't really altruism, or some other contorted excuse of the sociobiologists. And why not--theirs is a \`theory' that, at least when given sufficient hindsight, must \\"explain\\" and \\"predict\\" EVERYTHING biological, even those \`problems' that it obviously neither explains nor predicts! An obvious variation of Dawkins' (ultra-Darwinism's) \\"prediction\\" tawdriness is as follows: A baby bird screaming louder may prompt its parents to feed it more, which would obviously bestow a positive \`selection value' on loud screaming; on the other hand, loud screaming uses up energy that a hungry chick may already be deficient in, and, it is more likely to attract predators, both of which would bestow a negative \`selection value' on loud screaming. So the simple logic that tells us that \`survival benefits' are always naturally selected while the opposite are always culled away, manages to easily predict that loud screaming is something that will be genetically rewarded (i.e., selected), AND that loud screaming is something that natural selection will slice away. All we have to do to determine which conflicting \\"prediction\\" to hold to, is to determine *at some later time* whether the screamer population is robust or has become extinct, and viola!, we will know which of our contradictory \\"predictions\\" we then observe to be \`true'! Karl Popper must be \`turning over in his grave!' A \\"theory\\" that can predict anything and everything actually predicts nothing (in physics, this is also the current dilemma of the \\"M-theory\\"/\\"brane-world\\" ideas, which, it is becoming increasingly apparent, will have to retreat from the optimistic status of physical \`theory' and admit they are only \`somewhat interesting ideas' or \`non-testable conjectures,' since they inevitably \\"predict\\" anything and everything, they actually predict nothing). Asking an ultra-Darwinist/sociobiologist to define a means of falsifying his \`theory' has been likened, by one philosopher, to \\"talking to a log.\\"How can such a poorly argued book have been such a smash hit? Some philosophers, i.e., R. Kimball, have offered interesting answers that speak more to psychology and perhaps the blinders of \\"group think\\" than to scientific method or critical rigor or logical coherence. \\"The devil made me do it,\\" said Flip Wilson. \\"God made me do it,\\" says the Calvinist. \\"It's the aliens from space,\\" says the UFO abductees enthusiast. \\"It's the evil spirits,\\" says the demonologist. \\"It's \`the stars',\\" says the astrologist. \\"It's a shadow,\\" or \\"it's the bad blood,\\" say the shamanist and the occultist. \`Scientific' types presume to look down their noses at such things of course. But do they? It seems that certain popular forms of biological reductionism need puppetry too. Dawkins entered a market yearning for a would-be \\"scientific\\" puppet master and supplied the 'fix'. He has artfully tapped the supposedly more sophisticated \\"puppetry theory\\" audience. \\"It's the \`selfish gene', yah, that's what it is.\\" And the audience raucously screamed \\"Hooray!\\""},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"When Einstein formulated his Relativity theory, he proposed some postulates, one of them being that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. If that postulate is wrong, then most of his theory, if not all, will have to be reconsidered. It looks like Dawkins has done the same thing for evolutionism. His postulate: Genes somehow have a very strong influence on behavior. He goes as far to say that an altruistic person is being altruistic because his genes want to persist / replicate / whatever. So a \\"survival machine\\" would sacrifice itself for other similar \\"robots\\" with the same genes. Well, it is a fact that there are selfish people in the world. Did they choose to be selfish OR do they have some kind of gene combination that makes them selfish? It is also a fact that there are racist people in the world. Are they just favoring their genes so that racism would be a natural behavior? Is it \\"natural\\" according to Dawkins theory to be altruistic and racist?I am just examining Dawkins' postulate with the same humble freedom that scientists are questioning Einstein's postulate as I write this by trying to detect faster-than-light particles at the CERN accelerator. I am hoping that my faster-than-light particle equivalent for Dawkins' theory is something much easier to detect: free-will.So if free-will is a falacy, if human behavior is very strongly determined by genes, then Dawkins is probably right and morality is pointless. I think he is not, so I would like to see more tests against his postulate. This is after all science and not faith. (If you don't like my comment, say why in the comments. I don't mind being convinced I am wrong)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"As a trained philosopher of science, I read the book owing to the recommendation of a friend working on biology and my own interests in updating my knowledge on theories of gene and evolutions.Dr. Dawkins has a compelling and persuasive style of writing that makes his book enjoyable to read. But his arguments are not always as tight as they appear to be. I find too many questions and problems with this book and can only bring out some essential ones here.First and foremost, it is not clear that what he describe as \\"selfishness\\" can be regarded and treated as \\"biological\\" features like the long"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A silly idea or a dangerous delusionAnalysis of Dawkins's The Selfish GeneThe preface says \\"This book should be read almost as though it were science fiction.\\" I disagree. The book should not be read at all, as it has no factual or educational value. Or it should be read as pure fiction, as it is not scientific. It is strange that it was published at all.Dawkins starts with some sort of epiphany, that we humans are not the actual organisms that we are, but merely survival machines for the \`selfish molecules known as genes'. The preface reads like student's notes, by someone who did not quite get the lecture.The first chapter (with pompous title \\"Why are people?\\") is just as silly as the preface. I found myself disagreeing with every assertion. Let's take the first sentence. \\"Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence.\\" What? 1) Life is not a singular term; it is a collective noun for a myriad of living systems, complex themselves. 2) Knowing that life can exist in a myriad of complex forms, what does the metaphor \`comes of age' convey? That all of life forms singularly come of age, at certain defined point? Or that \`life' is a singular entity, somehow independent of forms within which it exists? 3) On \`a' planet? How would Dawkins know? Has he empirical grounds for such comparison? Has he ever witnessed \`life', as an entity, on a different planet? If not, why this generalisation? 4) Why would the entity within the organism figure out the reason for its own existence? I would have thought that it was the other way round - if \`life' is an entity that exists within us, shouldn't it be the organism that must figure out what exists within itself? (The existence already knows.) 5) The first sentence fails completely to establish the levels of analysis.The problem with communicating any sort of epiphany to others is that you cannot assume that their starting point is the same as yours. A scientific book would first try to establish the common grounds, the commonly agreed upon principles or facts, if they are to be challenged. It would not start with a personal view, and flimsy metaphors, then proceed with fairy tales. A scientific book would establish the levels of analysis, and explain the reason for proceeding in a certain manner. A popular scientific book would take time to explain to a lay person the basics of theoretical thinking, and why laying out levels of analysis is important. It would also stress importance of empirical evidence, and use of sources. The most difficult thing for a lay person is to figure out that the levels of analysis are confused, if they are, or if empirical evidence is used properly. Even academics, in my experience, tend to be attracted by trends, captivated by the rhetoric and ignorant of the epistemology.A number of reviewers state that the book is fascinating because Dawkins is such a good writer, and his prose is captivating. How can anyone flow with a prose that continually introduces semantically and syntactically fuzzy elements? I had to re-read that first sentence many times, in order to comprehend its meaning, and failed. I could not even establish a temporary interpretation of its intention, not even a quasi-meaning. I had to argue with nearly every sentence during the first paragraphs. That's anything but captivating. It makes one wonder if a lack of ability to interpret language makes people susceptible to manipulation. I've tried to read the book several times since 2002, and always gave up after the second chapter. Skimming through the rest, it was only more of the same. The empirical examples for animals came presumably from zoology; however empirical grounds for important discussion of kin were just hypothetical examples. Dawkins found it convenient to ignore a science that has amassed huge knowledge on kinship, namely anthropology. Author's ignorance of the variety of kinship's systems (and implicitly the variety of related behaviours) is not only rude or disrespectful; it also reveals his incompetence in writing about complex subjects. In the small tribal societies, from which the larger societies originated, the most important rule concerns who you are allowed to marry or not. Transfer of genes in small tribes is never a matter of free choice, but always a matter of avoiding genetic danger of too close marriages. Exercising choice - in order to preserve the perceived selfish qualities of a gene - is only possible in modern societies, where inbreeding is not an issue. It was humans, not genes, that dictated the rules of kinship, and Dawkins should know that. He is ignorant of his own ignorance - yet the lay readers do not know that, they are deceived.The mark of a good scientist is the ability to challenge his or her own perceptions. A good scientist will probe for truth, not popularity. A good scientist will ask others to do the same, i.e. challenge his perceptions or discoveries, so they together can come closer to truth. Richard Dawkins clearly wanted many people to believe in his epiphany, to take them on his discovery ride before he knew where he was going. Now that most of his ideas are proved wrong, he does not seem to be capable of admitting it. That says it all.What I particularly disliked about the book is that Dawkins asserts himself as a Darwin interpreter. How many of the reviewers have read Darwin's Origin of Species? Darwin's work shows all the marks of a true scientist. He has been studying the subject for decades, before he decided he would present his findings. He starts out with a long list of previous research, meticulously described, before he presents his own theory. Darwin is aware of the controversy he may create and the heretical standpoint he takes to his own beliefs; yet he does not present his theory to gain status, position or popularity. His sound research has convinced him, and he thinks it's his duty to convey truthfully what he has discovered.It saddens me to think that Darwin is now interpreted through Dawkins, as Darwin would probably have disagreed with Dawkins's unscientific methods and his jumping to foolish conclusions. To my knowledge, Richard Dawkins has not done any significant research, so his work can't be compared to Darwin's ever, on any level. Dawkins is an interpreter, and a poor one at that.If people are truly interested in the theory of evolution, they should read the original works, and find decent interpretations that help us understand the context. If readers are into our origins, a good contemporary author I can think of is Nick Lane, whose books on oxygen and mitochondria are extremely well researched and complied, brilliantly written and exciting. Having read his books, I can never think of a \`single' gene or a \`selfish gene'. The number of genes in a single cell and the complex rules for transfer of mitochondrial genes debunk that.The completion of the human genome project has rendered any notion of a single gene useless yet some authors (like Matt Ridley) continue to write as if genes were separate entities, rather than integrated in the functional wholes of cells. Another example of the single gene delusion is the questionably scientific genetic manipulation of genes in plants intended for human consumption. Experiments showed that single genes of different species would not transfer, but had to be forced. Experimental animals would not eat them; they had to be force fed, and most of them died, had malformed offspring or could not reproduce at all. What has GM got to do with the selfish gene theory? The fantasies of isolated genes have lead to the manipulative thinking and production of genetically modified organisms. The experiments (obscured to the mainstream) showed that in reality, most genes act as integrated networks; therefore their transfer can wreak havoc in organisms. Now that the danger is discovered, the experimenting itself can be traced back to such superficial theories of independent genes.Therefore, when Dawkins asks the reader to have faith in his fantasies, he is asking for a huge leap of faith. Rather than selfishness or altruism, when it comes to genes, I'd recommend the reader to think systems and function, organising hierarchies, and abstract communication. The idea of a \`selfish gene' is, depending on the context, a silly idea or a dangerous delusion."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins writes that \\"the argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes\\" (p.xxi) and that \\"We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes\\" (p.xxi). Yet, according to him, this book \\"is not science fiction; it is science\\" (p.xxi)!Dawkins contrives to overlook the twin discoveries that:1. the observable traits of organisms are mostly conditioned by the interactions of many genes;2. most genes have multiple effects on many of these traits.Dawkins transfers characteristics with which he is familiar from human behaviour on the macro-level to the inanimate components, \\"genes\\", of which we are physically constructed. He then proceeds to argue that these impersonal entities, which he imagines to possess characteristically human traits, infallibly generate the same unpleasant traits in human behaviour on the macro-level. So he writes: \\"The gene is the basic unit of selfishness\\" (p.36).The absurdity is evident in that genes or other nonconscious entities cannot be either selfish or unselfish. They cannot \\"compete\\" against anything or \\"choose\\" anything.If Dawkins were right, what would be the point of declaring, as he does: \\"Let us try to *teach* generosity and altruism, because we are born selfish\\" (p.3)? For if we really were machines, as he believes, even these very concepts would be meaningless to us. And certainly his oratory could have no effect whatever on our actual behaviour.In fact genes do not force us to behave in any particular way. Neither can they possess the ability to direct or to comprehend all that is required to adopt a course of either heartless selfishness or heartfelt, sacrificial compassion.The arguments in this review have been challenged by the claim that Dawkins himself answers these charges. His claim is, in effect, that that \\"the evolution of behavioural reactions or patterns via natural selection\\" and \\"control by nonconscious mechanisms\\" are two vastly different ideas. Also it is said that Dawkins does not deny a freedom of choice as the very last lines in this book itself \\"celebrate the human ability to make choices that transcend genetic control and instinctive reactions.\\" So it is said that Dawkins \\"repeatedly draws clear distinctions\\" to prevent his readers from jumping to the conclusions expressed above.However, there is a vast difference between asserting that such distinctions exist and actually laying a solid theoretical foundation for such distinctions. To lay the kinds of foundations which Dawkins does and then to go on to insist that these foundations do not lead to their logical conclusion is nothing less than an act of faith on Dawkins' part. It certainly does not bestow any validity upon Dawkins alleged distinctions. The bottom line is that Dawkins' presuppositions simply do not lead logically to the sort of distinction which he asserts.Essentially this debate is an argument not about data, but about underlying assumptions. Here is a example of what I mean:ASSUMPTION: 1. \\"evolution is a fact\\";DATUM: 2. \\"human beings have consciousness\\";ASSUMPTION: 3. \\"therefore evolution is capable of generating consciousness\\".Once again, it is a case of \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" (as Dawkins would say).The major challenge to evolution's status as a 'hypothesis' is that it has no predictive value. Whereas Newton's account of planetary motion, for instance, enables us to make accurate predictions of the future 'behaviour' of the planets, the evolutionary paradigm does no such thing."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dr.Dawkins \\"meme\\" hypothesis which is centered on the \\"selfish gene\\" concept (and it has also over extended itself into the realm of philosophy, in its vagueness it borders in the pseudo-science) which lacks rigorous scientific foundation.Below you will find a better rigorous scientific Explanation.Called: Acetabulis ludum theoryby Dr.Et non Realis ,PhD in Nequam-biology (Instituti de Nequam Scientia)Abstract- Cell Biology in Evolution: an elaboration of Dr. Lynn Margulis Endosymbiosis theory.Co-option of cell mechanism, the locus here is the archetype Mitochondria as the Principal symbiogenic regulator agent, via reverse transcriptional mechanism.Primitive Mitochondria use a survivable strategy that is explained by using reverse transcription methods (DNA Insertion and deletions and altering gene viability for translational yield) elucidating the production of pseudogene and Repetitive DNA Sequences, also changing gene messaging (mRNA) on the translational protein cycle, altering the cell cytoplasm micro-environment to the advantage of the archetype mitochondria. A corollary of this process would also be modification of the Phenotypes through innovative protein production. This mechanism can explain saltation phenomenon exhibited by phylogenetic tree, and give the punctuated equilibrium theory viable Biochemical pathway (see Dr. N. Eldredge and Dr. S. Jay Gould).

This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.

That was also not written in the textbooks of Genetics. Lamarckism was frowned upon since Darwin and statements of the Bible that the sins of the fathers effect following generations ridiculed as myths. But now it seems to be scientific research, provided the news are correct.The first who succeeded in this ground-shaking understanding was the biologist Emma Whitelaw at the Queensland Institue fo Medical Research. The Israelite biologist Eva Jablonka said that the whole discourse about inheritance and evolution would change and that it meant the end of the \\"selfish Gene\\".Not long ago allegations that adaptation of an organism to the environment would pass over to the descendants was regarded as scientific heresy. They contradicted the ruling cognition of the evolution theory. It was said that accidental variations in the genetic material, so called mutations, supply the creatures with an advantage in the struggle for life.It seems that Dawkins fabricated a hotshot, which he should urgently revise. The air for evolutionist is getting more and more thin. They need another helping sub-theory, or two?The discoveries of the Epi-Geneticists are an example for a scientific truism, which is not well known to the public: scientific knowledge - here the evolution theory -is a preliminary knowledge. Whereby it is still the question whether the evolution theory is not just an ideology.The \\"It is proved!\\", stated quickly, does not always mean the truth! Dawkins premature ideas concerning the Selfish Gene is such a \\"wanna-be-knowledge\\", which proves as en error in the light of serious scientific approach. At once several evolutionary dogmas go down without a whimper, if accident is not the hit. Now we have data for a new explanation: Not the accident calls for variation in the genetic material, rather it is the designation! Designation comes from Design! More concrete: the free will of man, letting him do this or that, hence having effects on the body and right into the genetic material. And this seems to be the undeniable scientific found. These self-eveloping genes have their limits, of course, but it is apparent that man has more responsibility for himself and others than can be welcome by those who like to do what they want.The not very respectful assertion of Dawkins and his purporters that human genetic material is nothing more than the rather minor valuable rest of evolution falls somehow very un-gently back on them.

What about the arguments amongst evolutionists themselves - Darwinists, those who believe in punctuated equilibria, saltationists - they can't even agree among themselves, let alone convince the creationists or the growing intelligent design movement.

This idea is completely consistent with complete reductionism. In fact, reductionism necessitates determinism. How could it do otherwise? While it is true that quantum mechanics might create a narrow range of possibilities for the deterministic flow of particles, most biologists insist that much sub micro effects would have no real consequence, and at any rate, since such effects are completely random, they should cancel themselves out. So if reductionism is the correct model of the universe, then the entire flow of evolution was just as predetermined and unalterable as the path of a projectile. Since particulate motion is blind, it is absurd to suppose the Big Bang gave these particles just the exact motion necessary to eventually create mankind. Something had to have given these particles the precisely correct original motion and chemical properties to accomplish this. What we regard as \\"natural selection\\" was all in the original Intelligent Design. So while evolution is not in doubt, Reductionism without Intelligent Design makes no sense.

And it's not based on a hunch from an ancient philosopher but from a modern scientist conducting real scientific research."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In his play \\"Suddenly, Last Summer,\\" Tennessee Williams writes of a young man who, on vacation at the seashore, watches newly hatched baby turtles struggling down to the safety of the water. Only a small percentage get there, though, because the gulls overhead scoop them up and eat them faster than they can crawl. The young man, observing this and already under great psychic tension, tells his cousin that now \\"I have seen God!\\" Later on, we realize the man is morally insane, and that perhaps this was the turning point; his descent into insanity.Whether Williams himself thought of God the same way, I don't know. But certainly the example of the turtles and gulls had been chosen, out of thousands of other such biological observations, because the young man chose to find God - or truth - in it. He could, if he had been in a sunnier mood, chosen to look at nesting robins or a mare and her colt.In \\"The Selfish Gene,\\" Dr. Dawkins argues against the idea of altruism in nature: mothers take care of their young because they love them, etc. Dawkins says they do it because it's in their genes. But he takes it one step further: he says it's the genes themselves that are struggling to survive - not the whole animal. The analogy of genes \\"using\\" animal bodies for their own \\"selfish\\" ends, as if we were robots and the genes our drivers, is made over and over again.Of course, Dawkins realizes this is not correct. Darwinism asserts that biological life came into existence blindly: cells and animals came (and continue to come) into being, not because they chose to, but because of natural selection. And the ones who survive do so because of serendipity.This is a very hard concept, of course, to understand. I remember Sister Pauline laboring to explain to us girls in junior biology class that the white butterflies didn't decide to turn black; they turned black over generations, due to natural selection. She had a hard time of it. (Catholics are \\"allowed\\" to choose between a literal or analogous interpretation of the Bible, so she was not breaking any official rules!)In other words, a \\"selfish\\" gene (or animal) makes no more sense in Darwinistic terms than an \\"altruistic\\" one.Dawkins explicitly states this on page 196. But he uses the selfish gene analogy so many more times - hundreds of times - that, just from the sheer repetitiveness of the theme, it may sink in too deeply (and do some psychic damage) to people who are not currently living on the sunny side of the street, so to speak.For those people, like the gentleman who wrote the touching review of how this book contributed to fits of depression, I'd say: This point of view has no more legitimacy than the altrustic point of view.An additional (and, I think, unnecessary) weight on the sensitive reader's soul is the aspersions that Dr. Dawkins, an aggressive atheist, throws on the concept of God - limited mainly, I think, to his chapter on memes (he saves most of his vituperation on this issue for another book, \\"The God Delusion\\").On that score, I'd say: please realize that scientists don't know everything. People in different professions develop different mental prejudices: lawyers think like lawyers, engineers like engineers, etc. And scientists, for whom scientific method is everything, tend to think that anything that's not measurable therefore doesn't exist. This is a logical fallacy. They also tend to think they are so intelligent, and the world outside science is so simple, that they can read a few survey books on religion, philosophy, or history and know all there is to know about the field. This leads them to made irresponsible, blanket statements, completely unaware of how little they know.On page 201, he winds up a chapter by saying all is not gloomy; humans can still strive towards altruism; that \\"[w]e, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.\\" Then, in a long footnote, he writes that some of his colleagues disapproved of this passionate summation. \\"In some cases, the criticism came from doctrinaire sociobiologists jealously protective of genetic influence....\\" and in others, from \\"high priests of the left jealously protective of a favorite demonological icon!\\" (His exclamation point.) These latter, apparently, were objecting that he on the one hand implied a belief in free will while on the other hand talking like a genetic determinist. He objects to this, saying, if I understand it, that he's both, and ends the argument by saying, \\"We, that is our brains, are separate and independent enough from our genes to rebel against them. ...[W]e do so in a small way every time we use contraception.\\"Now, I don't pretend to have a handle on the philosophical and sociobiological arguments regarding whether or not humans have free will, or even what exactly free will is. But in the above I don't see that Dr. Dawkins really does, either: he treats it far too simply.In sum, read the book, but don't let it get you down. After all, if the village priest doesn't have the right to bully people intellectually, than neither does the research scientist."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Here I go again.

He would be well advised to consider that maybe he isn't the great prophet he thinks he is. Look, I take the easy way out myself and figure I don't know much of anything. But I do know that history shows that people who figure they have THE answer are eventually proved wrong almost all the time.

It is a masterwork of unparalleled proportions. I savored each page and was awestruck at the brilliance of Dawkins' achievement: to explain altruism on a molecular level. This is momentous and life-changing science writing at its very best. This is the real bible."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In this classic sociobiology text, Dawkins shows how mathematical analyses can help us understand the evolution of social behaviors in humans and other animals.For much of the book, Dawkins uses game theory to show how differing strategies can come to coexist in populations. He does this with strategies of physical aggression (\\"hawk\\", \\"dove\\", \\"bully\\" etc.). He uses this approach to explain how the sexes could have evolved and to analyze the interactions of various mating and infant-care strategies.Dawkins also presents mathematical analyses that can explain the evolution of altruistic behaviors--i.e., behaviors that promote the survival of others while reducing the chances of survival of the altruistic individual. Here the analysis is based on the fundamental understanding that natural selection ultimately operates at the level of genes rather than organisms.In the process of natural selection, random mutation creates differing alleles (versions) of genes that create different varieties of a feature (e.g. different eye colors, or different levels of aggression). The alleles that endow the organism with characteristics that best serve to reproduce that allele become increasingly common in the population.By reducing the likelihood of survival, altruism reduces the likelihood of reproduction of individual organisms. However, an allele that creates an altruistic behavior could become common if that behavior benefited enough other individuals who also carried that allele: the process known as kin selection. For example, if an individual with one copy of an allele sacrificed its life to save the lives of two individuals who both carried one copy of that allele, the loss of the individual's copy would be compensated for by the preservation of the others' two copies. Altruistic acts toward closer relatives are more likely to be of benefit to an allele because closer relatives are more likely to also have that allele.In a similar vein, Dawkins elaborates the strategic advantages of reciprocal altruism and forgiveness using an analysis of \\"the prisoner's dilemma\\" trust gameAll of this makes for fascinating reading. However, Dawkins takes three linguistic and logical shortcuts that can lead the reader to misunderstand the process of natural selection.Dawkins makes the common mistake of referring to gene alleles as \\"genes.\\" Secondly, for much of the book he writes at the level of the individual organism rather than the allele. Thirdly, in order to make it easier to evaluate how specific strategies impact the frequency of the allele in the population, he writes as if genes--and animals--are thinking beings that consciously strategize with self-reproducing goals in mind.Dawkins sometimes points out when he is taking the logical shortcuts, and they don't compromise his analyses of specific strategies. However, he almost never restates his arguments in scientifically objective, allele-centered terms. As a result, these shortcuts can prompt the reader to create an incorrect mental model of natural selection in which human-like genes--and the individuals they control--are locked in a dog eat dog competition for dominance.Unfortunately, Dawkins himself seems to have succumbed to this misconception. On page 2 he writes: \\"I shall argue that the predominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness. This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfish behavior.\\"Gene alleles don't have attitudes to other alleles of the same gene, they simply influence the characteristics of the individual who carries them. Indeed, only a fraction of genes have anything to do with social behavior. Is an allele for light hair in Northern Europe \\"selfish\\"?The alleles that become frequent in a population are the ones that code for characteristics that enhance their reproduction in the environment that the organism lives in. Most mutations produce alleles that reduce the viability of the organism and hence of the allele. If one wanted to attribute a quality to alleles that become prevalent it would be \\"lucky,\\" or \\"effective,\\" rather than \\"selfish.\\"When evolutionary theorists write of \\"survival of the fittest\\" they are referring to reproductive fitness, not the ability to win a fight. Indeed, Dawkins himself demonstrates how non-aggressive strategies can come to stably co-exist with aggressive ones in a population.That said, reading \\"The Selfish Gene\\" was a pleasurable, at times even enlightening, experience for this reviewer.

The arguments the author talks about are very thought provoking. Recommended to any one interested in Evolution and its relatives."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene is one of the best books I've read. Its subject matter--evolution of life on earth--is important. Its writing is flawless and its points well-argued. Its conclusions are significant, controversial, and seemingly inescapable.The Selfish Gene is not for the faint of heart. Just look at the review here titled \\"Fascinating, but at times I wish I could unread it\\"--the author thinks that Dawkins's book \\"presents an appallingly pessimistic view of human nature, and makes life seem utterly pointless.\\" I don't share this reviewer's view, but I'll get to that later. Some background is necessary first.Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University. The Selfish Gene, his first book, was published in 1976. It has since become a classic of popular science literature. I'm not a scientist and I can't critique the scientific accuracy of Dawkins's book, but I don't need to: The Selfish Gene has been scrutinized for decades, and it has emerged mostly unscathed.Though it does contain background material, The Selfish Gene is not an evolution text. Dawkins's goal with the book is primarily to argue for a gene-based, rather than an organism- or group-based, view of evolution. He sets out to refute the theory of \\"group selection,\\" which had been popular prior to the 1970s. According to group selection, traits can spread in a population if they benefit groups, even if they are detrimental (evolutionary-fitness-wise) to individuals. So, for example, group selection implies that a trait for disinterested altruism can spread if groups of altruists are better off than groups of non-altruists.Dawkins argues that genes, not organisms or groups, are the fundamental unit of evolution. He terms genes \\"selfish,\\" a word he gives a technical meaning. A \\"selfish\\" unit of evolution is one that is selected for--that is copied through the generations--in a Darwinian selection process. A \\"successful\\" selfish unit produces many copies of itself; an unsuccessful one disappears. Dawkins does not mean, of course, that genes themselves \\"are\\" selfish. Rather he means that they affect the organisms containing them as if they are. Their effects suggest a selfish disposition.Genes are passed on based only on their ability to influence organisms to pass them on. Their benefit to particular organisms or groups is relevant only insofar as it aids their own selfish interest. Genes must be selfish, as only those most effective at replicating themselves stick around. The \\"unselfish\\" ones all die out.Genes are \\"replicators\\"--they create identical copies of themselves. Organisms are not--they pass only their genes to the next generation. Dawkins provides a possible story of the origin of life: in it, primitive replicators emerged in the primordial soup that was earth's surface hundreds of millions of years ago. These replicators were stable configurations of molecules that, through the laws of physics and chemistry, caused like configurations to be created around them. The copying process occasionally made mistakes, which led to a diversity of replicators. Because the replicators competed for finite resources (molecules), natural selection favored the ones that were best able to survive and reproduce. More-stable arrangements--and arrangements capable of decreasing rivals' stability--were favored. As time progressed, offensive and defensive strategies became increasingly sophisticated, and the molecular arrangements became increasingly complex.Eventually the replicators \\"learned\\" to build bodies for themselves. Dawkins suggests that a particular strain may have \\"discovered\\" (through a mutation) how to build a wall of protein around itself. He terms these bodies \\"survival machines.\\" Survival machines helped the replicators to move around, to defend themselves, and to reproduce. As the replicators grew more complex, so did their survival machines. The living things we now know--amoebas, worms, trees, racoons, humans--are all survival machines. The DNA contained in every cell is the medium for genes, which are the replicators. We are their survival machines.So ends chapter two of The Selfish Gene. Dawkins spends most of the rest of the book elaborating on his argument and demonstrating its explanatory power in specific cases. He covers his bases well and responds to the obvious objections to his theory. I couldn't possibly do justice to the finer points of his argument in this review, and I won't try. Instead I will briefly cover a few of the points I found most interesting.Dawkins's dismissal of group selection, which I mentioned earlier, rests largely on the concept of evolutionary stability. A behavior pattern (\\"strategy\\") that is prevalent in a population is evolutionarily stable if it cannot be displaced by an upstart strategy. Strategies for disinterested altruism--which group selection suggests could develop--are not evolutionarily stable. I'll illustrate with an example. Say that a gene \\"for\\" sitting on whatever eggs lie around is prevalent in a bird population. As long as all the members of the population possess this gene, all is well: all eggs will get sat on. However, if a mutant bird that sits on no eggs enters the population, its genes will spread rapidly: most of its eggs will get sat on (by the altruists), and it will be free to gather food and lay more. A strategy for sitting on whatever eggs lie around thus is not evolutionarily stable. (A strategy for sitting on no eggs isn't stable either.) As Dawkins shows, a strategy for sitting on only one's own eggs is stable.Genes are in competition with one another. They \\"want\\" to propagate more of their own kind, which means that organisms with similar genes tend to have similar interests and organisms with different genes tend to have different interests. Close relatives, who share many genes in common, tend to have closely-related interests. Because parents pass half of their genes to their children, parental care isn't altruism at the gene level--genes have much to gain from influencing organisms to aid others containing them. Because parents and children do differ genetically, however, their relationship is not purely cooperative. You'd expect children to \\"exploit\\" their parents to a degree--for example, by pretending to be more hungry than they actually are--and such behavior is in fact present in nature.Dawkins has much to say on the relationship between the sexes. He defines \\"males\\" as organisms with small and numerous sex cells (i.e., sperm) and \\"females\\" as organisms with large and few sex cells (i.e., eggs). Because sperm can be produced cheaply and in great number, male investment in child bearing is low. Female investment, however, is significant: a large egg must be produced, and a long gestation period may be involved. This discrepancy leads to differences in male and female strategies regarding sex. Because males' genes stand to gain (and lose) more from competition, males are more likely to behave like high-stakes gamblers. In polygamous species, they fight, sometimes to the death, for females. The winners' genes are spread to many offspring, and the losers' genes are spread to none. Because females' reproductive rate is fixed by their ability to produce eggs, they stand to gain less from competition. They have more to gain from being picky in their choice of mates, and all sorts of female mate-selection strategies have developed as a result.Before ending, I want to say a bit about the implications of Dawkins's book. The reviewer I mentioned earlier thinks that The Selfish Gene presents an \\"appallingly pessimistic view of human nature, and makes life seem utterly pointless.\\" I disagree. First, as Dawkins points out, our behavior is only partially determined by our genes. We are self-aware, rational beings, which means we can question the proclivities our genes give us. We can even \\"rebel\\" against them. Dawkins uses contraception as a simple example--non-reproductive sex certainly isn't in our genes' interest. More importantly, we can choose to behave as true altruists. We aren't compelled to obey our genes' selfish dictates.Life is only pointless if we think it is. We can create meaning as individuals and as a species. How we got here is irrelevant; we now have the power to direct our own destiny. I strongly recommend The Selfish Gene to anyone who wants to better understand their place in the universe."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"A mind blowing book. I read it 30 years ago and just re-read the slightly enhanced newer edition. Chapter 2, which introduces the idea that genes, not organisms, are the focus of evolution always gives me a feeling of awe, the closest I can come to a religious experience -- but, of course, Dawkins would not approve of that.Some of the chapters could be heavy going to a casual reader, demanding quite a bit of thought to follow the arguments. Along the way there are some nice descriptions of weird animal behavior.One of the additional chapters discusses the extended phenotype, and made me want to read Dawkins' book of that title."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Once you read the Selfish Gene, Your world will never be the same. Pardon the purple passage and excuse the apparent hyperbole, but what I assert is true, true, true.The basic idea of the Selfish Gene is that the unit of selection is the gene, and the gene, by definition, is selfish. To see why, a quick example will do. Suppose there are two seperate genes, let us label them A and B respectively. Gene A resides inside Karen, while gene B resides inside Kim. If gene A causes Karen to develop into a symmetrical, serpentine young woman, while gene B causes Kim to develop in a highly irregular manner, it is not hard to see that gene A, ceteris paribus, will be passed on in greater number than gene B. Over time this means, eo ipso, that gene A will become numerically superior in any gene pool. Of course life is not so simple, and no one gene causes beauty. However, the point is that the gene's eye view of the world explains so many mysteries of life. Altruism, sterile insects, special treatment toward kin, parent-offspring conflict, sex differences, and on and on: All can be explained with a selfish gene view of life.This may be the most powerfully written popular science book ever. I know that lavishing such praise on any work is problematic. However, I do not know of a book that influenced so many people in such a deep way. Even at 32 years of age, this book is as fresh as ever."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I was first interested in the work of Richard Dawkins while researching a paper for an anthropology class. I had come into contact with the notion of Memes via a book called \\"Dark Nature\\", and the notion of ideas being similar to viral infection got me going. So I bought Selfish Gene and dove right in. The reading of such dense and possibly difficult meterial is made pretty simple by the use of story narratives and parallels; rendering complex information simple upload and gestate. There is no part of the book that could be considered \\"over the head\\" of anyone familiar with the subject. I was just out of High School when I read this the first time and I have bought numerous copies as gifts for people I have met along the way. As an introduction and explaination of Darwinian theory down to the genetic level this is superb and due to the accessibility of this book I went on to purchase other books by Dawkins as well. Though there is a sort of difference between Dawkins and Gould (another writer on the subject of Darwinian theory) one could be of either, or neither, camp and take many good ideas from this tome. In respect to Memes, which was and is my primary interest, not a large quantity is written, but the effect is quite infectuous enough once the seed is implanted and one can easily extrapolate from there. this book is not just something I suggest, but it and others like it I think should be taught in schools as mandatory reading."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Dawkins book was popular with scientists and lay people alike when it was first released. It remains a classic which should be read as much for historical context as for content. There are assuredly better treatments on evolutionary science these days, particularly as regards the genomic revolution.Oh, and for those who are turned off by Dawkins' athiestic pronouncements in later writings (including, one can safely conclude, the upcoming \\"The God Delusion\\"), The Selfish Gene is freer of that perspective and certainly its insights into evolutionary process do not require that you accept his stance on God.Many scientists wish that Dawkins would tone down the athiestic rhetoric. Not only does it probably reduce the number of lay readers who invest time to read the factual content in his books, but it tends to convey the impression that most scientists have the same or similar perspective. I know of no survey on the subject, but I suspect that relatively few scientists are ardent athiests. For a refreshingly thoughtful alternative perspective, cruise the web for E.O. Wilson's position on athiesm (= a copout) and his advocacy of deism."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Parts of the book were utterly fascinating to me, such as the groundbreaking idea of the \\"meme\\" as a unit of cultural transmission. But the argument that species are survival machines for our \\"immortal genes\\" seems seriously flawed.First and foremost in my mind, it is hard for me to swallow that organisms practice altruism because the gene or genes that are responsible for this altruism have a probability of existing in the recipient of the altruism, the probability increasing with the closeness of familial relatedness. How, then, to explain altruism beyond the family, or even beyond the species? The author mentions that there is at least one well-documented case of a dolphin rescuing a drowning human being. In the book this was suggested to be a mistake. One of Earth's most intelligent animals has a gene for rescuing long, narrow objects and cannot tell the difference between a human and its own species. I got doubtful when contradictory evidence was explained as a mistake. And what about organisms' adopting children originating from other parents? Always a mistake? Highly expensive practice for when the real deal arises?I do not understand why there must be *a* unit of natural selection. Can't there be more than one, sometimes at odds with each other, sometimes in tandem? I do believe genes are selected over other genes, but I believe groups can be selected over other groups, too. Perhaps other units, both larger and smaller than genes (Why not the selfish base pair?), are also naturally selected.Finally, especially considering recent discoveries in genomics that have downsized the number of estimated human genes, there cannot be one gene behind any behavioral trait you can think of, a gene for being nice to your cousin, for example. I get that a gene can have many functions and can have a net effect of being nice to your cousin, and in its absence you would be less nice to your cousin, but this makes for a complicated web which would get torn apart as succeeding generations inherit just part of the web. The influences of biology, environment, and history get harder to ignore."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Before I read this book, I was like most non-biologists out there. I'd heard of the theory of evolution, but had an incomplete understanding of what it meant and if it really had any meaning in the \\"real world\\".It was from this book that I learned that every living creature has an evolutionary past, and that this past has to be considered to understand how animals (including humans) behave.There is so much beauty in nature owed to evolutionary processes--this book is a good place to start if you want to understand that beauty in biological terms."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Just in case many people assume that all negative reviews are from people who don't believe in evolution, I want to state that I have absolutely no doubt that evolution is true. My criticism isn't against evolution but against the theory that is in this book.At the beginning of the book, Richard Dawkins says that \\"this book is mainly intended to be interesting\\" and he certainly succeeded at that!He took the idea of kin selection (the theory that asserts that natural selection in evolution works at the level of the individual plus kin which share the individual's genes) and made it thoroughly interesting by asserting that it's actually the gene that matters in evolution. According to the selfish gene theory, we humans and all other organisms are simply vehicles\\" or \\"survival machines\\" built by the genes in order to pursue their own self-interest - i.e. competing with other genes to make copies of themselves through reproduction. So we are reduced to \\"lumbering robots\\" and \\"selfish machine[s]\\" whose only true purpose is the survival of our genes. Isn't that interesting? Well, much more interesting than the question of what level natural selection works on, usually is, and, accordingly this book was much more popular than a book about the subject usually is.While I personally like Dawkins and believe him to be an honorable, intelligent man who is truly concerned about humanity, I believe this book which made him famous is flawed. Please understand that my criticisms are not of evolution itself but of the particular theory that Dawkins set forth in this book decades ago, before the human genome project and many new discoveries which show some of the weaknesses of kin selection and the selfish gene theory.In 1976, when the book was written, the theory of kin selection seemed quite plausible, 33 years later, as I write this review, much of what seemed to be evidence of this theory has been disproved. The author, of course, cannot be blamed for not knowing what was not known at the time. One of the things that will change your reading experience significantly, and I recommend this, is to read the endnotes to see some of Dawkins own comments on what he originally wrote. Interestingly, in the introduction to this edition (30th anniversary), he states that there is almost nothing he would change about the book, contradicting what he himself wrote in the endnotes. I think it's important that anyone looking to learn about this subject by reading this book today, understands the flaws in the theory as they are known today and, unfortunately, very few of the reviews have touched on this.Criticisms:1. What the author calls \\"one of the most spectacular triumphs of the selfish gene theory\\" - the explanation of the worker bees who don't reproduce because they serve their genes more by helping to raise their sisters and brothers with whom they have a 3/4 relatedness - has been disproved. Dawkins acknowledges this in the endnotes of this updated edition: \\"...new facts lead us to doubt the importance of the 3/4 relatedness hypothesis\\". It turns out that different males mate with the queen so the relatedness goes down to 1/4, but, worse yet, worker bees frequently move and work in another colony where the queen and other workers are completely unrelated to them.2. The explanation of surplus DNA has also been disproved. It turns out that the DNA that was thought to be unused actually serves a regulatory function - it is not a parasite.3. The book uses deceptive math, which is explained in a way that the author himself calls \\"a bit of a cheat\\" [endnotes p 288] that makes many people believe that we share 50% of our genes with our children and siblings, and 25% of our genes with our grandchildren and cousins while, in reality, we share well over 99% of our genes with every human, even when unrelated; and we humans share about 95% of our genes with chimpanzees. The theory that we care about kin because they share our genes seems much weaker when the real numbers are used.4. The author himself, again in the endnotes [page 313], says that the handicap principle, if true, which he now believes it is, may necessitate \\"a radical change in our view of many of the issues discussed in this book.\\"5. The entire \\"Battle of the Sexes\\" chapter is based on a theory which the author himself, in the endnotes, says does not make sense. His original argument: \\"the female sex is exploited, and the fundamental evolutionary basis for the exploitation is the fact that eggs are larger than sperms.\\" In the endnotes he takes it back: \\"even if one sperm is small and cheap, it is far from cheap to make millions of sperms and successfully inject them into a female against all the competition.\\"6. The whole book is based on an empty premise that he himself says no sane person would believe [intro to 30th anniversary edition] - the selfishness of the gene. Obviously genes can't be selfish, but he states because of the selfishness of genes, organisms are naturally selfish. This is where the souffl&eacute; comes into play: the hot air is the \\"selfishness\\" of genes leading to selfish organisms. Useful genes survive. Useful genes lead to selfish organisms doesn't sound quite as convincing.7. The author himself claims he wasn't clear about the difference between a gene and an organism, such as a person, at the time he wrote the book [intro to the 30th Anniversary Edition]. Shouldn't that make us question his conclusions about organisms?8. In the 30th anniversary edition, the author responds to a reviewer who gave the book 5 stars but says that it has caused him bouts of depression since the theory leaves no room for a deeper meaning to life, by saying that no sane person would tie his \\"life's hopes to the ultimate fate of the cosmos.\\" This seems like a rather heartless and unrealistic response, unworthy of the caring man I believe the author to be. Of course we care about meaning in life and evolution does not preclude meaning.9. It has been pointed out that kin selection theory is just group theory among relatives and has the same flaws; it is open to cheating and is, therefore, not part of an evolutionary stable system.10. Dawkins asks us to face up to the question: What on earth do you think you are, if not a robot...? I don't believe it's helpful to fight religious myths by ignoring the difference between living, breathing, caring human beings who took billions of years to evolve and robots. This is done by many evolutionary scientists: reduce humans to something less, in order to sound more scientific and distance yourself from religion; I think ignoring facts makes one less of a scientist.11. New findings have shown that DNA is fluid and responds to the environment - including our own feelings - in order to better help us adapt and survive.

In fact, I found myself looking upon my bookshelf wondering whether I could ever find the motivation to read another book. There is just something about the Dawkins writing style that crushes my excitement and fervour for learning. Upon reflection of this recent attempt, I feel that it may be the way he describes concepts. The Selfish Gene soars across some fairly difficult terrain and attempts the very difficult task of accurately dispensing, in lay terms, genetics and reproductive processes such as meiosis, evolution, selective pressures etc. That it is in lay terms is this book's greatest strength, but also its weakness. In order to ensure the reader grasps each concept, it is discussed in multiple ways using a range of metaphors. For some readers (myself included), the prose will frustrate as you gain a comprehension of the material and then grind though pages more about that same topic. I must point out however that I have previously studied genetics, evolution and biology in university so it is likely that my professors were standing on Dawkins' shoulders when they taught us. This is no doubt a significant contributor to my frustrations with the book - I already knew the topics in a scientific sense.So given the above one might ask why the rating. Well, the book isn't targeted at me, but at an audience not cognisant of the mechanisms of evolution. For the purpose for which it was written, and in with that in mind, I can see that this book would greatly enlighten the reader and I loved how he could explain things easily in a way that I've never been able to. Further, many other reviewers view the Selfish Gene as a classic of pop science and I would have to agree with that assessment, if only because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Perhaps when this book first dropped 30 years ago as the blueprint for evolution it was considered radical. Today it's taken as a given that the primary motivating force for behavior has a genetic basis. This shift in attitude may be a direct result of the widespread influence of The Selfish Gene, but I wouldn't know. I wasn't around then. But this is a fine work to help everyone understand the core essence of human nature, and how we can use our superior capacity for reason to create a society of compassion that compliments our biological imperative.With the existence of such formidable works as this, it remains positively astounding that any debate should remain on the matter of Creationism, Intelligent Design or whatever transparent euphemism is currently fashionable amongst the fundamentalists so populous in rural regions.Of particularly acute interest to those seeking a slight edge in the competition of the fit should be chapter 9. This is something I most certainly will be passing on to those with whose success I have a genetic interest. Most, however, will never find their way to it, which suits me just fine. The less you know, the better it is for me.

I cannot comment on him in those fields, but he is without a doubt a superb evolutionary biologist.Just as Stephen Hawking can make astrophysics accessible to the lay person without dumbing down the essential philosophy of it, Dawkins can accomplish the same with biology. Using a bevy of useful anaolgies and metaphors, as well as meticulously researched scientific evidence, the book walks us through evolution from its earliest period on the planet, up to the present day, and beyond. His \\"meme\\", revolutionary for its time and still a popular term today, remains a valuable insight into \\"cultural Darwinism\\" and how replicators need not be limited to the genes in living bodies."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is not what I expected! I think that no other book has a more misleading reputation than The Selfish Gene. The irony is that Dawkins is nicknamed \\"Darwin's rottweiler\\" but his gene-centered theory of natural selection is thoroughly non-Darwinian. Darwin published Origin of the Species in 1859. The concept of the gene didn't gain acceptance until the early 1900s and the basis of Dawkin's gene-centered theory, molecular genetics, didn't develop until the 1950s and 1960s long after Darwin lived and died. So how does Dawkins pass off this book as a primer on Darwinian evolution? By crafting his faulty arguments exclusively in metaphor.Dawkins argues that genes are like pages in a book... and like oarsmen... and like primary policy makers, gamblers, master programmers, and extra-terrestrials from the Andromeda galaxy! Bodies are like survival machines, and like translocators, lumbering vehicles, processed food, and like gene machines guided by an executive simulator (that last bit is Dawkins-speak for the brain). Unless the reader is already grounded in evolutionary theory they will be quickly misled by the abuse of metaphor.150 years ago Darwin realized that animals and their environments are inextricably linked: animals run from predators and chase after prey, they forage for food, search for mates, endure cold, drought, disease, starvation and a thousand other insults. Darwin also recognized that each member of a species was just a little bit different from its peers and that that difference caused it to interact with the environment just a little bit differently. Darwin argued that those animals with traits that allowed them to better withstand nature's deadly assaults tended to reproduce a little more often. Those traits are hereditary and can gradually transform one species into another species better suited to its environment.Dawkins turns this familiar Darwinian theory on its head and counter proposes the gene-centered theory of evolution by natural selection. Unfortunately for Dawkins' thesis, genes don't interact with the environment so when he argues that genes are targets of natural selection he doesn't mean it in the conventional textbook sense, he means it in the whimsical Dawkins sense. And when Dawkins states that genes are \\"immortal\\" and that unchanging immortality makes them the \\"fundamental unit of natural selection\\" (i.e. change) Dawkins is deliberately founding his argument on a paradox. Genes can't change, they can't evolve, they don't interact with the environment and the gene-centered theory is nonsense but Dawkins will convince you otherwise by arguing about oars and Andromedans and bookcases.Whereas Darwin conceived of natural selection to explain speciation, Dawkins doesn't venture beyond micro-evolution. On the origins of sexual reproduction and multicellularity he does write a little but only very vaguely. If you put aside the science fiction bits about replicators, memes and whatnot, Dawkins doesn't have much to say about the big picture at all.I did enjoy this book though. In fact, I enjoyed it a lot because The Selfish Gene is consummately eccentric, fantastic and entertaining. Yes, The Selfish Gene is also deceptive and paradoxical but somehow that makes it all the more intellectually engaging. If you're looking for an introduction to evolutionary theory look elsewhere first and then come back to the Selfish Gene. It you're looking for a mish-mash of science, science fiction and hyperbole then look here first."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Anything by Dawkins is outstanding.

So why only four stars? Through no fault of Dawkins', this book, written over 30 years ago, is dated. I don't think it ranks as a theory of evolution, at best it is a hypothesis which Dawkins has a very hard time stating. There is so much quibbling in the initial chapters that I was close to giving up. I was reminded of early science writers who had to resort to \\"humors\\" and \\"ethers\\" to substantiate their theories.So, why four stars? Because Dawkins was on the point of \\"discovering\\" emergence. He actually used the word without realizing its full impact. The meme, of course, is the \\"motive power,\\" if you will, of the emergent next step beyond genes, what Dawkins calls the vehicle (for genes). If you believe in evolution beyond the Darwinian biological stage, emergence makes a lot of sense: from Big Bang to matter, to atoms, to stars, to galaxies in one direction and from atoms to molecules, to life forms, to intelligence, to technology and beyond in another. If you are interested in exploring emergence I can recommend \\"At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity\\" by Stuart Kauffman who argues that Darwinian evolution is necessary but not sufficient to account for evolution. For a look at future emergence, I recommend \\"The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence\\" by Ray Kurzweil who talks about our robotic descendants.

I came to this book as a social scientist who has allowed myself to become woefully ignorant of natural science, and this book really helped me wrap my head around a number of complicated processes. Dawkins here proposes a new way of thinking about evolution. Previously many disputed over whether we should look at individual organisms or entire species as the fundamental units of analysis. A species approach would mean arguing that certain behavioral traits are prevalent because they are beneficial for the species as a whole, while an individual-centered approach interprets prevalent behaviors as advantageous to the individual organisms. Dawkins' approach is closest to the latter, but he argues that we should shift our level of analysis even further downward, to the genes themselves. He urges us to think of organisms as vehicles which genes manipulate to ensure their transmission down through the generations. The title of the book refers to this basic portrayal of genes as selfishly manipulating the behavior of their hosts so as to be passed on to the host's offspring. In other words, even though genes themselves aren't conscious agents, we should conceive of them as such, and any explanations of animal behavior that ignore this are incomplete.In the course of the book Dawkins uses this approach to attempt to understand many seemingly anomalous behavioral traits among different species. Some of the most fascinating parts of the book concerned the social insects, namely bees and ants. Dawkins also makes good use of game theory to demonstrate how certain behavioral \\"strategies\\" came to be selected. He introduces the useful idea of an \\"evolutionarily stable strategy\\" to explain the relative prevalence of certain behavioral traits among various species. This is basically a sort of equilibrium; any deviation from this equilibrium, which would come about if a particular trait became more prevalent, would be balanced the subsequent increase in rival traits.I would recommend this book to anybody seeking a clearly written, non-technical introduction to evolutionary theory. While it may seem clich&eacute; to praise an author for writing about complex subjects in an articulate, easily comprehensible fashion, Dawkins really does succeed in doing so. I just had a couple of concerns that forced me to detract a star. First, while Dawkins conscientiously tries to avoid mathematical exposition, at times his presentation would have benefited from being slightly more technical. This was particularly true when he introduced game theory to explain the prevalence of certain strategies. A simple chart showing the payoffs resulting from certain strategies would have made his argument much easier to follow (he does do this in a later chapter on the evolution of cooperation). Finally, there is a later chapter in which Dawkins tackles human culture. He uses the term \\"memes\\" to refer to the cultural equivalent of \\"genes\\". He wants to argue that the transmission of memes down through the generations is really comparable to genetic transmission. I really didn't find this chapter very persuasive, and it certainly didn't provide me with any better understanding of cultural evolution than I had before. I think one could make an argument to the effect that culture evolves through similar mechanisms as natural organisms do, but Dawkins doesn't do it here. Nevertheless, this chapter that I am criticizing is rather peripheral and its weaknesses don't detract from the overall book. Overall, this was a very informative, well-argued introduction to evolutionary theory."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is amazing and deserves it's place as a popular science classic. Dawkins argues clearly and with integrity and you get so many mini epiphany moments as you read that you can't help but be profoundly affected by what you read. You will have such an understanding of how our genes may well influence things that you will look at life around you in a completely new light. I'd say that where as Steve Jones' 'Language of the Gene's' (which is also superb and highly recommended) looks more at human genetics, 'The Selfish Gene' looks at genes in general and applies the theory to plants, animals and human life. This is a very clear and readable book, which makes it all the more enjoyable. Don't get bogged down in the moral and political debates around the issues in this book, as Dawkins repeatedly says, this is about genes and how they function, not about if they are morally right to do so. That is where our own behaviour comes in to make us act more altruistically. This really should be required reading and you will not regret giving it a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Phew! I have lost count on the number of times I have turned to this book, with utmost satisfaction. What draws you to it is its sheer value. Origins of life, purpose of life, and the architecture of the living world, couldn't be better explained. Richard Dawkins is simply the best science writer taking his reader in a zestful metaphorical parade, through ever existential questions and sharing a scientific perspective that is refreshing and rational.Firstly, his writing style deserves 10 out of 10. Fit for any class of reader, erudite to layman, this classic rendition is simply too lucid and it would be impossible for anyone to NOT understand the content. Although you might have to read more than once to appreciate the many layers of sheer genius hidden in each sentence.Second - He takes you on a roller coaster ride, with seatbelts on, but nevertheless rocking enough for you to gasp out loud at various twists and bends, and safely brings you down to solid ground.Third - Explaining concepts such as replicators and vehicles with the gene in our planet being the replicator and the fundamental unit of selection for all life and the organisms being the vehicles or the machines (all plants and animals) , selfishness of the gene (reminding everyone constantly about the metaphorical significance of the term selfish), the purpose of life (or the lack of any divine/spiritual purpose) through the bottlenecked life cycle, the cultural unit of selection through memes, the clear debunking of the group selection theories....the menu is utterly savory leading you to crave the book. I take it often on train rides and even though I have read the book more than 20 times, I find it as one of the simple pleasures of life to read it on a train, fully immersed into it as if it was my first read.This book has made my life a lot simpler. While I had been drawn to various spiritual sects in the past looking for deeper meaning and purpose of life, nothing made so much sense to me as this book. While spiritual perspectives are welcome, they never hit the spot for me. I feel liberated with this scientific and rational perspective. I am also in the stage of my life where I am the healthiest I have ever been. Freedom and health is a perfect combination.Thanks Richard Dawkins for being the public advocate of science and skepticism. MY deepest appreciation for your work, your writings, and your ideas."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This edition contains an excerpt from a 1982 review by John Maynard Smith that sums things up nicely. Smith first observes that \\" The Selfish Gene reports no new facts. Nor does it contain any new mathematical models - indeed it contains no mathematics at all. What it does contain is a new world view.\\" Indeed it does. Most of the material I had already encountered elsewhere, but Dawkins has a tremendous gift for allowing the reader to see the whole of life from a new perspective (in this case, the perspective of the replicators that fashion us).In commenting on the hostility aroused by the book, Smith further notes that \\"[this] is a book about the evolutionary process - it is not about morals, or about politics, or about the human sciences\\". Too many people (myself included at one time) look at the title and see in it a promotion of the naturalistic fallacy ('what is ought to be'), which in turn elicits a defensive reaction from our own moralistic fallacies ('what ought to be is'). The book is not about a gene (or genes) that make us selfish, nor does it excuse selfish behaviours on evolutionary grounds. It is merely a statement of what is. If we deny what is because we don't like it, our ability to effectively remedy what we don't like is curtailed. Besides, things aren't as bad as all that anyway. I like how Dawkins added the chapter \\"Nice Guys Finish First\\" in this edition, where he nicely summarizes social game theory as it relates to evolutionary stable strategies of altruism. It really does make for a more optimistic and upbeat ending."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"This book is simply amazing! It is beautifully written and well formulated. I love how Richard Dawkins argues for his theories. I have learned about evolution in school, but not this way! Here he explains why we behave like we do towards our relatives (and others), how this has been evolutionary beneficial. The parts I like the most must be the parts with game theory. Is it smart to cheat others in order to survive? If so, how much can you cheat before you get busted and is less likely to survive?Finally I have to say that this is clearly the best book of Richard Dawkins I have read so far, and I highly recommend it!! (I haven't read \\"The Extended Phenotype\\", but I will very soon)"},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Science can explain exactly how rainbows form, does this rob the rainbow of its beauty? Would love feel any less real if we could identify the neurological circuitry associated with the feelings? I would like to think that those are two different areas and we need not confuse the difference.\\"The Selfish Gene\\" gives us a stunning insight into what drives us as human beings to procreate (obvious) and even to be altruistic (not obvious). At the heart of the matter is the \\"Selfish Gene\\" which *seems* to seek to multiply itself in the smartest ways to survive the longest. Sometimes one needs to take a \\"game theory\\" view, which leads to counter-intuitive conclusions.Continually Richard Dawkins repeats the mantra that just because something *is* in nature, does not mean that we *ought* to follow this way. The history of humanity is about rising above nature, subduing nature, thanks to our intellect. This may be a story about how we got here, but now we have the intellect to guide where we want to go.Richard Dawkins scientific acumen cannot be denied, nor can his ability to communicate science to the masses. Richard has successfully introduced a new word into the English language through this book, the word \\"meme\\", which is analogous to a gene but is transferred in the mind."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I had to read this over the summer for AP Bio, and I must say, this is now one of my favorite books. Though it drags on at times, the entire book is wonderfully written, having the perfect blend of scientific intelligence and basic summarization, so that at no point in the book does the reader feel absolutely confused, nor as if they are being spoken to as a child.In a way, opening this book is like opening a nerdy Snapple cap. Every page has a different interesting study or pattern observed by scientists, and every single one ends up explaining some part of the theory of evolution. Honestly, I don't think that anyone who believes in Intelligent Design could read this book and still call evolution made up. Dawkins connects all the dots for the reader, to a point where disputing evolution is just pure ignorance.This is a wonderfully written, interesting book, and anyone who wants to know more about evolution or just wants to know what all the big fuss is about should definitely read this."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Richard Dawkins has become famous in the public mind as one of the strongest exponents of contemporary evolutionary theory, as well as an opponent of religion and creationism. THE SELFISH GENE is the book that launched his career as a celebrity scientist.Ostensibly it is devoted to addressing, and ultimately debunking, the idea of \\"group selection,\\" or the nearly equivalent \\"altruism\\". What does natural selection actually select? The gene. Or more generally, a replicator, of which a gene is the pertinent example, while speculations on the nature of other possible replicators makes for interesting reading at the end of the book. The fact that genes are units of replication and thus selection is the defining principle of \\"neo-Darwinism,\\" the combination of Darwin's pre-genetic understanding of evolution with Mendelian genetics. Dawkins pursues with logical rigor the implications of this understanding, clearing away a lot of confusions, particularly those centered around explicit or inadvertent assumptions of selection of individual organisms, groups of them, or whole species or ecosystems. Seeming examples of such \\"altruism\\"--one organism promoting another's welfare at its own expense--can often be explained as \\"kin selection,\\" where one organism's genes promote the welfare of the identical genes in closely related organisms. In all cases, though, the gene is doing what is most effective in creating copies of itself.Though Dawkins is addressing a specific, if widespread, confusion regarding evolutionary theory, his book also serves as a good general introduction to the topic. His language is clear, evocative, and often passionate, and his examples and metaphors are memorable. Mathematical concepts, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, are explained clearly, without formulas or technical language. Quasi-philosophical speculations provide meaty food for thought. He introduces the now oft-referenced if seldom understood idea of the \\"meme,\\" a unit of cultural reproduction. Also, in the thirtieth anniversary edition he provides a summary of the idea he develops in THE EXTENDED PHENOTYPE: that genes' actions on the environment do not end at the boundary of their organism's body, but act on other bodies and the physical world.Some reviewers found this book a depressing read. This, I suspect, results from succumbing to \\"genetic determinism\\", which Dawkins avowedly rejects. When talking about humans, he notes that genes exert a strong statistical influence on our behavior, but not a completely irresistible one. For instance, there are the memes, replicators which evolve much more quickly than the gene. Yet our conscious minds can evaluate and choose to ignore even those. We can ignore the programming of genes (and memes), though it is a tough battle. THE SELFISH GENE helps us better understand what we're up against."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"Very well written book. Anyone with no background in Biology will be able to understand this book without any trouble. Richard Dawkins also provides good evidences and detailed explanations throughout the book. If you are a religious person, beware that this book might shock you in several ways."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"In eleven short, tightly written, lively, and easy to understand chapters, Professor Dawkins answers all the questions about Darwin's theory of evolution that we might have always wanted to know the answers to but were afraid to ask. He does this even though strictly speaking, the book is not at all intended to be a book on evolution. It was intended to be about the gene-centered view of evolution: that is to say, about how the gene sits at the center of the control module of all living organisms.Dawkins belief in evolution is solid, because to him, Darwin's theory is settled science that has not only stood the test of time but also is a \\"thoroughly-tested\\" and falsifiable theory. And as existential theories of living matter go, Darwin's theory of Evolution -- with its primary instrumentalities of time and natural selection -- provides the simplest explanation (in the sense of Occam's razor), of all living things: of how we got from inorganic to organic matter; from unordered atoms to complex patterns, from simplicity to complexity more generally, and from a single \\"live\\" cell, to the cell's ascendance into more complex living organisms, to higher forms and orders. This of course means that a supernatural being of any kind whatsoever would be superfluous.At the beginning of the book, the author poses the question \\"Why Do People Exist?\\" and proceeds to answer it by saying that: We exist in large part because of the \\"biology of selfishness,\\" that is, due to the selfishness of the genes. In the process of answering this question, he develops the biology of DNA and along the way demolishes some long-held hypotheses of the \\"pre-Darwinian\\" social psychologists and theorists who have long believed falsely that evolution is concerned more with the \\"survival of the species\\" rather than with the \\"survival of the individual.\\" Dawkins claim is a radical and controversial one: that this long-held hypothesis about altruism makes no evolutionary sense; and that if we are concerned about the evolution of altruism, then biology is probably not the right place to look.The crux of Dawkin's thesis is that \\"bodies are mere transport vehicles for genes.\\" \\"We are machines created by and under the control of our genes,\\" the predominant quality of which is \\"their ruthless selfishness.\\" And although altruism may indeed have survival extending value, we are genetically programmed to be ruthlessly selfish rather than altruistic.This is a seminal work that set off the fireworks in the sociobiology debates, and 30 years on, a great deal of its substance is still valid and has endured. Five stars."},{"Title":"The Selfish Gene","review":"I bought this book for my wife, who as a Zoology major had once been told by a Professor that this book was essential reading. While the book lay on the shelf, waiting for her attention, I felt sympathetic and decided to give it a read. This book, quite simply, changed my life like no other piece of literature, music or art (barring perhaps the Beatles) did.If you have not been exposed to the beauty of biology, or if you are wondering somewhere at the back of your mind why some species are the way they are and do the things they do, this book will blow your mind. It will make you fit pieces together and dare I say, make you think about religion and God differently. The God Delusion is getting a lot of attention lately, but really, reading the selfish gene puts all the dots on the map of your brain. All you have to do is connect them and you will have the answers to your questions.Read this book as soon as you can.

This is one book no romantic suspense fan will want to miss out on.Bounty hunter Annie Ryan met her match in jewel thief Liam &quot;Lucky&quot; Logan. Right when she thought she had him, the charming Lucky turned up the heat...and got away. The last thing she expected was for him to appear on her doorstep the next day. Or had he? FBI agent Matt Logan looked like his twin brother, but that was where the similarities ended. The by-the-book agent wanted to find Lucky, too, along with the priceless jewel he'd stolen. But that didn't stop the spunky Annie from getting under his skin, or him from under hers.&quot;Twice Tempted&quot; is similar in style to the classic &quot;Catspaw&quot; books and should win fans of both those books and anyone who enjoyed &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; last summer. A caper full of surprises, Allen has more than one trick up her sleeve that will keep readers wondering how she's going to resolve it in the end. The sexual tension makes this one of the sexier Intrigues to come out recently. This is one steamy book! The Boston setting adds unique flavor, and the relationship between Annie and her family offers some moving moments. The book also has one of the best uses of cliffhangers at the ends of chapters that I've read recently. Almost every chapter ends with a surprise twist that sends the story in another direction and raises the odds. Pretty soon, the idea of reading &quot;just one more chapter&quot; has become meaningless, since the temptation to keep going on to find out what happens next is too great. It kept me up all night. I could not have been happier.The only problem with the book is Harlequin's strange decision to run a letter from the editor on the second page like Silhouette does, instead of offering an author biography and backlist. I don't know why they want to copy what other lines do, but a list of previous books would be more handy for readers sure to be looking for Allen's other books. The year 2000 is not here yet. &quot;Twice Tempted&quot; is still a strong contender for the best 2000 Intrigue.

So this is a shorter version, as I am tired, but feel I MUST speak up! I was a teenager myself at that time (I graduated in 1965 from Fremont High in Sunnyvale, CA (Silicon Valley). My best friend and I, once I got my license at 16, spent all of our weekends, and sometimes weekdays, hanging out in the Haight and in Berkeley, those WERE exiting times. We got to see and sorta meet some semi-famous people, and for sure a lot of nobodies, just like us. While being a teenager with all of the female hormones raging around at that time, I can somewhat sympathize. However, what I daydreamed meeting Jimmy Page, I knew knew the whole fantasy was just that, a fantasy. I didn't smoke pot, as I never smoked, and I was always afraid to drop acid (I was sure I would have a bad trip!), so I drank some and partied some, but my head was mostly still in the Real World. I can't tell you how many teenage, mostly run-a-ways (back then you could \\"crash at nearly anyones' pad\\" no strings attached, or almost no strings), but some wre daddy's little rich girls (kinda like Patty Hearst), and some of them tripped big time! But even if the initial \\"dream\\" was on drugs, by the time they grew up (like Linda supposedly did) (and I've seen that she writes some sort of artsy-craftsy (like scrapbooking or something) type books, so a part of her is somewhat grounded in the real world or those books wouldn't get published. And let's face it, a \\"Wild Child\\" story published this late in the game was a gamble for fame and money, so she isn't brain dead, just a very sad little teenager inside of an old, and I DO mean OLD hippie body like all of the other Old Hippies. Some get over it and move on, some don't. I don't want to be the direct cause of her poverty, so I will only say that I, myself, would not waste money on her book. Let her earn a living as a real person, not some fantasy \\"wild child\\", and as for her and Jim -- NADA, he was elsewhere with other people when she dreamt he was with her. As much as there is written about his \\"dark side\\" and his sexuality, I don't think he was into child pornography, and even a 16 year old (I've got the photos to PROVE it!) back in those days was still a little girl, not like the 16-year old women nowadays (How did that happen, by the way?) So dream on Linda, if it makes you happy (but how can it, when it wasn't REAL?) For those of you who were fans of the Doors and of Jim Morrison, it never happened. He had a bad enough rep as it was, but it did not include child molestation! Sorry Linda, grow up, do your little arsty crafty books and live frugally.

Ashcroft is one of the many attractive, now aged beauties who claim to have had a passionate love affair with Morrison when his band, The Doors, was changing the rock world with it's dark blend of music and poetry. Before Ashcroft the most famous lover (aside from his famous girlfriend Pam Courson) was Patricia Kennealy, a wiccan who married Morrison in a pagan ceremony. Kennealy has photographs and even Doors band members admit Morrison did have some sort of relationship with her, but Ashcroft's book plays more like a well-written fantasy, a poetic daydream without any evidence to ground it in reality. Notice that she includes typical, basic concert photos and official Doors studio shots, and a photo of one curiously handwritten note \\"from Morrison.\\" The book itself is a literate take on the virginal teenage girl meets wild man story as Ashcroft recalls meeting this poetic, yet dangerous leather-clad singer who breaks down her fears and takes away her virginity. Ashcroft even attempts at inserting herself into Doors history by claiming that Morrison wrote the song \\"Wild Child\\" for her, eventhough by better accounts it was written for Pamela Courson. There are some typical Morrison moments where he reads her from Ginsberg's \\"Howl,\\" or chats about Kerouac. As a novel it is also well-assembled, but as biography it is just undigestable, especially when Ashcroft places herself in specific moments and events that Doors sources have already discounted. One should be impressed at how Ashcroft can keep it all going for 499 pages, as the affair tears her apart inside as Morrison dabbles in hard drinking and drug binges, and of course the 60s swirls around them with Vietnam raging etc. One of the disappointments in terms of fictional writing is Morrison's dialogue which is never believable, it never reads like a normal man talking, but Ashcroft simply writing lines for the mythical icon we've all come to know as The Lizard King. He says exactly what we would expect the Jim Morrison of the album covers, posters and Oliver Stone movie to say, never do we feel like these are two individuals sharing real, intimate moments, maybe because they never did. \\"Wild Child\\" has earned it's place among the notable Morrison books to be published in the last 10 years, at least because its so bold in it's invention. Three stars because it is a fun read and Doors fans would get a kick out of it, especially with Ashcroft's referencing of song titles and lyrics, but as a work of truth, this one doesn't pass the test."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"This book is either a beautiful love story and insightful look at Jim Morrison, or a work of deceiving, manipulative genious. I have read almost every book on Jim Morrison and The Doors and this woman was never mentioned once. Great detail has been given to all of Jim's serious girlfriends in the other books, with no trace of a Linda Ashcroft. However,amazingly, the book is so convincing that I am absolutely torn about what to think. If the book is a fake, I would stand in respectful awe of this author's brilliance. Either way, the book is enjoyable and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"This book is remarkable in one way--it accurately represents the fantasies of many a teenage girl. Yes, Jim really sang to YOU, even encoding special messages in his songs. (\\"If I WERE to say to you...\\" in the Ed Sullivan Show is actually a response to Ashcroft's grammar critique, who knew?) Yes, this 20-something man was entralled both intellectually and physically by a nerdy (by her own account) teenager and what he really wanted to do was trade not particularly high brow literary analogies for hours on end. Yes, you were the only one who truly grasped the meaning of the Doors. And this goes on for hundreds of pages. Towards the end, I began to worry seriously about Ashcroft's mental state.This book adequately represents the fantasy life of the pubescent, but, alas, is no more true than my high school fantasies. And not only does it have teenager appropriate content, it also has a writing style that could have been lifted verbatim from my overwrought high school diaries."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"As a biography, I give it no stars. As a work of fiction, I give it four. That evens out to two.This book chronicles the love affair of Jim Morrison and Linda Ashcroft, rock star and anonymous woman. The read is romantic and beautiful... too bad it's apparently fiction. Ashcroft offers a book that is, sadly, a pack of either lies or delusion.Her book's very core conflicts with and flatly contradicts the dual relationships with Pamela Coursen and Patricia Kennealy-Morrison, one of whom extra-legally married to him - a proven testimony that would conflict with Ashcroft's claim that Jim was planning to marry her. She gives no specific dates or landmarks in Jim's life, making vague references to concerts and such events - no one still living (or un-brain-burned) had apparently seen the two together. Supposed thefts deprived her of the alleged material documenting her relationship with Jim.Smells funny, no? Pamela Coursen had many, many witnesses that she was Jim's lover, testimonies from many people. Patricia Kennealy-Morrison has signed documentation alongside testimonies (though fewer than Pamela) that she had a relationship and extra-legal marriage with Jim Morrison. Ashcroft's utter lack of either documentation or witnesses adds to the funny smell, even if you disbelieve all that we know of either woman in Jim's life.As a novel, this book reads well. Sweet and romantic, with an excellent writing style and a pleasant flow. But I found it highly distracting that the author wrote this as a biography, and that I knew that none of this was true. Also, some of the things that Jim allegedly said to her disturbed me, and made me wonder why she would put such things down about/by Jim if she supposedly loved him.If you truly wish to know more about Jim Morrison and women who loved him, I advise you to read both &quot;Strange Days&quot; and &quot;Angels Dance, Angels Die,&quot; one about his relationship to Patricia Kennealy-Morrison and one about his relationship to Pamela Coursen. I cannot recommend this as a biography."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"First, the good news: This is a breathtakingly intimate portrait of James Douglas Morrison. And I use his full name here because I think it's a better portrait of James Douglas Morrison than of Jim Morrison. Only true Morrison fans will know what I mean. Ashcroft paints a picture of the Morrison who was sensitive, loving, creative, protective, generous, intellectual, romantic, playful, honorable, and charming. It's the Morrison that we know he was in greater or lesser measures, but that we nevertheless wish he was even more of. It's also the most dreamily romantic tale ever told about him. You can't not love him after reading this. The reader is seduced into loving him right along with the author--in fact, reading Ashcroft's story may well break you heart.Now, the bad news: Everyone who supposedly saw them together and could have corroborated her story is dead, or was so blasted at the time, they'd never remember her now. Also, all the letters, poems, gifts, jewelry, etc., that he gave her were conveniently stolen in a burglary. Not only that, but it's a clever literary device that she was underage, therefore, nobody could know about their relationship for Jim's legal safety. There isn't a single picture of them together. If he loved her so much, surely he could have posed for a very chaste photo (maybe taken by Bill Graham?). Most of the story takes place during her high school years, yet during all that time she didn't tell even one friend she was having an intimate relationship with the biggest rock star in America because what they had was special and private!It's a compelling and very romantic read, but it almost breaks your heart to realize that this story can't possibly be true, because for the most part, this is the Morrison that we all wish he was."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"A beautifully told story of love, trust, sensuality and creativity between two kindred souls. I enjoyed Ms. Ashcroft's writing style. The book read with a languid pace that held and absorbed. It painted such an intimate portrait of Mr. Morrison, that at times it was painful to read. But, is it the truth? You will have to read and come to your own conclusions. Truth has many sides."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"After spending 30 hours straight reading this book from cover to cover (no small feat at just over 500 pages), I was breathless, spent, and somewhat distressed. I felt as if I had lived through the thunderstorm relationship of the life and death of an alcoholic, megalomaniacal rock star. Ashcroft's simple suburban teenage life intertwined with Morrison's chaotic existence seems at times implausible. Yet, the evocative writing style of Ashcroft transforms this controversial tale of teen idol worship into a compelling story that transcends the specific details of their relationship. Ashcroft's ability to let the story unfold on its own sets this memoir apart from other biographies that editorialize their subject. This richly detailed memoir, based on her diaries of 1967 though 1971, resurrects the soul of Jim Morrison and brings to life the pain and power his music embodies. Because of the unique side of Morrison's character that Ashcroft portrays, claims have been made that this book may be nothing more than the fantastic longings of an obsessed groupie. Regardless, I highly recommend this novel to anyone who is willing to cast away their doubts and simply enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Although, like anyone who was a teenager in the sixties, the Doors' were a part of my life's background music, I read Wild Child because a writer friend recommended the author. So, I may be one of the few who read this book because of the writer and not Jim Morrison. Linda Ashcroft can write!!! But I also became a fan of Morrison's.I found Allen Ginsberg's quote on the cover to state exactly why this book is important: &quot;Wild Child opens a door and gives an unobstructed view of the human side of genius.&quot; (A Great Pun)I heard Ginsberg encouraged Linda to write the whole truth about Jim when she was starting out to tell a couple funny stories about Jim because so many bad things have been said about him.There were some wonderful revelations about writing in their everyday dialog. This book is what anyone who has kept a diary forever should read to learn how to turn it into literature ...One of the things I enjoyed most about Wild Child is that Linda Ashcroft wrote without the usual editorializing found in bios. She just let their story unfold. Jim wanted to be a teenager again with her. They were wild children in the best meaning. I really got wrapped up in real feel of the times and the heartfelt truth of the emotions. Dispite what I knew about Morrison's end, I found myself routing for them to make it. If the size of the book imtimidates you, I guarantee it is well worth the late night reading."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I have read this book and it is one of the best books I have ever read about anybody. Linda Ashcroft has written a beautiful love story about the relationship she had with the Lizard King himself, Jim Morrison. I believe her, and until anyone has walked in her shoes or lived her life they cannot judge her and have no right to do so. I have heard stories that she has lied, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter whether the book is true or not- it only matters if it is good. I would read this book either way. I also like this book because she showed a side of Jim that is ususally ignored- a loving, intelligent side (not to mention, romantic).Thank you Linda, for showing everyone this side of him, because so many books (and a certain movie by Oliver Stone) made him out to be a demon. In my opinion, Jim would be very proud of you, because you did him a great justice. I highly recommend this book. Read \\"Wild Child\\" and decide for yourselves."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Wild Child is the story of the friendship between the author - Linda Ashcroft, and the singer and poet - Jim Morrison. The book begins shortly before their meeting, which occured in the summer of 1967. When they do meet, they form a close, sensual friendship - which will remain so, until Jim Morrison's early death... but until we reach that part, we're given the opportunity to look into their life together. Into their games, their play, their passion, their strive for freedom and the healing of their spirits.It all arose strong feelings in me.Since Wild Child is based on Linda's own journal from the period of time when she knew Jim Morrison, it is a complex and very detailed story, written with beautiful, painting words which makes you see the scenes before you clearly.. and due to her perceptiveness, you're given quite a good insight on what really happened at every moment - it helps you look beyond the surface. We're given a rare and sensetive portrait of Jim Morrison, and most of the other characters mentioned in the book (such as Jim's girlfriend - Pamela Courson, and the guitarist Jimi Hendrix), are pictured quite intimatly, as well. Personally, i love drama..and people with a fire inside.. This book has a great deal of that element in it. So therefor, and because of the beauty, intelligence, freedom, poetry and romance in this book..i give it 5 stars. You deserve it ;)"},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"When I first received the book, I was thinking this was a hoax. That the book was going to be another groupie fairytale about Morrison. How wrong I was. From the first chapter on, Linda takes us to a magical realm called true love. She didn't love him because of who he was, she had found her true soulmate, Jim had found his true soulmate. I am not easily impressed by these types of books, most are all flowery and lies, Linda shows that Morrison truly had many different personalities and she has the capability to explain them to you in a very personal way , Ms. Kennealy lives in a fairy world, I read her book, this book takes you deep into the psyche of Morrison, his passions and his madness. Linda tells you the exact truth of Jim Morrison's death. She had a relationship with Pam Courson and was inspired by Anias Nin to write this book. Pam Courson called her the day Jim died from Paris and the exact way she killed him with heroin. This is the real deal people. Get it, read it, absorbe it. You'll see the true &quot;Jim Morrison&quot; through a true writer/artist's eyes, Linda, I would like to shake your hand.Michele, Oxford, CT"},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"This book does NOT read like a memoir. It reads like fan fiction. It is a beautifully written love story, but, so obviously NOT based on any relationship with the real Jim Morrison. If this book was published as fiction, I would give it five stars. That being said, I'm giving it one star for being well written, and one star for having Jim Morrison as the hero/romantic lead. I'm not saying this book isn't worth reading. If you have ever listened to the doors, or listened to an interview with Jim Morrison, and longed to know what it would be like to have the amazing artist/poet treat you as his muse, this book is for you. If you are looking for a factual biography and insight into what life with the REAL Jim Morrison was like, skip this one."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I had the same imaginary relationship with Jim Morrison when I was 16; but as romantic as my fantasy life with him was, I would never write about it and try to pass it off as a memoir. Shame on Ms. Ashcroft for her ridiculous attempt to fool the public into believing she had a relationship with Jim This book would have you believing Jim was needy to the point of being pathetic and that Ashcroft was his confidante and saviour. as his. Morrison fans/historians know he was not one to bare his soul to most women or be particularly sensitive(maybe just to Pam). The fact is, he was often unkind to women (as a friend of his confided to me). This book is a waste of time and money. Real fans of Jim know he was far from perfect but we loved him anyway and no one should try to make him what he wasn't. And, by the way, my name really is Ginger - unlike Ashcroft who even gave herself the fake nickname. And, what kind of parents allow their 16 year old so much freedom that she is able to spend frequent nights in a motel with a rock star of questionable morals ( they liked him according to her); how silly is that? Besides, The Doors were touring a lot; Morrison would not have had time to be with this girl so often while he was living with Pam & having his \\"flings\\". Ashcroft even has the gall to say that Pam knew about her & Jim even says that Pam was the one who called to tell her Jim had died! Don't waste your money on this one; it's just a fantasy (thanks to B. Joel for a great song by the way)."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"For a work of fiction, this is a beautifully written book. But do I believe it's true, hardly. I have searched long & hard for a photograph of the author with Jim Morrison, zilch!! Her memoir would have held more weight had she included photos in the book of her with him, but there's not one. I enjoyed the book, nonetheless--it's a fun read."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Great storytelling but I just didn't buy her claim about the significance of the song '5 to 1'.

I still recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Read this a few years ago and i thought it rang true to me, and i have been a student of All Things Morrison for over 20 years. But her shoebox of letters and photos etc was conveniently stolen or burned in a house fire... if it is fiction, this person is a truly gifted inventor and fabricator with a deep understanding of JDM. If it is fact, well then it's really cool to see this glimpse of JDM through the \\"Ashen lady's\\" window... I would love to know whether it is fact or fiction, but either way, i thought it was a compelling story, and i felt like it was giving a true insight into the life and times of the gifted rock artist."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I'm giving this 4 stars for the beautiful writing, what a pity Linda Ashcroft & her publishers labelled this book as non-fiction. She has the capabilities to be a wonderful writer of novels, which is of course what this book is. A powerfully evocative recreation of the intensity of teenage feelings & fantasies, with barely a fact in sight. I know the saying is \\"if you can remember the 60s you weren't there\\", but it's too unlikely that nobody from that era remembers Morrison's underage friend.Forget the outrageous claims & enjoy the classic story of the unawakened girl & the man nobody knows except her. Perhaps the writer will make enough money to get some therapy & develop her undoubted talents."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"To be sure this is a controversial book. For a 15 year old girl Miss Ashcroft was certainly extremely sophisticated and she also made it appear that she was in great control of her emotions. Adolescents rarely have this level of savvy. The one question I have not seen in the reviews of her book is the most OBVIOUS of all - is it not common practice to date your journal entries? Come on! For someone who can conjure up such great detail in remembering things, how is it she would leave off the beginning step to any journal entry. But to be fair one should look at the Morrison journal entries - his songs! I think this guy was sooo famous, he may very well have needed a 'hidden person' in his life who wasn't 'connected' to his everyday goingson. I liked the book alot. It was much better written than PK's. It has some pretty terrific stories. Morrison Hotel may very well validate how he really felt about this girl. The lyrics fit with her view. I'd like to believe she was the 'real deal' for him but there are too many unverifiable claims - dead people and stolen property. Don't real thieves rifle through more than a box in the closet? The book is worth the read whether or not any of it can be accounted for. Apparently Morrison promised to come back for PK too after he ditched Pam. In essence what you end up with is the mighty question of the old short story - the lady or the tiger? You decide."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Linda Ashcroft writes acceptable prose and spins an interesting novel concerning her relationship with Jim Morrison. Obviously, there is no possible logistical way that the events could have transpired as written, given The Doors' very hectic travel schedules in those years. And too, there is scant or no collaborative evidence, not to mention that other Doors' biographers, very close to the events, have omitted her named entirely. Given that, and understanding that this work is fiction, I can recommend the book be enjoyed for its insights to muriad possibilities of partial truths."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Ms. Ashcroft has a wonderful grasp on the English language, and is a talented writer.

I read it and when I was finished immediately started reading it again. Each time I read it (this is my 10th time) I take something more precious away with me----I cry, I laugh, I learn, I ponder, I realize new ways of thought and understanding, I travel along with Linda and Jim and experience.My dear Mother, passed on, June 5th, 2004, from Lung Cancer which spread into her brain and spine also.....She had been sick for the last 2-3 years--for some comfort of my own during this extremely stressful time and I must admit escape and for some existential answers, I turned to The Doors music and Jim's words. I am from that generation (birthday 2-26-51) and \\"grew up\\" with \\"The Doors.\\" Jim's words always seemed to help me get through especially what was unknown. So to escape and at the same time try and get some answers.....I devoured the words in Jim's songs and poems.....like \\"learn to forget\\" and\\"the future is uncertain and the end is always near.\\"As my Mom became more dependent on me just for everyday survival because her illness was devoring her and in order for me just to go on and do what at that time seemed the impossible.....I began to read Linda's book. I would just throw myself into the words and pages of \\"Wild Child\\".I could lose myself into the reality Linda and Jim allowed me to slip into and experience along with them. Words cannot begin to explain how important this became for me.....a safe place to go and immerse myself the reality they both shared.This allowed me to come back into the here and the now when I was finished reading, which gave me the strengthand the courage to face the duties I had to perform for my Mom and also helped me face the reality of my Mom sickness and helped me handle how it was robbing her of her life with me.Thank-you so very much,Linda, for sharing so much of yourself and your Jim-- you and Jim helped me to continue on and do what I knew I had to. Linda's Novel and words are still and always will give me the courage and the strength that I need to continue on my life path.

In fact, Jim Morrison's parents stopped the book from being sold in the UK because it contained so many untruths. (She claims that she tried to have sex with him at the age of 15.

Get a life please and write some novels.Three stars for the incredibly brilliant web of lies.\\"Storytelling is just an elaborate form of lying.\\" said someone whose name escapes me."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"My wife purchased this book through Amazon and read it TWICE in the span of a month. So I thought I would read it. Having read more than a couple of biographies of rock musicians and bands I was hoping to get some new facts on The Doors. What I came away with was more a feeling of being taken for a ride. And I don't mean as a rider on the storm.By the end of the first chapter it had the feel of a romance novel. All that was missing were the euphemisms for the male and female parts and a Fabio-like rendering of Morrison clutching a heaving bosom drawing of \\"Ginger\\" on the cover. With each chapter I completed it felt more and more like fan fiction or the \\"historical novel\\" genre.If she is going to use words from songs,(the part where she says something about Morrison quoting a line from a Beatles song about being able to steal but he could not rob), she should have at least put words in his mouth from a song already released by the Beatles. Look it up. \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" was on Abbey Road which was released in late September 1969. Not August. References to a Neil Young album and a Rick Nelson song are cloudy at best. She would have us believe that not only was he this waif like lost little boy poet genius and love god. But wait, there's more. We are supposed to believe he had such a deep insiders knowledge of when Neil Young's album was going to be released and other bits of inside stuff about the music industry. As if the Stones, Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young and other luminaries in the rock galaxy had to clear everything with Mr. Morrison. This is a favorite device in fiction. Throw in enough real places, people and events that it feels like it just has to be true. I am shocked she did not have \\"Jim Morrison\\" pulling a Forrest Gump and turning up at JFK's murder and other major events!Her idea that she was riding on the same stretch of road where James Dean was killed is also hard to swallow. Trying to cut through her florid prose, I was unable to tell where exactly she and \\"Jim\\" were driving. But she makes it sound as if he was killed on the road that runs up and down the coast in a Corvette. Uhh... sorry dear, it was a Porsche. Even if she had the exact spot and mile marker down, he was heading out of Bakersfield toward Salinas. Not Stockton, San Francisco or Big Sur.We are to believe that he had this \\"other life\\" that he carved out apart from the Doors and the rock lifestyle that he seemed to relish. The accounts I have read about Morrison paint a picture of a talented but deeply troubled man. And like many rock stars he would have told any cute little girl anything to get what he was after. But to state that she was somehow his creative equal and muse along with being his inspiration for so many lyrics? Lot's of young girls fancy themselves as deep thinking poets and writers. Of course the \\"hero\\" in this story is going to be on the phone with the conveniently dead Andy Warhol trying to get her into art school.Dead men tell no tales.The Beatles are my favorite band, but I don't claim to have been the guy they called when the pressures of fame got to be too much. I will lay claim to John Lennon soliciting suggestions for the lyrics to \\"I Am The Walrus\\" from me.Trying to paint him in the revisionist style as a misunderstood, tortured genius who was going to marry her and settle down is a bit much. This fantasy viewpoint that he wanted to rescue her from her parents is troubling. Perhaps in the minds of many a youth in that era their favorite singer, actor or athlete was going to come down off their pedestal and spirit them away to a magic place. For most people the alarm clock goes off right as you're about to get the keys to the new car and the lifetime supply of money. How would any parent in the 1960's or 70's have felt about their daughter getting involved with Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Mick Jagger or any other rock star? You better believe that most men would have been VERY suspicious of his intentions. But again she works her magic by making it sound like \\"Jim\\" had honorable intentions. Wonder how open she would be if she had a real daughter that was being wooed by the likes of Curt Cobain? In the real world.This whole book reminds me of a Saturday Night Live sketch with Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. The show was first aired on the 20th anniversary of The Beatles landing in America. Murphy plays a person claiming to be the saxophone playing, black, fifth member of The Fab Four. Piscopo does a great job as the incredulous interviewer who asks questions that Murphy answers with a look of disbelief that we are not buying this at all. To quote Clarence Walker,\\"Paul still use AfroSheen because of me!\\" At least they used humor to make their point.

It's doubtful that she even KNEW him.I believe Patricia K's story when it comes to bare facts, though her interpretations of Morrison's intent, feelings, and motivation might be questionable.But Linda's story, nope, I don't buy it.Save your money, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I feel this a really good book for anyone who likes a good romantic story. In the end as I'd like to think it is true, I just can't believe it is so. There are so many things that prove otherwise. Such as the only people (friends) of Morrison that she met, had died before she wrote this book. Also if it were true she would probably have at least have a couple pictures to show for it, oh wait I forgot about that stuff stolen out of her closet. And you would also think if he'd introduce her to his girlfriend that he would also introduce her to the other band members, but that wouldn't work out because they are all still alive and well. It makes for a good read and left me wishing so much that it was true, but all I can sum it up as, is some teenage girl who ran into Jim Morrison a couple times and decided to fan it up a bit into a novel."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I would like to thank jsolinas for raising a very good point, &amp; one that anyone who is now considering purchasing this book should consider: &quot;Wild Child&quot; is a work of, if not total, then major fiction. Ashcroft does a good job of matching up events in the book to the places &amp; events that Morrison was at in a corresponding time frame, however, there are also a number of out &amp; out lies, &amp; I'll give you one of them just to prove my point. Very late in the book, Jim asks Linda to give him a line for a song that he's working on, &amp; she responds w/&quot;Motel money murder madness&quot;, a line that, as we all know, would later show up in &quot;L.A. Woman&quot;. This takes place in about 1970, according to the book. However, if one goes back &amp; listens to the first poetry tapes that Jim made back in early 1969, you can hear him read that same line in a poem, which logic dictates must have been written even earlier than that, at least a year or two before our dear &amp; talented Pat claims to have become its author herself.

Her credibility has already been shot down by numerous people in the Doors Family. Throughout my studies of Morrison, this book has to be the most egotistical account yet by an author. Although she proclaims her love for Jim throughout the book, it seems that she wishes to tear away some of the myth which has been built up over the years. Every writer/poet/ artist gets their brilliance form their environment, meaning all kinds of things can inspire an artist to create. The numerous claims in this book made by the author concerning Jim's lyrics and how she was part of that creative process should have probably been left untouched, especially since her dates/times throughout the book have been proven to be false (go to DCM website to read it yourself). If you read this book, be looking for a comedy. It is a tall tale which can't be taken at face value. As a student of the Doors and the literature which has been published about Morrison over the years, I could have written this book."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I can't believe that someone who had such fleeting liasons with Mr Morrison could churn out 500 pages.

There is another Patricia Kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind. I thought one Patricia was enough. But after reading this book, I am faced with the frightening realization that there are TWO of them!Also, what I find very disturbing is that this version of Patricia may be even daffier than the original version. After reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of Patriciaitis and a dose of Kennealyism.By the 40th page I was searching for my red slippers so I could click them together and get back to Kansas.

I figured the story was fiction from page 3, and the only reason I kept reading the book was to see what outrageous claim came next... and I wasn't disappointed. Besides the obvious, i.e., no proof, date conflicts, items \\"stolen\\" and all witnesses dead (except Dennis Hopper), Jim's personality -- even on his best behavior -- was nothing like Ms. Ashcroft described. Sorry to break the news, but in addition to being an alcoholic AND a brilliant mad man, Jim was incapable of this type of \\"pure\\" relationship during his troubled lifetime. Perhaps as he aged and sorted himself out he may have been capable of a monogamous, give-and-take stable journey with one woman, but it would have been with his equal, not a 15-year-old child. Her description of Pamela Courson as a wimp and sniffler couldn't be further from the truth. Pamela had plenty of experience with Jim's groupies and would have either (1) ignored this stalker, or (2) flattened her. Finally, the unsubstantiated claims Ashcroft made in the UK version are disturbing and were culled from rumors that have been flying around for years."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"this book is beautiful, i cry every time i read it, i never met Jim but through Linda Ashcroft's words i feel like i know him so well.

Perhaps that is naive, but it would appear by all accounts that Jim Morrison was extremely free with his affections and had a knack for making all the girls he was with feel like \\"the one,\\" even though they knew full well there were others. Did Jim Morrison really intend to marry Linda Ashcroft? Probably not. No more than he did anyone else, anyway. But the author was at an impressionable age and Morrison seemed to thrive on carrying on a sort of \\"secret\\" life. I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss this account -- not entirely, anyway."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I read this book not knowing how much controversy was at hand about it's legitimacy. But isn't that the case with a lot of his books and the movie. No one person can agree on how he should be depicted. You tend to believe in which book actually fits the description you already feel is true. Not being open to take in everything you read and amalgamate a personality cuts yourself short on what he truly was. I feel he showed each person what he wanted them to see. He was very macho when it came to men and when it came to certain women he showed his soft side. But isn't that true of any man? I have read &quot;Well she has no proof and everyone is dead who could collaberate this relationship!&quot;. Well what about Dennis Hopper? Has anyone asked him about the collaboration of the song/poem &quot;Watcher of the Skies?&quot;.I love this book and could not put it down once I started reading it. I want to believe this is as close to an accurate account as possible and that the story of how he died seems to me very believable.To close I don't think she wrote this book to make herself famous or for a publicity stunt. If so why can't I find even one picture of her on the web? I feel she wrote this book to cleanse her soul. She sounds like an amazing woman and I only wished they could have married and lived happily ever after...."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"The story was amazing, and Linda voices her tale with eloquent words and thoughtful stories. However; I find two things that are the cause of my suspicion 1)I think that it is rather convenient that all of the poems, letters, and rings that were given to her by Jim Morrison were &quot;stolen&quot; out of her house, and 2) the fact that everyone that had seen them together is either dead now or was so strung out there is no chance they would remember her.

It is a sensitive, provocative and ultimately heartbreaking book about the love shared between the author and Jim Morrison. However, as a professionally trained sceptic and cynic [a/k/a lawyer], I wondered about the fact that there were no photographs of the two lovers included in the book and the fact that their wedding rings and written memorabilia were all stolen from the author's home, conveniently leaving no physical evidence of the relationship's existence. Furthermore, all mutual friends of the lovers such as Jimi Hendrix, Bill Graham and a famous child actor [whose name eludes me]were all deceased by the time of the book's publication. So we have a one witness case, with no other living witnesses or physical evidence [photos, rings, the multitude of letters from Jim Morrison to Ms. Ashcroft]. Having said this, I am, nevertheless, a real romantic and found the story to be so beautiful and heartbreaking [especially the part about Jim's intention to return from Paris and marry Linda Ashcroft], that I hope its true."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"This is the book I hungered for. The simple honest truth! Of all the books I have read on Jim Morrison, this one at least shows no exaggeration of his wild life and by the end of this book I felt I had known Jim Morrison for who he truly was a poet,rock star, sensitive person who could love and who also felt human pain who was torn apart from so many different worlds. Linda Ashcroft's meanings behind some of the songs was very helpful. The only thing troubling me is that the dates don't seem to match up with the rock stars schedule back then??

If you can't find Stevenson's article, try reading \\"The Doors on the Road\\" by Greg Shaw if you want to know what Jim Morrison was REALLY doing, when he was supposed to be spending time with Ms. Ashcroft (hint...he wasn't flying kites with Linda, he was busy touring!!!)."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I would like to thank jsolinas for raising a very good point, & one that anyone who is now considering purchasing this book should consider: \\"Wild Child\\" is a work of, if not total, then major fiction.

Many are found in this book. I was aloud to grow closer to Jim Morrison and to begin to know Linda Ashcroft. These real people found each other in the creative mix and environments that were California in the late sixties. Besides being about a revolution of love, the story widens with the true personalities each player introduces behind all the drinking, druging and fast times we know as rock and roll. Jim was a poet/film student, army brat, and indulging shaman. Linda, a writer by her own right and (YES!) confidante/co-creator behind the genius of her teenage idol. Really Jim was much more than an idol to her. She found in him her own creative powers that helped to carry him emotionally through very ruff waters, and the ghosts of his past and present. She could do this because she herself had a similar twist in her own background... This was a journey of painfully healing friendships and a long overdue testimony and revelation from the authentic but secret woman and co-creator behind the delightfully mysterious Doors!

So to all you non-believing pricks out there who want to know the truth i'll let you figure out which one it is. This biography is very well written and very emotionally touching. It is a very sweet and caring account of the Jim that most of the public did not know and still seems largely ignorant of. I have read all of the other books on Jim Morrison and this one is definitely at the top of the list. Another thing, pretty much everything Jim wrote or sang about had at least two meanings. What makes you think that LA Woman was ONLY about Los Angeles ? In reality it also means Linda Ascroft...his &quot;little L.A. Woman&quot;...the little 5'3&quot; sweet thing who was his true love. Courson and Kennealy were vultures by comparison, Pam was the only real gold-digger. The only &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; was Jim's own Romeo-and-Juliet flawed Love for Pamela...that in the end destroyed him...anyone who really knew Jim would know this... he was the victim of his own heart and love... Love was the only thing he believed in, that is why he never owned a house and just traveled from hotel room to hotel room like a nomad.

Buy this book with caution!"},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Having read the poorly titled but well researched &quot;Angels Dance, Angels Die&quot; about Jim I was inspired enough to take up this tome. The first thing that struck me beyond the rather hyperbolic writing was that there was no mention of MY affair with Jim which was concurrent with Linda's (and Pam's, and...)and I don't recall seeing Linda around. And it was actually me who inspired Jim to write that sophmoric verse that has decayed into rather embarassing drivel in the less intoxicated 21st century. The book is actually rather interesting once you realize it is all fiction (others have mentioned the strange lack of ANY evidence, not to mention the Doors magazine showing that Linda's dates don't correspond with Jim's actual whereabouts -- unless there was a double?), and realize that this is either really really pathetic or shrewdly cynical. Even in the rock star bio sphere you need to have some element of credibility, Linda Ashcroft has none. So don't buy this for the real skinny as it were, but if you are interested in aggressive self delusion (I'd like to think it is that over pure cynicism, and the rampant ego tripping she indulges in would point me towards the former) this is an interesting document. I sort of think of this as the book Glenn Close's character in Fatal Attraction would have written had she lived."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"Linda Ashcroft's book has been deemed highly controversial since the day it was published. Most, including those who knew and loved Jim Morrison best, have slammed Ashcroft's story as a complete fabrication and have even gone as far to release Jim's personal itineries to prove their theory that 'Ginger' is and was another obsessed fan who only wishes she had a relationship with the legendary Doors singer.Indeed, Ashcroft does not do herself many favours with lack of hard evidence. The only people to back up her story are deceased and she has hardly anything Jim gave her as it was all 'stolen.' However she did manage to hold onto one or two items including a very facinating page from a notebook where her, Jim and Dennis Hopper hand wrote lyrics to a song.Linda Ashcroft's story starts when she met Morrison by complete chance in a coffee house in 1968 which led to a blossoming relationship until Morrison's untimely death in 1971. In the book Ashcroft describes her meetings, phonecalls and letters with Jim down to the finest detail thanks to her own diaries and journals of the time. Some of the stories she tells are believable and some of them definately are not.She claims to have met all members of The Doors (who do not remember her), Bill Graham, the promoter, and also Pamela Courson, who knew about Morrison's affair with her, amongst others. She even goes as far to say that Pamela told her the true story of Jim's death, which is included in this book and what his last word was.Despite the cons, the book itself is a very good read. If it is a true account, it is an extremely valuable insight into yet another side of Jim Morrison. However, after weighing up the evidence from the 'other side,' I do have my doubts as to whether Linda Ashcroft's account is 100% true. The lack of evidence, the conflict in dates she has given to those in Morrison's known itineries and just the simple fact that those who know Jim vehemently deny he ever had any relationship with a 'Linda Aschcroft' or 'Ginger' tend to sway it all into the 'nice story, shame it's not true' pile.Despite my opinions, I would strongly recommend that you buy the book and make up your own mind. But I guess unless Linda Ashcroft can find more evidence of her relationship with Jim Morrison, true or not, her story is always going to have a large shadow of doubt casting over it."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"This is not a bad book if it was presented for what it was FICTION.

The reader will begin to doubt from very early on when the author clearly uses specific dialogue as if writing a play...Memory is one thing but to remember word for word dialogue from 30 years before seems ridiculous to say the least..I could have made a similiar claim and built a whole story around a love affair even though I was born AFTER he died..after all I have just as much &quot;evidence&quot; as the author does..."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"I have read this book and it is one of the best books I have ever read about anybody. Linda Ashcroft has written a beautiful love story about the relationship she had with the Lizard King himself, Jim Morrison. I believe her, and until anyone has walked in her shoes or lived her life they cannot judge her and have no right to do so. I have heard stories that she has lied, but in my opinion, it doesn't matter whether the book is true or not- it only matters if it is good. I would read this book either way. I also like this book because she showed a side of Jim that is ususally ignored- a loving, intelligent side (not to mention, romantic).Thank you Linda, for showing everyone this side of him, because so many books (and a certain movie by Oliver Stone) made him out to be a demon. In my opinion, Jim would be very proud of you, because you did him a great justice. I highly recommend this book.

It was well written, and very absorbing.It's pretty clearly a work of fiction. Why Ashcroft didn't market it as such is a mystery to me, but if you take it for what it is, it's a very enjoyable read.People have written historical fiction featuring all sorts of long deceased famous characters: Edgar Allen Poe, Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, lots of biblical characters, etc. So why not Jim Morrison? He's a rather fascinating character, a worthy subject for a work of fiction.Ashcroft describes herself as having always been very interested in writing. One wonders if she began this work of fantasy back when she was a teenager. When I was a teenager...I wrote a few stories about myself being personally acquainted with rock stars and tv personalities. Of course, they weren't so well written as Ashcroft's pseudo-memoir, and of course I certainly wouldn't have been foolish enough to publish them as biographies.It's paperback. Get it used. Read it.

While there are alot of people who doubt the truth in her story, i have cross referenced it myself and i'll say this.... If nothing else she did her homework before writing it. The book begins by giving us a little backgorund on herself, but promptly proceeds to her time with Morrison. From their first meeting to their last 4 yrs later (when he leaves for Paris) her story kept my full attention. For me the most intresting part of this book was the elements of their relationship, wich seemed a cross beteween lovers (though they never actually had sex) and that of siblings. Linda seems to be someone Jim wants to protect from his lifestyle yet he cant protect her from the aspects of himself that created that lifestyle.While there are traits portrayed in this book which Morrison was well known for, there are much fewer than one would expect. Instead you see a new side of Morrison. Not only an intellectual side, but a sensitive and very caring side. (maybe this is part of the initial doubt about the truths of this book?) In short, this book portrays Morrison in a way we dont always see, from the view point of a woman with wich he allgedly had a very different relationship with and who was protected (by him) from his fame. Defintly worth reading... even if your not a fan. As to it's truths, thats up to the reader to decide."},{"Title":"Wild Child: Life with Jim Morrison","review":"It probably wouldn't be that difficult to say you had an affair with Jim Morrison (I'm certain many did) but a &quot;relationship&quot; is another matter.

Come on, if I was dating a famous rock star, I'd probably have at least ONE picture to show. Of course there is the obligatory break-in where all evidence (including the wedding rings!) was stolen....It was amazing that they went right to the closet where everthing was stored, took the evidence and left the closed box to be found by the author at a later date ....Call me a skeptic, but I'm just not convinced."},{"Title":"An essay on philosophical method,","review":"Collingwood is one of the best philosophers in the tradition of the German Idealists--indeed, reading his work will do more to help you to understand Hegel than reading almost anything else will. Aside from being a great philosopher, he is also an extremely clear writer, and he is able, in simple prose, to demonstrate how dialectical ideas have direct and obvious bearing on everyday life. This book should be the basic \\"organon\\" for modern philosophers, but it is, sadly, rarely read. Reading this can improve your understanding of logic, of natural science, of induction and deduction, of historical method, of the distinctive nature of philosophy, of language, and more. It is also an excellent companion to his other great work, \\"Speculum Mentis.\\" If you know Collingwood only from his writings on art and/or history, you owe it to yourself to read this work (and Speculum Mentis), to understand the deeper philosophical context behind those writings. (Of course, if you don't know his important and influential writings on art and history, you should read those too!)

After listening to the tapes I went to other sources to read the actual words and was astonished at the differences in how I would say what I read and the actual pronunciation of the words.

I was stuck in a rut with color selection and this book is helping me to spice things up a little."},{"Title":"Creative Guide to Color & Fabric","review":"The &#34;Creative Guide to Color & Fabric&#34; book is great. I had lost my whole collection of these during a move and am so Thankful to be able to replace them. Yes I would recommend this book to anyone who quilts."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"I have owned this book for awhile. It is a good overview of metal smithing but it is very weak on details. It is extremely difficult to actually make any of the items shown if you haven't seen them done by an instructor. I definitely would not recommend this book for anyone who is a novice and wants to make jewelry based on its instructions."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This book has an extraordinary amount of information in it and I highly recommend it for beginners and advanced metalsmiths alike. It is a definite must have any any metalsmiths library.What this book is: This book is a reference book which touches on many techniques used within the field of metalsmithing and jewelery making. I've been a silversmith for over 15 years and I learned quite a bit from this book. Personally, I think the title of the book is a bit misleading.Though it does touch on an enormous amount of invaluable information, that's pretty much all it does is touch on it. I certainly wouldn't call it \\"Complete Metalsmith\\". The book is illustrated by very small basic drawings, some of which can be a little bit hard to understand.What this book isn't: This book is not a typical How To book. You're not going to see illustrations or instructions on how to make specific jewelry pieces. And you're barely going to see much in the way of drawings on how to actually do the techniques described. It's more like a text book of techniques without much in the way of visuals.If you are the type who learns better by illustrations, then I would suggest The Workbench Guide to Jewelry Techniques by Anastasia Young, which I received yesterday and is an absolutely beautiful book with loads of information and gorgeous photographs. And the price is extremely reasonable for such an excellent book.But if you can swing it, I would recommend both of these books. I wouldn't want to be without either of them."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This was a book I purchased prior to my first class in jewelry metalsmithing. It is certainly a great book and full of \\"must have\\" information for the more advanced student. My instructor referred to it as the \\"teacher's manual\\" and as I still had many unanswered questions about basic metalsmithing, she suggested I purchase Tim McCreight's other book titled, \\"Jewelry...Fundamentals of Metalsmithing\\"... I received this book last week and have found it is more to my level of basic skills... Tim McCreight is a great author and I highly recommend his books."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"As an owner of the 1991 edition of \\"The Complete Metalsmith\\" I was floored by the additions to the new (professional) version. The old copy seemed to be primarily a fingertip guide, not making much sense unless used for reference. The new edition on the other hand is absolutely readable, and in color! The chapters are organized much better, explanatory text has been expanded in all the right places, and almost 100 pages of (great) information have been added. If you are into working metal, buy it!-Ian"},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"I have been working with silver, brass, and copper wire and sheet metal for about 3 years now. I consider myself a beginner to the wide world of metalsmithing and often take on projects that are very complex to stretch myself. This book is not only confidence building but motivating for me to try new techniques or improve those I have already learned. I carry it with me on trips for reading on the plane or in the hotel or at the pool, reach for it at the end of the day as good bed time reading and when I am in the studio working on creating. Great illustrations, and explanations, though I am not scared of trying anything and failing and trying again. I also bring my book to my fabrication class and find it a great reference to aid my plans in designing a project with my instructor to plan the techniques I'd like to incorporate into a larger composition. I got this book as a birthday present, and it's the gift that keeps on giving well beyond the $30. it cost."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This is a great book, specially if your are just starting. It has great advice of all sorts and it guides you step by step in the process of making with very easy to follow drawings and explanations. I highly recommend to anyone intrested in small scale metalsmith or jewelry making. It even tells you how to lay out your workshop."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"You will have difficulty learning to make jewelry using this book. It is more of a lightweight survey of techniques than a \\"how to do it\\" book. It can serve as a reminder for those who already know a technique but haven't done it in a while.When I first started making jewelry I bought the earlier edition and found it woefully lacking in depth in some ares, especially choosing torches and soldering. The new book has more topics but not much more depth. The sections on soldering and torches are still too superficial to be useful to either the novice or expert. It is much more of a student guide than a \\"Professional Edition\\". If you want more depth in a survey book get Jewelry Making for Schools, Tradesmen and Craftsmen by Murray Bovin."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"I have fallen in love with this book and Tim McCreight.In all seriousness though, if you have an interest in working with metal, but don't know what specifically you want to do with it, or don't know where to start - buy this book (or the slightly lighter student version).I bought the book with the intention of picking up some welding/cutting knowledge and wound up discovering my previously unknown obsession with enameling and patination. The book summarizes many different techniques and methods of working with metal and gives a basic description of what the processes involve. It's enough to use alone on some of the techniques, and on the rest it's enough to assist you in figuring out what supplies you'll need to proceed and/or whether or not you'd be served in buying another book specific to that process. Regardless of whether or not the book covers each process completely or not (pretty much impossible unless it was to weigh 50lbs), it's an invaluable reference and very motivating and inspiring to have around. You want this book!"},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"No wonder this book is THE first book recommended by metalsmiths. This book gives great detail about all aspects of the craft. I see it staying on my bench from now on."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"So well illustrated explanations are great, book lies flat, a wonder for those of us that do not have teachers around. Just what I needed to give me confidence."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"this book gives lessons on how to do pretty much everything pertaining to the craft of jewelry making. i'm very pleased with the amount of information, i just wish this book offered project ideas on on how to apply the lessons learned. thats my only complaint, and otherwise i truly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This book is fantastic, very well written and easy to understand. I love the big spiral binding that allows it to lay flat while I'm working on something and constantly referencing it. I'm primarily a glass artist with a strong desire to learn certain metal techniques to incorporate with my glass jewelry - without spending hundreds of hours and dollars on special classes. I can find exactly what I want to learn and more in Tim McCreight's magnificent book. I'll be using and enjoying this book for many years to come. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This book provides a wonderfully complete overview of a wide variety of silversmithing techniques. It doesn't provide detailed how-to instructions; if you are new to metalsmithing you will probably need additional instruction, but it is still a very useful resource. I learned a lot from it."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"Wow! Great for people who want to know EVERYTHING about making jewelery. I really appreciated the clear instructions, visual layouts, and the levels of each craft described. This edition describes the homemade version, the tools you can make or buy, as well as the more industrial method for almost every technique covered in the book.Clear and concise, each metal is presented from the periodic table giving a description of it's properties. Great for scientists types and for people who want to create their products in historic ways at home."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"Very detailed book.

Probably the best available for the jewellery-oriented metalsmith. Certainly \\"the one\\" that beginners should buy. If you can afford it, spend your money on this Professional Edition over the regular edition(s)."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"Need I say more? This is the text my son used in his silversmithing class at Hopi HS. Now that he's in his 30s and wants to return to silversmithing, we were amazed to not only find his old text, but an IMPROVED version.Don't think twice about it. If you're a metalworker, you should have this in your library. Period. Other books may go into greater detail on specific things, but this is the \\"bible\\" for this craft and any serious craftsman will be using this book as reference until it falls apart.I considered buying the hardbound version, but I think the spiral version will lay flatter and actually be more user-friendly and less prone to damage if handled with reasonable care and not taken out into the shop.Worth every penny."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This is my first go-to book when I am doing something new and need to know how to get started. It is encyclopedic in that it covers everything, but it does not go into a lot of detail on some subjects. It seems to have enough to get you started, and a lot of details on setting up workshop, tools, etc with less coverage of the more advanced techniques.The pro edition is a spiral bound hard cover, and it also has more pages and more subjects than the cheaper student edition. I bought the pro version since I would would hate to end up buying both if I find out it had something essential. There is also a super-deluxe version that has a DVD, The Pro edition is the one you want.The book has lots of reference material, details on tools, metals, techniques, etc. so if you are doing jewelry work or metalsmithing it has enough in it to make it worth buying. It does not have pretty pictures, and does not have a lot of details for the more advanced techniques, but in those cases you really need to buy a book devoted to a single technique to get enough coverage.I bought this and Jinks McGrath'sThe Encyclopedia of Jewelry-Making Techniques: A Comprehensive Visual Guide to Traditional and Contemporary Techniquesand they are a good pair. McGraths's book is less thorough but he has a different perspective on things and also includes lots of nice photos. It is more visual and maybe that is more useful for some people, but I find them both essential. If I had to buy just one, it would be the McCreight book since I can live without the photos, but for the very beginner I think the McGrath book may be a little easier to get into."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"Recently I have returned to playing with metal in designing jewelry, mixed media art, and fine art. The author of this book - Tim McCreight is world-known for his work and providing books to help others learn the basics and some of his own \\"tricks\\" in manipulating metal. I have to say this book is one of his best and probably the one I hold in highest regard. It it thorough. It is well written. It is full of high quality, often with color to help know which piece is what when working an item. It is well organized. The appendices are SUPERB - from safety (ventilation, repetitive motion, chemicals) to suppliers to geometric formulas to melting points to conversion factors to properly photographing jewelry AND MORE! It is a great starting point for all those who are seriously interested in pursuing this type of work as a hobby or art.Some of McCreight's other books (e.g.Practical Joining) are often rehashes with a bit more thoroughness of this book, while others (e.g. on PMC - precious metal clay) cover other topics. Of the numerous books by MeCreight in my library, I refer to this one first. The spriral binding is great and thus when I have to review something when working, the book lies flat and doesn't need to be held down in order to stay in place.The only drawback is that the cover (at least my version) tends to attact fuzz or dog hair when I take it from my work area to review sections in my home. Weird...luckily tape takes care of that problem for I don't want to give up my pets!So for beginners to advanced workers in metal - get this book first...or second if you want a more beginner book to see if this work is really for you. Other books by McCreight should be considered IF you are interested in pursuing various aspects of metalwork in detail (e.g. \\"Metals Technic\\" - book based on his workshops and focused on producing quality pieces in various methodologies...but some of the images in it have much to be desired - ?new addition might help that???)."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"The book has a lot of useful tips, tools, methods and so many other things. I am satisfied. Remember there is a version with some video orientation that is more expensive but could be useful if you dont have a teacher."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"After taking a intro to metalworking class over the weekend where Tim McCreight's book, this version, was highly recommended by the instructor, I ordered a copy immediately. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in the book and its contents. It is truly a reference book, and not a very detailed one either. I looked immediately for info on using a rolling mill, and other than a description of leaf embossing using one, nothing else. No info on what I am sure are a number of other uses, nor on the care of such a machine. Also, no real mention of bronze, something that would be extremely useful in these times of inflated gold prices.All entries are short and succinct but extremely limited in depth. Some people complain about the use of drawings, I actually like these, but the other factors are compelling shortcomings. One of which is the binding. Yes, it is a spiral binding, but the quality of the paper seems too thin for that format, it feels as though the pages would practically fall out within a very short time. I was afraid to look at it for fear the pages would rip out. I am returning it this morning and am going to try Jinks McGrath's book. It looks a bit better on line at least. She does seem to have a good description of the care and use of a rolling mill, and bronze is mentioned.The Complete Jewelry Making Course: Principles, Practice and Techniques: A Beginner's Course for Aspiring Jewelry Makers"},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"Extremely comprehensive and clues given to different processes and the use of tools and elements.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"I've had and used McCreight's original \\"Complete Metalsmith\\" for years and wasn't sure I needed the new version. After owning it for several months now I couldn't be happier. The author assumes that the reader is as interested in WHY things happen as he is. This is not a step-by-step project book, but a bench tool. Do you need to know how to score metal to make a sharp corner? How can you tell when a piece of metal is annealed? Have you been bezel setting stones and are now ready to advance to a prong setting? Ready to make a hinge? Casting? Fusing? Repouss&eacute;? Need to know what the Precious Metal Clay craze is about and how to start? It's all in here and the information is presented in a format made for the beginner or the experienced jeweler. He even covers how to photograph your work.I love that McCreight shows several ways of doing things so that if you don't have the equipment or tools, you can still proceed. In his typical style, the author has thought of everything. He's even made a smaller and less expensive version of the book for the \\"starving artists\\" and students among us.I have the version with the CD and use the software on my Palm regularly in my metalsmithing classes.This book is a worthy successor to the old version and should become as much a classic."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This new &quot;pro&quot; edition of The Complete Metalsmith is everything you would expect it to be. Detailed, accurate, and filled with many useful diagrams. It is a significant improvement over the regular edition in terms of topic depth and scope.The hard covers are nice and the elastic tie to keep the book closed (and any loose notes you've accumulated inside) is a really nice addition. I'm not a big fan of spiral binding -- I'm sure it's the only way to make a thick reference that will lay flat on the workbench, but the spiral binding makes the pages difficult to turn.If you're a jewelry professional, the pro edition is definitely the way to go. If you're a beginner, the regular edition is probably sufficient (and $15 less)."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"It is with the highest recommendation that I encourage any metalsmith, be they beginner or advanced, to have this book on hand. It is chalk full to the brim with resourceful information, much of which can be used on a daily basis. I had the priviledge of learning under Tim McCreight's instruction at MECA for 4 years, and learned so much from him. He is a great teacher, but an even better book designer and author. This revised version of the original Complete Metalsmith has not only refreshed my memory of various techniques and how to do them, but it has also introduced me to many new ones, and best of all, many home-made systems to achieve certain results that normally require specific equiptment. Each time I open this book, I am inspired immediately to go try this or that. There is so much to this book that I couldn't adequately describe it in detail, except to say that if you're looking for a comprehensive and thorough guide to the craft/art of metalsmithing, this is a must-have book!

There is a technical discussion about the physical properties of various metals, what makes them soft or hard, alloys, melting points, etc. Information on electroplating, shaping metals, joining metals, welding, casting, etching, patinizing. There are many arts and techniques introduced, such as wire pulling and metal clays. This book would be particularly useful to someone interested in metal sculpture or jewelry making. A nice reference book."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This book is a wonderful overview of most of the techniques of metalsmithing. The professional edition is sturdier for the most part than the older edition the book is designed to lat flat on the bench it is obvious it was designed by someone who designs functional objects for a living. It is the first book I recommend to anyone getting into metal work, from blacksmithing to jewelry making. It is a definite must-have and a classic of its kind. This said, if you get into any one technique more, specialty books are helpful, but this is the best overview out there. I don't give five stars often but this was wonderful."},{"Title":"Complete Metalsmith: Professional Edition","review":"This book has been very helpful to me in my jewelry-making course. The explanations are generally clear and Mr. McCreight covers a wide variety of topics. I've bought several books on metalsmithing, but this is the one I go to first to familiarize myself with a new technique before trying it out. I wouldn't want to use this book to teach myself metalsmithing; some explanations that seem very clear in the comfort of your study turn out to be just a bit terse when you're at your bench alone with the book and a lump of metal that resists becoming a piece of jewelry. But with the help of a teacher who can fill in the gaps, this book is very useful indeed.My decision to award this book four stars is due mainly to flaws in the tables at its end. For instance, one table reports that the number of Troy ounces in a Troy pound is the same as the number of Troy ounces in a pound avoirdupois, a bit over 14. Another tells us that the conversion factor for going from 18kt gold to platinum (how much more the same volume of platinum will weigh) is the same as the conversion factor for going from silver to platinum, about 2.06, thus wrongly telling us that silver and 18kt gold have the same density. Those are just the errors I caught as I casually looked over the tables. They shake my confidence in the other numbers provided and convince me I'd better get out my calculator and my CRC manual to verify those tables before relying on them.Tables like these are usually taken from other sources and compiled by assistants, so I expect those errors are errors either of transcription or in the source material. In the area in which he's expert, metal smithing, Mr. McCreight has been a sure teacher who hasn't led me astray. It would be a very good idea, however, for someone to fix those tables. They do reduce confidence in an otherwise excellent book. Pictures and more illustrations would really help clarify some of the explanations in the text."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],W={key:0},q={key:1};function C(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,D)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(E,[["render",C],["__scopeId","data-v-9a7ce04f"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/28.md","filePath":"quotes/28.md"}'),G={name:"quotes/28.md"},O=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{B as __pageData,O as default};
