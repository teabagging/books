I, however, did not enjoy reading it. I read it through to the end, but it was tough. I did not like any of the characters except for Nelly, & Cathy (the daughter). When the dialogue was of Joseph, it was extremely difficult to read. I had to force myself to read it aloud just to figure out what he was saying. I don't like to work that hard when reading a book. For its time, I know it was a grand book. The writing was fine, but it was depressing and almost all the characters too flawed for my taste."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Brilliantly written; I'll give the novel that much. The plot masterfully contrived, characters well developed, settings enigmatically constructed, the novel as a whole was from a literary standpoint a success. However, the language is consistently dark throughout. The wording carries heavy negative overtones and a depressed, pessimistic and even evil mood pervades from the first to the end. Relief from the darkness finally breaks through only in the end when one character steps beyond herself and assists another in elevating himself. Otherwise, bitterness and selfish ambition drive the story. The depravity runs rampant from bad to worse as characters systematically use, degrade, and abuse one another to work out their bitterness stemming from one father's mistakes and failed parenting.If you love unique, dark characters, twisted plots, and the study of the effects of family dysfunction on a multigenerational level than the novel will not only be worthwhile, but also enjoyable as few would disagree with Emily Bronte's genius as a writer. However, I would caution that the book might not best be read in the dead of winter or over a prolonged rainy spell as it is rather depressing. But on a sunny, warm day, with ample positive diversions, the novel may not only be a challenging companion, it will likely make you very thankful for the companions you personally have that are altogether so unlike the characters in the story."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"'Wuthering Heights' by Emily Bronte is a dark, brooding novel of unfulfilled love. Most everyone dies young and unhappy. Everyone seems to fall in love with first cousins, which has me believe their strange behavior is in part due to in-breeding. And there is our lead male character, Heathcliff, who leads a vindictive and sadistic life after losing his honey, Catherine (..she was also a bit loopy, and died young). This book is whole-heartedly depressing, and not at all romantic ... unlike the famous film adaptation with Merle Oberon and Lawrence Olivier.So I really cannot see why this book is so highly rated. Oh, the prose itself is okay. The dialogue is fine. But the story is so narrowly focused (the romantic failings of two intermingled families in rural Yorkshire circa 1800) and the characters morose. Healthy amounts of anti-depressants and a Majorca vacation are needed for these fools.Bottom line: almost laughably dark and twisted. Emily Bronte must of been one very unhappy woman."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"&quot;It is as if Emily Bronte could tear up all that we know human beings by, and fill these unrecognizable transparencies with such a gust of life that they transcend reality.&quot; -Virginia WoolfDamn straight, sister! I gotta tell you, read this book in the *summer time*. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, read this in the gloom of winter, as I stupidly did.The epic story of Catherine and Heathcliff plays out against the dramatic backdrop of the wild English moors, and presents an astonishing vision of fate and obsession, passion and REVENGE.This classic book is a bummer. Not that it's bad writing, but my oh my.. it makes you so sad! Your heart just goes out for Heathcliff and the depression he faces. But also, the um... &quot;inter-breeding&quot; (*blush*) is quite disturbing!! One cousin marries one other cousin and they have kids who marry their other cousins, I was just surprised that the whole lot of them weren't, &quot;messed up&quot;.I really wouldn't recommend this book for happy people. If you want some romance and a historical novel, read &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. My favorite."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It was very hard for me to get into this story. The words were very old-fashioned, and some scenes seemed to go on for a long time. I thought it had a good plot, but I really only liked the first half. It took me a long time to finish this, and when I finally did, I felt that it ended abruptly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I just can't past the boring words to understand the plot. There is this guy who wants to take revenge on everyone, but he loves this one girl, that he can't have, and he marries this other girl to get her money. What is going on here? It sounds like a season of All My Children or any other day-time soap opera. Maybe everyone from the Heights and the Grange should appear on Jerry Springer and fight it out. Needless to say, I did not like the gypsy orphan and the bratty little princess whining about everything that came their way. I bet Geraldo could get them to confront each other about thier problems."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WOW! I had a hard time at first adjusting to the difference in 1800 language and todays, but man I am sure glad I stuck with it. What a wonderful book. No surprise that it is in the \\"classics\\" catagory. Beautifully written love, hate, passion, and lonely darkness novel. Think I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't know what really needs to be said about Emily Bronte's 1847 novel, the brilliantly plotted, superbly structured, & extremely engrossing WUTHERING HEIGHTS, 'cept maybe, \\"if you haven't read it, you really ought to becuz you're in for an amazing treat\\". Quite frankly, I'm jealous of the \\"uninitiated\\" who are about to embark on such a fantastic \\"journey\\", given the great road that lies ahead.For the sake of prospective first time readers who need a bit more info to tempt them into taking the plunge, I'll just say that THIS is the book that made famous the idea of rambling about on a moor with someone whom you fancied. Need more? Well, the protagonist is named Heathcliff (you've probably heard that named tossed about somewhere) and it is he who dominates both halves of this two generational story. Still not enuf? Okay; while it has been viewed by many as a great love story, WH is actually - in the words of Bronte biographer Lucasta Miller - \\"more Romantic (as in the literary style) than romantic\\". Furthermore, while new readers may have already experienced - perhaps, in reading other novels and certainly in watching tv shows and movies - the particular \\"twist\\" on the traditional method of narration that Bronte employs, it must be noted that SHE was the FIRST great writer to use it and, all these decades later, WUTHERING is still unsurpassed in its use. That's about all I dare say so as not to spoil it for new readers.In any event, the primary reason that I am writing this review is to note on the wonderful - albeit relatively short - introduction that is included in this Penguin Classics edition, one that was written by Monash University (in Melbourne) prof Pauline Nestor. If you're like me and enjoy reading intros and other critical pieces about this impressionistic romance AND don't like \\"spoilers\\", I will, as in the case of the novel, keep my comments about the content (of the intro) to a minimum. Indeed, it will be enuf to say that those WUTHERING fans who are tired of seeing Marxist, feminist, revisionist, or any other \\"ist\\"-type reading on this novel will be delighted by Nestor's take on this masterpiece, one that largely focuses on its \\"transgressive power\\". She also briefly critiques many of the various \\"popular\\" interpretations of WH that have been embraced over the years.So, while first time readers will delight in this novel's power - in regard to both its craftsmanship and its ability to rouse the emotions - those who have already read it will enjoy the intro's study as to WHY it has such power, including the power to maintain such a hold over those who have experienced it.Also, like other Penguin Classics editions, this one is annotated, which is particularly helpful in the case of WUTHERING HEIGHTS becuz, as newcomers will quickly discover, the Yorkshire dialect of a certain character is - to put it mildly - difficult for most modern readers to understand.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first time I read this book, I was 11. It was fairly interesting but I didn't give it any second thoughts. Five years later, I pick it up again and finish it in a day. I am so in love with this book.

Going into it, of course I knew of its reputation. But I also knew of its size. And at the same time, one can't help but think how a Victorian Era woman could cross time and gender conflict to get in touch with a 17 year old guy.Boy, was I wrong.Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a book to get lost in. The multi-layered, time jumping story absorbs the reader quickly and effortlessly, and doesn't let go until long after one's stay in the English countryside. A lot of the characters in this book are bad people, but none of them are bad characters. From powerful, crystal clear motives to mystery and revenge, Wuthering Heights has it all. And it's not going anywhere, so you might as well hop on the bandwagon and read it.For those of you not in the know, Wuthering Heights is centered around a man named Heathcliff, who rents a house to a certain Mr. Lockwood early on in the book. Lockwood, our narrator, is shocked by some of the conditions Heathcliff is living in, and then asks his maid, Nelly, about it. Lockwood transcribes Nelly's words, creating two narrators.At one point in the novel, Lockwood is writing down Nelly's words about Isabella reading Heathcliff's letter. That's four narrator's at once. Oh. My. Gosh. But don't you worry. Emily Bronte is no lightweight, and she can manage each and every character and story thread. I've touched upon this once and will continue with it for a while: there's a reason this book is a classic and so widely read.On top of the plot, which is all consuming and entertaining (It's almost likeHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1),A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), or some other fantasy novel the way it creates its own world), there is this fierce underlying theme of love. But what's so great about this books theme is that its not a thesis statement. This book is a discussion of love, what it can do to man, what it creates, what it destroys. You'll find more academic truth in this novel about man's condition than you ever will in ay bare bones medical text book.The strongest point in this book is the characters. Isabella, Linton, Heathcliff, Catherine ( A woman after my own heart), and many, many more stick with you for a long time. Nelly, especially, who isn't just a lame narrator. She truly brings some stuff to the table, and I've known a lot of people like her, so I have a soft spot for her in my heart.It's hard to write a review of this novel because it's literally just so good. And that sounds cheesy, because its a classic and if you're here, you know its supposed to be good. But I cannot stress enough how this one not only lives up to, but it exceeds expectations for how good its supposed ot be. Don't pass this up."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've read this several times. It is a good read, but it's more of a story about how NOT to treat people. It at least makes you appreciate your own life after reading it, but it is very depressing. It all ends well with the characters, but not one of my favorite classic novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel was completely different from what I expected. The characters took me by surprise and despite their rotten personalities I couldn't help but love them and wish their sorrow to end."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When Wuthering Heights was originally published in 1847, it was not well received. The depictions of passionate love affairs on the moors, cruelty and hatred were considered to vulgar and too shocking for audiences of the day. Wuthering Heights is now considered a classic of English literature and one of the best novels by a woman writer of the nineteenth century.There is something outright haunting about the characters of Wuthering Heights. They complement the eerie moor setting entirely. None of the characters is likable really, but there is something about them that hypnotizes the reader. Heathcliff's passionate love, rage, hatred and unbelievable cruelty, Catherine's puerile and fickle nature just to name a few.Wuthering Heights is not a happy love story by any stretch of the imagination. It is dark, yet passionate. It explores both sides of human nature. The characters can love passionately, then hate completely and cruelly.It is a bit difficult to get into. The opening chapters are very dark and Bront takes a while to set up the characters, especially with the frame story involving Mr. Lockwood, but if the reader sticks with it, the characters are great, the plot is twisted and the raw emotional language Bront uses are worth waiting for.See more of my reviews @ [...]Bottom Line: Wuthering Heights is a must read for English literature lovers and dark romance lovers alike. It's complex, passionate characters are awful but hypnotizing.View all my reviews"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The story is timeless, with something for everyone!

First of all it was hard to keep up with because the author jumped around to many differnet characters. Secondly, the old English used was hard to understand and having to jump back and forth to the foot notes made you lose your train of thought. It also wasn't the type of story I though it would be. I had heard it was a love story between Heathcliff and Catherine but I didn't feel the love.

This is little more than a Victorian soap opera -- probably one of the worst novels I have ever read. It starts out fine, but mid way through I am reduced to guffaws (and this state of hilarity has occured every time I have attempted to read this novel over the past 30 years). The prose is overwrought and the characters . . . for the life of me I am unable to explain other readers' adoration of either Heathcliff or Cathy. If you want spooks and atmosphere and Brontes, read Jane Eyre instead. It's far superior."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If one did not know it was the famed &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;- and read this book, I'm sure he would have thought it was a script for morning soap opera. Not only the story is highly unbelievable, it's way to melodramatic and disturbing. It's a good writing on Bronte's part but it is not a good story. If the book had not been written in such a descriptive and well-fabricated style, this would have been considered as a trashy women's romantic novel. You can tell it's written by a woman after all."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is an absolute mess. It's told in the first person by different narrators but as I was bored and so unfocused a lot of the time I was sometimes not sure who was narrating. Heathcliffe the 'hero' was annoying and in some ways pathetic and the heroine Cathy seemed like a spoiled brat. I didn't like the use of dialect either- It's a lot easier to read English as it should be written and imagine an accent to it rather than see these strange alien words in print. What an absolute mess of a book, I can't believe all the praise I see heaped on it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was very pleased with the book,\\"Wurthering Heights\\" and the service in sending it to me.

Yet from what I understand this pernicious book is taught by the liberal elite in our nation's colleges. We must carry on the fight to protect young minds!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For starters, with apologies to women-studies majors everywhere, Emily Bronte was a generally weak woman in poor health who wrote stilted poetry and a horrible novel- Wuthering Heights. Far from being the romanticized feminine icon she is portrayed to be today, the real Emily Bronte was a very lonely and timid young woman who lived 39 years on this planet and accomplished nothing- leaving behind no friends or family to mourn her short time on this earth. She WAS however a precursor to the modern liberal movement in that she too lived in a fantasy world, the only difference being Ms. Bronte actually named her's. She called it \\"Gondal\\"- and described it as a magical place where everything worked out just the way Emily liked and no one could say or do anything she didn't agree with. Yes, this the hero of feminism... If ONLY there had been a literary critic in Gondal, we might have been spared the Wuthering Heights! I usually enjoy \\"classics,\\" those books that, as Clements so astutely pointed out, everyone wants to have read but no one wants to read. But Wuthering Heights? Ach- I hate this book with a passion. The characters are almost all either pathetic, melodramatic, overly hateful, stupid, incredibly annoying, or some combination thereof. Women have a strange tendency to have babies with no prior warning. Live dogs are randomly hung from hooks, apparently to die. And the plot becomes ridiculously predictable once the simple premise is accepted that the hero has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It was an awful, hateful book- I spent almost the whole time hoping the characters would die of syphilis so I wouldn't have to read about them whining all the time. On the plus side- Wuthering Heights could make a good movie...if they totally changed the dialogue...and reworked the characters completely. Basically, they would have to film an entirely different movie and just keep the setting (and the name) the same. By the time I finished the book I wanted to take my soldering torch and burn it. My only fear was that if I did, Catherine might be resurrected and proclaim her love for Heathcliff profusely as the book burns away. Actually, that would have been a better ending to the story. Alas I suppose I'll just end up using the book as a clay pigeon."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know many people love this book, but I've read it 3 times, and I just can't appreciate it. While I have no complaint with the technical aspects of it (writing style, grammar, etc.), the story drives me a little bit crazy and makes me depressed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I gave this book only 3 stars because I didn't consider it enjoyable reading. I'm sure some will glean much from the writing style of the author. It might be of interest to some to make a study of the different characters and try to figure out what made them as they were. With that said, most likely, to most everyone else this book would be rated with at least 4 stars. For myself, I was really glad to finish it and move on."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Just goes to show that love stories with odd twist span the ages. Is a great story if you like stories with depth."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"'A masterpiece' probably sounds like a clich&eacute; for this novel, but that is exactly what it is. From the start, one is captivated by the story; at times shocking, disturbing, but above all, amazing. After I finished reading it, I came to realize that it was a tragedy that Emily Bront died at such a young age, leaving behind her poems and this one, magnificent novel. Yet, even if she had lived long enough to write other books, this one would still have outstripped them all.The language used in the novel is lyrical and beautiful. Once you start reading it, you can understand why 'Wuthering Heights' is often regarded as the most successful poetic novel ever written. Emily was, after all, a poet, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be to write poetic prose and manage to do it right, yet this is what she has done. Her settings and characters are well described, and the plot is masterfully executed.As to the characters themselves, they are remarkably believable. We can identify with them in their struggles, their hopes and fears, and we feel the same emotions that they feel. Heathcliff is an outstanding literary figure, whilst Catherine, despite her faults, is and remains a classical heroine.Although there are many film and television adaptations of 'Wuthering Heights' (and a new one will soon be coming out), I am proud to say that I haven't seen any, and that I never will. The last thing I would like to do is spoil one of my favourite books with some trashy, messed-up Hollywood movie or television serial. I have a unique image of how I see the story and characters, and that's how it's going to stay.Simply put, everyone should give this book a try, even if they don't like classic novels. It has a thrilling plot, remarkable characters and beautiful language. Condemed when it was first published in 1847, 'Wuthering Heights' stands out today as one of the greatest novels in the English language.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this (like many of the other classics that I got) because I had never read it before.

I am glad that I read it, but probably would not read it again."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I absolutely love this book! Anyone who reads classics should consider this one.

I found the language and accents of some of the characters difficult to understand at first but as you read further into the book, it flows and the plot thickens. I thoroughly recommend reading this book, I won't give away the storyline but I think you should persevere if you find it difficult to take in at first."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I know some say it's hard to read and understand which could be true.

I swear I was so angry at Heathcliff I couldn't even fall asleep. I cannot believe how cruel he was. Actually, everyone was cruel and self-serving in their own way.

And I'm glad Heathcliff is dead.BUT yes there is a but, I read some wise words not too long ago and I thought I would share them. In not so many words it goes like this...If a book ever impacts you in any way, whether it be positive or negative, then it can be considered a great book.Hmmmmmmm...interesting. It's true, this is actually a great book. Not inspiring, but definitely thought provoking and apparently for me emotion provoking."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I recommend buying this book because not only is it a literary genius, but it also had notations on the back that helped you understand why a certain word was used or what a word means. I thought the actual book itself had good binding and it was a sturdy paperback. Although I do have to say that if you have never read this book and you don't want to be spoiled, do not read the introduction that is in the beginning of the book. Overall, I recommend the Oxford Edition of Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wurthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a great book. It is set ing the moors of old England. Cathy and Heathcliff are two lovers, but when Cathy marries Heathcliff's rival, Edgar Linton, he vows revenge on both of them. The protagonist of the book is without a doubt, the narrator of the story, Nelly Dean. The antagonist is the vial, Heathcliff. She write the characters with such description, it is like they are right in the room with you. The plot is so well writing, it keeps you guessing at every turn.This book is written in the perspective of Nelly (Ellen) Dean. She is the care taker to Cathy through out the book, and one of Heathcliff's close friends. The theme has many interpretation, but I think the most noticeable is of the jealousy Heathcliff feels towards Edgar. It warns you of the dangers of jealousy and that i can drive anyone to the very brink of insanity. This book was one of the most intriguing, well written, passion filled, exciting, living you on the edge of your seat wanting more, creative books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. I would recommend this book to everyone, 5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When I first read Wuthering Heights, I was completely absorbed into the phantasmic world. While I have read gothic works like Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelly's \\"Frankenstein,\\" Wuthering Heights tramples them with it's intense passion of the central characters, Heathcliff and Catherine. Not everyone's going to love this book, most, if not all the characters, are amoral and cruel people isolated from society. Heathcliff is the classic Byronic Hero; brooding, passionate and driven by vengeance, definitley better than today's wannabe gothic characters(cough...Edward Cullen). Other than that it is poetically written, an open field of meadows and lonely households, snowy storms, etc. If gothic stories are your thing, then pick this up, be warned that despite being hyped as the archetypal story of forbidden romance, that is only half the tale which is filled with bitter revenge; buy this."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"haven't read it yet , its in good shape and it came in a timely fasion! thanx."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Depressing, obsessive, tormenting and heartwrenching.

Heathcliff is unforgettable. It's as if part of me is on the moors with Heathcliff and Catherine. There is something so haunting about their childhood romance that never went the way it should have. In fact, I think that this is one of the books that influenced me to write about children. It has a certain Edgar Allen Poe feel to it. It kind of reminds me of Annabelle Lee. The ghostly images of the loss of love by the sea.

Sure it is written in a lovely matter, but there are 15000 people with various English majors who can write beautifully as well. It's hailed as a love story, but at the core of it there isn't any love at all. Just an assortment of angry childish people all who are developed as a still birthed child.Heathcliff and (old) Catherine love each other. But WHY, they love each other is never granted in any regard. They are in love simply for the sake of having a story a write about. That's it. Then the characters themselves aren't just underdeveloped, but they're TERRIBLE people to add on top of that. I am not one of those people who feels the need to love each and every single character, or any of them actually, but this must at least backed up with something to frame the character.Heathcliff is a horrible person simply because, based on what was given of his character in the book, he was abused. Now this aspect of course warrants some sympathy for him. And even though he is vengeful while he is a child, this is completely understandable given how he is treated. However, as a man he does not grow at all. He degenerates to a sadist simply because he didn't get what he wants, why he wants Catherine is anybody's guest.I'll just stop here because I honestly can't go on. The book is far too terrible for me to even go through breaking down each miserable character paragraph by paragraph. To put this book simply; it's basically like an emo's version of a Tyler Perry story. The conflicts exist simply because the characters will it to."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was a terrible cut up version of the original which had little of the beauty of the real story. It was not worth the paper it was written on."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I've read a lot of the reviews below and many have said that this is a love story. If this is a love story then it is definitely is not my kind of love story. I felt that overall it was a very dark novel about horrible things happening to a variety of people. It was very difficult to get into any of the characters and overall I was fighting to get through it to the end. I love classic novels and Pride & Prejudice is my favorite but this one is not even in the same category...too dark for me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book on the recommendation that it was the finest English language novel ever written. Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots. But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I realize many would contest my opinion in this feverently, and I've argued first hand with many a Wuthering Heights fan, but I have to say with all honesty, this is the worst book I have ever read.The dryness of the plot is second only to the dryness of Emily Bronte's style. For a story attempting to establish themes of love and hatred, passion and apathy, the book is sure dull as hell.I simply can't see any saving quality in this book whatsoever, save the fact that nothing at all happens so you can skim through it without missing a single element of the non-existant plot. The climax of all action within the book is a scene one third of the way in the book where young Heathcliff hurls applesauce at his effeminate and whiny rival, and it just goes even further downhill from there.It is very obvious in her writing that Emily Bronte has never left her home, as her characters are all pallid one-dimensional reflections of her own disgusting parasitic victorian life. Never in a book, even with the most despisable of villans, have I let out such a cheer as a character died, because with the dying of each character in Wuthering Heights there is a feeling of, &quot;FINALLY.&quot; Every character is dying from page 1, in one way or another, and Wuthering Heights is the &quot;journey&quot; of seeing them to their graves, and breathing a sigh of relief, interlaced with mindless whining from one character or another about how the tea and scones are too cold today.If the use of the adjective &quot;Wuthering&quot; is not a warning enough, then read the first five pages. THe only thing I can thank Emily Bronte for is the knowledge that I'll never face pain as great as she has given me in trying to force my way through her book, and I am probably now able to withstand any sort of torture or physical torment by looking back and rememebering, &quot;It could be worse... I could have to listen to Joseph speak again, or Catherine whine.&quot;I realize there's going to be multiple posts debating this, in an &quot;Emperor's New Clothing&quot; sort of fashion of only those who are smart can see the meaning in this book, but the only meaning this book has is what literary critics and English Professors try to stuff it with, no different than the stuffing forcefully injected into a long-dead thanksgiving bird. For a moment, put away your pride, cast down your defensiveness at the view that you're supposed to enjoy this book, and ask yourself: Is there really anything of value in this entire novel? The critical mind will find the answer. The coward will continue to uphold the sanctity of victorian cow-dung. Enjoy your reading :)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Gah! This book is the most horrible thing I've read! Heathcliff is a horrible character! I didn't know I was ever suppose to root for him. He borders on crazy and even crazier. No one should be forced to read this dren. I'd rather be waterboardered than read this again...at least the psychological scars of waterboarding wouldn't last as long!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Being a pretty avid reader, I thought my classic repertoire should include Wuthering Heights. I had to basically force myself to read to the end. I have no problem with despicable, morally corrupt characters. The Fountainhead is one of my favorite novels. The problem is that the treatment of them by Bronte just lacks depth. I found the book to be tediously slow, dry, and repetitive. Maybe I just didn't get it, but I really hated this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a timeless classic.

The story crashes along with melodrama and emotional episodes galore; and when you set all that against the impossibly lonely and picturesque backdrop of the English moors, it's enough to snare any romantic heart. I won't give you the particulars of the plot... it is at its core a love story, but also a great deal more complicated than that. The relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine is all at once pure, spiritual, sexy, intensely stormy and destructive, in a way I've never seen done before in fiction.This is one novel that I feel like I could read over and over, submerge myself in the minds of each of the characters multiple times, and still not plumb the depth of its meaning. The writing is gorgeous, of course, with complexly-constructed but damn near-perfect sentences. This is an emotional, overwhelming, entirely un-sedate book -- a remarkable thing to emerge from Victorian times, from the impenetrable mind of a reclusive female poet. We'll never know what Emily Bronte was truly like, but she was clearly an incredible artist who deserved vastly more recognition than she ever got in her lifetime. The words positively thrum with passion. Truly incredible."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I received the incorrect copy. The image presented is not what I received.

No need to comment on the book itself, everyone knows that Wuthering Heights is a classic that can be read over and over."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Unlike most students, I did not have the pleasure of reading this classic and well-loved novel at school. And to be honest, it would not normally have made my reading list. But having read the Twilight novels three times, and Wuthering Heights being featured and quoted so many times, after a while I got curious and thought the only way to better understand the comparisons made by Stephenie Meyer, I just had to read it. At first, the old fashioned language took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten over that, the first third of the book started to really interest me. The characters created by Emily Bronte are certainly very unique, and the depths of their evil surpassed any characters I have come across to date. I was intrigued and started to really enjoy the novel, to the point where I was quite unable to put it down. In the end, I have to admit I was totally disappointed. What promised to be quite an exciting tale of unusual characters and a touch of haunting, left me completely unsatisfied, and questioning why this has become such a classic. I thought it was extremely well written, very interesting characters and well thought out, but in the end it was just someone's life story, that never really \\"got going\\". Given when this was written, I can certainly understand the waves such a novel would have made in the world of literature, but it just does not measure up to the modern day offering. I would say it is a good novel to read to have a better understanding of how this has shaped authors over the years, and perhaps us as readers too. I was just left feeling like there should and could have been more..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I purchased this for a college class. It was shipped on time and arrived in perfect condition. I didn't love this book, but I am not a huge Bronte fan. However, it is a classic for a reason and a good edition to any library."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Right, so either your love it or you hate it.The main characters, Heathcliff and Catherine, are impossible to like. Heatcliffe is vindictive and cruel and Catherine is a weak and cruel character herself. Not only that, they're both selfish and angry narrowminded. It's difficult to not be moved.And being moved is what this story does to you. If you cannot separate yourself from the Characters, and see the book just as a book, you're going to hate it. You WILL hate the characters and wish they would all just burn in methaphorical hell...But if you do manage to just enjoy the story as a story, which is difficult, then it's a thrilling book with many interesting characters, who submit themselves and each other to odd desputes and whatnot due to their odd character traits. Forgiveness is not really a word in this book and most of the story is about the frustrations from their social places.You might even enjoy the... erm... the social... Oh whatever. It's difficult to separate your feelings from what you're reading. And you keep wondering why they're so stupid and cruel.I aged 10 yrs from reading this books."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As CD production and quality was very good, good quality, pleasant reader.But the book it self I did not like.

I would say read it and be you own judge."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I bought this book and it took almost 3 weeks to get to me 2 states away. Should not have taken that long."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The REAL Housewives of Victorian EnglandMr. Lockwood comes to Wuthering Heights in order to rent Thrushcross Grange. He gets stuck there, with Mr. Heathcliff, a rude gentleman, a young woman, and several other strange people. While there, he stumbles upon the diaries of Catherine Earnshaw. After a strange dream, he runs back to town, where Ellen Dean \\"Nelly\\" tells him the story of Wuthering Heights.I'm sure most of you are familiar with a TV phenomenon called \\"reality TV shows\\", particularly ones like \\"Jersey Shore\\" and \\"The Real Housewives of OC/Atlanta/wherever\\". I think it would be a compliment to say these shows cater to the lowest common denominator. They are primarily packed with drunken escapades, unbridled fights, and lots and lots of sex. And you know what? People like these things because of the sheer stupidity. Hell, I'll admit to watching a few episodes of Jersey Shore, and not just because it was the only thing on my hotel TV (although the latter is true too).I've heard copious things about \\"Wuthering Heights\\": it is a classic, it is a love story, it is wonderful literature, it has great imagery/themes. They may be true, but for me, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" is a freakin' riot book--the Victorian equivalent of the reality TV shows we enjoy today.The characters are vicious, back-biting dogs, continuously making life miserable for each other just for the hell of it. Catherine marries a man she sorta loves just for the title; Heathcliff has an insatiable thirst for revenge; Hindley is weak; Hareton is an evil child; Cathy a ditz; Linton a wuss; Edgar powerless; and Nelly a meddle-some gossip. Probably about the only character not painted in such a poor limelight is our narrator, Mr. Lockwood, who is boring beyond belief. Lock these characters up in a room, and expect them to rail and complain and slap the hell out of each other within moments. They are all sadists and masochists, and I'm not just talking about the obvious Heathcliff. They would make PERFECT fodder for a low-brow reality TV series--I can just see Isabella (post-marriage) b!tch-slapping Heathcliff, Heathcliff and Edgar tearing off each other's shirts and brawling on the living room floor, and Linton and Cathy slipping off to nail each other in one of their rooms.For those that say this is a great love story: Huh? I mean, I get that Heathcliff and Catherine \\"love\\" each other, but it almost feels like more \\"obsessively lusting\\". As for Isbella loving Heathcliff, he doesn't turn around, love her and marry her; instead, she lives in abuse until she finally grows a pair and runs off. Linton and Cathy are constantly being thwarted in their relationship, and it is Heathcliff who forces them to marry. And on...and on... It's more of a \\"How NOT to Love\\" story than a pure romantic love story, like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". NOTE: If you love A so much, marry A. Do NOT marry B and then excuse it by saying you \\"love\\" A so much that you want to *fill*in*the*blank* for A.Also, I found myself wondering several times: how much of this story is Nelly warping? Is she purposefully making these people look bad (even her own mistress, Catherine, she insults regularly)? What parts did she not hear? How would things have been different had she kept her big nose out of the drama?All the complaints I've read are 100% true. The characters are vile and overdramatic; their actions are drastically mean and seem bent for the sole purpose of causing more drama; the framing device threatens to fall apart (particularly when Cathy is narrating through Nelly who is narrating through Mr. Lockwood--can't tell you how many times I forgot who the \\"I\\" was).All the compliments I've read are also 100% true. The writing is very well-done, the story is interesting, the characters are different and not stereotypical, the outcome isn't predictable, and the imagery is vivid and dark.In short: No wonder this was such a controversial book when it first came out!I think this book is definitely more interesting in audiobook format, because the author can differentiate voices, give inflections, and bring to life the arguments and vicious remarks that fly back and forth. Maybe I'm a sadist or masochist like the cast, but I rather enjoyed being a fly on the wall, listening to Nelly's gossip about these sad people and their self-induced miserable lives. It's not a book for everyone, but it's definitely one of a kind.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a great classic read. It is a dark book with a good ending. If you look at the background of each character, you'll understand how they have come to act the way they do in the book. Maybe to the extreme in their actions and hatred, but you can see cause and effect to the situations that occur. Also, if you read about Bronte, you can see why the book is so dark. She had not such a happy life. I wish Bronte would have written more books. Again, a great book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After spending an interesting night at Wuthering Heights in the company of a group of people that seem an abnormally miserable, vile bunch, Mr. Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange, asks his housekeeper to divulge their history. She does this gladly, and so we get the tragic story of Heathcliff and Catherine.I often find the classics to be tedious and boring. Wuthering Heights is neither and I found that to be a nice surprise. From the beginning, the book oozes drama and it stays that way until the very end. For some reason, I've been under the impression that this is a love story. I guess in a dark, twisted way it is, but it focuses more on cruelty and revenge. None of the characters are very likeable. As a matter of fact, a majority of them are quite appalling. Instead of this making me dislike the book, I think it made me like it more. Strange, I know, but it did. Wuthering Heights kept me captivated and has earned it's spot as one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'm a man in his fifties and managed to avoid reading \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for all these years. I don't like romance or gothic novels and I had seen the 1939 film version with Lawrence Olivier and thought it ridiculous. I only read the book now because it was an assignment for my adult school novel-reading course.The story needs little summarization as it so well known but suffice it say that the principal draw of the book is the romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a story that is over at the time the novel begins but nevertheless haunts the entire book. To call Catherine a heroine and Heathcliff a hero is stretching those definitions more than should be allowed. Catherine a tempestuous narcissist who dies for spite and because of childbirth. Heathcliff is worse, torturing his wife because she isn't Catherine and children because they remind him of her. Yes they aren't quite villains as they have tremendous courage, honesty and energy which make them powerful figures despite their many flaws.In our class discussion, people took Heathcliff's evil nature for granted. To me, it wasn't that clear. He was cruel and vengeful. Heatlhcliff was stubborn and difficult but is that evil? If evil is to have no regard for human life then clearly Heathcliff doesn't fall that low, he does appear to value human life. This debate over human evil is one of the fundamental values of Wuthering Heights as literature. The book creates wildly extreme qualities that inhabit the same person. This allows us a prism to view into the psyche and get clear for ourselves how we evaluate good and evil."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is a wonderful classic -- so much going on in the novel on every page that it is a pleasure to read and experience."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Though the performances are very good, I am very frustrated with this purchase, as Amazon describes this set as unabridged. It is, in fact, substantially abridged, so buyer beware."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When Wuthering Heights first came out, readers were shocked by the violence and the passion of its story, that is the strange romance between the mysterious Heathcliff and Catherine Earnchaw, the daughter of Mr. Earnshaw who adopted Heathcliff. The scandal was so much that Emily Bronte, when she died, thought that her book was a failure. Fortunately for her, and for its first readers, the story's reputation grew among literary circles, became an important reading for people like Virginia Wolf, and even became a movie in 1939, starring the great Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon. As such, the book's reputation has now become an important piece of art around the world, influencing important artists in their works (ex:Jane Campion's The Piano, J K Rowling's Harry Potter, etc.)Most people tend to focus solely on the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine and they tend to think that the story is simply a love story, which is what they did with the Laurence Olivier movie. However, Wuthering Heights must be considered, at least that's what I think, as a tragedy which shows how a simple act of kindness from a good man brought forth discord, jealousy and a story of revenge whose victims, the Earnshaw and the Linton families, soon suffer the wrath of someone who never received the most decent sense of love. Not only that, Wuthering Heights shows how certain families, in distant regions positioned far from big cities, act between themselves as they bring upon each other their own laws. Having had grandparents who lived in regions resembling as much as the moors surrounding Wuthering Heights, I wasn't that much surprised by the cruelty that some of the Earnshaw and the Linton brought forth on Heathcliff.So for me, that book, was a pleasure to read again and again.One thing that surprised me with this book is how Emily Bronte managed to transcript the dialects of the countrymen of that region. Indeed, certain character's dialects are written according to how the characters pronounce them. Though reading it straight on for the first time, might be difficult, I suggest to those that may be rebuked by this type of dialogue transcription to read the dialogs aloud. To me it felt much more easier to understand certain conversations and have more pleasure reading that book.As such, I recommend this book to everyone who would be interested to read a great piece of literature or to discover the original material that brought forth the movie adaptations that they love to watch and rewatch."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I must admit that I went into this book completely unprepared for what hit me. I was expecting something vaguely along the lines of Jane Austen, but darker; I didn't realize just how far into the depths of sadness it would go, and it was incredible.Wuthering Heights is the story of Heathcliff, a child brought into the respectable Earnshaw family. He and Catherine, the daughter of the Earnshaw patriarch, form an immediate, permanent bond, one that will bring years of sadness into their lives when Catherine decides that she cannot abandon her station for Heathcliff, instead choosing to marry Edgar Linton, a privileged child from the neighboring Thrushcross Grange.The interesting thing is that this basic love story, for which the novel is best-known, is only the first half of the book. The second half follows the ramifications for all of the characters, as Heathcliff's cruelty reaches a fever pitch and he destroys everything with any connection to Catherine. This part, for me, was the real meat of the story. It's incredibly dark and occasionally terrifying, written in excruciating detail... but also full of a savage beauty. Heathcliff's chasing after a ghost will simultaneously make you cringe and break your heart, and that is the ultimate measure of success; Bronte created a character that manages to be sympathetic, even when you wish for nothing more but his death.It is not without flaws (I found Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship underdeveloped) but the sheer force of the story is almost dizzying, heightened by the interesting (if occasionally limiting) structure, and I would easily recommend Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As with most people interested in classic literature, I had known of \\"Wuthering Heights\\" for years and years, but for some reason, I had never made the effort to read it.

Not many writers can paint characters with this same level of depth. Some you will love, and others you will love to hate. While the book is not what I would label \\"an easy read,\\" it is quite readable considering when it was written. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed. I would have loved to have read this book with a club, so that I may have had an opportunity to discuss the many themes it involves."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am in love with this story and will forever be.

If I could have fiercly stabbed his character to death I believe I wouldn't hesistate in doing so. The person he loved more than any thing and his only reason for living died yet I can feel no pity at all for him.This book was to me horrifing. I gave it 4 stars because I will NEVER forget it. Such a sequence of terrible, cruel events inflicted by one person in a life long pursuit of vengence goes beyond words. The depth of the sorrow of the characters and pain in this book amazes me. I can barely believe that this was publised in 1847, it does not startle me at all to learn that it did not do well at first.As you read this book you feel as if every decent thing is being obliviated and sucked off the face of the earth and you're left only with cruelty, pain and a longing for revenge.This is by no means a light read.

For instance it was apparently common for cousins to marry each other in that society. It was also not unusual for farmers to employ servants as was the case with both the Earnshaws and the Lintons in this story. That was true even though an obvious class distinction existed between the two families.WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a love story in spite of the Gothic horror which permeates the novel. I recommend the book wholeheartedly and believe you can read it repeatedly and still find fresh insights and new enjoyment."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"In such situations, it is customary to start out with a &quot;good and the bad&quot; scenario. So here goes.The good: This book has a complex plot that keeps you interested for the most part. The characters are believable (if somewhat twisted), and the setting is appropriate: a creepy old house in the Moors of England.

I gave it 4 stars because although it is a good story, I found the characters themselves frustrating. This book is not meant to be skimmed for the character names overlap and it can become confusing if not paying attention. Also, I found it hard to relate to since we do not marry our cousins nowadays.

The love Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw had was a love nobody else could undersatand but them. It defied all odds and boundaries. They were truly meant for each other and even death couldn't part them. There love is one that will go down in history as one of the truest loves in the world."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was well written, I must admit, for what it was. It never failed to convery its primary themes; jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. At the same time, it was missing the hook that captures you and makes you care whether the characters succeed or fail. I waited for it chapter after chapter until finally I couldn't seem to feel anything for Heathcliff or Cathy. I have read other works by the Bronte sisters. And while I won't discourage anyone from reading a book they are interested in, I must warn you, if you have any illusions that this will be in some way similar to that of &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"...but otherwise, there's a plentiful selection of better books to read before this one. This book contained likable and despisable characters, a rather uncommon trait these days. The plot and character interaction were at times confusing, yet really didn't go anywhere significant. Remember, old and british doesn't necessarily equal good."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"No book has changed me as much as Wuthering Heights has. Its appeal for me is in its sense of otherness, something so completely removed from ordinary life. Wuthering Heights is set in a realm where ordinary morals do not apply, where love is transmitted via pain and suffering, a maelstrom of the extraordinary, which lasts for about 40 years, and then is gone. Heathcliff and Cathy must be two of the most unique figures ever created in English literature. Cathy, the spirited and vengeful heroine, who pays for her one fatal mistake with her life. Heathcliff, whose drive for revenge can only be calmed by his love for Cathy. Wuthering Heights is a microcosmos, another universe, so alien and foreign from ours. Its roughness and brutality may confuse us, but beneath the pain is love and tenderness"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte did an excellent job in writing Wuthering Heights. Each character plays an important part in the novel. The way she describes each setting makes you feel like you are really there. Heathcliff, the main character, begins the novel as a young, nice orphan child brought into a family. People treated Heathcliff like a slave when he was younger,but when he gets older he gets revenge on everyone. Catherine, the other main character, is supposed to love Heathcliff according to her, but then marries another man because of money. I think Heathcliff and Catherine should have gotten married. The setting was described beautifully. Emily described the feilds of land that the kinds would play on and the green grass blowing in the breeze. The way she set the mood and the setting the same was great. She descibe how the flowers in front of Wuthering Heights were dead to let you know how bad of man Heathcliff was. Overall it was a very good book, a little hard follow sometimes, but a good book. I enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I did not find this to be a book that I would recommend to others. It was not really my type of book to read. There were two parts that I found of intrest. In the first part of the book I found it kind of funny. When Lockwood came to live on Heathcliffs' property. Lockwood expressed his wanting to be isolated, but he kept talking to Heathcliff. Then Heathcliff interupted Lockwood and said, &quot;I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it-walk in!&quot; The other part I found it kind of weird. Cathy clams she does not make fun of Heatcliff,but she keeps making rude comments. Cathy says a one point, &quot;I did not mean to laugh at you.&quot; These were the only parts that I found intresting in the book. I found them intresting because of there ironic effect."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"To make my review concise:This book is about a dysfunctional family and dysfunctional relationships between people - or more accurately, about relationships that revolve around a twisted man. It doesn't do much beyond flesh out those relationships over a span of many years.I suppose this book is interesting. It is well written and definitely has characters (although for the life of me, for some reason, keeping their names and identities straight in my mind was a tiring task that I never really fully accomplished, maybe it's just me). I went into this book hoping for more plot, more story of people's lives, with the dysfunctional family elements pervasive if not along the sidelines. That's just not what it is. It's a potential tenant learning about how twisted a family is from the reminiscent eyes of a previous inhabitant. And that is really all the book is.My review here is obviously not paying attention to the book's classic status. Or the fact that it's free and creative commons, written by a woman during a timeframe where as far as I understand, that wasn't common, lest of all to go on to be considered a classic. Or the fact that the story-inside-a-story concept was novel at the time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Fast and prompt service and was exactly what I was looking for.

Not an interesting book to me."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel has touched me deeply since first reading and I have enjoyed it many times over, again becoming engrossed in the characters with each new read, yet each time finding something new. A true classic. It is a little sad, though, that this great book averages four stars, the same rating as many of the comparatively poorly written, more contemporary but soon-to-be-forgotten fiction reviewed on this site. Not that one should confine oneself to reading classics, but at least recognize them for what they are."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Ever since I read this book, every book is easy to read. Thanks to this book, I have come to understand two things better: a bit more of human nature through Heathcliff's, and both Catherines' characters and English language through Emily Bronte's amazing style. The language changed a lot ever since the beginning of 19th century, I had trouble reading at first, it seemed boring and I couldn't really get into the characters. Then suddenly it became easy and interesting to read. Maybe I should thank my reading abilities for the improvement but I'd rather think it's the well developed characters of Ms Bronte helped me to step over that invisible reading barrier. I highly recommend this book, it is a must-read kind because it is about pure love, not passion."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights during a time when the people of England were not ready for such an intense and passionate novel. There-for it was not given the recognition it truely diserved until many years later, long after she died of T.B. Wuthering Heights is truely a work of art. The story envelopes the reader into a mysterious world with very heartful characters. The narration is perfect, in that you are seeing and hearing everything that the narrator says and sees. Emily's writting style is perfect in that she always gives just the right amount of details in her accounts. As a matter of fact, the story is so well written that a reader who really takes the time to understand and enjoy the book will soon find himself/herself attatched to it. It is almost impossible to put down. Over all, Wuthering Heights is a book not to be missed, but reader be warned, it is a book that takes a lot of effort to read. A lot of paragraphs require heavy analyzing to make sure that you catch the hidden meanings and important foreshadowing. In think that there really isnt much of an age restriction, but if your reading this book for pleasure, and your under fourteen, you wasting your time."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Part of the charm of this novel is that it remains very readable 150+ years after its original publication date. The language of the book flows in a wonderful way, carrying the reader fully into another time and place. Emily Bronte was a true artist; telling a story of passion, pride, jealousy and vengeance using ordinary characters we can all relate to. An unforgettable literary masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte is clearly the genius of the family. If you liked Jane Eyre, you will love Wuthering Heights. It is *better* than Jane Eyre, it made me like Jane Eyre less in contrast with Wuthering Height's intense passion. This book is extremely unique and insightful. Don't let the first two chapters confuse you, don't put down this novel, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I really loved this book. It was a wonderful book, definetly worth your time. The feelings, and the characters were amazing. Each time I read it, a new feeling, a new moral, pops out. Every time is better than the last."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I think I know how Emily Bronte developed the character of Heathcliff. I believe that she based it on that of her father. Outrageous? Unfair? After all the Rev. Bronte was a decent sort of chap whereas on one occasion Heathcliff beat a young teenager until he lost consciousness.But consider this. Emily's father, tormented by his intellectual isolation and his lonely widowhood, used to occasionally open the back door of his house and fire a gun several times into the moors for no apparent reason. You can imagine the young Emily tentatively enquiring, &quot;Is everything alright, father?&quot; and her father answering brusquely, &quot;Perfectly satisfactory, thank you, my dear.&quot; and then slamming the door as he disappeared back into his study.On other occasions, he used to stuff furniture or a rug into the living room fire. I forget where I read this. Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte? Daphne du Maurier's excellent book &quot;The Infernal World of Branwell Bronte&quot;?I doubt that Emily forgot the images created by her father's behaviour. It must have seemed to her like a hint of a suppressed rage so huge as to demand the creation of a character like Heathcliff to express it.How strange this book - like a dream journey into the subconscious world! People reflected in other people. Time collapsing onto itself. As Emily herself said in a poem, &quot;Once having drunk of such divinist anguish How can I face the empty world again?&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Like To Kill A Mockingbird, Wuthering Heigts is a novel on the 'prepare for college' reading list, and is read in many high schools. I found an old copy on my mothers bookshelf, and loved this novel before I knew it was considered a 'classic'. You often hear references made to star-crossed literary couples such as 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Catherine and Heathcliff'. It is telling that this work is important enough to be referenced alongside ShakespeareThe only novel written by Emily (her sisters Charlotte and Anne were more prolific), the tale takes place on the moors of England. Catherine Earnshaw is surprised when her well-to-do father brings home a mysterious foundling and names him Heathcliff. A dark and brooding child, Heathcliff nonetheless becomes Catherines playmate and confedant.Their relationship changes, however, as Catherine grows into a woman. She begins to think that a lady of her station should not be dallying with a foundling such as Heathcliff, who has no family or wealth. She is wrapped in her own vain self-worth, and beings to spur the bewildered Heathcliff.A moody and potentially violet man, Heathcliff retreats further into himself the worse Catherine treats him. He never stops loving her, his passion endures even her scorn. The end of their love affair is both beautiful and tragic.A great triumph of writing by a woman of her time, Emily died shortly after her novel was published. As a historical note, the three sisters published their work under pen names. This ruse was concocted so publishers wound presume the works were written by men, and would therefore be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I first read Wuthering Heights when I was in high school. To this day it is still my favorite book. The characters of Heathcliff and Catherine come alive. I still feel the heartache experienced by these two characters whenever I read the final confrontation scene between these two soulmates. You are actually swept away by their passion and pain.This is one book I would highly recommend to anyone who has an appreciation for great literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Yes. I loved this book. You must read it. I have never read any book like this before. It's both happy and sad....read it yourself and you will see what I meen!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Bronte's Wuthering Heights contains the charms and vices of a soap opera. Due to the complex family structure one almost needs to keep the family tree handy while reading to keep from getting confused. I enjoy watching soap operas I like to know all the complex family history or just basic background that has been happening for years. When you know all of the history, it makes the story make sense. Wuthering Heights has this charm because of its long time span and complicated family tree. Some of the bad points of soap operas are also present in Wuthering Heights. One such disadvantage is, in my opinion, slow moving plots. Since there is such a long time period covered, the stories can often drag out. Overall, I liked Wuthering Heights for its soap opera-like qualties."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Overall the book had alot to do with a mystery of love. This book left you wondering what will happen next. Out of everything I had read in the book. I like Catherine Earnshaw Lintons part the most. She was wild at times then a lady at another time. Catherine had it bad with the confusion she had between the two men. My favorite part is on page (149) when Edgar return home from Gimmerton and catches Heathcliff with his wife cause she didn't want Heathcliff to go. The part that seem to make me think is what was Edgar thinking when Heathcliff Gave Catherine to him. This book was Good and I would recommend this book to any one. But I would make sure I explain each character to him or her first."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the greatest books I ever read. It was written so fine and with such sensitivity that you feel like living a character in it. Love and hate are used very well together. Hard thing about the books is to learn the characters and how they are related to one and other. Be sure to read the version with the list of difficult words and you'll enjoy the book. Very, very good..."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It is a very powerful book that captures you immediately into its narative. You want to grab these two characters and tell them to STOP hurting each other. My wish for them has always been happiness together but that never happens. They are doomed from the start to live life loving each other from a distance never being truely together. I wish more people would read this classic for this really is one of the best."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is definately one of the top ten best books I have ever read. The plot is wonderful, and the charceters are extremely well devolped. I have started staying up as late as midnight to finish it. My only complaint is the narritive is hard to follow sometimes, and I keep getting the Cathrines mixed up. Otherwise, it is great."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Upon the understanding of the Earnshaw and Linton family histories, one can begin to enjoy the twisted and beautiful facets of Emily Bronte's plot. The development of the character of Heathcliff is nothing short of genius. He is a true villain that at times can be greatly sympathized with because of his great loss, the love of his life. The gothic elements in this novel greatly heighten the overall effect of Bronte's plot. A beautiful story that is indeed a classic of English literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was very much looking forward to a wonderfully written, romantic classic, but I was disappointed to find that the romance and love is not as moving and touching as I had expected. For one reason, the two main characters who fall in love are dislikable characters. I did not like Catherine or Heathcliff, and this made it very hard for me to enjoy the book. However, despite this, I still enjoyed this book. I do recommend it although I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Despite its outward appearance, Wuthering heights is not a romance story. Bronte's purpose in writing this novel was to find out whether or not her criminally-inclined brother could be forgiven. She represented her brother with Heathcliff, a character whose depth of emotion and spirit-- an almost inhuman depth, far surpassing all except Catherine I-- perhaps made possible the extenuation of the absolute evil of his vengeance. I'll say no more, Bronte's purpose was that every reader judge for himself."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the story about the obssessive love between Catherine and Heathcliff.An eternal love that destroyed everyone who tried to destroy it, and was stronger than death"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up Wuthering Heights because I was bored, and then I couldn't put it down. It was intriguing from the start, and never once boring. I plan to read this novel again at some point in the future"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Rants and raves for Wuthering Heights. A story of the past but applies to today's reality. A story of twisted love, passion, jealousy and loosing a loved one.I truly enjoyed reading this novel. In my eyes it was a master piece written in the past. Unlike today's novels this book holds imagery close. You really feel like you're in the story. Not only are you reading but it's like you become a character, watching from the side lines. Just a master piece written by Emily Bronte, a story that will bring event back into reading a novel.A dark and twisted love story, that isn't what most people want to read, but once you get a few chapters in your stuck; you want to know what's going to happen next. Where this love triangle and twisted story is about to go.I'm afraid to say the some of the chapters didn't make since, the twisted, dark, beginning is alittle hard to follow. But if you get past that and really read what this book is about you will find an adventure you never expected to find.I give 4 out of 5 stars. This book is close to being an all time favorite. Not quiet there yet. But close. I recommend reading this book; it's a book to read on a rainy day. Something i will never forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was perhaps the first book that i read which made me cry, laugh and allowed me to become more attached to characters than any other book i had read. When i read it, i knew it was going to be one of my favourite books for life.Emily Bronte's tale of incest, death, insantiy and fate never seems to grow old whilst leaving a testement to the past at the same time. Without a doubt, Wuthering Heights also contains one of the most powerful and potent settings of any book. The book's narrative is divided into two stories- the first of Cathy and Heathcliff and the second of Catherine and Hareton. Which did i prefer? Heathcliff as the hero, but i couldn't not love him as the villain too.Perhaps the main reason i adore this book so much is the obscure complexity of Heathcliff and Cathy and the undying list of themes that seem to grow in number everytime one picks up the book. Any author who succeeds in forcing the reader to like the bad and hate the good has done an amiable task and Emily Bronte does that to the fullest degree. Let's not forget the brilliant insults either. A fabulous read for anyone old enough to appreciate greatness."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Heathcliff is an orphan, adopted by the Earnshaws, where he falls madly in love with their daughter, Catherine. But Catherine denies her true love for Heathcliff, instead marrying Edgar Linton for his wealth, education and good looks. In denying herself Heathcliff, Catherine falls to madness and death, and Heathcliff's terrible vengeance ruins not only her, but everyone Heathcliff has ever associated with.The truth is this is a really well crafted novel. Many are put off by the dark and brooding themes. Also the word choice and frequent switch of narrators can be confusing. But you have to give the book time. Emily Bronte's word use is masterful, giving the characters great scope and the setting an eerie vividness. The revelations are shocking, but also very gripping. It's a love story that goes tragically wrong for the characters, and it leaves a real imprint on you when you finish it. If your into tragic love stories, it is a classic, so you should consider it. And don't worry, the ending isn't THAT tragic."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is not just about love. It is about hatred, delusion, despair. Most of all, it is about vengeance. A spiteful, remorseless and hopeless vengeance exacted for a lost and mourned love. It is indeed a dark, bitter novel which makes you feel angry and woeful. And yet amongst this blind darkness of feelings there's something more than mere despondency: there's faithfulness to a love that is able to survive beyond any parting, even in death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic by Emily Bronte is a must read. The language is archaic, but the story is so compelling I just rushed through the book with no problems.The story is about the passionate love between mismatched Catherine and Heathcliff. Catherine is beautiful and refined, but underneath the ladylike exterior, she shares the same wild and free spirit as her soulmate. Heathcliff is one of the most complex characters of literature. You either love him or you hate him. Indeed, most of the characters in Wuthering Heights are complex - not all good, not all bad. This complexity in a novel published in 1847 was far ahead of its time.The setting of the lonely moors of England and the fine country mansions make the story easy to visualize. The tale is told from the first person point of view of Nelly, the maid who saw it all, and a young boarder who seeks to live with now-older Heathcliff in Heathcliff's dark and imposing estate called Wuthering Heights.The story is epic because it does not stop with Heathcliff and Catherine. It continues with Heathcliff's son and Catherine's daughter. The consuming yet doomed love of Heathcliff and Catherine has tragic repercussions for their descendants. Wuthering Heights is a study of the haunting, eternal power of love. Emily Bronte's story reminds us that sometimes love is not always beautiful and sweet. It can also be selfish and twisted."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel was some what ridiculous. The main characters were childish and I actually ended up liking the neighbors better - which I think was the objective. The ending was the only part that I actually enjoyed - don't worry, I won't give it away. I'll just say that it is a relief from the chaos apparent through out the novel. The mood uf the entire novel is dark and despondent...it was just too gloomy for me. I read it first when I was 17 - after reading so many other well written classics by great authors - I have to say that this one does not compare."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a supremely compelling novel displaying the best and the worst of our own human nature. It most certainly is worthy of all the praise it has received, and I can say it was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. After enduring the first one or two chapters- which are incredibly droll- one is immersed into a world of the most elliquent emotions, and the deepest ties between the charecters. Within the first few chapters you begin to spot the eternal, everlasting love between the two main chareters Heathcliff and Catherine. Unfortunatly the family rivalry between Hindley(Catherines brother)and Heathcliff soon make it clear their undying love cannot be fullfilled due to the fact that before Heathcliff was adopted into the family he was a gutter waif,or one may say a vagabond. Then Catherine marries, which forces all the residences of their little world to be flung unto a world of deception, cruelty, spite, and revenge.I would say that after reading this book one really has to view humanity and love in a different light. For me it really exposed the deep emotions that are never in black and white and that one must really be introduced to before they can truly begin to know what feelings are about. Probably the best part of this book, or at least for me, is the way Bronte makes the reader feel what the charecters feel and how gradually she gives one the understanding of the conflicts between the chareters. Bronte also prestents her book in such a way that after a while you really feel you are in the room whatching the events unfold, which gives the reader the oppertunity to care about the novel. Somehow, I cannot beleve I thought I was not going to like this book when I first began reading it, but now I'm sure it will remain a classic for millenia to come."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights was our newest assingest reading in my language arts class. I have to be honest I almost quit the course just looking at how difficult it seemed. I had never read classic literature before and it was something new, that looked way too difficult for me. Now that I have finished reading the book, I completely understand where all the stories I love to read came from. They take the basic story line from classics such as this one, and make it simpler. However, I honestly enjoyed the challenge of coming to understand this book. I have also struck a new passion for classic literature.Emily Bronte had a magnificiant way of finding different twists to be put all over. For instance, the book starts off at the ending and does a flashback of the beginning of the novel. Her ways of connecting things make this book so you can't skip a beat or you'll be forced to go reread it. Each chapter is jam packed with details. Even ones you think insignificant have ways of tieing in later on.The true story begins a love/hate good/evil battle. It's a lesson in life and teaches you about what certain peoples values truly were. For Catherine (a main character in the story) as much as she loved Heathcliff (a servant boy who was found on the streets of London and adopted into the Earnshaw family) her decision to marry was not followed by her heart, but by what her social status would become. She ends up marrying Edgar( a wealthy man who lived down the road from Wuthering Heights in a place called Thrushcross Grange) and not knowingly sparks Heathcliff's revenge which is the story line continued through the very end of the story.To love Heathcliff is to hate Heathcliff and visa versa. He plays almost the biggest role since he is one of the only characters who is known throughout the whole book. You first meet him as a grumpy old man whom Linton( one of the narrators) is leasing Wuhtering Heights from. As the new narrator, Nelly Dean( another servant girl who had a long past with the Earnshaw family) tells of what hardships he really had to go trough. Heathcliff was an adopted orphan and he was brought into a father who loved him, a sister who really showed no care at the time ( but who would fall madly in love with him in the end) and a brother who showed nothing but hatred towards him until his dying day. Mr. Earnshaw was very partial to Heathcliff to I think that struck the hatred from Hindley ( the brother). Throughout the late Catherines life, it was a constant battle between love and money. Although Catherine marries Edgar and Heathcliff does end up with Isabella ( Edgars younger sister), their love only grows stronger. And it continues even after Catherine dies and has her daugheter, young Cathy.Both volumes of this book are so much alike. It is almost the same story just with the heirs of the deceased living it. Cathy ( late Catherine's daughter) also is in love with two men.( Hareton- son of Catherine and Edgar, and Linton- son of Isabella and Heathcliff. Although Cathy's first husband( Linton ) does die shortly after their marriage and she gets to marry Hareton too, the similarities between Cathy and her mother are so significant.As the novel comes to an end Cathy and Hareton move back to Wuthering Heights. It is very debateable on wether or not this is truly a happy ending ( becuase so much has happened before it). I think it is because I think it is finally bringing the two different worlds together as one.I loved this book and enjoyed how well Bronte brought everything together. I have found a new love for classics and am finding myself enjoying more from that time period now more than anything else. All because I didn't give up on this one book...I encourage everyone who reads this to continue reading the book. It gets hard (believe me I know) but if I understood it anyone can!--d*"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is on of the greatest classics in literature and one I had never read until recently. I found this story of obsessive and destructive relationships very compelling and difficult to put down. It's a romance but by no means is it a happy one. Things don't go well for these people.Wuthering Heights is the story of two families the Earnshaws and Lintons, who really should never had gotten together. It's the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine that underlies the whole book. Heathcliff is defiantly the ultimate anti-hero, he's obsessive, abusive and just plain evil, but still you feel yourself drawn into his dark world and hoping that redemption comes to him. He seems beyond it however and his destructive behaviour forms the basis of this gothic tale.Emily Bronte's skills as a writer are amazing, her language is poetic and deep and the story is truly unique. My only criticism is concerning the way she wrote dialogue for the character Joseph, it's often illegible and I found it most difficult understanding what he was saying. That aside I really enjoyed this book and recommend it wholeheartedly as a study of human nature as it is without the influence of a Divine being.Thanks for reading my review and enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"At first, I griped and complained about having to read this book. My aunt practically shoved it into my hands and told me that I was to read this book and like it! Well, I read it, and I don't like it at all...I absolutely LOVE it! I'm really into romance and this one hits home.Emily Bronte died one year before its publication in 1847 and is perhaps one of the most powerfully written books in the English language. I was first 13 when I read this book and it took me three more times for me to understand what the heck Joseph was saying! .... learned in this type of speech, it's really an understanding book.Just the undying love between Heathcliff and Catherine alone is enough to put anyone in tears. And how Heathcliff is so masculine, yet so insecure and rude. How did Emily Bronte come up with this passion and this knowlegde, when she seldom left her house? You can't help but fall into sync with one or more of the characters. Tragically, yet beautifully written.This book is truly a classic, you'll never want to put it down! Get it!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"the point of view was different and that was one of the main things that i enjoyed about this book. at the beginning i was like what a boring book because it had nothing to do with what it was sopposed to andi was confused. but further on i started to understand and couldn't put the book down. heathcliff and catherines characters were hard to like but had to admire their love. it ws unique, something that only people dream of and even though theirs didnt work because their likves turned out the wasy it did catherine(2)and hareton experience love. it was well written and one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Those who read this book looking for plots that are simple to follow and modern grammar will be sorely disappointed. It is a classic, beautifully written and descriptive. I chose this novel for my senior thesis, and when delved into more deeply, the complex relationships and manipulations between characters is astounding. Emily Bronte is an artist whom I greatly admire and will always look to as an inspiration. I pity those not exposed to this caliber of writing, and even more so those who cannot find any enjoyable portion of it. It is a work of passion, innovative in a time of repression."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The first book I ever read by the Bronte sisters was Jane Eyre, and I loved it, while WH was too gloomy for my 13 years. I still appreciate Jane Eyre a lot, but I think you can compare Emily Bronte only to Dostoyevsky. WH is above all about life, how it crushes a person, how it changes you from a child into an adult, often thereby destroying the best part in you, about making utterly wrong decisions for the society's sake...it is universal and timeless."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this book in Bosnia, when I was 8, and in the beginning, I was bored by the insipid narrator...then, as I read further on, I gained a whole new world of insights, and after I put it down, I was not the same. This is-without any doubts-one of the greatest books ever written: about love, probably not the way it really exists, but more about the way it should be-fierce, almost insane, unconditional, holy; about life, the way it often is, merciless, disregarding one's true wishes and needs. But all the words I pile up here fade away in comparison with this book. It is a shame that there are so many worthless &quot;romantic fiction&quot; pulp books being published and read, when there is Wuthering Heights to teach you about love, loss and despair."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is excellent, but to fully appreciate it, you must be able to understand not only love but passion. Immature readers cannot grasp the depth of the passion between Cathy &amp; Heathcliff. While Jane Eyre is an interesting story, it does not reveal the magnitude of human emotion and angst that Wuthering Heights does."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Reading all the comments made me sick to the stomach. Everyone nowadays is just living too fast to enjoy the world's real treasures: books. So stop thinking about the logics of Wuthering Heights and just enjoy it 'cause it's the BEST!!!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am one of the only men Ive ever met that really likes this book. Its one of the only two books that I had to read for school that I actually liked (the other being 1984). Its an extremely passionate story of, as the above description says &quot;a love stronger than death&quot;. Also, I feel this is a book that almost anyone can relate to, due to the way it gets down to the essence of what love is. My words cannot do this book justice properly."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is amazing. It is such a powerful story. everytime I read it I can see, almost feel, it happen. It's such a dark, almost morbid story. there's just so much feeling that went into writing the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This is the GREATEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN and is probably the greatest book that will ever be written. It not only has a great story line but it has a true depth to it that seems to reach beyond physical life and understanding itself. For a women of that time to have such insight into the psychology of her caracters amazes me. I first read it when I was a senior in highschool and it gave me a true love and respect for reading and great writers such as Emily Bronte. I highly recomend reading it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Simply the most incredible book I have ever read. The characters become embedded in your mind, and you live through their body and see through their eyes. It is so heart-wrenchingly passionate that at times you will feel helpless under the book's control. For anyone who enjoys romance and passion, this is the book with your name written on it. Everyone should read this book, for it taps into those rare and everyday human emotions that we can recognize and relate to. Indeed, a great read."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This classic has a reputation as being a grand \\"love\\" story. It is more about dark obession than \\"love\\". The characters are all psychologically damaged people (nuts) who seem to thrive on making each other miserable. I cannot figure out what Catherine had that made two men fall madly in love with her--she is spoiled, selfish, and extremely stupid. Edgar is a spineless wimp who certainly knew he had a rival--but refused to deal with it. Heathcliff is a sadist who is obessed with (not in love with) Catherine; he is willing to harm even himself to cause suffering to other people. Who could love a man that nasty? Isabella is another silly woman who could not see what was going on around her and falls in \\"love\\" with her imagined version of Heathcliff. And on and on...Nelly Dean is the only sane person in this novel, and she was crazy to stay around these looney families as long as she did.The atmosphere saves the book from complete ruin--it is as dark ,moody, and brooding as the characters. Even the houses seem to snarl and brood and take on the personalities of characters. One is compelled to continue in the book just to see how much more crazy things will get with every body being so dysfunctional and obssessed with having their way. The writing is poetic, and the final scene between Catherine and Heathcliff could be touching--if you can forget how absurd it is.Maybe I am too much of a realist to get carried away with this type of novel. I would not touch Heathcliff with a ten foot pole and can't imagine what women see in the character, other than dark good looks. I cannot imagine what a man would see in Catherine. Or how any of these crazy characters' actions spell l-o-v-e."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If I were a contributor to a dictionary and was asked for a definition of the word passion, I would simply write....\\"See Wuthering Heights\\". All the basic human emotions- love, hate, jealously, pride, are on display in this novel but at their penultimate height. Cathy just doesn't love Heathcliff- he is part of her very being. Heathcliff just doesn't hate his son Linton- he must fully destroy him. In real life, no one would want to meet, let alone spend any time with any of these people (except perhaps for Ellen Deane, a housekeeper who recounts the story to her new employer-good eye for detail as she spins her tale). But to live with them through the pages of a novel-pure heaven. No other book I have read from this time period even comes close to the modernity of this novel. Heathcliff and Cathy are not destined to be together, because Cathy is unable to forgo the warm pleasures that money can bring. She marries Edgar Linton, a good man devoted to Cathy and for a time Cathy settles in to this life. But as soon as Heathcliff re-enters her life, she is determined to possess him as she did before and Edgar must just understand. Why should he be jealous? Cathy asks. There is not hint of a sexual relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff but something deeper, deeper than even love. Edgar, like most human beings, feels unable to share his spouse in this kind of relationship and being thwarted in her desires, Cathy pines and eventually dies. But this happens in the first half of the book-what are the remaining 150 pages about? Since Heathcliff can never be happy since Cathy is gone, then he decides that no one will be happy and he takes his revenge. And what revenge! Just from general knowledge, I knew what to expect in the first half of the book but the second half was a revelation. Emily Bronte has created a character in Heathcliff that breaks almost every moral code of the time and yet the reader sympathizes with him, no matter how monstrous his actions. I can't think of another writer alive or dead who could have pulled off this feat so well. The writing is beautiful and the dialogues between Cathy and Heathcliff are richly poetic.If you haven't read Wuthering Heights, do yourself a favor and run to find a copy. Reading experiences such as this are rare- a perfectly written novel with characters you will remember forever. The world lost a great novelist with the death of Emily Bronte after only one novel. It makes the reader wonder what else she could have produced."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This edition is just the last aesthetic overhauling of Oxford World's Classics ones with just the same picture (by the Pre-Raphaelite master John Everett Millais) on the cover (see my reviews on them or the global vision I offer in the Norton Critical Fourth Edition review).The cover has been the main object of redesign and looks good, even showy. The only complaint I have, with this as well as with previous editions, and Penguin and some worse ones (like Wordsworth Classics), is the very bad paper quality and the outrageous mass-market paperback with glue-only binding. The book looks like it were to be destroyed BEFORE reading. This just can't be the only format in which to get this absolute classical masterpiece of world-over novel writing, in one edition in which the best scholarly efforts have been spent to get a pure text with adequate annotation. At the very least it should be offered as a quality paperback, with flaps, acceptable paper and, of course, signature-sewn.As far as the contents and not the vessel is concerned, and summarizing: the best 1847 reliable and authoritative Clarendon critical text (due to Hilda Marsden), even with over-conservative details for a mass-market edition, like a rather heavy and outdated punctuation and the unbelievable two-volume implied structure, with its clumsy independent chapter numbering.Ian Jack's annotation is yet one of the very best, even if its Yorkshire dialect support is scanty and a bit difficult to follow (most good editions offer by now fullfoot-of-page glosses of the dialect tirades -glosses that are sometimes wrong and misleading-). The Bibliography is very good, selected, sorted and annotated (I don't know if updated, suppose not). The long Introduction by Patsy Stoneman (30 pp) is excellent, even if a little scholarly (and, as with most of other Introductions, please don't read it BEFORE the novel but after it, just as the \\"Charlotte's materials\\" of 1850 provided at the end of the volume).This edition is a really good buy, that should be compared to the best text-oriented editions:A) Penguin (Pauline Nestor),B) Routledge (Heather Glen, very hard to come by, try Amazon Canada).You may also consider the good context-oriented editions (that is, \\"study\\" ones, rich in contextual materials and/or critical essays), namely,C) Norton Critical Fourth Edition (Dunn), with rather scanty if good annotation and a bit eclectic and even idiosyncratic text (but with very good punctuation);D) the NEW Broadview Press edition by Beth Newman, with scanty notes (very good as they are) and full dialectal glosses like Norton Fourth (both sets of glosses neither wrong nor misleading). Some textual foibles or little blunders are not worrisome (with the best punctuation in town). The overall selection of contextual materials is, arguably, the BEST EVER, with a very interesting document on \\"brain fever\\". The brief and original Introduction (21 pp) is excellent and thought-provoking.Not to be forgotten in this class isE) Longman Cultural Edition (Alison Booth), featuring good if more conventional Introduction and good annotation that includes a little blunder about Miloin Chapter 9, with the authoritative Clarendon text (I will inform you if there is any hidden foible with this), and a too vast array of almost dis-arrayed contextual pieces (more than forty of them), interesting but too brief to be really meaningful.I stand by what I have written, but don't forget that this is one of the very best editions available!Oneworld Classics is a worse choice, in spite of his good paperback making, with good paper and printing quality and covers with flaps. With its good annotation it would challenge the top positions, were it not by the bad quality of the text itself, that was carefully edited but keeps many blunders and too many of Charlotte's 1850 \\"improvements\\". Wordsworth Classics edition is also a worse choice, with a reliable 1850 text (that of the Haworth Edition of 1900: that is, a reliable edition of the wrong text!), adequate notes (even if brief and not user-friendly) and a fair Introduction by John S. Whitley, in one of the worst material productions ever.If you are looking for a beautiful hardcover volume, your choices are much more limited. You can wait for two or three years to get an used copy of the Clarendon 1976 (or 1995) Edition, or you can get the nice volume in Barnes&Noble; Classics (that has the reliable Haworth Edition 1850 text, which is really a pity), or rush to get one nice copy of the Franklin Mint edition of 1978 (see my review) with the beautiful if not daring double-page lithographs by Alan Reingold and a very good pre-Clarendon 1847 text, but with no modern introduction and no annotation whatever, except for the well-done footnotes glossing correctly and in full the dialect tirades (the first edition ever to do so)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I loved Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and I can say without a doubt that I loved Wuthering Heights just as much. The Bronte sisters are so talented! I hope to read something by Anne Bronte, the less well known sister, too. Wuthering Heights is about a destructive and consuming love between Heathcliff, an orphan who comes to the mansion of Wuthering Heights, and Cathy, the daughter of the wealthy family that takes him in. They are drawn together as soon as they meet. The novel is narrated partly by Mr. Lockwood, a tenant who meets Heathcliff many years later. His housekeeper, Mrs. Dean, tells him about the events that happened years earlier, making for a gripping, suspenseful, and sad story.Wuthering Heights is very complex, especially the character of Heathcliff. He's not \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"; he's conflicted, a multi-layered character. At times, I sympathized with Heathcliff; at other times, I really hated him. Wuthering Heights is difficult to put into any category. It is realistic, but it also has supernatural beings, with ghosts and graves and a love that transcends time. But it also is a mystery, asking complicated questions. The writing is very old-fashioned, but it's not too overwritten, though I did have a little trouble with some of the Yorkshire dialect. But that occurs very rarely; there's just one minor character who speaks that way.You can read all of my reviews at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I downloaded Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" to my Kindle and read this gothic novel for the first time since I was a teenager discovering 19th Century novels. I remember liking \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as well as Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I'm sure as a young girl I enjoyed the lyrical, descriptive writing, the mysterious, dark setting, and the passionate but impossible love. But now, forty years later and perhaps wiser, I saw so much more in the characters and the relationships, that it was almost overwhelming to read. I now definitely prefer Charlotte's Mr. Rochester to Emily's Mr. Heathcliff. Such a conflicted, tragic character, Heathcliff only gives small glimpses of human warmth. Yet those glimpses kept me reading and wanting to hope for him. Every character in the book is tragically flawed. But like water springing in hard, rocky soil, love breaks through in unexpected places (as with Catherine and Hareton at the end)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I love this book and have read it multiple times. To call it melodramatic is to misunderstand the period in which it was written, is to oversimplify it without critically assessing it, and is to mistakenly compare it to current novels. It's apples vs. oranges! One thing that I've always admired is Bronte's use of the letter-within-a-letter framing device; it helps establish the multiple voices of the novel and must've been quite innovative for its time. Admittedly, my appreciation for this novel has been enriched by the 1939 film starring Merle Oberon and Laurence Olivier, though I don't think any film can really do this book justice. It's a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"3 out of 5, only because it's a bed book. The book itself is in good shape, and it arrived quickly. My gripe is that I didn't see it explained anywhere that it is a Bed book, which means the book reads horizontally not vertically. Not a big deal, but irritating none the less."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I honestly didn't think that I would enjoy this book as much as I did. :] It is a love and hate story. I wasn't fond of Catherine or Heathcliff, but i enjoyed the book. It took me a little while to really get into but after that i couldn't put it down! :] But if your looking for a happy story with a good fairytale ending this book is not for you. For me I really did like this book but I don't think it's for everyone.&lt;3"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was kind of skeptical of this book in the beginning, after all, a book that has like three generations of families, half of them with the same name is really confusing. In addition, it seemed that I could find any good characters in this book. Even the main character has faults that I would look down upon. This book centers around the revenge of the main character Heathcliff. After trudging along several chapters I found this book to be quite interesting.This book incorporates a lot of gothic elements within the book. Emily Bronte conveys a deep horror and arouses our morbid curiosity with this. One will find many supernatural elements and suspenseful atmosphere within this book, and even a ghost! Because Bronte writes this book through the eyes of several characters, it is hard to judge the objectivity of the story, forcing readers to determine for themselves whether or not certain actions were justified. In the retellings through one character who used to care for Heathcliff's lover, she consistently paints him as the antagonist, emphasizing his faults and his actions against the family. This makes the book that much more interesting to read.The story of Wuthering Heights is a really complicated love story that focuses mainly on Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw. Through Bronte's appeal to pathos, she is able to convey and build up the romance between Heathcliff and Catherine. When she dies, Heathcliff, literally becomes a monster mentally, and Bronte applies this to a figurative level, describing him as a monster too. This also reveals the inner turmoil he experiences upon her death.Emily Bronte definitely writes on par with her sister Charlotte Bronte. Emily's work on Wuthering Heights, with her use of pathos and figurative language definitely makes it a classical gothic romance novel with a novel storyline.It is a beautifully written book that is full of human emotion from the seemingly cold and calculating Heathcliff. After the death of Catherine he burns for revenge. It is a great book, one just needs to get through the first couple of chapter to realize this. The conclusion is also satisfactory and provides for a good release of tension and an epiphany-like ending.I find this book to be a good read, because it has some adult themes, I would not exactly advise little kids to read it, but I am sure that anyone who appreciates literature would be \\"wowed\\" and amazed by this book. Give it a chance, and you will find that this book is worth every single penny!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a love story. But it is not your typical, love conquers all tale. It is a dark, twisted story of obsession, greed and lust that spans beyond the grave. What really strikes me about the story still is how dark it is. And I don't mean 'given the time it was written' because the story is legitimately dark no matter what era it is set in.In the story Bronte perfectly frames two very different kinds of love. There is the healthy love that the tragic heroine of the story has for her husband. There is a fondness in that love that seems destined to grow and flourish. But, there is also an unhealthy, all consuming fiery love between the heroine and the devil of the story, our tragic hero, the scoundrel Heathcliff. So consuming and obsessive is the love between the two that it becomes dark and twisted. Their love is so unhealthy and obsessive that it consumes and devours both of them. It all sounds so amazingly romantic but what it drives the characters to: insanity, murder, captivity, and revenge makes even their proclamations of love to one another macabre.On a side note, Heathcliff, the center of the story for most intents and purposes, is so damned intriguing. I haven't really encountered a character quite like him in literature. You find yourself wanting to know more about him and can't helping thinking that a man who could love so deeply could be so damned evil! But oh, he is...Far and away, Bronte succeeds in the book in creating characters who are both sympathetic and intolerable. None of the characters are entirely loveable, save for the story teller herself. Otherwise there is a pathetic air among everyone save for Heathcliff who seems the only one in the novel who can exploit this weakness. It makes for a lot of moments of cringing as you can almost see the gears of evil genius working in Heathcliff's head.My only complaint with the book is the conveinance of pregnancy. Never is it mentioned until the child is born and never is the mother said to be or appear pregnant. It wasn't enough to entirely take me out of the story but I did roll my eyes on every instance. That is really the only hard argument I can make of Bronte taking an easy way out in her plot but given this is her first and only attempt at a novel, I can let it go as it truly is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I used to love Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice was my favorite book; I've read it so many times that I can quote Elizabeth Bennet in my sleep. I know every single word of the movie Emma by heart. So, naturally, I felt compelled to read it. I love the flowery language, how Emma and Mr. Knightly converse so eloquently. However, still being a student, I am subjected to the whims of my teachers. When Mr. Sneeringer told us to have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights read in a week, I groaned. How it pained me to set aside my precious Emma! I was especially greived because I recognized the author's name. About a year and a half ago, another honors English teacher commanded us to read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. That book is definetly not reader-friendly. The vernacular of the Victorian era that completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel worked completely against Charlotte Bronte. It made reading a difficult novel all the more tedious. I feared that I was in for another dose of the awful stuff when I received Wuthering Heights. I want to say that I was pleasantly surprised, but that doesn't even come close to my feelings. The mystery was too much for me; I couldn't put it down. Wherever I went, Wuthering Heights came with me. I took it to class, to my meals and to bed. I literally fell asleep reading the two nights my book lasted. I found it to be extremely powerful and compelling. I aspire to become a great writer someday, so I have studied many things necessary to a great novel, including plot and character development. Emily Bronte is a master at these. Her characters are so complex, and, yet, I can still identify with them. They are so well developed that it makes an intriguing story impossibly compelling. She is truly a master of the Gothic novel. I am still in awe of the graphic description of all the dark forces surrounding the Heights. I became part of the whole story when I read this book. Yes, I still love Jane Austen, but now I readily admit that there is definetly room for Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"And it must be a fine something indeed, for it kept me, a fairly discerning reader, going all the way through despite the dated language, occasional impenetrable dialect, and characters who as grown adults behaved precisely the way I remember behaving when I was about 16.Part of the 'something', I think, is the surprisingly modern psychological insight underlying the book. Today we all know the people who cry 'I'm in love' while inflicting only pain on the loved one, or who destroy children and families because of some perceived wrong. But at the time this book was written, it was not common to focus a novel on a pair of lovers with the understanding that those lovers were, in fact, jerks. The way Bronte alternately panders to 'romance' conventions with craggy Heathcliff and wayward Catherine and then spits in the face of those conventions by showing the effeminate, willowy Edgar to be the closest thing to a decent adult character in the book is refreshing for those of us who are tired of the dominance of the alpha male.In passing, I must also mention that between the stormy moors, the borderline necrophilia, and the grandiose tooth-gnashing spurned-lover angst, this is a very goth book, which never hurts from my point of view.The other part of the equation is that (despite the protestations of certain reviewers) Bronte keeps the suspense high throughout the book. Between worrying about the fate of young Cathy, waiting for the ghost to make another appearance, and eagerly anticipating the moment when Heathcliff gets his, there's hardly a slack moment.I must say that the ending was not, in my opinion, as strong as it could have been, but I'll speak of it no more so as not to spoil it. Hence, only four stars."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Although I read Wuthering Heights years ago, I enjoyed rereading it. When I was younger I thought Heathcliff was just plain mean. Now that I am older, I understand loss, and frustration a little better and the book took on new meaning for me. I think everyone should read this book at least once, and if like me you read it years ago, it is time to reread it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I won't talk about the book because it's a classic and it is wonderful. This edition is so nice. It is cute and small and very pretty. It won't take much space, and it could be joined by several in the Gramercy Classics series for a very nice display. I recommend this book as a gift and I recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The only novel of Emily Bronte, published a year before her tragically early death, was met with considerable critical scorn upon its publication in 1847, but became successful in the following years, and it remains a masterpiece of literature to this day. The novel's central characters, Cathy and Heathcliff, are the ones that stick foremost in readers' minds, but the book spans two generations, opening with an embittered Heathcliff having wrecked havoc on the offspring of himself and his wife,the now deceased Linton, Cathy's daughter, and her brother Hindley's son, Hareton. The first narrator, Lockwood, arrives at the Heights, witnessing the strange, dark dynamics of his master's home. He falls asleep reading the papers of the late Catherine Earnshaw, and then encounters her childlike wraith, frightening him, and he overhears Heathcliff crying out for her. Lockwood makes the aquaintence of Nelly Dean, the Earnshaw's original housekeeper, and implores her to fill in the blanks of the bizarre oasis that he has found himself in. It then flashes back to what set it all in motion. Heathcliff is a gypsy boy found abandoned on the streets of Liverpool and is taken in by the Earnshaw family. The daughter Cathy is immediately taken with the mysterious lad, while her brother Hindley openly resents him. Cathy and Heathcliff are inseparable, roaming the moors, seeking adventure in everyday occurances, living their isolated lives in relative tranquility. Their bond, while not incestuous techincally because they are not blood relations, is disapproved of :\\"She was much too fond of Heathcliff. The greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him, yet, she got chided more than any of us on his account.\\"When the elder Mr. Earnshaw (who favored Heathcliff) dies, Hindley takes full advantage of this and relagates this \\"filthy, swearing boy\\" into a servant and goes out of his way to make Heathcliff's life hell. Cathy meets the weathly Edgar quite by chance after she and Heathcliff stray onto the Linton property: she is attacked by the family dog and they take her in until she heals; she contracts a fever which kills Edgar's parents. When she returns to the Heights, she has been transformed into a lady, upsetting the volatile soulmate that she so dearly loves but does not feel that she can marry. The rejected young man disappears from his beloved's life for some years, returning a very (inexplicabily) wealthy man, returning to wreck havoc on all who have wronged him. Cathy has married Edgar; Hindley has become a gambling drunk. He torments his former love with his courtship and marriage to Edgar's sister Isabella, his dark motives that ultimately drive everyone to misery, Cathy to an obsession that will cost her dearly. Their tender reunion at her deathbed (she is weak, soon to give birth to her namesake daughter), heartbreaklingly expresses their longing for one another and the negative choices they have made. \\"Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest, as long as I am living! You said I killed you - haunt me then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I believe - I know that ghosts have wandered on earth. Be with me always - take any form - drive me mad! Only do not leave me in this abyss, where I cannot find you! Oh God! It is unttuerable! I cannot live without my life! I cannot live without my soul!\\" After her death, Heathcliff becomes even more embittered, despising his effeminate son, Linton, nuturing Hindley's son Hareton in hatred with cruelty and abuse - both young men court young Catherine's affections. Despite his efforts, Heathcliff is unable to put a stop to Hareton's obvious love for young Catherine after the death of Linton, and so there is hope for the next generation when Catherine realizes that her heart lies with Hareton. The significance of that is unmistakable, even to Heathcliff, who sees in the budding relationship before him the parallels of what he once had with Cathy. Heathcliff remains obsessed with his lost love, hearing her voice calling to him, seeing her apparition out on the moors - the taboo subject of necrophilia is hinted when he digs her up the day after her funeral, and some years later longs to crawl in the coffin with her. When he finally meets his maker, and his ghost joins Cathy's, he has left a very unpleasant memory in the ones who remain; he endeared no one to him with his selfish, cruel and dissolute ways.Heathcliff is appropriately named; although it is acknowledged in the novel that he is named after an Earnshaw son who died, it serves as both a first and last name - his lack of a personal history, mysterious reserve - he is wild, just like the moors and the heath that grows there; he is unpredictable and volatile, like the wind that rips through the countryside, he drives others often to desperation - both Cathy and Isabella are extreme examples of this - leaving them devastated and inclined to self-destruction, as a cliff overlooking the sea can symbolize. He is almost unknowable in a way, making him almost a blank slate that others can project their own views and desires on. Cathy is self-absorbed in the way of an infant, and her love for him is both mature and childlike - the bond the formed from those early days is in her mind, always:\\"My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath . . . . I am Heathcliff - he's always , always in my mind - not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself - but as my own being.\\"The shifting of narrators can be mildly confusing at times, but the story is powerful and probes into the depths of human psychology, very daring for a novel of its time. Emily Bronte's poetry is also in a class by itself - some of her poems, which she wrote while composing the stories of her imaginary world of Gondal, seem to foreshadow the theme of Wuthering Heights. I recommend strongly the poems, \\"Remembrance\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\" in particular.A classic on every level, as long as you can handle dark human depths and romantic tragedy."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Every month my teacher makes us write a book report. I had a 300 and something page book that I was going to read but of course I put it off because I HATE READING! I decided to read this book because it was shorter and it had been on my bookshelf collecting dust for years. Once I started reading, I read a quarter of the book and the only reason I put it down was because by the time I looked up it was two in the morning! I think everyone needs to read this book. I was also amazed when I found out that it was written 150 years ago!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I picked up this book with a great background history of the Bronte sisters. Emily was the most sheltered and out of her came Wuthering Heights which is an intense story of love, hate, and passion. The book criticizes society at the time and really holds nothing back. There is no real happy ending here but the book does take you along an interesting path that deals with race, class, and religious issues."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As you begin to read this novel you will almost certainly feel a sense of confusion. I have heard many people complain that the first four chapters are among the most confusing and boring chapters they have ever read. Do not, I repeat, do not stop reading this book in the first four chapters. Although the story does not make sense at first and especially because the names of the characters sometimes appear more than once, continue to read the book because it is worth it in the end.The story focuses around Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The main theme of the story focuses around the mysterious powers of love and hatred and how this played into the lives of two families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons. The reason why this novel has been considered such a masterpiece is that it encompasses every human emotion from love to hate, forgiveness to revenge and everything else in the realm of human understanding. As one reads the novel it becomes apparent that Emily Bronte is very skilled in her ability to weave everything into this tight-knit story with countless parallels and subtle symbolism. There is incredible symbolism within this book that I would encourage readers to try to pick out. On the surface the book is a treasure in itself, containing the most memorable love story in all of literature as well as managing to encompass so many universal themes, but understanding the symbolism gives this novel so much more depth. Understanding the symbols is the only way to truly appreciate the genius of Wuthering Heights and Emily Bronte herself. If you do decide to read this book, it becomes too irresistable not to read again, and absolutely impossible to forget."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a disturbingly dark book about love, obsession and revenge. It is a romantic novel full of twists and turns that nearly requires the reader to keep a running dictionary of characters, especially since names have a tendency to pop up in different places and on different people throughout the novel. I read this novel for a class assignment in Victorian Literature but it is helpful to know that the book employs many themes of the Romantic literary genre as well. Victorian ideas of social class are brought up as well as the fantasies of adolescence. Some of the Romantic ideas found in the novels include the idea of the tragic landscape. The landscape of the novel is foreboding and isolated, borrowed most likely from the gothic novel. The characters are extreme in their varying passions and the concept of the dream is used in a type of ghostly communication. One of the story's narrators has a dream of being visited by the ghost of Catherine, which causes a startling and dramatic reaction in Heathcliff. The belief that the reader cannot fully hate Heathcliff because of how he was mistreated as a child is also a Romantic ideal.The story contains a great deal of darkness and some cruelty, which may turn readers away. Love is often extreme to the point of violence in the novel while the romances themselves are nearly incestuous in tone. Cousins marry and adopted siblings hold lifelong affections and obsessions for each other. The novel also illustrates an element of cruelty that can be slightly disturbing at times. Heathcliff, the novel's antagonist, goes as far as to string up the beloved dog of the young woman he courts after Catherine rejects him.The main focus of the story is the rather twisted love story element that develops between Catherine and Heathcliff. Heathcliff is adopted into Catherine's family at a young age and the pair become close, though Catherine rejects him because he is poor and instead marries a rich neighbor. Though throughout the novel, other romances develop between the two highly inbred families, they are side stories in comparison to the main romance.The love of Catherine and Heathcliff eventually develops into an obsession that lasts, and in fact becomes even stronger with the eventual death of Catherine. Her spirit seems to haunt Heathcliff and further fire his obsession. Even before Catherine's death this obsessive love broadens to include an equally obsessive drive to ruin the lives of all the people who mistreated him and stood between him and Catherine, including her husband and older brother.These obsessions eventually lead to the last of the major themes of the novel, revenge. A good part of the book is spent upon Heathcliff's attempts to destroy the lives of anyone and everyone who mistreated him or got in the way of his relationship with Catherine. His need for revenge does not lessen as the book moves on and Heathcliff continues to take his revenge even upon the next generation, including Catherine's daughter and his own son. Whether or not Heathcliff succeeds in his attempts I leave to the reader.Personally, I enjoyed this book a great deal, if for no other reason than the simple fact that it was quite different from the usual school assigned reading. I was pleasantly surprised by how well woven and engaging the book was. The calculating lengths that Heathcliff goes to in order fulfill his quest for revenge are nearly reason enough to read the book. The old style language of the book, which I expected to be a hindrance, was hardly noticeable. In short, if you can handle (or enjoy) the book's darker aspects, then I highly recommend this classic to you. (And I'm not just saying that because I have to! ;))Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WARNING: reading this review will spoil some of the plot of WH.I grinned when Sis, back in high school, told me I reminded her of Heathcliff. I remembered from the (old, old) movie that he was some evil fellow. Then I read the book. And stopped grinning. I'm amazed this book would ever be assigned to high school 'kids.' It's humorless and ultra-realistic. Every page reeks of evil and has selfishly evil (meaning normal) characters. Heathcliff was a tortured being but hardly innocent. Cathy was a solipsistic, driven fool. Even the Cliff Notes booklet for WH is surprisingly short (I read The Notes after burning through the book in a week) as if Cliff's was horrified to study this book! Cliff's good observation about Heathcliff is that his sole emotion is actually pity/affection for Hareton and that his 'love' for Cathy is, in fact, an animal possessive jealous rage. I changed after reading this book. For the better, I don't know. There is a point in the book where Heathcliff's every action evokes disgust and hatred, and then...as a man...I began to feel what he felt. For whatver his faults, I began to connect fully with his insane rage, and that his ideal of 'love' for Catherine--however warped--had been stolen from him forever. I understood his ruthlessness and love for no person or thing after Catherine's death. By the way, not to parrot the critics, but it is true that the marriage of Cathy and Hareton is NOT some kind of full circle, happier ending. It's more like holding hands in Hell. I left this book sadder than when I started it. After reading it, I doubt anyone anywhere is getting 'wiser.'"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I was enraptured with this book.

Even his oldest friend and companion Catherine is not beyond reproach.Lockwood knows nothing of the scandal and unrest that surrounds Wuthering Heights when he leases Thrushcross Grange from Heathcliff for a season. Scandalized by the residents of Wuthering Heights and shocked by the blatant disregard for common courtesy and propriety, he soon endeavors to unearth the whole story from his housekeeper, Nelly Dean.The story Nelly reveals is one of unresolved passion, haunting obsession, and a connection that even death cannot deny in Wuthering Heights (1847) by Emily Bront.Wuthering Heights is Bront's only novel.Groundbreaking for its time, Wuthering Heights is a divisive novel that is more often regarded with love or hate rather than indifference.Some claim Bront's gothic novel is a sweeping romance that spans not just years but death itself. Written in the first person with a framing story around the main drama of Catherine and Heathcliff's doomed relationship, Bront creates an evocative story filled with Yorkshire dialect and harsh lanscapes.At the same time, this book is a study in human cruelty. Catherine and Heathcliff are horrible people and, even while proving their love for one another, they do unspeakable things.If you can get past the basic meanness of almost all of the characters, Wuthering Heights is an atmospheric story filled with chills and menace sure to linger after the last page is finished.Possible Pairings: Frost by Marianna Baer, Plain Kate by Erin Bow, The Wicked and the Just by J.

Not only did her writng have the power to transport you to seemingly another world, but the memorable characters and personalities make Wuthering Heights a book to remember. The charming tale takes place in windswept England on a lovely castle. Told through a narrative of an old housekeeper, the story of love and hate take place first hand. While quite unsuspecting, Mr. Lockwood, a guest of Thrushcross Grange, visits, he hears the tale of the Earnshaw family who used to live in Wuthering Heights. In a tale of backstabbing, lying, cheating, love, and hatred, he hears the tale of Hindley and Heathcliff and their sibling rivalry along with their lover Catherine who marries Hindley but is in love with Heathcliff. At the end of the book, all members of the original family are gone, and Mr. Lockwood takes note of how quiet and peaceful the grange has become. The true charm of this book are the characters. The way in which they speak is charming and brings out personality. Emily Bronte had a wit an charm about her style of writing, something that is very apparent in Wuthering Heights. While filled with quite a bit of drama, Wuthering Heights is a book that will transport you to the old English estate country and leave you with a story in which you will find entertaining as well as charmming."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book came in as I had expected it too be as well as on time!

I haven't read the others, but it is definitely my favourite so far.\\"I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\\""},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"It's strange how often I have the experience of reading an \\"old\\" novel like this one, expecting it to be dry and boring, and find that it's anything but. You'd think I'd learn, but no. There's a reason these are called classics: people have been thinking they're really good for a long time, and they're still really good. This is the kind of book I would have gone out of my way to not read in high school, which is probably just as well. I wouldn't have appreciated it then.One thing I noticed right off the bat is that this isn't Jane Austen, which just goes to show that female British novelists of the early 1800s can be very different. Jane Austen is very funny and satirical. Emily Bronte is very serious. There are flashes of humor now and then, but she's mining the human soul, and it's dark work.This book was written in 1845, but describes fictional events that took place from the 1770s until 1801. I don't know why she placed the events in the novel so far in the past. Maybe people of the 1840s would have thought, \\"Oh, the 1770s! Yeah, that's how people behaved then.\\" The same way we would think of the 1940s, I guess. But I don't have that perspective, so I don't know what she was going for.She does some pretty complicated stuff with the narration, too. She doesn't just tell you what happened, starting at the beginning and moving on to the end. She actually starts at the end of the story, with the main narrator meeting the surviving participants in what happened 30 years before. Then she begins introducing various other narrators who describe what happened from their point of view. This really plunges you into the story, because you're not looking at it from the outside, but from the perspective of someone actually involved with the events at the time. You're in the moment and in the place. I was impressed by such sophisticated storytelling in what I think was her first novel, and in 1845.There are only a handful of characters in the story, and each one is sharply delineated. You can just picture these people. Bronte has a knack for apt description. I was glad this wasn't one of those novels that describes every nail in the floor, but what description there is is always telling and to the point. She's not just filling up pages like some authors ::cough:: Dickens ::cough:: sometimes do.The plot is simple enough. Heathcliff is a boy of unknown origins who is brought up in the same family as the girl Catherine. They're inseparable companions. However, when they grow up, Catherine marries someone else. That's it. But the consequences and the complexity of the interactions of these two characters with each other and with everyone around them are amazing. Bronte wrings every drop out of the situation. At some times, you get the feeling, \\"Wait: you mean, if he had heard the rest of what she'd said, none of this would have happened?\\" But that's what life is like sometimes. It depends on a single word or look or gesture.I think that people of the time would have been pretty scandalized by some of the goings-on. People play pretty loose with \\"the sanctity of marriage\\", for instance. And I think it would have absolutely terrified women about getting pregnant. Everybody dies in childbirth in this book.I also think this has to be one of the first novels that has an actual sociopath as a main character. Dropping someone like Heathcliff into ordinary polite English society is like tossing a hand grenade into a cricket match. The effects are devastating, and all the more so because people don't expect it and have no idea how to deal with it.To modern audiences, there are other parts that are at least as disturbing. The idea of first cousins marrying seems to be perfectly fine with these people - in fact, one character does it twice - but probably gives readers today a Ewww feeling. And the casual way that Heathcliff can beat people, or kidnap them, or lock them in their rooms for weeks, all without even the mention of the possibility of some kind of police or legal reckoning is chilling.Bronte shows a perfection of wording that is astonishing. She always selects the right word to describe even the most commonplace of actions, such as walking or talking. It's an unobtrusive thing, but she words scenes with a precision that is admirable.Ultimately, this is a fascinating novel following events from a simple source that eventually engulf and destroy almost everyone connected with them, like a slow and remorseless tidal wave.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A must read...not because \\"Bella\\" says you should. But because this story is just so powerful. Aside from that one guy you can't ever understand, it takes you to another time with language that is so much like woven yarn."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"After reading Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I thought I should continue in the same vein with Wuthering Heights, written by her sister Emily Bronte. But whereas Jane Eyre is a story of love rewarded and hopes fulfilled, Wuthering Heights so far is an unremittingly grim tale of cruelty and revenge in two related families.Structurally, the book is a frame tale within a frame tale: Mr. Lockwood, the narrator who introduces the story, is soon replaced by the voice of Nelly Dean, the faithful servant who relates to Mr. Lockwood the family history that has led to the current misery. To my view, Nelly is the strongest and most believable character. Most of the rest of the characters in the story seem overdrawn. They are also hard to keep straight, partly because names are shared between generations; sometimes I think a family tree might be helpful.Considering that Wuthering Heights was written about 1845, I was expecting more difficulty with language than I actually encountered. There are few speeches in a heavy Yorkshire dialect which are daunting, and apparently even the author at one point considered revising them to make them intelligible to a broader audience. And there are some isolated words which seem to have changed their meaning over the years; but for the most part the book is quite readable.I have so far read about two-thirds of the text. I am plodding through to the end, hoping that there may be some ray of light shed before the end of the book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A great classic read.

It is an amazing novel, capturing the reader and drawing them into Cathy and Heathcliff's world, devided between the two contrasting houses of Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. The writing style of Bronte conveys the emotion extremley well throughout the intricate and intertwining storylines. The story is told over the course of two generations, in the moors of England, creating a good backdrop for such a story. It is, in my opinion deserving of its status and leaves the reader with thoughts regarding fate and predestination. A dramatic and sadenning book, Wuthering Heights is a novel which, at the time it was published pushed back the barriers of what was considered &quot;acceptable&quot; in literature."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This book is a great mix of passion, love, betrayel, and revenge.i would recommend this book to everybody.

The main difficulty was understanding the slang words and some of the phrases that were used in the &quot;English&quot; language. Once I got more into the story, I could understand what was going on. I found myself wanting to read on about the relationships between Heathcliff and Catherine, Catherine and Edgar, and Heathcliff and Edgar. These relationships were exciting to read about to see how everything would turn out in the end. I would put myself in the characters' shoes and think about how I would react to the various situations. For example, if I were Catherine, I would get rid of my need for wealth and marry for love. In Heathcliff's position, I would have accepted the fact that I would never be with Catherine and try to find happiness in my own life.

WHat a great pity that Emily Bronte hasn't written more novels."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I could actually see myself in both Cathy and Heathcliff, though totally different characters.. or are they?.. It's a good good book!"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte has perfectly illustrated a tale of passion, love and despair. One of those couples seen in the same light as Romeo and Juliet, Heathcliff and Catherine portray lovers in another story of love lost. This book is impossible to put down, and it will surely haunt you long after you have finished it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I am not entirely satisfied with the title I give for this review. What would one say of a book that disturbs and grips you and at the same time moves you as no other romance story has.It is a dark story. Twisted characters.Despicable and inhuman characters even. The narrative infuses in us a feeling of dark stormy nights. There isn't much depiction of romance in here. But I remember it as the most passionate romance I've ever read. The romance between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. The power of their feelings for each other is so real and forceful, I feel they might still be roaming the moors in Yorkshire together as spirits.And Emily Bronte's narrative is gripping.The only shortcoming I felt was the ending which was rather convenient and this convenience leads to a predictable happy ending."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"If Emily Bronte's intention was for us to have some feeling for her characters, because I think that is one of the marks of a good writer, then she hit the mark beautifully. Catherine and Heathcliff must be the most infuriating characters I have ever had the displeasure to read about. They are two selfish beasts continually arguing over which one is selfish! Instead of finding their relationship to be some intoxicating gothic romance, it is instead a bizarre, love/hate infatuation that brings misery to everyone around them.The gruesomness of the characters takes away nothing from the value of the work. As a matter of fact, I think it adds a vivid flavor that is hard to get from many novels. Afterall, everyone gringes at movies, but how many people gringe at books?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"My Review:Emily Bronte's novel Wuthering Heights is a classic that all should read. It uniquely portrays the undoubtedly present fight between earnest and passionate love and vigorous hate. This novel is the epidemy of a tale that twists the reader's previous opinion on innocent love.Wuthering Heights is the home to the Earnshaw family. It lies desolate from the world upon the moors and wetlands of vast fields. This home is quiet large in size, however it is musty and gray in color and rather lonely in its outward appearance. The master is the father, Mr. Earnshaw, then there is Mrs. Earnshaw and the children, whom are Hindley and Catherine. Further into the novel a child is added into the Earnshaw family, but it is not their own. This child is later known as Heathcliff, an Irish gypsy waif found and pitied by the master during his stay at Liverpool. The master took such pain in seeing the boy on his own that he brought him home to his children to accompany. But Earnshaw's son, Hindley, from the very beginning detested Heathcliff for the reason that the master, much too obviously, favored \\"poor Heathcliff\\" than that of his own son!AS the years past, turmoil, jealousy and overall hatred consumed Hindley, leaving Heathcliff and him to be forever enemies. On the contrary, Catherine and Heathcliff were the best of friends and they grew to love each other dearly. In fact the were inseparable to the point that the greatest punishment that either could have been given was that of being away from each other.The two were quite rambunctious and always up for adventure. One day Catherine and Heathcliff met other children at the residence of Thrushcross Grange ( the Lintons, the rich and spoiled kids!!!). Catherine instantly fell in love with their classy way of life and left Heathcliff to eat her dust!! haha..Catherine still loved Heathcliff but grew to understand that she was just too high class of a women for him , resulting in her decision to love and marry her material possessor Edgar Linton ( one of the rich kids, his sister was Isabella Linton.)Stricken by grief, Heathcliff pursued till his very death his soul and body...his dear Catherine. Without her he was not complete, and each day he yearned her presence.In volume two of this novel the reader comes to know of whom marries who and who are their children. Heathcliff in this volume becomes an aggressive hateful man and his once joyful heart is turned black and cold; full of hate. Cathy, the descendant of Catherine, is portrayed by Bronte as the fulfillment of her mother's dream that was never reached ( marrying her true love). And whom Cathy marries is her cousin ( I know gross right?...well she marries 2 of her cousins!!! nastier!) who is known as Hareton. They, in a way, are the parallel of their elders, but they are more so in the sense that they are the \\"happy ending\\" to the love fest of Catherine and Heathcliff.Overall, I would have to say that this book is not only credited for its educational material, rather to me it is credited by its insightfully constructed plot. Bronte is an amazingly talented author who places her own viewpoints and morals skillfully throughout this classic. This novel is great because of its symmetrical structure of love and hate, nature and culture, and lastly the ongoing fight between Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. At the story's finale it is truly left up to the reader to decide whom they believe won the battle. At first one believes it is Wuthering Heights due to Catherine giving in to marrying her love, yet it could be the Grange for both Catherine and Hareton beating Heathcliff's evilness in the end. What readers should come to appreciate from this novel is that Bronte really applied her inner emotions to this novel and the whole story is told from her beliefs and her viewpoint on the matter of Catherine and Heathcliff's immortal love which is too sacred to control, therefore Bronte ends this love triangle by their death for the reason that in some cases love cannot be joined for it is so strong that peace could not be kept with its overpowering presence on human kind.--ChiChi----"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"When it was first published under a pseudonym in 1847, Wuthering Heights caused a scandal. The staid and drab era of the 1840's was simply not used to such an intense and disturbing story of such raw passion and cruelty. In this tale of love and tragedy, an orphan named Heathcliff is adopted and comes to live at Wuthering Heights. He falls in love with the man's daughter, Catherine. But his life is hell because of her brother. Catherine's brother hates and humiliates him. Heathcliff can take it no more and eventually he runs away. He's gone a long time and in the meantime, Catherine marries, even though it's Heathcliff she's really in love with. Heathcliff returns dandified and rich... to take his revenge. But I won't give away the climax and ending. Heart-stopping and intense! Not for everyone, certainly not for the light 'n' fluffy inspirational romance reader, but for fans of Charlotte Bronte and Thomas Hardy.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Some readers may be put off by the &quot;classic&quot; genre of this book. The only reason I read it was because I had to for English. Well, I was glad I did. It is extremely difficult to understand at times, especially with the constant switching of narrators. I had previously seen a movie production with Lawrence Olivier, which I loved, and although it was quite different from the novel, it helped me to understand much of what was happening. The romance between Cathy and Heathcliff is absolutely heartrending. To all of those who love passionate romance (though not passionate by today's sense), I recommend this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't like romance novels, or movies or television shows. Such is the curse of the lion share of my sex, despite our gradual feminization in the modern era.I'm glad I overcame my aversion to read this excellent portrayal of eros defiled. Heathcliff is the focus, fulcrum and prime mover in this story. He is dragged of the streets and taken in by a wealthy gentleman from the provinces. This man showers great affection on the young street urchin and demands equal treatment from his two natural born children.The eldest, a son, resents this upstart, so when the father dies, he relegates poor Heathcliff to the status of neglected servant. Catherine, the younger, has become a close friend of Heathcliff and follows him into the relatively untethered but savage life of the servants' children. Growing up unsupervised they develop the manners of the low born, and but develop a strong bond of love that transcends the facile distinctions of filial versus romantic.Alas, when Catherine comes of age, the duties of her birth beckon and she is taken from Heathcliff and marries someone of higher station.It is this love, never fulfilled, that sours in Heathcliff makes him a despicable tyrant.This is the dark side of romance, and Romance as viewed from the man's vantage point.Worth reading."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As a great work of literature and a novel of passion, this work is excellent. A dark novel, it is quite intreging, drawing one into the complex and whimsically dark dream world of the characters. The novel is truly able to contrast the wild depths of one's soul with the civilized, although repressed areas through the contrast of the two houses and the people who reside there. Heathcliff, although dispicable, is someone we can sympathize with...savage and unrefined, he extends beyond humanity, becoming a character of pure passion. Cathy also exists as a refined and civilized form of that same passion, which is why she can love both the dainty Edgar and the wild Heathcliff. The children carry on the parents lives, and, eventually setting their mistakes right and bringing order through their marriage. Heathcliff too has a poignant changing scene, in which we realize that he is not evil, but has just succumbed to this because of his pain and sorrow. My favorite scene is the last between Cathy and Hareton, ending with Heathcliff's death....it was simply beautiful and contrasted with the novel's darkness. The style too was mesmerizing....Bronte's poetic language is beautiful and full of meaning...fiting perfectly with the characters. All and all, it is an excellent novel, but complex, and anything but light and simple. Jane Eyre may be better, but if you like it, read this too, it's worth your while."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is a very slow book. Not much happens and you shouldn't read it if you want an interesting story. After reading it, I feel that the book could have been shortened greatly. Even though there are some excellent themes in it, I don't see WH as an example of fine literature. Authors such as Hemingway (For Whom the Bell Tolls), Dumas (The Count of Monte Cristo--Unabridged), and Frank (Alas Babylon) spin much better tales with much stronger themes and meaning. My advice: skip this book and read the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Hello,and welcome to my breif reveiw on Wuthering Heights.If you want to read this book you've made the right choice. Wuthering Heights is a beautiful book of passion,pain,tragedy and love. Although I am only a chid I think that this book is the most touching one I have ever read. Wuthering Heights is about the young love of Catherine and Heathcliff and their struggle to be together. I read this book and had this much admiration for it, so why shouldn't you?"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"WUTHERING HEIGHTS has always been portrayed to me as a magnificiently tragic romance between an unconventional pair of lovers. I'm glad I can finally judge it for myself. Heathcliff, rather than coming across as the quintessential brooding (yet sympathetic) hero, is a character of textbook psychopathic tendencies, right down to the needless torturing and killing of animals. Catherine is never described or portrayed sympathetically either; she is ill natured, petulant, conniving and as vengeful as Heathcliff, whom she regards as her soul mate. (But, of course, since they are both physically attractive, people must feel free to ignore these aspects of the text.)So what triggers the tragedy in their romance? Unconventional Catherine decides to take the conventional route of the times and marry for money. Heathcliff, a foundling who has been raised as Catherine's brother, slinks off with his tail between his legs, only to return in three years time with enough money to gamble with,enabling him to win the mortage to Wuthering Heights from Catherine's nasty actual brother. Meanwhile, Catherine and Heathcliff are quite dismayed when Catherine's husband finally puts his foot down and says they cannot continue their relationship. Catherine proceeds to her bedroom where she eventually bites a hole in her feather pillow and (in my favorite scene) amuses herself by naming the bird from which every feather came. Heathcliff elopes out of spite with Catherine's sister-in-law, a conventional sort who still manages to do what the wild and reckless Catherine should have done in the first place, or even later, instead of hiding out in her room for months on end. But no, that would have spoiled the plot, wouldn't it? WUTHERING HEIGHTS is definitely driven by plot, with the characters' personalities shifting to suit Miss Bronte's narrative needs.Am I glad I read this? Yes. Bronte's descriptive strengths made mucking through the characters's histrionics worthwhile. Should I have felt guilty for having put it off for so many years? Certainly not. I think even as a teenager I'd have found the characters absurd and unlikable. Do I have concern for those who think Heathcliff's continued obsession with Catherine after her death, and his compulsion to punish all those who'd thwarted his relationship with her (as well as the offspring of these people, even his own)is a shining example of a true love that transcends death? Most definitely. It saddens me to think that some girls may remain in abusive relationships because their boyfriends are the Heathcliff-type, and therefore, supposedly desirable. Heathcliff is psychopathological. Love for one person, thwarted or not, is not supposed to be used as grounds for destroying the lives of everyone else you come in contact with."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"What a great experience to finally reread this classic as an adult. Emily Bronte depicts a very gothic and depressing story of two star-crossed (but not terribly likeable) lovers, Cathy & Heathcliff, and the love between them that transcended the grave. Added to that a wonderful depiction of the dark English moors and the local characters with their strange dialects. This was also told in a very unusual style, like a tale within a tale within a tale, adding more layers and perspectives to the story.How unfortunate that one's upbringing can so affect a person that their grief and bitterness turn what could have been a fine young man into such a hateful and vengeful person as Heathcliff became. And fortunate that Cathy's daughter and Hareton could overcome their dark upbringing to bring a happier light onto the dark moors of England.I did not read this version of the book, but theSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), which did not have all the footnotes. I think I enjoyed that better as I wasn't constantly distracted by looking to the back for the notes and just allowed myself to become engrossed with the story. It's one book you have to read at least twice in your life -- of course in school as required reading and then again as an adult to add that perspective of age and experience in life so that one can more fully appreciate a such a classic tale."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Those who read WUTHERING HEIGHTS only because their 10th grade English teacher mandated it, often return to Emily Bronte's classic years later for a return visit to the howling moor without quite knowing why. There is a sense of place to the novel that resists ready explanation, and it is perhaps that lingering memory of the triangle that connects Heathcliff, Catherine, and the moor that demands a closer examination with a more mature perspective.Heathcliff and Catherine have a stormy love affair, but the book is not simply a reworking of the romantic potboilers so current then. Nor is it just a cataloguing of nature, though nature is present even from the opening pages. What elevates WUTHERING HEIGHTS to a level not reached before and only a very few times since is Bronte's unique ability to take a nature that is merely descriptive in the hands of a lesser and infuse its wildness and unbridled power into a man who is the walking symbol of that power.Bronte divides nature in the macrocosmic sense--birds, trees, wind, rocks--into two distinct elements. There is the low key, quiet, and peaceful image of nature so beloved by Wordsworth and locates it in the peaceful Thrushcross Grange. It is here where the cultured Linton family live. Every image that Bronte uses is pacific in scope. One wonders whether the Lintons even hear the same whoosh of wind that resounds in Heathcliff's ears. Less obvious to the careless reader is the enervating subtext that infuses the Grange. Bronte drops several hints that the Grange, for all its peaceful charm, has a charm that is incapable of propagating itself in the emerging harshness of the deterministic ruthless way of life that just then was gathering steam. Catherine is a woman with one foot in that world of culture, manners, and -lingering slow death. Even after she leaves Heathcliff for Edgar Linton, Catherine tells Nelly that she is quite aware of the differences between the worlds of the Grange and of Wuthering Heights: \\"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods. Time will change it...My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath.\\" Here, Bronte takes the homely images of nature and personalizes them as the metaphorical difference between that which Catherine merely finds pleasant (The Grange) and that which she finds necessary (Wuthering Heights). Then there is the twisted, stormy, and unpredictable nature of Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff grew and it is there that he suffered untold horrors that taught him that for him to survive, he had to be as violent as the winds which surrounded him.It is less certain whether Bronte wishes the reader to excuse Heathcliff's unspeakable cruelty once he reverses economic position with the effete Edgar Linton. But perhaps it is less to the point to seek to place blame for Heathcliff's revenge than to acknowledge that it is definitely useless to blame a bolt of lighting for striking its unwary victim. Heathcliff, as the walking symbol of Wuthering Heights, is that bolt which strikes out in a manner not unlike the way that he himself had been struck many times as a boy. Once Heathcliff has his revenge in the humbling of the Lintons, a revenge which costs him his beloved Catherine, it remains for the next generation--the young Cathy and Hareton--to remind Heathcliff that revenge must not be permitted to outlive its proper time, and for the new residents of both Grange and the Heights, that time has long passed. What emerges, then, from a second reading of WUTHERING HEIGHTS is Bronte's firm commitment to recreate a clash of conflicting and very nearly mutually exclusive emotions--revenge and forgiveness--that cause each new generation to learn to temper the former with the latter and thus retain their basic humanity."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"A classic like this comes with a hell of a lot of baggage. More people know of Wuthering Heights, know the cliche of clambering about desolate moorlands shouting \\"Heathcliff!\\" and rolling about passionately in the heather, than have actually read the book.But those who do read it are often surprised to find a violent, complex tale that tells as much of hate as of love. This is no frilly romance. This is a book peopled by unapologetically nasty, even hateful characters, many of whom are totally irredeemable. This is a book of hardship, of cruel passion, of all-consuming vendettas.It is also a fantastic book that everyone should read at some point in their lives. Emily Bronte tapped into some deep, dark well of the human psyche when she penned this singular collosus of a novel. From its amazingly complex yet deftly accomplished narrative structure (consisting of narratives within narratives within narratives) through to its two-tiered plot concerning the sins and misdeeds of one generation being visited upon the second, Wuthering Heights can take your breath away. It doesn't hurt that the plot itself is of great interest, and that the characters, horrid as some of them are, are so vividly drawn that many (like Heathcliff and Cathy) have transcended the bounds of the book to enter our popular consciousness.Wuthering Heights is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This novel is amazing and among my favorites. From the loyal and selfless Mrs. Dean, to the narcissistic and vain Catherine (and everyone imaginable in between), the characters are portrayed with a very unique talent. They truly are unforgettable, and the story is well-packed. The literal undying love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff will clutch the very soul of the reader. The insanity that grips and devastates throughout the novel gives Wuthering Heights an almost sick tone. The more dominate plot of Heathcliff bringing a heavy revenge upon his foes which in turn terrorizes the next generation, is told in a brilliant, intriguing, and clever way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"There really much to say about this wonderful book that hasn't already been said, but I want to say when I read this book, i was so upset when the book ended. I've read this book about million times and each time it gets better and better. I wish i had written this book, it touches every part of you when you read it."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wuthering Heights\\" is now a famouse work of literature that once recieved very negative reviews Emily Bronte has this only novel besides her peoms. Taking place in a small town \\"Gimmerton\\" in England, it offers a lot of emotions and thoughts to the reader. This novel begins with a narrator who is mentioned only three to four times. The narrator Mr. Lockwood is lodging in at Thrushcross Grange, and is tolf the story of a very conflicting family, by Ellen Dean. Mr.Lockwood only has the oppertunity to meet fine of the characters. It seems to be that anyone that visits Wuthering Heights is faced with horiffic mightmares and will not stay in for long. Ms. Deans story begins when the main characters were very young.The novel has a lot of twist and turns and it is filled with hatred, love, envy and unhappiness. Emily ends her novel very calmly as everything falls in its place. I believe that even today, we are faced with people or families that dislike one another. Yet it is harder for revenge to be accomplished, since now we have justice from law? Emily's novel takes place before the 1800's and the rich were the ones who rules, especially in a small town . \\"wuthering Heights\\" is a must need book. The detailed events and feelings, makes you know each character deeply. You will feel attached to the characters and feel what they feel. I really enjoyed this novel."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"\\"Wurthering Heights\\" is among the greatest English novels. It is the only novel by Emily Bronte that was published in 1847, one year before the death of the author. It is a tragic romantic story of the tormented love relationship between Heathcliff and Cathy. This is a well written moving story which some readers may find too distressing.Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff were deeply in love but were destined to be apart. Catherine is a strong willed lady who was on her way up the social ladder. Heathcliff was an orphan who was a waif and was brought to the house by Cathy's father. Cathy and Heathcliff have a strong attraction for each other. However, due to Catherine's social status, she decides to marry Edgar Linton. Heathcliff feels betrayed. From then on, Emily Bronte weaves an intricate plot in a captivating story full of suspense. The story of revenge by Heathcliff is deeply disturbing, violent and shocking.Heathcliff comes out as a man with a demonic character, who is not capable of forgiving someone, is absolutely evil and seeks total destruction of the objects of his hatred. It is difficult to understand the depth of his cruelty and the extreme irrationality of his actions.The book teaches a number of lessons, one of which is the damage that resentment and pride can do to a person as it did to Heathcliff. The author also shows the negative impact of class differences as Catherine cannot embrace Heathcliff for who he is, despite their deep mutual love.This is a compelling and powerful book that left a deep impression on me. The intensity of the emotions exhibited by the main characters is captivating. This powerful and unforgettable novel is highly recommended for those studying English Literature and anyone else who wants to read an interesting and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"That, along with many other lines, is why so many of us love Wuthering Heights. It is my all-time favorite book. I've loved it since I was about 14 years old (I'm 30 now). I love the atmospheric quality, the isolation, the rawness of human nature that this book portrays. Yes, Heathcliff and Catherine's love now seems a bit crazy, but for people who led such isolated lives, it's not hard to believe. To me, the novel IS Heathcliff. SPOILER ALERT--Once Catherine dies (midway in the novel), you would think the novel would end. But it doesn't, because Heathcliff's story continues. He's still my favorite anti-hero of any novel (sorry but Darcy or Rochester CANNOT compare)."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Emily Bronte, by far the most talented, arcane, imaginative of the Bronte sisters, wrote the most mentally-provocative love story ever told in the English language. Everything about this book is brilliant! Its setting on the \\"wuthering\\" (wind-swept) hilltops of a Yorkshire moor that seems not just ghost-ridden but somehow physically suspended in time is the most perfect marriage of location to tale I know of. The characters here, needless to say most especially the damned, tormented Heathcliff, rise so far above anything else written in the English language for the next hundred years that I only wish there was a higher rating than five stars to heave praise on this deserving masterpiece. I was given stacks of \\"classic\\" novels to read throughout high school and I grew cynical about them all, these boring, dust-choked standing ruins of books, but Wuthering Heights was a rare exception. This story of love, death, obsession and the indescribable energy of human emotion all but rises off the page with its ferocity. It's widely said Victorian women had fainting spells under the power of Bronte's prose, and I don't doubt that. It is not for me to try to detail this novel's plot, but rather to try to convey to you the force with which Bronte's great book struck me. I was shocked by its brilliance and reveled in all its suggested far down below its cacophonous words. Anyone who claims to appreciate literature and does not read Wuthering Heights is dwelling in a self-imposed exile from an experience few books can deliver. The sheltered Miss Bronte, in literature what the later Emily Dickinson was to poetry, was, in her era, without peer."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Wuthering Heights is one of the most passionate and haunting novels I have ever read. Emily Bronte's incredible understanding of human nature makes this tale of the power of both love and hate more endearing and realistic than the normal Romantic novel. Even after 150 years, it has the ability to shock and horrify a reader, as well as move them to tears of both joy and sorrow. The first half of the novel that illustrates Catherine Earnshaw's and Heathcliff's doomed affair is by far the most popular and famous section of the book. However, our culture has severely watered down their fascinating relationship to an archetypal version of two lovers. Bronte presents us with a much deeper, twisted, and complicated love that destroys their lives as well as the people around them. I personally also loved the second half of the book that deals with the effects of Catherine and Heathcliff on the next generation. It is much less intense than the first half, but is very beautiful and brings the plot to a full circle. I strongly recommend this book, but please do not believe that it will be a simple love story. It is a complex analysis on vindication, jealousy, hatred, and of couse, a love that is even stronger than death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Its been a long time since I've fully been engrossed in a novel-for some time, I've worked my way through books, flipping a few pages forward so I could see when the chapter would end and I could find something better to entertain myself with. This particular novel, however, woke up something in me. It's a beautifully written piece about a passion that goes unchecked, leading a man to his doom. What's august about this piece is that the reader has a hard time deciding if the man (Heathcliff) did in fact deserve his fate. The novel deals with very difficult psychological subjects-when forgiveness should be blessed on those who have wronged you and what one should value in one's life. It is enraptured by violence, yet there is not mention of any violent scenes. Amorous to its very essence, but sadly disappointing for those expecting erotic moments. It deals with the very basis of man but mixes universal raisons d'etre with individual idiosyncrasies of the characters. It is, in short, an amazing novel and Emily Bronte should be admired for still being able to connect with readers years after her death."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read Wuthering Heights for first time when i was 12 years old.Now I\`m 18 and I\`m still reading this book.And at everytime i read it, I can\`t hold myself from crying.

The strength of this story is that it is written about very flawed people. It is dark and passionate and very non-PC. It would never be written today. In short, it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was really a great book. I started out with a negative attitude about reading it, because many English literature classics turn out being very boring or slow; not so with this one. It was so intense and original that I honestly had to force myself to close the book at night and get some sleep. One should not expect a likeness to Shakespeare's extraordinary skill of language, but it obviously was not written by an idiot. Overall it is easy reading, with a few sophisticated, rarely used words encountered every page or two. The book should be read by anyone who can appreciate true love, and the pain caused through selfishness, cruelty, and all-encompassing sorrow. Just about every feeling of emotion is covered in this great work, actually. Don't put much truth into what some reviews say about the ending. There truly could not have been a better one. Everything comes full-circle, as I see it, and it happens in such a way as to make any sharp reader satisfied. Check this book out from the library; or better yet, buy it so you can read it again, ten years down the line, when you've forgotten what it was even about."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"For the first time I got to read this absolutely astounding masterpiece, I got thrilled and enchanted by the most beautiful language, descriptions that make you see the set and actions before your eyes, and of course this consuming crazy passion which entwines both main characters. Emily Bronte succeed not only in creating a most touching, and yet horrifying love story, which can only be compared to Phantom by Susan Kay,but also managed to make it a Gothic tale with symbolism and double meaning all around. This is a book to be read many times, and understood deeply. I was 16 when I've read it for the first time, and since then I reread it for countless number of times, and each time I discovered something new. It helped me to grow emotionally. In this story, &quot;physical&quot; true love is lifted above our world, ad turned into something more spiritual. The bond between heathcliff and Cathy was so strong that it conquered death. A greatest love story of all time. A must-read for anyone."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"The other reviews of the book already summarize the plot and lend a personal response. I only wish to bring to mind, a few points about the book which make it worth reading and worth appreciating .Written in the typical Gothic Novel style, the work is full of horror, violence, love, trauma and death. How many authors can intergrate all that into a single plot and have the novel called a &quot;classic&quot;? The fact that Heathcliff cannot be classified is crucial to the novel, he oscillates between the vicitm of abuse by Hindley, and the villain by Nelly, Cathy and Linton. Throughout the novel, the unreliability of the narrative only adds to the dire and dark tone of the novel - making it even more horrific than it already is. In the time Bronte wrote in, eroticism in literature was absent - the boldness of Bronte in writing about a man walking into a married woman's bedroom inannounced is not only shocking, but also a precursor to the modern, romantic drivel that some read. Its a great book, the theme of nature vs.nurture and of wuthered development have been taken up with severity - and as the story unravels, the plot reveals itself in repetition - highlighting the horror of violence. Read this book, knowing the time it was written in, see the harsh descriptions of the violence committed by a loveless man, whose unknown background makes him a mystery.

The 1847 novel was the only one witten by Emily Bronte.The story tells of Heathcliff who is an orphan adopted on a Liverpool journey by Mr. Earnshaw. He brings the ragged lad back home to the wild moors of Yorkshire. Heathcliff is mistreated by the oafish Hindley Earnshaw the son of the family. He spends long dreamy hours wandering the moors with Catherine the Earnshaw daughter. After many complications Heathcliff leaves England for mysterious regions. He returns years later to discover Catherine has married the weak milquetoast Edgar Linton who gives Catherine the security and kind love of a well to do landowner.Catherine dies giving birth to daughter Cathy. Heathcliff weds the infatuated sister Isabella sister of Edgar Linton. In the second half of the novel Catherine's daughter will wed the son of Heathcliff and Isabella. Isabella has fled from the cruel Heathcliff dying at an early age.The novel is structured as a flashback to events told by Nelly Dean a nurse to Catherine who relates them to Mr. Lockwood a shallow English dandy who has rented Thrushcross Grange following a failed romantic affair.The novel switches from past to present dealing with many characters with similar names. Heathcliff is often called satanic and is a figure of Dantian and Satanic power. He is very cruel killing small animals; driving Isabella away and insulting everyone. He mistreats his son and his alcoholic nephew. Heathcliff is as rough as a crag of rock on the wild moors. He longs for a complete soul union with Catherine. He even has her dug up from the grave so he can look at her dead face! Necrophilia, sadism, overt cruelty to the weak are everday occurrences at Wuthering Heights which is ruled by the tyrant Heathcliff and his mean toady servant the repulsive Bible thumping Joseph.Catherine is petulant, violent, selfish and cruel. Neither Heathcliff or Catherine are admirable characters. They apparently love and long for one another. At one point Catherine tells Nelly \\"Heathcliff and I are one soul.\\" Following her death she will haunt Heathcliff as she roams the stark moors in neither heaven or hell.Libraries have been built dealing with the complexity of this novel. It demands several rereads. Let it be said that the novel is always fresh, suprising and modern. Wuthering Heights is not your typical love story. It is harsh, stark and cruel. Read it and ponder this tale of ghostly, obsessive, dreamliike love set against the dark brooding moors of Yorkshire. The characters will leave a permanent imprint on your mind and heart."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I'll never forget a one-on-one extended conversation I once had with the celebrated, brilliant albeit tortured poet, John Berryman (and his bottle of Jack). What remains with me from that broadly inclusive and allusive ramble about all things literary (and more) was his singling out Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as the one novel capable of exerting a hold on the reader that all but defied his analysis and description. I didn't fully grasp his drift at the time, but after at least two additional readings of this perversely powerful, heaven-denying yet time-defying testimony to indestructible passion that is neither quite \\"of\\" nor \\"out of\\" this world, I now number myself among those who, like Berryman, are in the novel's grip.The uniqueness of the story is not the subject matter (as Charlotte implied in her critical assessment of her sister's novel--though I would grant that scenes of puppy hanging and necrophilia are not common Victorian fare). The novel owes its special place to the discourse--the language as employed by Emily Bronte to express the feelings of Catherine and Heathcliff--that moreover insures familiar emotions strike the reader in unfamiliar ways, altering and destabilizing conventional understandings before taking root in consciousness. Bronte's syntax and diction literally make the reader \\"work,\\" but the difficulty is essential to her dual purpose: 1. to enable us to experience first-hand some of the same reeling and disorientation felt by the characters who ride the whirlwind of their fatal but not deadly passion; 2. to convey the supreme difficulty (impossibility, for most of us) and accomplishment of representing in words a passion that is equal parts natural and unnatural.The key to reading this novel for maximum impact and lasting appreciation is to struggle with, but not give up on, the novel's vital meanings, which are in the passages containing some combination of the following: paradox and irony, sudden reversals, antithesis, oxymoronic juxtaposition, natural images functioning as \\"objective correlatives,\\" mind-blowing similes and metaphors pushed to extravagant literary \\"conceits.\\" Above all, the reader needs to be alert to Bronte's transpositions of references and referents, her displacements of \\"signifiers\\" and the \\"signifieds\\" with which they are normally paired.The foregoing might seem to be insufficient incentive to read this remarkable novel were it not for the surprising degree of \\"precision\\" that characterizes Bronte's eros-fueled discourse about love. Just as the \\"monstrous,\\" elemental, and hate-spewing Heathcliff is at the same time an attentive, responsive observer (catching Hindley and later Catherine in mid-flight, a fractional second before either hits the floor) and a careful, even long-range planner, taking pains to stay within the \\"law,\\" Bronte's language attends to and remains true to its own laws, adhering to a meticulous and consistent logic that rewards the reader who has the patience to stay with its lurching, unpredictable course. Once you've decoded a statement such as Heathcliff's that he can \\"never forgive Catherine's murderer\\"--with Catherine herself being the \\"murderer\\" he has in mind--the logic of Bronte's lexicon along with her unfailing responsibility to the reader become more evident, making possible a relationship between reader and text rivaling that of Cathy and Heathcliff.(Concerning this Penguin edition, I could do without its return to the original published format of two volumes along with two chapter 1's, two chapter 2's, etc. The unified, organic structure of the novel is better served by an edition that avoids such a distracting bifurcation of the narrative. There's only one potential benefit that I can see: if you read the first volume only, the William Wyler-directed Hollywood classic starring Olivier and Oberon works much better.)"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"This was a difficult read for me. For several months I would pick up this book become utterly disgusted with the characters and put it back down again. I'm really not sure why I finished it as the more I think about it the more I truly hated it. I wish I had returned it to the library unfinished.This is the story of Heathcliff a gypsy boy taken in by the Earnshaw family and Catherine Earnshaw his only childhood friend. Let's just say that as events unfold and as the characters develop we come to know the evil Heathcliff and selfish Catherine will never be together. Since they truly love each other the only alternative seems to be to make life miserable for themselves and everyone around them. At this point I was really hoping for a rabid pack of wolves to attack everyone and end their misery. Unfortunately this did not happen.On a more positive note this book was very well written and the character development superb."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I don't think there is any other novel out there like this. It's definitely a classic, but it's not pleasant and lovely like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice or mysterious but positive like Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. As other reviers said, it's dark. It's unpleasant. It's full of anger and fighting and cruelty.And yet it is well written. It portrays well what it is meant to portray. I wish I understood it better (reading reviews and plot outlines on this page helped me immensely in this area). I definitely want to read it again sometime. I find it interesting that such a repulsive (but again, fascinating) book is such a well-known classic that almost everyone has at least heard of the title."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"As someone with a B.A. in English Literature, I can appreciate that this book has some fine writing and is a worthy classic. On the other, more personal side, I found it extremely disturbing. It is not a tale of love--in fact, I didn't witness any love between Cathy and Heathcliff. Instead, they engage in a sick, jealous, violent, obsessive relationship which ends in heartbreak and tragedy for all concerned. Heathcliff, though the &quot;hero&quot; of the story, is a dangerous, cruel, selfish, and mentally disturbed man and I was not able to feel anything for him but repulsion. Cathy is a spoiled, selfish brat.Nonetheless, it is interesting and sometimes intriguing to read, so I would recommend it if you like 19th century fiction and don't mind lots of violence and cruelty."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"From what I can gather, it is commonly considered that the primary theme of Wuthering Heights is a type of love that transcends all else. Great passion, transcending mortal life, consuming one's soul. Something noble in and of itself, more powerful than reason. Supposedly, this somehow partially excuses any evil stemming from it. Heathcliff is seen as having a wild, passionate, \\"bad boy\\" attraction.If one reads quickly, without really absorbing it all, some scenes do give Heathcliff this allure. But integrating all that he does, he is too evil. And in the end, nothing but deranged evil. His deranged, so-called love excuses nothing. Nor does the mistreatment he received excuse mistreating innocent bystanders. Though it does show insight that abuse tends to engender hatred of life and abuse of others.In his resentment, Heathcliff destroys all rational values in search of some personal satisfaction which is too mean and limited to ever make him happy. Such a man cannot love himself or anyone else. He may have an obsession for something of his imagination, but not appreciation for real people and the give and take of real relationships. Bad treatment may have led to him becoming a monster, but once a monster, he must be recognized as a monster.At that time Bronte was writing, in the 1840's, mystical notions of other worldly love and passions and existence were fairly common. But they are irrational nonetheless.I reject the popular view of the book's theme, whether Emily Bronte intended that theme or not. I think the story illustrates the theme of people being responsible for their own choices and suffering the unexpected consequences of their actions. In other words, the story does not glorify some superior love, but actually ridicules the delusion of it.The idea that souls of loved ones will be reunited after death is common. However, this is a spiritual thing; so, Heathcliff's desire to have the coffins opened on the side makes no sense in this light. He was simply deranged. How Bronte thought up such a thing is strange. Perhaps the idea is that Heathcliff is not spiritual enough, not properly religious, to imagine the mystic reuniting of souls? So he imagines a more physical reuniting?Bronte, as shown by her poetry, seems enamored with notions of life after death; so, it is difficult to know what she felt about life. There is evidence both that she enjoyed it and that she hated it. I wonder if she didn't simply have different moods? Anyway, she was often intelligent and insightful about the natures of different types of people, and Wuthering Heights is cleverly and inventively presented. The ending, which implies that the new generation will find lasting love and happiness, saves the book. I also liked the way religion was shown to be of no positive use for anything, which I doubt was Bronte's intention, but engenders meaness and abuse."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Yes. I agree. This book is compelling and atmospheric. I love the hints of the supernatural. Heathcliffe's lycanthropic qualities. Almost a werewolf on the moonlit moors. The ghostly hauntings and the attentions to and realisations of character's dreams are all very effective. I also like the dichotomy between the two houses. Wuthering Heights is a veritable Hell and Thrushdown Grange is Heaven. BUT... I have never encountered such an utterly repellant motley crew of characters in my life! Who on Earth could have ANY feelings for these people? Heathcliffe is a mad-dog that needs putting to sleep. Hindley is an abusive, maniacal drunkard. Joseph is an hysterical religious bigot. Catherine is a pain... But, worst of all none of the characters show any inclination to extricate themselves from their mess. Rather, they actively encourage each other's dissolution and disarray. There is no-one in the book strong enough or intelligent enough to check these processes of atrophy and attrition. How pointless, don't you think? And for all the reviewers who defend this book with the charge that real-life is similarly evil... Well, yeah, maybe real life according to Jerry Springer and his idiot dysfunctional redneck guests. I found these characters so repellant and downright sinister I couldn't stop thinking of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady."},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"Its a well woven story. Shows many attributes of human nature, the characters are as imperfect as humans are. Its not one of those stories with a perfect heroine or a horrible adversary, this story is realistic and shows different sides to people, it details their lives with utmost imperfect sincerity that you feel so deeply for these people, the author did a marvelous job with establishing a empathic relationship between the characters and the reader, and its ending isnt a perfect fairy tale ending, but its very filling and satisfying, it might be a accurate portrayal of what life is really like, and the ways people go to endure it"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","review":"I read this many years ago.

However, having now read it once in print and listened to it twice in audio, I will admit that it is growing on me. Wuthering Heights will never be a favorite -- its characters are too universally tormented (demented, even), the emotions are too overwrought and the feel of the book is too claustrophobic to ever suit my tastes. However, I am learning to appreciate the wild elegance of Emily Bronte's work.A note on the particular audio version I listened to, which was produced by Recorded Books: it has been my experience that Recorded Books employs the best narrators in the audio book industry. And while Flo Gibson, who narrates this one, is a highly-regarded narrator, nevertheless she is one of my least favorites. I have listened to her narrate two or three books and in each of them my opinion was the same; when she is narrating in her natural voice it is pleasing enough, but when she is doing character voices she manages to make them all sound like 80-year-old women who have been lifelong smokers. Her voice is particularly ill-suited for young female characters."},{"Title":"Are You Ticklish?

Often in the opening section she leaps magnificently and jarringly from episode to episode within the same paragraph, leaving the breathless reader wondering what are we discussing now, as more often she dismisses too easily other commentators while expressing her own views upon her own authority without providing objective proofs from the novel. Her section by section analysis leaves one only slightly less breathless.Nevertheless, as in all things Joyce, this commentary provides more than substantial food for thought and opens interesting areas for contemplation of this magnificent and eternal work.In the opening episode of Ulysses we find Stephen paraphrasing Mr. Wilde by calling Irish art the cracked looking glass stolen from a slavey. And thus each commentator views the depths of their own soul within the novel, and presents their perspectives as solidly based within the novel, when it is only after all a personal impression, like seeing a woman's hand in a passing small cloud. French's other forte is women's issues.Very much like a whale.And so my perceptions from the novel after repeated readings ofUlysses (Gabler Edition)and hearings of theUlyssesrecording by Donal Donnelly, may differ quite strongly from those so forcefully stated by French, and I may provide chapter and verse to disprove some of her statements, or provide skepticism regarding others' absolutism.Nevertheless, I find her insight and expressions bracing cold water cast upon the nodding, napping complacency of my own solipsistic impressions and provide a parallax most useful in coming to see what is really going on here in the Dublin of June 16, 1904, and what is going on here within each reader's soul who must construct meaning from this myriad great novel, including my own.Thus I recommend this learned if for me slightly flawed commentary to any reader of James Joyce, a lifetime avocation, as one supplement to the already Talmudic body of commentary which has gathered, and which must ever be read, as tea leaves in a cup, as clouds above, as smoke arising from a turf fire.Read this book, and do read The Book, Ulysses, and every single other commentary you can find, of which several may be found quite favorably here upon the amazon."},{"Title":"Creative Grandparenting: How to Love and Nurture a New Generation","review":"What a great book for new or experienced grandparents!

However, the novel is wildly overwritten. There are far too many characters - each is fairly well drawn, but each alone could have been the center of the book. Together it's almost too much. And many times the sentences and paragraphs go on far too long, restating the same thing. Where was his editor? I would be interested in learning about the town today.

Beginning in contemporary times with Jakob Burkhardt and working back to the beginning of the current era with the Bible-and including Marx, Hegel, Vico, and Augustine (among others)-Lowith argues that the immanentization of the historical world, giving meaning to history, in short, the philosophy of history originated with the Judeo-Christian eschatological framework: the salvation man sought at the end of life through faith in God and Christ is placed instead at the End of History, when humanity, as a whole, will reach a sort of &quot;perfection&quot; (an anti-Christian belief in my opinion).Each thinker's approach to the understanding of history is explained, as well as his conception of the End of History. Whether you agree with Prof. Lowtih's main thesis-that the philosophy of history originates in Judeo-Chrisitian eschatology-or not, this work will be enlightening to anyone interested in the philosophy of history, theology, the history of Western philosophy, historicism, or just history in general."},{"Title":"Meaning in history;: The theological implications of the philosophy of history","review":"Lowith's premise is that our view of history is confused because we look at it with 'one eye of faith and the other of reason'.

History as a partial record of human experience is too deep and, at the same time, too shallow to put into relief the humble greatness of a human soul which can give meaning... to what otherwise would be a burden for man. History no more proves or disproves the incomparable value of a single man's righteousness and heroism in the face of powers of the world than it proves or disproves the existence of God... [Nietzsche] was wrong in assuming that the pseudo-religious makeup of nature and history is of any real consequence to a genuine Christian faith in God, as revealed in Christ and hidden in nature and history.\\" (Pg. v)He considers the ideas of philospphers such as Augustine; Joachim; Bousset; Vico; Voltaire; Condorcet; Comte; Hegel; Marx; Burckhardt, etc.He concludes, \\"The attempt at elucidation of the dependence of the philosophy of history on the eschatological history of fulfillment and salvation does not solve the problem of our historical thinking. It rather poses a new and more radical problem, for it raises the question of whether the 'last things' are really the first things and whether the future is really the proper horizon of a truly human existence.\\" (Pg. 204)He adds, \\"The modern mind... eliminates from its progressive outlook the Christian implication of creation and consummation, while it assimilates from the ancient world view the idea of an endless and continuous movement, discarding its circular structure. The modern mind has not made up its mind whether it should be Christian or pagan. It sees with one eye of faith and one of reason.

Also, one might consider that further research has uncovered the Zoroastrian roots to the sources Lowith finds in the Judaic tradition, cf. Norman Cohn's Cosmos, Chaos, and the World to come, along with Bruce Mazlish's The Riddle of History, and the works of Frank Manual.In a Darwinian age, the subject of the philosophy of history has fallen on hard times, but as the theories of Darwin slowly but surely are exposed for what they are, this prodigious alternate legacy of historical understanding will prove--thar she blows, and there the Lowith's will be ready for anyone wishing to pull a fast one here also, a la Darwin."},{"Title":"Meaning in history;: The theological implications of the philosophy of history","review":"This book presents a broad view of thought on philosophy of history. While this book only presents a bit on each thinker, it is a good introduction to the subject area so you know where everyone fits in."},{"Title":"Meaning in history;: The theological implications of the philosophy of history","review":"What can I say? The book was well thought out, very well written and lacked truth at the same time. I will have to say that the book is full of a man's desire to corrupt oneself and overlook the conspiracy set up by the British Empire. But, despite this poor review, I encourage all to read WITH AN OPEN MIND, and learn from a true master of deception."},{"Title":"Tracking ghost railroads in Colorado: A five-part guide to abandoned and scenic lines","review":"I have both the 8th & 10th printings, would like to find if there is any more since then. If you want to find the location of an old RR bed from where a certain hiway is or a certain town/city in Colorado, THIS is the book!!! I have been \\"chasing road beds\\" for many years with this book and could not have done as much nor had as much fun and found as many RR treasure without this book.

Old railroad lines and their routes are shown on the maps, and described briefly in the text (though references for further reading are provided). Some history and abandonment dates are provided, in both the maps and desecriptions. Historical B&W photos accompany many of the sections.

Amazon is the only place I could find the book!"},{"Title":"Crimson Tears (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"Those who are simply looking for an action adventure set in Games Workshop's 40K universe - or those who enjoyed the first two Soul Drinkers novels - will like this book as well. All the elements of 40K, from elite Space Marines to the mass troops and armor of the Imperial Guard, are there. All the characters from the first two novels - Sarpedon and the all the rest of the Soul Drinkers - are there.Unfortunately, the plot devices and many of the supporting cast are clumsy and/or forced so M. Counter can make his points. The Crimson Fists are mindless automatons, complete slaves to tradition and the Codex, single-mindedly pursuing the Soul Drinkers to the exclusion of all else ... until it's convenient to the plot for them not to do so. They serve as the \\"enslaved\\" counterpoint to the \\"freedom\\" that the Soul Drinkers have achieved. The plot device used to get the Soul Drinkers into the story at the outset is conveniently ignored when it's time for them to leave.In short, entertaining to fans who don't look too closely at the writer's craft."},{"Title":"Crimson Tears (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"I have read the other books in this series and they were not bad. I like 40K literature I am hoping that one day it will do what D&D literature did and that is produce a great Chracter and writer like RA Salvatore. I hold no illusions that thise series was on the way to do that but the Soul Drinkers have been well developed and entertaining especially the first novel were their obession with an artifact leads to their downfall and their ultimate freedom. I thought that was a well developed theme that's why this novel is a disappointment. Its feels anti climatic at the end and much as the previous review there are typical plot turns and the inclusion of the Crimson Fists is really pointless. I am hoping the next novel chapter wars redeems the series but I have to say this novel really drops it back into the pack. A novel in a series should serve to advance the overall story line and leave you with a sense of wow because some questions were answered and new ones posed. After I was done reading it was more like uhh."},{"Title":"Crimson Tears (Warhammer 40,000 Novels)","review":"This book follows the Soul Drinkers chapter of space marines. This book has everything you'd want in an sci-fi action book, with a jaw droppingly interesting story. The scale of events that unfold in this book will make any warhammer 40k fan giddy with excitement.What would you do if you were betrayed by the very group of men that were supposed to represent salvation for your chapter(group of warriors)? And what would you do if one of your own fell lower than anyone ever thought possible and became one of your worst enemies? The Soul Drinkers undergoe all of these trials, but if they truly survive all of these events is another question entirely. This just scratches the surface, and I don't want to give it away.To all the newbies to the Warhammer 40k universe, I'd suggest the Soul Drinker's Omnibus instead of getting this book right off the bat. The Space Wolf omnibus was my first read and I became instantly addicted to the fast paced action, ideological zealotry, and deep political intrigue that is the 40k universe."},{"Title":"Notebooks 1935-1942 (Modern Library)","review":"Most of the kernels in Camus's notebooks could be the seeds for short stories or even novels.

Of course that was Larry McMurtry and I have come to realize that he was right about himself and many other authors. \\"Notebooks 1935-1942\\" is evidence that it is true even about Albert Camus. Enthralled by \\"The Stranger\\" and \\"The Plague\\", I set out to read everything by this author. I blamed myself for not enjoying his complicated essays. I also blame myself for thinking that this collection of random thoughts, scenarios, and quotes would be worth the time it took to read it. There are occassional observations of note but they are lost in the lack of continuity of thought. The art of literature lies not in having great ideas. The art of literature lies in creating stories and scenarios that enable the reader to discover the truths the author would like discovered.For students of Camus there could be some benefits in reading this \\"book\\". The first part of the notebook generally focuses on material used in \\"A Happy Death\\" while the very latter part of the notebook generally focuses on material used in \\"The Plague\\".So many Books, so little time.

I believe the title to be a bit misleading because it does not depict that it is a Christian book based on citations from the Word of God, however, it is very much so a gift from God. This woman is definitely an anointed writer.This book has been such a blessing for me. It is a book full of prayers and information on God's view of what love looks like, His intention for your life and guidlelines on conducting ourselves as virtuous women. All of this is information is in the Word and it is plainly referenced in this book. A couple of beautiful, sample prayers are below:Heavenly Father, thank you for the precious gift of Your love. Thank you for showing me what love looks like through the gift of Your Son. I ask that you impart to me the capacity to love as You love. Grant me the gift of discernment to see the hidden motives of the men who enter my life. Keep before me a picture of what love looks like, that I may not be deceived by the crumbs the enemy offers. Help me to wait on You to bring the one who will mainifest Your love to me in human form. Until then keep my heart in the palm of Your hand for safekeeping, in Jesus' name. Amen.Heavenly Father, this day I resubmit my life to You. I ask that You dismantle every previous dream and goal that I may have clung to that is not of You, and replace them with Your vision for my life. I ask that You reveal Your ordained purpose for my life and give me the courage to follow it through. I ask that You would plant Your desire for my life so firmly in my spirit that it burns like a fire that consumes me with a zeal to do Your bidding. Make provision for Your commission for my life. Fill my life with Yourself, fill every empty space in me with a sense of divine purpose and love for You. Let me be found being busy about my Father's business with joy emanating from my soul as I bask in the knowledge that I am in the center of Your will, in Jesus' name. Amen.This book mainly serves as a resource for single women, however, it does contain a lot of information that is useful to married women. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who may be &quot;going through&quot; or who may want to be encouraged in their healing process, to ministers, to anyone who may may ever find themselves in a position to minister to a woman who reveres Christian principles or just an educational tool to validate how God's word is all-encompassing of knowledge about any of life's situations."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"First off, I just want to praise the Lord for ordering the steps of this sister to write this timely book.It has been a loooong time coming,because He sees that His daughters are simply &quot;banging there pretty little heads against the same wall&quot;.This book contains the real deal on how the Heavenly Father God wants us as His women to behave, walk and be treated by earthly men.There are times that I am reading this book and I just putit down because I need time to obtain the powerful thruth that is on these pages.

After the program I said I will buy her books, I bought this book in January 2002,after the holidays being depress from my wedding date that was schedule for in Decemeber 2001,but was cancel.Reading this book inspired me to regain self control within myself and to understand that God has his plan map out for me. My favorite bible chapter that she mention in her book is Pslams;139 ,where he describe me as being beautiful and wonderfully made prefectly from my mother's. womb. With that revelation of that chapter I was able to forgive myself and promise that I would not allow anyone to take advantage of me. I've learnt the standard that God wants us to have as a woman.

This book is a beacon of light for any single woman who is in the dark about dating and the relationship process. Michelle McKinney Hammond goes right to the source (God) and paints a bright and clear picture of God's design for the relationship. This book just oozes with wisdom and love and she delivers a powerful message of hope and encouragement in such a gentle, loving and sisterly way. I loved this book because it has changed my outlook on men, dating, and relationships and it has led me to the most important and fulfilling relationship that I could possibly have and that is my relationship with God. What I learned from reading this book is that...1. God is a jealous God and that He loves me and wants to be in a relationship with me (rather than the knuckleheads I've been dating) 2. Love never fails (God's love is a love that you can trust). 3. A donkey with always want a thoroughbred (a man of lesser quality will always desire a woman of quality but will not possess the ability to meet her needs, so why waste your time entertaining the dumb stuff...life is too short...have courage and never be afraid to stand on your convictions) 4. I am a virtuous woman (for my value is worth far more than rubies and I deserve to be approached and treated as such) 5. I am someone's missing rib (God has someone special looking for me with a missing rib, all I have to do is to continue to beautiful even long after he finds me.) 6. Trust God that he will give you the desires of your heart and in the meantime...live life like you already have the love of your life....because you do. Great book! It has changed my attitude about men, dating and love through the renewing of my mind. I am a new creature, my mistake of past are past away and behold all things which include my joys and my desires for my life and future are brand spankin' new!

It's no good trying to make it happen yourself... that's YOUR timing, not God's timing.

This book is an excellent follow-up to &quot;What To Do Until Love Finds You...&quot;Ms. Hammond speaks plainly, but intelligently. Offering encouragement, sound advice, and common sense, Ms. Hammond guides her reader into the logic that a woman has a role which is very important to fill. She also drives home the importance of being a Principles woman, and the value in waiting on the Lord instead of pushing to get that man!The study guide in the back of the book out-does the one in &quot;What To Do Until Love Finds You...&quot; Ms. Hammond has expanded it, and through the study guide encourages the reader to fully evaluate themselves and find out the areas that need improvement.

Although I have to admit that in the past, I've acted against my belief in who I know I am in God. This book has helped to re-open my eyes to God's plan for us as women and has truly convicted me. I was silently saying &quot;Amen&quot; at every paragraph. Once, I even broke down and started to praise God as I sat on my bed, clenching this wonderful book. Truly moved, I've decided to wait on God until he sends the right person in my life, because I believe that I will know when that special man walks into my life.

Her &quot;principles,&quot; which basically explain the biblical and common sense that we lost sight of in &quot;modern&quot; times, do nothing less than honor the woman and seek to put her in her rightful place: the apple of the man's eye, the queen on her throne next to the king. I would heartily recommend any woman who's healing her heart and seeking a loving, christian-based relationship to buy this book, follow her advice and watch the brothers come RUNNING!! I cannot wait to get ahold of her next one and learn even more.

One major point of interest for me was that she consistently used scripture to back-up each given Principle.I purchased this book unwittingly, as I'd never heard of theauthor . . . the title sounded interesting so I ordered it and hoped for the best. The book said &quot;amen&quot; to truths God has whispered to me over the years for instance, &quot;The responsibility of the man is to love the woman; our response is submission&quot; (Ephesians 5:22-33). This is so important because so many Christian women (myself included), have jumped headlong into relationships at the slightest bit of expressed interest from men to our own destruction. Men will pursue what they want; after all, that's their job . . . &quot;He who finds a wife . . .&quot;Ms. McKinney Hammond provides practical insight and suggestions along with a detailed Study that corresponds to each chapter of the book which I found particularly helpful. This book is an easy read . . . she speaks strictly sister-to-sister; as I read, I began to feel as if we were engaged in a conversation.This book is on my Christmas Gift List for all my single (and one of my married) friends.Single Christian Woman, you owe it to yourself to read this book!

What makes her attract every man, woman, child and animal within ten miles? Michelle McKinney Hammond strikes again. To me, this book was what showed me how to plant positive seeds in my character. It's like going to a beauty parlor for the Spirit. There is a study guide in the back. I highly recommend that you keep a journal. The questions really make you evaluate who you are. It also showed me harmful cycles of behavior and reviled hidden fears that I had. The principles are great. Michelle stayed true to her &quot;in your face&quot; manor. It's so nice to have someone be so straightforward in her message. This book is a great gift to any woman who wants to be known for who she was made to be and not everything she has ever done."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I have read many(!) books on godly relationships and this is by far one in the top five, if not top three. The book is divided into 12 chapters, and each chapter corresponds to a different principle that a godly woman, whether married or singleton can learn and benefit from. One of the main themes of this book is that you are to act what you are, a woman of purpose who knows that her fulfillment can only come from her heavenly Daddy and not to become sidetracked because we as godly women are to have high standards for the men in our lives. I also VERY highly recommend A Jewel in His Crown by Priscilla Evans Shirer for more great stuff on a woman's identity in Christ and When God Writes Your Love Story by Eric and Leslie Ludy for more on godly relationships"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"A very good friend told me to read this book. At first I couldn't get past the title &quot;Secrets of an Irresistible Woman&quot;. I said sure, okay what secrets could there be and why should I care? It's not like I need a man or need help getting one. But I read it anyway. Girl! I read the whole book in 4 hours! It was that interesting.This book is by far the best self-help, self-love book I ever read. It has given me a totally new perspective on love, romance, men and self respect.I recommend all women regardless of age, religious or non-relious backgrounds read this book. It's easy to read and understand and the author tells it like it is. She's funny, honest and gives you the truth. It's up to the reader to decide if she can deal with that or keep living with herself.This book is for any woman who has been poorly loved, cheated on, mistreated, beaten, disrespected and rejected. All of us have been this woman at some point in our lives.It's truly worthy of a second read! I plan to purchase this one for my girlfriends and after you read it ... hopefully you too will pass it on."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"This book helped me so much that I can't even begin to put it in the right words....but I'm going to try. First, it's bible based. But, don't get scared off by that. You do NOT have to BE a Christian to get a LOT out of this book. It will uplift you SO much by showing you just how important you are, what you deserve as a woman, things you should and should not accept from men and how you should and should not be treated.....what YOU should accept. This is a wonderful book for EVERY woman....married, single, dating, not dating.....EVERY woman. I got it from the library, but then bought it here because I refer back to it OFTEN and have SO many Post-It notes marking pages and LOTS of highlights in this book. GREAT book for ALL women."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"After reading this book, I discovered how to activate the principals that would transform me into a noticeable woman of God. As I read the lines, I cried relating to my own situations; I chuckled when words weren't sugar coated and I raised an eyebrow while I nodded my head knowing that she was speaking such truth!This book gave me so much insight on how to unleash burried potential and prepare myself for nothing but God's best!I found myself relating in so many ways; this is the very first book I have ever read that has made me slap my own self upside the head! I came across parts where I would jump up from my bed and stomp on the devil and I found that I was reading it under my desk at work! Michelle McKinney Hammond has sowed a seed into my life - a seed that I now water daily. I was extremely blessed...and transformed! I told my sister about it and she told her friends about it and now Michelle is in all our homes!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE FOR SINGLE WOMEN EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I absolutely love this book. The author is funny and direct in her information. She is right-on, from a Christian perspective, but not at all religious. I have bought many copies of this book and given it to single women whose paths cross mine as a sort of handbook on relationships.At the time I read the book, I beleived that I had met THE man that God had for me. By the time I finished the book, I could agree with every statement made in the book and KNEW that I had met the one whom I was to spend the rest of my life with.My advice? Read it, and heed it! You'll end up totally blessed!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"A must have for single women. This book is truly a blessing. It made me look back &amp; see what &quot;went wrong&quot; in my relationships. It has also helped me talk to my 16 year old daughter about not trying to be someone she's not just to get or keep a guy. The principles in this book make sense. I wish I would have read it years ago. If you are a single woman, or have daughters I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"Michelle McKinney-Hammond understands the day-to-day trials of single women. She uses scripture to emphasize Gods love for us and what we as single women should expect of ourselves. Every Christian woman should read this book. I love the way she speaks to you and not at you. Its like talking to a girlfriend/Sunday school teacher."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I believe Michelle Hammond is correct. Women don't need to be the ones to do all the work and keep the relationship going. She taught me that I am to love and care for myself and not chase the man, but that God has a special man for us all. Please give this book a chance it will enlighten you."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"This book was recommended by a sister in christ, she suggested I read it. Well she was on the mark, the book rearranged my thoughts of men, spirituality,and myself. Secrets of an Irresitable Woman, unlocked the doors damaged by relationships. Must read for singles and recently married. Thank You Michelle!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I received this book a few days later than the date that was set for the book to arrive and boy was I glad to finally receive it.I've just started reading and already I like this book, but then I've loved all the books written by Michelle Mckinnley Hammond, so it comes as no surprise that I would love this one.She writes with a clarity that is both honest and sraight to the point simple. She also writes with humour and that's one of the things I like about her.You walk away from this book knowing the secrets of being an irresistable woman, the woman God designed you to be.The only problem I had was that when I received the product, the book had it's cover slashed as if by some sharp cutting object and I had to tape the cover and a couple of the other pages inside the book together to hold them together.I know that Amazon has a 30 day warranty if your not happy with product you could send it back, but I didn't really want to send back the book as I had waited a really long time to receive it, but I'd like to warn other potential shoppers that sometimes the product might come to you with a slashed cover."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"Michelle McKinney Hammond, as always, provides good insight and wise counsel for women from a godly perspective. Easy to read and much to take away."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Everything my mom told me is true. And although I am not boy-crazy, what she says really makes sense because that's the way it's been and will always be.My experience proves that she's right because he proposed but I knew he wasn't Mr. Right. Now I am just waiting for Mr. RIGHT while I'm taking care of myself...doing me!!!!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"This book is written from a Christian perspective. It is worth the money for the wonderful prayers at the end of each chapter alone. However, the book is so much more. It helped me heal after a long-term dating relationship ended. I could see how excluding God from my dating decisions only brought me grief in the end. I also saw how attractive confidence in myself as a wonderful creation of God can be. I have moved on with my life and thanks in part to this book, I have learned lessons from this experience and am happier because of it!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"A friend recommended this book to me last year and it changed my view of dating/marriage. Michelle has written with humor, honesty and it's all based on the Bible. My friend and I have recommended or given away several copies of this book to various women we have met over the past year and many of them have been changed, as well. This book encourages women to have a life, a God centered life, for their ultimate fullfilment. Michelle has a God given gift that is evident in all her writings."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I strongly recommend this book &quot;Secrets of an Irresistible Woman&quot; by Michelle McKinney Hammond. I believe the title to be a bit misleading because it does depict that it is a Christian book based on citations from the Word of God, however, it is very much so a gift from God. This woman is definitely an anointed writer.This book has been such a blessing for me. It is a book full of prayers and information on God's view of what love looks like, His intention for your life and guidlelines on conducting ourselves as virtuous women. All of this is information is in the Word and it is plainly referenced in this book. A couple of beautiful, sample prayers are below:Heavenly Father, thank you for the precious gift of Your love. Thank you for showing me what love looks like through the gift of Your Son. I ask that you impart to me the capacity to love as You love. Grant me the gift of discernment to see the hidden motives of the men who enter my life. Keep before me a picture of what love looks like, that I may not be decieved by the crumbs the enemy offers. Help me to wait on You to bring the one who will mainifest Your love to me in human form. Until then keep my heart in the palm of Your hand for safekeeping, in Jesus' name. Amen.Heavenly Father, this day I resubmit my life to You. I ask that You dismantle every previous dream and goal that I may have clung to that is not of You, and replace them with Your vision for my life. I ask that You reveal Your ordained purpose for my life and give me the courage to follow it through. I ask that You would plant Your desire for my life so firmly in my spirit that it burns like a fire that consumes me with a zeal to do Your bidding. Make provision for Your commission for my life. Fill my life with Yourself, fill every empty space in me with a sense of divine purpose and love for You. Let me be found being busy about my Father's business with joy emanating from my soul as I bask in the knowledge that I am in the center of Your will, in Jesus' name. Amen.This book mainly serves as a resource for single women, however, it does contain a lot of information that is useful to married women. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who may be &quot;going through&quot; or who may want to be encouraged in their healing process, to ministers, to anyone who may may ever find themselves in a position to minister to a woman who reveres Christian principles or just an educational tool to validate how God's word is all-encompassing of knowledge about any of life's situations."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I read this very inspirational book in 2001. I am so grateful for this book and author to this day. We all need a challenge in order to grow. This book is a great alternative to the \\"rules\\" book. The secrets are biblically based.

This book and others written by Michelle McKinney Hammond are my most used and treasured books. I am single and Christian. Michelle's books are the ones I recommend to all my female friends, single or married. I have let others borrow the books, but not for too long because I love to refer to them occassionally.There are jewels between every page and in every chapter of this book. This book frames for women guiding principles for all female/male and other relationships. I learned perspectives about different topics from this book that I have been able to embrace and continue to look at life differently. I am happier and content with my singlehoodness. This book made it easier for me to accept responses and interests from men. I learned solid Christian principles applied to the courtship processes like I've never heard them before.

It has lived up to and has gone past all my expectations, it's an awesome book.This book is great for single women who have had relationships and want to learn from them. It teaches you practically how to not carry baggage from past relationships, and how to shine like new for the next prince charming.It's also excellent for people who haven't dated yet. I personally haven't and this book has been a major blessing to me. It's got me back on track (keeping my heart with all diligence and keeping to my principles), being satisfied where I am now.This book doesn't tell you to \\"Kiss dating goodbye,\\" but gives you practical and very easy to follow guidelines that could be adopted into any of your relationships (not just with a special someone of the opposite sex).It also got me thinking about preparing for marriage, which at 19 is a pretty scary concept! It showed me that I need to get my house (both physical and Spiritual) in order if I am ever going to think about stepping up and partnering with someone that brings glory to God.I'm not a reader so if a book is not humourous, easy to read and practical, forget it. I can count how many books I've read cover to cover on one hand. But I can honestly say I couldn't put this book down, I read it in two days.This book is just too full of Godly wisdom and practical advice to let it pass by you.Enjoy :) OOXX"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I have a very large library.

This is my manual of operation next to the holy bible. This is truely an eye opener and bring things in perspective when it comes to relationships with men. I have been applying these biblical principles Michelle speaks of and I must say, it works!!! I notice I'm attracting more real men and the so-called players, and fishermen are falling by the way side, as I use to keep them around, allowing them to just string me alone. I'm no longer wasting my time with them. I am having more fun and feeling better about myself as well. I got a good feeling about this. Wow!!! the real men are sticking around, being consistent with keeping dates, being a gentleman, and don't mind the celebacy. Michelle talks about the very things we as ladies do and should not be doing. So ladies if you want to empower yourself with the truth, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I found this book in my archives after cleaning house and attempting to clean my soul. I re-read the book at a time when I felt I needed it the most. The author does a good job of breaking down the complications of dating, how we sometimes go wrong, and what to do to keep your value, love yourself and allow others to love you too. But you must know the rules first!I recommend this book to every woman who has found herself dating, disappointed and looking up sperm banks! Some of us never learned the basics and this is a good place to start. And despite all the reference to bible, I still think most of us can relate, no matter what your spiritual status is. There's something in this book for all of us!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I can't say enough great things about this book, and the author! I first read this in a small study group with some other single girlfriends. There are questions in the back, which I think are great for on your own or in a group. She really challenges you to re-think the \\"rules\\" of dating. I applied the principles in my life and years later I'm happily married with 2 beautiful children - and wouldn't have wanted to do it any other way. Had I continued down the same destructive dating path I always had (ignoring the principles), I don't think I'd be where I am today.

I have since bought several more and also have purchased some for my single friends (who incidently, loved her books as well).As woman, God gave us a certain mystery. This mystery was not to be used in negative ways to entice men but to make you more precious in your husband (to-be's) eyes. Hammond really has a wonderful way of looking at singleness and offers creative ways to spend your time while you are living those years. She has a light very humored approach to this sensitive subject. She is wonderful. I recommend this book to all singles and even to some married ladies (they said they have also learned a lot about marriage relationships)."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I began reading this book and immediately I could see the truth in it. The author writes based on experience which is all too important when trying to persuade a group.The fact that she qualifies her statements with Bible quotations provides an excellent and credible source for readers to refer to for further study on this topic. I believe single women of all ages (teens to married women) should read this book. This should be a reference tool used in High School for young girls!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"This book reminded me of how important I am to God. It made me realize that I should appreciate myself. With all this in mind, women who read this book will realize that they have been settling for less than what God wants for them in their love lives. They will now look at the different women in the bible as their source of role models. These are things that we should do in our everyday lives, and Michelle finally brings all these issues to light in this book that is wonderfully written with wonderful chapter titles. Her sense of humor is amazing and you will find yorself in so many pages in this book.

Ms. McKinney-Hammond keeps it real and on the level; easily applicable and personal.

All my life, I have been called a Prude, geek, lonely-girl, and goodie-two-shoes, just because I \\"did the right thing\\", and I wanted a man to love me for who I was, and not want I could do for him sexully, or how I threw myself on him. And this book, showed that through the Bible, the Lord wants us to just that . . .and more.No longer do I feel depressed, or have this urge to \\"have sex\\" in order to keep a man. A true, Christian man WILL WAIT!"},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"Hammond's message to women can be summed up by the following quotes from her book:You were created to be a help who would meet a specific man's specific needs. [...] You were made, fashioned, and designed to be a 'help-meet' to your man. Man was not made for you, you were made for a man. [...] Man needed help, and women got drafted for the job. (135)At any rate, God ordained marriage. The clue as to why He did this is found when we look at why He created man and woman in the first place. God created man to multiply and have dominion over all that He had created on the earth. And He created woman to assist man in his assignment. (160)Deep within a man's psyche he's still in search of a virgin to marry. He might play around with loose woman, but when it comes to marrying her he wants a woman he can trust. [...] When you tell him about all your past relationships, he stores that information and it colors his view of you. After all, you are a Principles Woman, you're not supposed to do that. You were supposed to be sitting somewhere, praying and waiting for him. (69)Once married, your primary identity must be that of being your husband's wife and the mother of your children. (140)Count yourself as a valuable commodity. (167)The only way to always be treated by your husband as a valuable commodity is to make sure that he understands from the beginning that you are accessible but costly. (129)~~~~~~Unless she is deliberately invested in promoting patriarchal oppression towards women--or simply blinded--I am not sure how Hammon can bring herself to write such a book. She is obviously not aware of how male-identified she is. Her message is that women must be chaste and virginal, get married, align their opinions and coordinate their actions in the best interest of their husbands, and serve them. This book is embarrassing not only because it instructs women to behave and sacrifice themselves for men, but because it was written by a woman. Female to female oppression is hideous and shameful. But, of course, she is oppressing women in the name of God.Unless you are curious and sure that you are not prone to depression, or are researching books for a class assignment on how female oppression is prolonged, do not read this book. Not only are many biblical passages incorrectly set up as examples--Hammon contradicts herself multiple times. For example, early on in the book, she says that women should not feel that their life is incomplete because they lack a man. Then she goes on to say how God did not create women to function away from men, and how their purpose in life is to help men. Contradictory and oppressive."},{"Title":"Secrets of an Irresistible Woman: Smart Rules for Capturing His Heart","review":"I really enjoy this book. I've read over and over again, and still kept my attention and interesting.

Once I read this book and read the scriptures referenced, I was shocked. I had no idea of what the true purpose of marriage was. I had to step back and ask myself some questions. Most women get excited when we think about marriage, and it is wonderful to dream of the type of husband we want and how good he will be to us, but ladies I ask you this, are you ready to be a WIFE! You will be suprised to find out how important your role as a wife is in your husbands life, and how much we are a reflection of everything good in our husbands life.

I was 28 years old, divorced at 24, had a child from that marriage and all of my relationships ended up being totally MESSED-UP. I just couldn't seem to find any nice guys that had their lives together. Well, after reading this book, Michelle REALLY opened my eyes to how I was actually sabotaging MYSELF! --In short, if YOU don't have your head and life together, how in the world are you going to be able to find a guy who does --and keep him?? Michelle just \\"tells it like it is\\" and I adore that about her. It was like, \\"Wow. A straight shooter. Finally!\\" --Someone who was honest with me. I had actually read this book then was blessed to happen across her at a Women of Faith conference. --This lady TOTALLY ROCKS!

Ballard became a legend himself after the discovery of the most famous ship to ever hit the waves."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"In September 1985, after a long, greuling expedition, Dr. Robert Ballard discovered the wreck of the legendary ocean liner R.M.S Titanic. He returned a year later and showed the ship in even greater detail. This book is not just about the Titanic and the search for the wreck but is also about how Robert Ballard build his career at Woods Hole before he started searching for Titanic. It's just a shame that recent expeditions to the wreck haven't treated it like Ballard thought they would."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"Ballard's beautifully-written story of the Titanic and his discovery of its resting place remains the best book available on the Titanic. He summarizes the events leading up to the sinking and its impact on the Edwardian public is, like the classic a Night to Remember, concise and enlightening. The story of his search for, and ultimate discovery of, the wreck itself is riveting. One can hardly blame Ballard for his hopeful (and, ultimately, incorrect) belief that subsequent explorers would treat the wreck site with the same awe and reverence he experienced."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"hi, i'm 17 and i've read a book about Titanic but i forgot who the author is... but as far as i can remember, i'm sure the author is Mr.Robert D.

When i saw the movie Titanic, i cried.. but when i read the book and get to know the truth, i shivered and felt pity.

He takes you from Woodshole to the North Atlantic Ocean to search for the Titanic. Then he narrates the discovery of the great ship while he takes you 2 miles below the surface to explore the famous ill-fated liner."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"I am involved in the TITANIC project extensively, and have used Dr. Ballard's book for reference on many occasions. What I have discovered is that it is an admirable effort, based on the information available at the time. Of course, all of his first-hand information is accurate. The info on the current state of the wreck, his photomosaics, and the artwork included inside is not entirely accurate. Based on what Dr. Ballard's team knew at the time of publication, it cannot be faulted. However, much has been learned since then. Readers should be careful not to accept only one source for info on this, or any subject. A good source is the series of shows that the Discovery Channel is doing on this subject. They have teamed with some of the best people in this field for extensive research on the wreck."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"This is one of my most cherished Titanic books. Written by the excellent duo of Dr. Robert D. Ballard and Rick Archbold, it tells the story of not only the discovery and exploration of the Titanic, but has a chapter each about that fatal night in 1912 when she sank and about Jack Grimm's three fruitless searches for the Titanic as well. It also has commentary on some Titanic controversies and mysteries like the Californian and the Titanic. To cap it all, it has a marvelous introduction by the acclaimed historian Walter Lord, author of the Titanic books A Night To Remember and The Night Lives On. I have a copy of both the hardbound version and the recent paperback re-issue of The Discovery of the Titanic. I'd strongly reccomend picking up the re-issue as it has some new material in it that is quite interesting. To sum it up in a nutshell, this is a very excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"I bought this book soon after the hype brought on by the film. I have always been a history fan. The stories surrounding the fate of the Titanic have always intrigued me.I knew of Ballard from previous expeditions that he had done. I have seen his work on The Discovery Channel and The Learning Channel.This book is well thought out. From the search in the early days to the actual discovery and exploration. It's amazing how Ballard was able to stick with it over the years and the difficult times.The book is written more as a story than as a text book. Plenty of history. The underwater photos are magnificent. I read the book and just wonder at all the problems that they had to overcome. The setbacks. The failures. It's all here in an easy to read and follow book.If you are at all interested in the Titanic and it's discovery, this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"WARNING!! My paperback edition (Warner Books, October 1995) fell apart. I received it from amazon, and the photo pages were falling out even before I started reading. I do not know why. As I write this, none of the other 28 reviewers note this trouble; so maybe I got a fluke. You could buy an old, used hardcover edition to be sure that your book does not fall apart, but my paperback's Epilog has an update of new information through 1995. If you buy the paperback and it falls apart, try piecing it together with clear, glossy packaging tape. That worked well for me.Looking for a good account of the Titanic incident? Do NOT get this book. Get Walter Lord's \\"A Night to Remember\\" together with his \\"The Night Lives On.\\" Or get the newer book, \\"Titanic,\\" by W.B. Bartlett. A good, thorough account is gotten either way.Looking for a brief account of the Titanic incident that comes with an in-depth account of the discovery of the wreck? Look no further. THE book to get is the one I am reviewing right here. Reading Robert Ballard's book about the discovery of the Titanic is like reading Christopher Columbus's book about the discovery of America (supposing he wrote one). Ballard organized the effort to find the wreck. He also participated in the development of equipment to search for it and to explore it. With this book you get historical and scientific information from the primary source.Videos of the Titanic wreck have been seen for years. They are pretty much like the beginning sequence in James Cameron's movie. To me, they seem mostly barren and boring. But when Ballard made the two series of dives described in this book, in 1985 and 1986--before tomb raiders cleared away many artifacts--the site had much life. Here's a passage from the book:\\"Thousands upon thousands of artifacts littered the rolling fields of sediment, many of them perfectly preserved. The entrails of the Titanic spilled across the ocean floor in seemingly endless quantity.\\"I like to immerse myself into my reading, to vicariously BE who I am reading about. This book allows that. At the historical moment when Ballard and his team discovered the Titanic, I also discovered it. I felt their elation. Then I understood that Ballard's struggle with administrators at Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institution was justified. He had been ordered to terminate his quest for the Titanic. It was unscientific. Now, as the Titanic was discovered, I felt the full meaning of discovery. I understood that even if it was a discovery of a man-made object, it was still discovery. It WAS science!The prose is easy to read and properly written. Well, I counted only three instances of missed proofreading. It has moments of suspense, as when I was on the edge of my seat hoping that a competitor of Ballard would not discover the Titanic first. Later I was on the edge of my seat again, hoping that Ballard and his crew would find the tiny Titanic in the immensity of the Atlantic before they depleted their allotted time and funds.Glossy black-and-white photos, glossy colored photos, glossy colored paintings--the book gives a good selection of these. To accompany the narration, you also get a good number of printed photos. Those glossy paintings, done by Ken Marschall, are incredible. They are so well done, you might mistake them for photos.Since Ballard is writing about his own events, this book is a primary source and does not require footnotes and bibliography. Except when he gives his account of the Titanic incident. Though I have read enough on that matter to trust his accuracy, maybe you have not. But as I noted above, if you are looking for that information, this is the wrong book. Ballard does cite his sources for all photos and illustrations.Even in our age of digital electronics, good reading deserves our time. If you are looking for something to break your children away from their game consoles, try \\"The Discovery of the Titanic.\\""},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Titanic","review":"this copy of Ballard's discovery of the Titanic is a lot smaller than i was anticipating, which makes it harder to read.

But also about the joy of finally finding the wreck and his emotions during all of this. All this is told from a integer point of view, also crediting the other people for their part in the discovery. The book includes many photographs and two nice full-color foldouts of the wreck.

But the basic story is the same.This is a charming narrative of a cruise in a well-built little sailboat, in waters of the Baltic countries, to places the author clearly knows and loves.Arthur Ransome later wrote a series of children's books focused on sailing. He would certainly have agreed with Kenneth Grahame's \\"Ratty\\" that \\"\\"There is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.\\" One might qualify that, noting that in Ransome's books, the sailing is rather more directed and purposeful - but he always communicates the sheer joy of being on the water in a craft that responds to the elements, at your direction (He was not a fan of engines of any kind - a sometimes necessary evil. Sailing was the thing.)\\"Racundra's First Cruise\\" was published in 1923. He had commissioned the building of Racundra, a thirty-foot ketch built for seaworthiness and comfort inside. With the \\"Ancient Mariner\\" - an old veteran of the days of sail in clipper ships - and \\"Cook\\" - probably the companion who was to become his second wife, but only identified by her unending task - he takes us through many sometimes tricky passages along the Baltic coast, visiting old cobblestoned towns and remote peasant villages.It is delightful to sink back into a time when the sea was still full of trading vessels under sail, though of course large and small steamers also abounded. Mentions of \\"during the war\\" refer of course to the Great War. Relics of older conflicts abound - Russian, Swedish, Latvian, Finnish, Estonian - and Ransome provides many interesting footnotes to their stories.My favorite encounter is that with the enigmatic man who lives alone, building a ship, in the forest. The ship is at first seen as \\"a golden hull in the shadows among those tall trees\\" then we see that \\"the upper planking was new, certainly, ruddy gold where the sun caught it, but lower down her hull was weathered\\"....\\"The keel, laid on great stones, was joined to them by moss. There was lichen upon it, and on the foot of the stern-post was a large, bright cluster of scarlet toadstools.\\"Enjoy."},{"Title":"Racundra's first cruise (Mariners library)","review":"Great little book - takes you back to a different, simpler, world.

I agree that only Tejanos have lived and fought under six flags and that Tejanos are here to stay. Tejano Empire is a bold book, well documented, and difficult to lay aside once opened by a reader. Stories handed down for generations are finally put into print. Beasley's sketches depict tejano stories that will live forever.

I think this book will bring back self confidence to the many families in South Texas with ranching roots. With this book Tijerina helps fill the void of the much neglected history of the ranchos in South Texas from a Tejano point of view. The beautiful illustrations by Ricardo M.

This is a book everyone who is interested in early South Texas History must read. My hats off to Andres Tijerina."},{"Title":"Tejano Empire: Life on the South Texas Ranchos (Clayton Wheat Williams Texas Life)","review":"This account is an eye-opener for Americans who think they know Texas. It challenges the stereotypes people have about Texas \\"cowboys\\" and ranch life. It argues that it was the Mexican-Spanish-Tejano ranchers who first established roots in Texas and who built the first substantial cattle ranches, before they were rudely dispossessed of them by white Americans. I don't know much about Texan or Tejano culture, nevertheless, I found it is entertaining, accessible and readable, with great details about Tejano \\"cowboy\\" life and 19th century ranching culture in Texas, including great descriptions about food, rituals, architecture, festivals, and the lost trades and occupations of this world. I highly recommend this for anybody who is interested in early Texas and frontier culture. The only drawback of this book is its almost universal endorsement of this culture, without any criticism of it. For example, there is almost no mention of crime, social problems, gender inequality or class tensions within this idyllic community. Thus, it is more of a genuine, heartwarming celebration of Tejano culture rather than an objective sociological study. This author has edited other similar books which I look forward to reading."},{"Title":"All Said and Done","review":"&#65533;All Said and Done&#65533; by Simone de Beauvoir is the final of five volumes of de Beauvoir&#65533;s autobiography, and is different from those that precede it, which basically progress on a chronological basis. This book is arranged thematically, and de Beauvoir picks up a theme or area of her life, addresses it for the 10 years that the book focuses on, 1962 to 1972. Early in the volume, she addresses books she&#65533;s read, movies, theater productions, etc. A particularly interesting chapter focuses on the deaths of some of the people she has known, including Sartre&#65533;s mother and de Beauvoir&#65533;s close friend, Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti. While these sections have interesting moments, the brief time she spends on each book, movie, or production and the shortness of the sections isn&#65533;t a very engaging read. The discussion is really a gloss, and feels a little obligatory on de Beauvoir&#65533;s part.The book really picks up in pace and interest when de Beauvoir moves on to address the travels she&#65533;s taken in these ten years toward the end of her life (she died in 1986). She first goes through trips she made for fun, with Sartre or on her own. Then she addresses trips they took for primarily political reasons, to Egypt, to Israel, to Russia, Estonia, etc. She&#65533;s always a very engaging travel writer as she has a deep knowledge of the places she&#65533;s traveling, and, often &#65533; especially on the political trips &#65533; she and Sartre are given guides and access to things one might not be able to see on one&#65533;s own.Toward the end of the book, she writes about her feelings about the Vietnam War, going into some detail about two tribunals that worldwide intelligentsia held to try the United States for war crimes in Vietnam, particularly for genocide (the United States was found guilty). De Beauvoir was very against France&#65533;s actions in Algeria, and she now turned her attention toward what she felt was a violation of the rights of the Vietnamese for self-determination to make a statement with her colleagues on their political situation.This book was illuminating of de Beauvoir&#65533;s character in a rather new way. Toward the end, she emerged to me as something of an ideologue, rather than a woman who was committed to certain principles that she addressed issue by issue. When the students took over the Sorbonne in the late 1960s, she supported their actions because it was to overthrow the status quo; the students wanted more control of their studies, they wanted to abolish the class system between students and faculty and they didn&#65533;t want to have to accept professors&#65533; edicts. She seems, from this book, to believe that any system that is very long held should be overthrown on that point alone. She was disappointed when she and other editors at Les Temps moderne offered the rebellious students an opportunity to write for their political review and the student leaders turned them down because their publication had become an institution (it was too long standing). She does not comment on this.Also in the late 1960s, de Beauvoir and Sartre officially broke with the Soviet Union, which they had supported as part of the noncommunist left for some time, because of its actions in Czechoslovakia. While de Beauvoir constantly ridiculed the United States for its imperialism, up until this time, even after visiting Estonia and Lithuania after they were controlled by the U.S.S.R., she did not criticize the Soviet government. But after the Prague Spring was crushed, she and Sartre had to admit that they were not pleased with the &#65533;thought-police&#65533; actions of the Soviets and their interpretation of the communist party. She also laments that Marx is so disregarded in the U.S.S.R. by the time of this volume, that there is no longer any one there who can speak with authority on Marxist theory or philosophy.I really enjoyed this volume, for its differences with its sister volumes, and for what it reveals about de Beauvoir. I recommend it, and think it could certainly stand on its own."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Engrossing, but also kind of reads like a text book, with the methodology explanations being comparatively dry compared to the sections on the murderers and their crimes. This isn't a complaint, just a statement. Comprehensive, though a bit repetitive and over-redundant in places (the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5). There's a lot to learn here, but the approach is very analytical and cerebral (though it is still chilling in spots). If you're looking for more sensationalistic and gut-wrenching, this isn't your book."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"As someone who loves reading true crime stories and has a long term plan on working with the FBI, I have to say this is by far one of the best books out there for the history, profiling, and creation of the world's favorite monsters - serial killers. I could not put this book down! In addition to being well written, academically researched, and detailed, it opens the door to many other sources for people who are looking to learn more about the profiling and psychology of criminals."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This book is extremely interesting but it is also very factual so you have to read it carefully. I couldn't put it down, Vronsky's amount of in-depth research is admirable. So worth reading."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Finally, an informative book on serial killers that isn't just the written version of rubbering necking at a car accident! The author presents the latest theories on the formation and categorization of multiple killers. He uses detailed case studies of individual killers to illustrate different elements of classification. A very interesting and easy to read book!"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This is the best book i have read on the subject of serial killers and i have read hundreds in my studies."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This is the book on serial killers that serial killer Dennis Rader (the BTK Killer) was reading when he was arrested in 2005 (according to Stephen Singular inUnholy Messenger). If that is not a \\"professional\\" endorsement of the depth and complexity of Peter Vronsky'sSerial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters, then I don't know what is. There is no question Vronsky's 2004 book is the definitive history of serial homicide from its early ancient roots in Roman and Medieval societies to about the mid-2000's.Vronsky is a professor of criminal justice history and his book is highly researched with sources extensively cited in the endnotes but unlike most academics, Vronsky writes in a very pleasurably readable journalistic story-telling style he defines as \\"true crime history.\\" The book covers the history, culture, and psychopathology of serial homicide and its investigation. It does not have to be read from beginning to end but can be read in random sections that interest you the most. The only drawback is that the author occasionally repeats a sentence here and there in case you are reading the book out of page order - not a major problem for me and it works very well. I skipped right away the dense statistical stuff in the early part, and went straight to the dramatic case studies and psychology first and then after went to the statistics behind the cases studies.There is a masterly summary of the origins and historical statistics of serial murder, the social construct of the psychology and culture of serial killing and the evolution of profiling and other investigative techniques and their strengths and weaknesses interspersed with several dozen compellingly written narrative case studies of serial killers, some famous, others I had never heard of. But even the cases of famous serial killers, like Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy are newly researched and told in a way you have not read before. While this is not an encyclopedic treatment of all serial killers, it is comprehensive in its treatment of profiles and categories of serial killers with the very detailed case study stories serving as examples: a kind of of state-of-the-union on the \`theory and practice' of serial murder: the method and madness of monsters. The last chapter, on how to improve one's chances of surviving a serial killer encounter is awesome.Vronsky also wrote a sequel,Female Serial Killers: How and Why Women Become Monstersthat looks at the history of women serial killers and the politics of female perpetrated predatory serial murder that radical feminists love to hate.While SERIAL KILLERS is a brilliant history of serial homicide until the early 2000's, rumor has it Vronsky is writing a new history of serial killing from 2001 until today, picking up roughly from where his first book left off, something I am eagerly waiting to read if it is as good as his last two books were."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This book is well-written and very engaging. Gives very thorough history on some very prolific serial killers. I recommend it for any fascinated with the subject of criminology or has an interest in psychiatry---zoning in on psychopathology.

If you want first-hand accounts, look for another book."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"It has a lot of information about serial killers that I didn't know about. I believe it was a excellent choice"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"I bought this book on Saturday....4/16/11......I got through it soon after. This is better than it seems. Especially the section on Peter Woodcock(Gary Michael Krueger).The serial killers covered here are done so with detail. This book even goes into detail about some brutal sex offenders from pre modern times....(no sections are not dedicated to them) but at least a couple of paragraphs. Some are covered in 2 pages. This is an excellent book on the subject. I whould really suggest this book."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"I loved this book right from the beginning. I could barely put it down to eat and work! It was interesting yet informative.

The only boring part is the section of statistics. He describes the killers so very well and it is cool that he includes quotes from the killers. Great book do not recommend if you are a easily frightened because some of the content is disturbing."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"The subtitles of this book promise a lot, but the book hardly delivers on those promises. Given that there really is still so little insight into the psychology of most serial murderers, a lot of the uncertainly here could have been excused if we hadn't been lured into these pages with the cover's promise of \\"definitiveness\\" dangled in front of us like candy from a stranger.The beginning chapters are especially disappointing. They are full of loosely written anecdote, repetitions, backtrackings, and citations of contradictory statistics. There was a recent spike in serial killings; any spike in killings is more apparent than real, probably a function of recording/classifying technique. Serial killers are actually a very rare phenomenon, there only having been 399 in recorded history; serial killers can and probably have lurked ubiquitously, brushing past us all the time, hidden behind facades of normalcy. The reader is ping-ponged between such opposing assertions. Also, statistical breakdowns sometimes confusingly add up to either more or less than 100%.While the writing remains generally loose, almost to the point of being sloppy throughout, things do improve as Vronsky gets into case studies. He has a particularly long section on Ted Bundy, providing a few insights that didn't come out in the excellent movie, \\"The Deliberate Stranger,\\" and that didn't get generally circulated. It's the same with Ted Kaczynski, the \\"Unibomber\\" whom it's revealed might have been gulled into participating in potentially dangerous and disorienting LSD experiments done at Harvard.He also has a fairly good section on John Wayne Gacy in which he quotes Gacy as maintaining that it was \\"the other guy tilt\\" who killed all the youths found in his crawl space. Actually, that phrase, \\"The Other Guy Tilt\\" with its unstudied, sharply akimbo connotations, would have been a better title for this book than the misleadingly conclusive and academic titles that Vronsky chose.Even with the case studies, there is something to be disappointed about though. The reader might wish that Vronksy had spent less time on already well-documented lives, and had probed more into the backgrounds of killers who got less media coverage, at least in the U.S. There are so many (such as Dr. Marcel Petiot) who are disposed of in thumbnail sketches, even though their elaborate techniques might have provided a gateway into the murderer's mind.One gets the feeling Vronsky wanted to put something sensational and saleable on the market as quickly as possible, and didn't want to be bothered doing any difficult, original researches. He settled for second-hand sources, then jotted something down.However, the book did hold my interest. Some of the last chapters provided especially valuable correctives to the impression of forensic infallibility we get from modern TV shows and movies. For example, Vronsky points out some of the failings of the FBI's classification systems.On the whole, this book is worth reading, but there are probably better-researched volumes on serial killers out there."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Once I started this book I could not put it down!! There is so much information within the pages that it is almost a mind overload. There are so many killers throghout history. This book makes you wonder who you are talking too, what is in the mind of every stranger around you and how on this Earth we live in that there are so many demented and broken people who want to kill and do harm.Great read for any true crime or serial killer fan out there."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This was a very interesting and detailed, yet easy to understand book. Vronsky tells the reader from the beginning that he's no serial murder expert, but it does seem like he's spent a long time in the field. Just about all of his information is cited. He even chillingly tells you of his own experience of (unwittingly) meeting two famous serial killers shortly before they were captured.He covers each killer with information on their childhood, adult life, crimes and victims and subsequently their capture. He even takes you through the FBI's process of finding them.About 3-4 pages of the book feature black and white photos of crime scenes and victims, which are graphic.I've brought this book with me everywhere in the course of reading it. It really captures people's attention and they immediately want to know all about it.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"I've been watching Criminal Minds lately, and it's made me wonder how accurate the portrayal of profiling is, as well as about some of the cases they refer to in their investigations.

He has been shooting and producing investigative documentaries and independent films since 1975.He has worked in Europe, the former Soviet Union, Middle-East, South Africa and in Canada and USA. He has produced and directed numerous cutting edge investigative documentary television specials on subjects ranging from early punk rock and flashback syndrome in Vietnam war veterans to organized crime and nuclear materials smuggling in the break-away regions of the former Soviet Union.Peter Vronsky's extensive, varied background must contribute to a very different and enjoyable book about serial killers.This book is well-worth the money."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"i have developed an interest on true crime and criminology, and purchasing Amazon's books has opened a new point of wiew for me. I am a bit slower to read in english, because it's not my native language-but the vocabulary is easy to comprehend and the text is quite fluent. I especially liked the fact that this book detailed on the serial kiler's crimes. Now I don't mind tha language anymore. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"I really can't praise this book enough. There is so much information in it, and it is set up in a very accessible way. It isn't written in a dry, clinical sort of way where the writer's voice is entirely absent. There is dry, and incredibly dark, humour to be found in here (some well deserved comedic relief, I suppose.) I found the parts about how they profile serial killers to be incredibly interesting, and want to find more about this thanks to this book. There is also a very interesting bit towards the end, filled with advice on how to survive a serial killer. Of course, they are not foolproof, as he states, but they are words of wisdom taken from the mouths of those who ought to know. FBI profilers, and, uniquely enough, the Gainesville Ripper.Definitely give this book a read!"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"I have read literally every book written on serial and sexually motivated murder and this is by far the worst.This book starts with an admission by the writer that he knows nothing about the subject and has learned everything he knows just like the reader. Bad omen. He then proceeds with the rambling tale of how he thinks he has bumped into two different serial murderers in his life and that seems to be the motivation to write this book.So then, the book begins. He seems antagonistic at best when referencing the work of experts in the field such as the Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico, disputing statistics compiled by people who have, by his own admission, more experience than he does.The crime accounts are no better than what you could read in the news reports of these cases. As an example it includes an account of the London Moster who was a man that stabbed women but never killed anyone, which is piquerism not serial homicide. never focused or on track this book is all over the place and a very amatuerish work.I highly recommend that you buy another book such as Hunting Humans, or The Criminal Mind"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This book was on the list of required readings for a criminal justice course I took but it was actually fun to read compared to some of the dull and clinical readings we have to do. I began reading this book on the way home from the campus bookstore, and could hardly put it down until I finished it. This writer deals with some very technical and heavy-going forensic material on serial killers, their psychology, history and investigative techniques. But he explains things in a very understandable way without talking down to you and gives real case examples for his stuff with identifiable details (which forensic texts often do not.) The references in this book are worth its cover price alone. I am so tired of reading \\"true crime\\" accounts with no idea where the authors get their information. This writer tells you the source of almost every major fact or controversial claim in his book. You can go and look it up yourself if you don't believe him or want to know more. And there is material here that no other books on Serial Killers deal with. Great book. Smart and hip. A Fast Food Nation or Black Hawk Down of serial killer books. Well researched and brilliantly written. Going beyond books on serial killers, this is one of the better books outright that I have read this year. Just a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"A lot of reviews focused on the history covered by this book, but what I found most compelling was in fact the second half, which discussed the \\"formation\\" of a serial killer.In the first half, the author goes back a few centuries to uncover gruesome truths of serial killers across Europe. With every chapter, he steps forward in time, narrating the lives and biographies of famous and not-so-famous killers, from Jack the Ripper to the Boston Strangler. Every page delivers a shock, as the lives and practices of the killers are revealed.If you manage to survive through the photos in the center without passing out at the gore, you'll find the second half even more gripping. It explains how a serial killer develops, how his behavior differs from others in childhood, how he strikes his first victim, and the pattern that dictates his life from there on. There is plenty on the many types of killers and their various approaches to murder.A fair portion near the end of the book is dedicated to criminal profiling and crime scene investigation. The book closes with a chilling chapter on how to survive if you find yourself at the mercy of a serial killer.A very engaging read if you have the heart for the gruesome details!"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Peter Vronsky has an interesting personal perspective on serial killers. His book does not try to be a definitive source on all serial killers, but does try to provide an over view to the world that some of these killers live in. His writing is thought provoking and brings to light many interesting statistics and facts about both serial killers and profilers. Definitely a great read for both the amateur as well as the professionals who may have to be searching for the killers. Also has a nice bonus chapter about surviving serial killer abductions."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"I cannot say much more about this book than the other review, however, I can HIGHLY recommend it. It was by far one of the best books I have ever read pertaining to serial killers and everything inbetween.

I have read many books on serial killers and profiling and this tops them all."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Ever since I first read \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\", the ground-breaking book about the serial killings of Ted Bundy, so brilliantly written by Ann Rule, I have read lots of true crime books covering serial killers.This is one of the best books I've seen covering the topic of serial killers, and is well worth the read. It is truly an educational and well-written study of a stranger who may be beside us!"},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Vronsky is a great story teller and gives a thorough analysis of serial killing and the perpetrators.

I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"Peter Vronksy's \\"Serial Killers\\" is a good overview of serial killers and what makes them tick. The book is filled with case studies of famous serial killers, as well as some thumbnail sketches of less famous killers. To be honest, I would have been more interested in reading about the lesser-known killers, as yet another retelling of Ted Bundy isn't really needed at this point. The first chapter of the book is fairly boring, filled with statistics and conjecture. The book picks up speed toward the middle and doesn't really slow down from then on out. My stomach turned at some of the descriptions of victims in the book, and I realized that perhaps I learned more about some of these killers and their deeds than I had wanted.A warning: there are some very graphic photos in the middle of the book that I now wish I hadn't seen as they are very explicit. You may want to skip the picture section if you are squeamish."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"This was a great book, Peter Vronsky obviously did a ton of research. The only minor complaint I have is there are times where he states the same things over again as if they hadn't been written in the book already. Other than that, in my opinion, it was indeed a well written book. He goes into great detail about what \\"triggers\\" serial killers, MO's, the methods of profiling, stories of actual crimes, etc. I was so intrigued by this book I finished it in 3 days.This book also made me really stop and think just how comfortable we humans become in our daily routines, with many of us believing nothing will ever happen to us. Even something as simple as going to the grocery store, which may be something you do every Sunday, could end up being your last day alive. Not only is this book truly informative, I think there is also a lesson to be learned; never trust ANYONE. Always be aware of your surroundings and no matter how innocent a stranger may be or seem, you CANNOT trust them. And above all, NEVER, EVER get into a strangers car. I'm not suggesting living out the rest of your life in fear by any means but this book, for me at least, reinforced the belief we always need to be aware of our surroundings and again, never trust anyone. Do not be afraid to refuse to help someone get something into their car, do not be afraid to stand your ground fearing you may come off as a jerk or impolite and mostly, if you say no, do not allow someone to pressure you into doing something you don't want to, it really could save your life."},{"Title":"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters","review":"\\"Serial Killers: The Method and Madness of Monsters\\" is a first rate account of serial killers.

Montgomery originally wrote six novels, beginning in \\"Green Gables\\" with Anne's arrival as a child at a farm on Prince Edward Island, and ending with \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\", the coming of age of a married Anne's youngest child during the First World War. Montgomery later published two additional Anne novels to fill gaps in the story of her heroine's life. \\"Anne of Windy Willows\\" covers the three years between her graduation from college and her engagement to a childhood friend, and their eventual marriage.Anne spent those three years in the PEI town of Summerside as principal and teacher at the local high school, while renting a room in a house known as Windy Willows. The novel offers a unique perspective of Anne Shirley as a fiesty and independent working woman, trying to make a place for herself in a town full of rivalries and prejudice against outsiders. Anne will have to overcome those prejudices in order to have a positive impact on her students, a task that will require courage, tact, and perhaps a little guile. Anne will also discover her powers to interfere for good in the lives of some of the people she meets in Summerside.Montgomery stirs Anne's long romance with Gilbert Bythe, away at medical school, through a series of letters relating her impressions of Summerside. Montgomery will weave in some familiar faces from earlier novels, while adding a few characters, including Rebecca Dew, the unique maid of Windy Willows; Katherine Brooke, an embittered fellow teacher; and the mysteriously lonely young Elizabeth Grayson, who lives next door. Just for dramatic effort, Montgomery works in a couple of terrific ghost stories. The novel is nicely episodic, and very likely to appeal to fans of \\"Anne of Green Gables.\\" It is very highly recommended to that audience."},{"Title":"Burt's Bees Baby Skin Care Kit (Mega Mini Kits)","review":"Small sizes great for the diaper bag and to pack with you for the trip to the hospital so you can have the nurses start using \\"good\\" soap instead of harsh cleaners on your baby.

However, you may come to very different conclusions, or none at all, if you cannot put the clues in the context that Gardner does when Mason solves the crime.Here we start out with a very complicated set of situations, as Mason is approached by a man whose wife ran off with another man. But this isn't the first story Mason gets, as the client first complains about a howling dog next door. We soon discover that the dog may have had a good \\"dog reason\\" for his howling, but if that is so, then why did it abruptly stop? Then Mason's client disappears. Things only get more complicated from there to the very end.The TV show version of this book changed a few things around, but overall was remarkably close to the plot of the novel, which I always find to be entertaining. No question, I'm a Perry Mason junkie. However, I try to indulge my habit in small doses, three or four books a year, so that I don't overdose on them and lose my enthusiasm. For anyone already a Perry Mason fan, or for those who enjoy the old style mysteries where you have a good chance to solve it as you read, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"The Case of the Howling Dog, by Erle Stanley GardnerArthur Cartwright visits Perry Mason to see about a dog and a will. Perry explains what makes a will valid in their state. Cartwright hates to hear a howling dog because it means death in the neighborhood. Perry explains how he will avoid a malicious prosecution suit: they will see a deputy district attorney to issue a warning (Chapter I). Clinton Foley, the neighbor, visits the deputy DA and charges that Cartwright is mentally deranged; Foley's dog doesn't howl. Deputy Sheriff Pemberton will personally investigate this conflict (Chapter III). The housekeeper and cook say the police dog Prince didn't make noise. But Foley finds a note - his wife has run away with Cartwright (Chapter IV)! Cartwright left home last night and never returned (Chapter V). Perry orders Paul Drake to investigate Foley and Cartwright; he suspects there is something going on (Chapter VI). Paul Drake reports on the identity of Foley and his wife - shocking news (Chapter VII)! Perry calls Foley to discuss the situation at a 9 pm meeting.When Perry arrives at Foley's home he finds the dog dead, and Foley's body. He calls the police (Chapter VIII). Sergeant Holcomb questions Perry about his appointment. Perry points out that his lack of an alibi shows he had no foreknowledge. A perfect alibi should be suspicious (Chapter IX). Paul Drake's menlocate the taxi driver who brought a visitor to Foley's home earlier (Chapter XI). When they locate Bessie Forbes, Perry visits her and gives her advice (Chapter XII). Perry retrieves a handkerchief, and call Sergeant Holcomb to turn it in as the owner visited Foley's home around the time of his death (Chapter XIII). Perry's clever misdirection points to the Breedmont Hotel.Perry confers with Bessie Forbes and hears her story. Perry tells he she can't afford to lie about her call on Foley, and can't afford to tell the truth. Bessiemust not answer any questions unless her lawyer is present. The police show up next to arrest Bessie, and warn her that anything she says can be used against her (the \\"Miranda warning\\" in 1934). Della and Perry discuss the case (Chapter XV). Perry explains that a defense lawyer presents the facts in favor of the defendant against the powers of the state. Perry must strike at just the right time to free his client. First he must build up sympathy in the newspapers. Perry's case will depend on that howling dog! The police traced the gun to Bessie Forbes, bought over a year ago.Perry gets Paul Drake to investigate the alibi of Thelma Benton, Foley's housekeeper. Her hand is still bandaged from a dog bite. Perry uses a ruse toquestion her (Chapter XVI). The trial starts in Chapter XVII. Perry cross-examines the taxi driver who brought Bessie Forbes to the Foley home; he was coached by the district attorney. Perry plays another fast trick, skating on thin ice because he has to do it (Chapter XVIII). Perry explains the fickleness of the mass mind and how he will use it (Chapter XX). The cross-examination of Thelma Barton is interrupted with startling news! Perry argues for his client, and the jury returns with 'not guilty' in Chapter XXI. In the next chapter Perry explains it all, a happy ending; we learn why that dog didn't howl. Perry would not accept a dismissal; justice was served, not the letter of the law. The language reflects the manners of that time."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"This is the fourth Perry Mason books written in 1934 and I think it is one of the best.

Her competitor, Harry Peavis, bought up a few shares in her small corporation. Now he wants to buy up control. Mildreth calls Perry Mason's office for an appointment, then visits her invalid sister Carlotta and her husband Bob. Chapter 2 explains how this nightclub with a PRIVATE door runs a racket. The witness, Esther Dilmeyer, is poisoned by candy but is found in time. Mildreth suspects Bob has given up Carlotta's shares in the corporation. There is another roller-coaster ride of a story where events pop-up as a surprise twist. Complications arise from page to page, chapter to chapter, yet the storyline stays simple to follow.In Chapter 5 Mason visits the nightclub owner's cabin, only to find the police and newspaper reporters covering his murder. Lynk was dead quite a while (the coagulation of blood and rigor mortis). Now the question is who did it from the list of suspects, or an as yet unknown person. Chapter 6 tells how a suspect could refuse to answer questions based on constitutional rights. Lieutenant Tragg plays with Mildreth like a cat with a mouse, and gets her admission (Mason represents her sister Carlotta). Mason points out that husbands and wives are more likely to kill each other than a stranger (Chapter 9). Chapter 13 explains why a claimant in a court of equity must have clean hands; illegal means, entrapment, fraud, or oppression disqualify a suit. Mason learns of facts that lead to the questioning of a witness, and the truth comes out to free his client. Mildreth recovers the missing stock and keeps her business. This all takes place in two fast-paced days. One item dates this novel: a woman wearing \\"light woolen stockings\\" (Chapter 3)."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"a client calls for a will and a howling dog . the next day he runs away with his neighbors wife leaving behind the CORPSE of her husband and perry mason in a very embarrising position.or did he? must read . on of the best gardners book."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"Well plotted, and a VERY unexpected end. a must read"},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"Fans of Gardner's Perry Mason stories will quickly recognize that this was one of the first in the long and delightful series of stories featuring the dynamic attorney. There are also references to the economic depression that had enveloped the United States and the world, further serving to date the story in the minds of the knowledgeable reader.At this point the development of the Mason, Street and Drake characters is still in the early stages; Mason has a rough and hard edge and the two primary adversaries, police Lieutenant Tragg and District Attorney Hamilton Burger have yet to appear. Mason is very bold in working along and beyond the border of ethical and legal boundaries, a point that he acknowledges to both Street and Drake. The relationship between Mason and Street is one of affection, yet Street open criticizes Mason's tactics, something that is rarely repeated.The story itself is a modification of the episode of Sherlock Holmes where the key point is what the dog did not do. In this case, the dog supposedly howls but then later does not. This is a key point in the story and like so many others, when it is revealed the conclusion is obvious. Modern readers will be appalled at the racial slurs regarding the Chinese cook as well as the hints of his primitive mental capacity. The best way to deal with these things is to appreciate how far our society has progressed in this area and read on."},{"Title":"The case of the howling dog","review":"First published in 1934, The Case of the Howling Dog was the fourth entry in Erle Stanley Gardner's long-running series featuring Perry Mason.At this point, Gardner was still in the process of establishing the formula that he would adhere to once the series hit its stride. Lieutenant Tragg, the intelligent and sympathetic homicide detective, and Hamilton Burger, the D.A. who would become Mason's principal adversary had not yet been introduced. The police department is still represented by the oafish Sergeant Holcomb, who wouldn't recognize a clue if it bit him in the backside. The D.A.'s office is represented by an assistant D.A., Claude Drumm who immediately falls into every trap that Mason so cleverly baits for him.Della Street, the faithful and adoring secretary, Paul Drake, the reliable detective, and Perry Mason himself are still evolving into the characters they would ultimately become. Mason is a bit rougher around the edges than the suave attorney that most crime fiction readers would recognize, and at this stage of the game he's much more willing to severely bend, if not actually break the law in the interest of serving what he sees as the greater good.As is often the case in this series, the plot becomes almost hopelessly convoluted: A man comes to see Mason about his neighbor's howling dog and about writing a will. Complications ensue.Suffice it to say that there will be a murder. Inevitably, Mason's client will be the prime suspect, and inevitably the case against the client will appear to be open and shut. As always, the D. A.'s office will be salivating at the chance to finally beat Mason after suffering so many ignominious defeats at his hands. And of course, as always Perry will pull the rabbit out of the hat and save the day at the very end.Obviously, this story is a bit dated and is clearly a product of its times, but it's still a fun read and an opportunity to see Perry Mason and these other characters in their formative stages."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"The Rights of Man is a riposte to Edmund Burke's criticism of the French Revolution. Its message is the superiority of reason, in the form of Republican government armed with the Declaration of the Rights of Man, over despotism which holds populations in ignorance. With the American and French revolutions fresh in his mind, Paine was writing in a world on the threshold of freedom and that comes through in his forceful and forthright style. That said, and most important for the reader to appreciate, much of what he has to say still applies today. Paine in scathing in his critique of hereditary monarchy and privilege. He says &quot;the idea of hereditary legislation is.......as absurd as an hereditary mathematician, or an hereditary wise man.&quot; He rejects the notion of government laws being justified by tradition and therefore irrevocable. His argument against Burke's defence of the 1688 revolution in England is perhaps the best in the book. Paine argues that the only thing that is truly hereditary is the Rights of Man : &quot;The Rights of men in society, are neither devisable, nor transferrable, nor annihilable, but descendable only.&quot; The book is a superb polemic when both understood in its historical context and applied to world politics today. His arguments for reform of the House of Lords strike a particularly pertinent note. He expresses liberal doctrines that many people take for granted but in our own genocidal times Paine reminds us that many of the topics that impassioned him should continue to impassion everyone with an interest in humanity. The style of the writing may put off a few as many themes disappear and reappear throughout the book instead of being dealt with in a coherant whole. The fact that it was written in two parts and that he is one of the greatest pamphleteers of modern times should compensate for this minor irritation."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"Thomas Paine's &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"\\"Rights of Man\\" (1791-92) is Thomas Paine's famous response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution of France\\" (1790). Although it helps have read Burke's essay, a general background is sufficient to understand and appreciate Paine's basic and groundbreaking arguments.Paine and Burke were originally allies; Burke not only supported self-rule for the American colonies, he also supported the emancipation of the House of Commons from monarchical control and the independence of both Ireland and India. Many of his allies, then, were bewildered by his fervent opposition to the French Revolution; Burke drew the line between territorial autonomy from a distant or aloof government and the total overthrow of existing monarchies and institutions. For Burke, humankind's real enemies were drastic change and \\"unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos,\\" and he proved himself a staunch defender of the status quo, of precedent, and of gradual reform.Jerry Muller, in his recent--and superb--book \\"The Mind and the Market\\" asserts that Burke's denunciation of the French revolution is \\"the single most influential work of conservative thought published from his day to ours.\\" (This, of course, depends on what one means by \\"conservative.\\") Yet Muller and likeminded historians inevitably cherry-pick Burke's more attractive economic and philosophical arguments and foreground Burke's critique, in Muller's words, \\"of the revolutionary mentality that attempts to create entirely new structures on the basis of rational, abstract principles.\\" (Muller doesn't even mention Paine, much less the example of the United States.) Such a focus inevitably sidesteps Burke's brief for the supremacy of European monarchical institutions and of the landed aristocracy. And that's where Paine comes in.With his usual acerbic wit and extravagant rhetoric, Paine, in the first part of his treatise, makes mincemeat out of Burke's sillier statements. For example, he finds especially unspeakable Burke's claim that that \\"the English nation did, at the time of the [1688] Revolution, most solemnly renounce and abdicate [the right of self-rule], for themselves, and for all their posterity for ever.\\" Paine correctly challenges the primacy of a decision made by members of that generation over desires of other generations, questions the right of any generation to surrender the rights of their descendants, and notes that \\"government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it.\\"He also chastises the English for a system of hereditary government that virtually guarantees unfettered rule by children, madmen, idiots, and foreign-born pretenders (and he certainly has plenty of examples from which to choose), many of whom led their realms into chaos and terror without the help of radical revolutionaries. And Paine argues that wars would cease with the promotion of democracy and the cessation of the selfish interests of absolutists. His critics rightly respond that the rise of democratic institutions has hardly stopped wars, although one might pose the counterargument that, relatively speaking, democratic governments go to war with each other much less frequently.In the second part, Paine proposes a radical agenda for an overhaul of the British government. Although his anecdotally based statistics and figures must be viewed with skepticism and a few laughs, the prescience of his proposals is startling: poverty relief, social security, public education, maternity care, homeless shelters, workfare, veteran's benefits, and progressive taxation. His is the agenda of the idealist: \\"When it shall be said in any country in the world, my poor are happy; neither ignorance nor distress is to be found among them; my jails are empty of prisoners, my streets of beggars; the aged are not in want, the taxes are not oppressive . . . when these things can be said, then may that country boast its constitution and its government.\\"Paine, of course, had the nascent United States to cite in support of his proposals, but he and Burke were debating these matters before the onset of the Jacobin Reign of Terror, which dismayed Paine and seems to have realized Burke's worst fears. Yet, throughout history, for every Robespierre or Lenin, one can find a Mandela or a Walesa; monarchies too were no strangers to upheaval. Paine hardly argued for \\"mob rule\\" or even \\"majority rule\\"; the French Revolution failed in part because it violated the fundamental tenet that the citizens of each nation have a right to choose whatever rule they please, even \\"a bad or defective government, . . . so long as the majority to not impose conditions on the minority, different to what they impose on themselves\\"--a caveat we all should take to heart in today's political climate."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"Paine wrote RoM while in France, during the early years of the revolution, in response to an antirevolutionary pamphlet from his previous friend Burke. There is lots of polemics going on, and the crux of the matter is that Burke makes light of The Declaration of the Rights of Man, which was adopted by the French National Assembly in August 1789, after the storm of the Bastille. The Declaration, written by Lafayette with some input by Jefferson, is a brief and concise document. It became the preamble of the constitution of 1791.Here a shortened version.1. Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.2. The aim of all political association is the preservation of the ... rights of man. These rights are liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression.3. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation. ...4. Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; ... These limits can only be determined by law.5. Law can only prohibit such actions as are hurtful to society. Nothing may be prevented which is not forbidden by law, and no one may be forced to do anything not provided for by law.6. Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. ...7. No person shall be accused, arrested, or imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law. ...8. The law shall provide for such punishments only as are strictly and obviously necessary, and no one shall suffer punishment except it be legally inflicted in virtue of a law passed and promulgated before the commission of the offense.9. ...all persons are held innocent until they shall have been declared guilty ...10. No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.11. The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.12. The security of the rights of man and of the citizen requires public military forces. These forces are, therefore, established for the good of all and not for the personal advantage of those to whom they shall be intrusted.13. A common contribution is essential for the maintenance of the public forces and for the cost of administration. This should be equitably distributed among all the citizens in proportion to their means.14. All the citizens have a right to decide, either personally or by their representatives, as to the necessity of the public contribution; to grant this freely; to know to what uses it is put; and to fix the proportion, the mode of assessment and of collection and the duration of the taxes.15. Society has the right to require of every public agent an account of his administration.16. A society in which the observance of the law is not assured, nor the separation of powers defined, has no constitution at all.17. ... property is an inviolable and sacred right ...Paine contrasts this brilliantly utopian text with England's lack of a constitution.But there is not just the matter of principle, there is also disagreement over matters of fact.Burke had denied not only the French right to revolt, but also the reason to revolt, as the current holder of the throne was not known to be a despot. Paine's point is that the revolution was not against the king as a person, but against a despotic system, which divided and sub-divided in 1000 steps and acted by deputation. Popper's concept of the \`open society' comes to mind. The \`declaration' quoted above aims at an open society. That is not a question of the personal quality of an individual ruler.(I can't help thinking laterally, about a special country, which right now also has a reasonably mild and rational government, within the limits of the system... What is the leader of the revolution over here quoted as having said when asked about the French Revolution? It is too early to tell. Well, that seems to be apocryphal.)Government, wrote Paine, arises out of 3 sources:a)superstition (priest craft, think of Islamic or other religious states),b)power (dictatorships, one party rules), orc)reason (which i.m.o. is synonym with secular).Unfortunately we know from history that many cases which started out from reason went into some kind of hybrid state, down the road. Or worse, we see the effect of the \`dialectics of enlightenment': reason itself becomes embodied in power and perverts itself.The order of the day for us, today, is to struggle for the survival of reason in existing governments, or for the growth of reason where it is lacking."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"In reading Tom Payne it is best to go right to the horse's mouth.

He listens to this over and over again. Thanks so much."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"The book is a response to arguments made by Edmond Burke that were critical to the constitution and behavior that resulted from the French revolution. Edmond Burke believed in the English constitution and the structure of the government in Great Britain. Mr. Paine argued the British did not have a constitution, the government was tyrannical, not efficient, a poor economic system, and not democratic. The sporadic alterations in the general design of the English government was not designed by the people voted on by the population in Great Britain, so it cannot be considered a constitution. The purpose of this work is to make an argument why the constitution set up by the French revolution is superior to the pre-Revolutionary French government and the current British government at the time of publication. No constitution cannot be established but through referendum.Thomas Paine argues that the equality of man is established by his very nature. His arguments come from the bible and other religious resources. The rationale for the rights from man come from God, but the author does not believe an individual religion has a monopoly on the truth. Pain believed in freedom of association and the organization of individuals in the making a political argument. He believed people of opposing thoughts could come to accommodation while they walked this earth. Anyhow he believed in the arguments of different world views could be made to come to the conclusion all men equal in his natural state.Paine argued government is formed either through Superstition (Religious manipulation) Power (war, conquering a people) and those that arise out of society (constitutional government). Constitution must occur before the government. The United States and France were his examples of governments coming from society. Governments that exist out of power or superstition produce a hereditary government or government ruled by a certain association not from the population or society. Edmond Burke defended the nobility. Mr. Paine made a distinction between government privileges inherited based on birth and the wealth obtained through inheritance. Titles are nicknames of legal sanction to have authority over others in the population. Consequence is not just unfairness, but a less competent government and the lack of fairness in governmental decisions. Distinction between people must be determined by the person's utility. Does the person improve society by holding a specific position of trust. The sovereign and legislators should be determined by the vote. Transmission of ideas through debate will improve the government. Debate is formed through association. People should be encouraged form into groups in order to form alliance to their point across. Society and Civilization, the wants of the people can be pursued more efficiently when a structure exists where ideas may be debated, thoughts learned, and more may seek participation. Some men have abilities that other do not posses. Society therefore the individual function better under structure but that does not mean all governments are equally as effective. Thomas Paine did not want the rights of a select few chosen through heredity protected at the expense of others. Men seek a fair government where their concerns are heard.Thomas Paine believed in the Universal Right of Conscience. Man does not worship man, but God. The mortal worships the immortal. Government should not presume or regulate how man worships the immortal neither should government define who the immortal is. - If man is free to judge his own faith his beliefs will hold what is to be true. - If man is free to judge another's faith he will hold or believe the idea of another God to be false. Thomas Pain makes the argument government corrupts religion. I have no argument here. But when he argues that government is the cause of religious intolerance that argument is absurd.The author saw the forces of history on the side democracy. Thomas Paine saw democracy as a major factor in developing the free enterprise system. He saw the United State as a major example of democracy and prosperity. Man was set free to go after wealth in so doing creating more wealth. He presumed France would soon follow the United States. Thomas Paine argued government sanctioned Charters (monopolies for the Aristocrats ) hindering ingenuity and the betterment of man. The more efficient the trade between people and nations the more wealth is produced.The author goes into great length to argue for less regressive taxes. Taxes on products hit the poor the hardest and increase the need for more in the population to receive aid to be able to survive. Thomas Paine was an advocate of a more progressive tax. He also argued for more government to those in aid by taking returns of investments and taxes on the wealthy.."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"This book was written in 1790 and 91. It was written in two parts. It started out as a rebuttal to Edmund Burke's book on the French Revolution, but as it developed Paine ended up discussing the whole aspect of democracy and goes in quite detail into the ills of a monarchial government. Paine was an ex-patriot Englishman who lived for a time in the United States. His time there coincided with the American Revolution, and Paine was a contemporary of George Washington and Ben Franklin. Paine was an idealist and that comes out clear in this important work. He also made a lot of enemies in England with his radical viewpoints. His was not an easy life, but he certainly lived at a crucial time in world history, and his viewpoints are actually quite valid in some respects even today. Not an easy book to read, but an important work to make the effort to do so."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"How far the mighty fall.Paine refuses to condemn even the most hideous atrocities of the French Revolution, and indeed, imagines that other countries should applaud and emulate them. As if \\"FREEDOM\\" meant \\"freedom to live in terror of the Paris mob,\\" or indeed, \\"freedom to participate in the random, vicious slaughter of innocents ALONGSIDE the Paris mob.\\" But in this book, there is no such thing as an \\"innocent\\" aristocrat. The aristocracy concept itself is oppressive, and must be rooted out through violence in pursuit of a \\"pure\\" France of poverty, random dismemberment, starvation, and despair.In this book, Paine considers ALL the authority of the past illegitimate -- all of it. All structures from family to piety to duty to honor must fall ... supposedly because it is \\"enlightened\\" to think so. Paine thinks the only thing holding people back from becoming truly transcendant beings (heaven on earth again) is those moldy old conventions. If this sounds like Pol Pot and Mao and today's \\"pragmatic\\" politicians, it's because revolutionaries from that age to this have borrowed these words in pursuit of their true goal: POWER. They've also borrowed the methods of the French Revolution -- terrorizing their own people and destroying their own nations.SO, my big question is this: Is it because of Paine that Jefferson failed to comprehend the evil of the French Revolution?How could Paine, who championed the American Revolution (a war to UPHOLD the long-standing British principles of natural rights and common laws, which were being violated by the Colonial governors) have written this book so soon on the heels? Was Paine secretly paid by the National Assembly to produce this? Did he instead revel in misery and bloodshed, was he a real sicko? One must wonder.The person to read on the French Revolution is Governeur Morris, the American minister to France after Jefferson's stint there -- his journals reflect the reality on the ground, and he roundly conveys his disgust.Gentleman Revolutionary: Gouverneur Morris, the Rake Who Wrote the ConstitutionEnvoy to the Terror: Gouverneur Morris and the French Revolution"},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"On time, and as promised.

It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL \\"democratic\\" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow."},{"Title":"Rights of man;: Being an answer to Mr. Burke's attack on the French revolution,","review":"This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.

Regardless, the second part, the chapter on &quot;Ways and Means&quot; in particular, is composed of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find. What Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state, replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other fine statist amenities. Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing whatsoever. It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring legacy as a friend to liberty.

Great reading--really added some depth and understanding to the story.I did have one disappointment: In the chapter on post-WWII development, Guy has a section titled \\"The Great Transmission Chase,\\" which begins, \\"The mid-1950s saw an enormous amount of IH farm tractor engineer attention going into transmissions and draft control.\\" The following text gets into planetary gearsets, torque converters, hydrostatics, and even more unusual stuff, which is fine--but I'd hoped for some insight into the reasons for and nature of the 560's transmission problems, and maybe some details of the corporate thinking behind the decision not to adopt the 3-point hitch. Guy's book is about experimentals and new developments, and perhaps the trouble with the 560 was that there *wasn't* much experimentation or new development, so the book may cover the right stuff. But the 560 seems to me to have been a very significant tractor for IH, in terms of the IH/John Deere relationship, and I was hoping to read more about it.But that quibbling aside, Guy's writing, illustration, and editing are all very good, and this book is a definite keeper."},{"Title":"International Harvester Experimental and Prototype Tractors","review":"Seller had great communication and was very friendly.

This book deals with is brutal Chosin Reservoir campaign of the Korean War fought in miserable bitter cold of the 1950 winter.

From the prologue:\\"The Last Gate is set on a world very much like our own Earth. Humans dominate the world, but theirs is a world of science, technology and magic. It is actually two stories existing side by side, and interwoven with each other. On one side are the dakas of Jantideva, a family of monarchs that virtually rule the world through the Alliance of Nations. On the other side is an almost extinct race of people called Ver dala Ven. Cobo is one of the last members of the golden-eyed people who are given the right to serve the Guardian and the Masing Star.A thousand years before the story begins, one of the dakas, Daka Redd, tried to force the people of Shodalum, to work in the deadly lume factories with no thought to what the chemicals did to their health. The Guardian became angry, and took (allowed to die or killed) all the Ver dala Ven, who served the dakas as healers and advisors, except one in every generation. The Masing Star, whose constant song could be heard by all and brought peace to the souls of all the races, fell silent. But Betnoni, the Ver dala Ven who had stopped Daka Redd's attack on the striking Shodites, left a prophecy which no one understood until it started coming true...\\"Though her curse became so accepted that it took on her name, with the passage of time the holders of her secret hardly took note of the prophecy.\\"The Shodites operated the lume plants that supplied the lume the Dakas had become dependent upon to fuel their windriders. From Chapter 1:\\"Lume produced a waste product that caused instantaneous death when used on a living being; a clean and bloodless death that melted the internal organs of the victim seconds after absorption. In a society that had not known war for five thousand years, the production of weapons was the ultimate waste of lives and currency. Redd, however, was ambitious.\\"Ver dala Ven Corbo tries to put an end to the slavery of the Shodites and reconcile them with the Dakas in order to bring back the song of the Masing Star and to bring all the people of The Last Gate under the protection of the Guardian again.In Betnoni's Prophecy Elizabeth A. Merz has created a world of love, families, mercy, religion, exploitation, war, cruelty-all the aspects of life in our world, but intensified by mutation and mutilation worse than any this world has seen to date-intensified by the ability of some of the characters to read the minds of others. Ms. Mrz has done an incredible job of portraying the stories of all the classes of citizens of The Last Gate so that the reader identifies and champions characters who are inevitably going to harm each other-they have no choice. This ability to elicit sympathy for the heroes and heroines of opposing camps is the mark of a master story teller and Betnoni's Prophecy proves Elizabeth A. Merz has mastered her craft.Betnoni's Prophecy didn't end with all or even most of the loose ends tied up. In fact it didn't end-even after 308 pages. This reader only hopes the next book in the series starts where this book stopped, because there are characters left in peril, with no resolution.-Evelyn Gale"},{"Title":"Betnoni's Prophecy","review":"Betnoni's Prophecy is a dramatic science fiction epic saga, the first title in a seven novel series called &quot;The Last Gate&quot;.

Arrogant Redd ignores the demands. The Shodites go on strike, but Redd declares that his slaves have started hostilities. His spiritual advisor the Betnoni the Ver dala Ven warns him to heed the peoples' voice or else one Daka son per generation will fall. They will also lose the connection to the Masing star that aids the Ver dala Ven, who will no longer exist. Redd rejects his Ver dala Ven advisor.One millennium later, Cobo of the Betnonis believes that he is the only living Ver dala Ven until he learns that he has a teenage son Taen from his passionate love making with Daka leader Jishni before his exile eighteen years ago. Cobo does not know for certainty whether his abusive son raised by his beloved and his uncle has the power. However, Cobo will learn the lad does not have the personality for Taen plans to use his biological sire to take control while Cobo wants to fulfill the prophecy by opening the last gate to the missing Masing Star..The first book of the Last Gate septology is a tremendous political fantasy thriller that contains a richly developed cast (past and present) that make believers out of the audience. Especially intriguing is the antagonists locked in a pivotal battle that seems Freudian. World builder extraordinaire Elizabeth Merz provides a strong opening tale that besides the upcoming sequels, begs for Daka Redd's tale to be written in depth in its own novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hawaii's Missionary Saga","review":"LaRue Piercy's \\"Hawaii's Missionary Saga\\" is complemented by illustrations or photos about every five of its 220 pages.

The author was a newspaper reporter and historian at Hawaii's first church in Kailua-Kona, Mokuaikaua Church (Congregational) on Alii Drive.There are a couple typos (such as 1920 instead of 1820), but I think they can be figured out by historians.

I cannot agree that this book gives a good, general overview of Hawaiian missionary history, but if you know the Hawaiian islands well and want to delve into some very specific local history, if you are researching 19th Century missionary history, or if you are interested in the personal history of one or several of the individual missionaries profiled here, this book could be worth your while.

Davies has a perfect mix of wit, erudition, and curmudgeonly attitude, and in addition to being a terrific writer, he is an ardent devotee of the stage.This comes forth in all the pieces, and is further emphasized by excerpts from his &quot;Theater Diary,&quot; provided by the editors, his wife and daughter. While some of the pieces are there just for amusement (e.g., a libretto Davies wrote for a children's opera), others are very thought-provoking (such as his &quot;Opera and Humour&quot; talk), and still others are a melding of the two extremese (for instance, his talk on &quot;Lewis Carroll and the Theater&quot;).Some of the pieces repeat themselves, as they are based on talks he gave and pieces he wrote throughout his life, and obviously certain comments which are redundant to the reader would no doubt have been fresh to the audience.All in all, I recommend this book very highly, for anyone with an interest in theater, or a love of Davies. I would have liked more of his thoughts about theater and less of things like his libretto (though I did find that amusing), as it felt more like that was included to meet some page count demanded by the publisher. However, this may not have been possible given the material at hand."},{"Title":"Happy Alchemy: On the Pleasures of Music and the Theatre","review":"Although I'm not a big theatre fan, I do enjoy reading Robertson Davies. He is one of two writers whose work I will read even when the subject is not up my alley; so when C.S. Lewis writes about Medieval English Literature or Robertson Davies writes about the theatre, I still read them. It brings me great pleasure to experience their writers' craftsmanship and I know I will learn something. (I also know I'm going to enjoy their humor.) Happy Alchemy's subtitle reads, &quot;On the Pleasures of Music and the Theatre&quot;, and this work present 33 Davies pieces, including &quot;Lewis Carroll in the Theatre&quot;, &quot;Opera for the Man Who Reads Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Dickens and Music&quot;, &quot;How I Write a Book&quot;, and the humorously self-depreciating &quot;My Musical Career.&quot; Happy Alchemy shares many fine insights about humanity while also providing many historical and literary lessons for the reader.

I first encountered Debian GNU/Linux back in 1996. The version back then had a static kernel with drivers for almost every SCSI and Ethernet device known to Linux. When I attempted to install it, my system promptly froze while it was detecting hardware. So I was happy for the opportunity to revisit Debian GNU/Linux with the help of this book. This time, I took a different tact, pretending no prior knowledge and letting the book &quot;hold me by the hand&quot;. And let me tell you, it helped me a lot. For example, Dselect is not easy to figure out but, by taking one through finding Midnight Commander (a good package, by the way) and adding it to the install, it showed me how to navigate through Dselect. I now feel more confident in performing a &quot;custom&quot; install, using Dselect.Also, I have been using Linux since late 1994 (my first distribution was Iggdrasil's &quot;Plug and play Linux&quot;) and until now, I have never compiled a kernal. I have come close in the past but a new release coming out that supported my custom hardware (i.e. sound) always kept me from following through. But this book took me through, step by step, configuring and compiling the kernel, making the process, if not easy, at least quite approachable.Interestingly, the discussion in the book on swap files helped me to debug a persistent Windows 98 problem where, after Windows 98 was up more than a few hours, it would slow down to a crawl with the disk drive running at full speed. What I found was that the way Windows 98 defined the swap file was not helping me at all. I changed it from a dynamic to a static swap file, using almost double the RAM size and Windows 98 is running almost respectably.Getting back to the packaging systems, I feel quite comfortable with &quot;dpkg&quot;, based on the description in this book. It is not too far off from &quot;rpm&quot;, which I have used quite a bit, from my prior experience with Red Hat Linux.If there is a section that could be stronger, it is the X11 Installation section. A run down of the configuration tools available (XF86Config, Xconfigurator, etc) would be helpful. However, the description of the Window Managers is very good, in addition to the description of why you need to install multiple font packages and why it is better, at first, to not make xdm come up at boot time.In all, this has been a very helpful book and has made Debian Linux a good choice for my future Linux installations."},{"Title":"The Debian Linux User's Guide","review":"If this is the first time you encounter Linux then maybe you'll find some useful information in it, but even in that case I wouldn't offer you just that book.

It is very specific and good about the early stages of the installation process. But, you need to be somewhat knowledgeable about the command prompt to use this book. Also some interpretation of the info here is necessary. For example there is a chapter on dpkg, the underlying installation program, but it is very superficial and is no help if you get into trouble.

I even got it to function properly. After using this book and it's software, I ended up with way less than I wanted. Also, after running through the installation using this book, I ended up not being able to use windows because the lilo (Linux Loader, the boot-loader installed with linux) configuration file was extremely messed up with no option to load windows.

I was very upset by this and began to seek answers in Science. Just read a little into it so far and looks like it's gonna be a good read.I am so thankful that at least some feminists view gender roles as having some sort of basis in science and evolutionary theory and not the sole product of a social construct of conscious and collective effort my MEN the evil purveyors of the \\"The Patriarchy\\". Contemporary feminism teaches divisiveness and portrays women as the victims of men. This book is trying to get more feminist involved in at least taking a look at evolutionary theory, evolutionary psychology and evolutionary biology and human sciences. Young women are taught that science is to be mistrusted because it comes from men. If this is the case I hope young women will read the works of Prof. Sarah Blaffer Hrdy and Prof. Hellen Fisher to start to bring them back to the humans sciences. It is imperative that they do so. This book is a basic introduction that I think will ease them back into trusting science and men and humanity and stop defining themselves in the context of victims.

This one, however, leaves some loos ends hanging. We are lefft wondering what will happen to his Italian girlfriend (characteristically, for this hero, they are instantly in love but can't speak the same language, so there is a distance between them, as there is with the rest of the hero's family and acquaintances) and what choices he will make about the rest of his life."},{"Title":"Flying Finish","review":"I have been reading a lot of Dick Francis lately as sickness has meant a lot of time in bed.

He doesn't believe anyone likes him for himself, and so he rarely makes a friend. Tidy, methodical, controlled and secretive, he's a man of the fewest possible words.He's also a man of many talents - a quite good amateur steeplechase jockey - and an even better amateur pilot. His acquaintances in the racing world have no idea he can fly, and his acquaintances at the flying club have no clue he races.His family desperately wants him to marry a rich girl to shore up the family fortunes. And one day he rebels. Quitting his respectable desk job, he becomes the head groom for a company that transports horses - at considerable loss of pay and prestige. This is the final humiliation for his family.Henry likes his new job, which still leaves him free days for racing and flying. Unfortunately, he's landed at a company that's not what it seems. Even more unfortunately, he's entirely too observant and begins to notice suspicious goings on.How Henry gets in and out of trouble is the substance of the plot, which also allows for a hot romance with a charming young woman in Milan. First published in l966, the book is a bit dated politically, but I enjoyed this window into the past.As things heat up for Henry, it's a pleasure watching him gain confidence and take a few chances on friendship and love.

A great athlete!"},{"Title":"Flying Finish","review":"This is one of the earliest of Dick Francis' many wonderful novels. Henry Grey, the hero of Flying Finish, is not only a viscount, but he rides as an amateur steeplechase jockey. He is mysterious to his friends and family and refuses to knuckle under to anyone, not even to his matchmaking mama who wants to marry him off to a rich heiress who will restore the family fortunes. Henry works for a company that transports horses by air, thus combining two of his loves--horses and flying. He takes flying lessons when he is not traveling as a groom. Despite his busy life, Henry is closed off and lonely, an introvert who is sleepwalking through life making the easy choices. I couldn't help but wonder how a person with so many walls between him and the world could fall in love so quickly with an Italian woman with whom he seems to have little in common.Nevertheless, Francis has done a fine job with the plot and the action. Villains scheme to smuggle, cheat, and murder. By the time Henry works out what is going on, his girlfriend may be dead and he is in danger of being shot. After a chilling encounter with a sociopathic killer, Henry escapes and manages to save a friend as well as the horses aboard the plane.I have only one complaint about this book and that is the abruptness of the ending.

The odes comprise about a dozen pages; Vendler's analysis is nearly 300 pages. She analyzes in thoughtful detail six classic odes of Keats, not in isolation, but by emphasizing their complex interrelationships. She argues that each poem reflects the odes preceding it and shaped the subsequent odes. As she states, \\"For the poet, the completion of one poem is the stimulus for the next; this is particularly true for poems of the same genre.\\"Not surprisingly, Vendler assumes that the reader is reasonably familiar with Keats' better known poetry (Hyperion, Endymion, and, of course, the Odes). As Spenser, Milton, and Wordsworth significantly influenced Keats, some familiarity with these poets is helpful. I found that Vendler requires attention and thought, but in return she provides insightful commentary that leads to a deeper appreciation of Keats' poetic genius.On occasion Vendler's style becomes unnecessarily convoluted. But these instances are rare lapses; her writing is characterized by a clarity that is often absent in modern criticism.She scrupulously credits ideas originating with others, explicitly identifies points of disagreement and differences in interpretation and in the process introduces the reader to a wide range of Keatsian studies. I gained a greater appreciation for modern literary criticism. I even enjoyed reading Vendler's detailed footnotes."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats (Belknap Press)","review":"After five years since I first studied this work on Keats' Odes (and after continual feasting on her &quot;Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets&quot;), I have returned to Vendler's volume to renewed appreciation of her respectful insight into Keats' creations and processes. The same respectfulness and confident humility that graces her Shakespeare criticism flourishes here - and warrants at least a brief expression of consensus with earlier laudatory reviews.Most significantly for the lover of Keats, Vendler integrates the life and creativity of the seven or so months during which he produced odes that &quot;belong to that group of works in whch the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.&quot; She makes explicit the implicit signs of connection among and growth through the Odes (and a key portion of Fall of Hyperion). Connections with Shakespeare, Spenser, and Milton are interwoven skillfully -- as integral parts of Keats' context as were the works of nature and art that are explicitly addressed in the poems.Vendler's work extends much deeper than I can fully follow, and some of it will leave all but English majors in the dust. Let's not let that discourage the rest of us amateur Keats enjoyers - the Introduction alone plus the initial discussion of each of the Odes contain indispensable caresses for the heart of mere mortals."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats (Belknap Press)","review":"Helen Vendler&quot; The Odes of John Keats' gives the reader an opportunity to see how the six great odes written in 1819 came to be. She shows how the poems are linked together through words, images, and ideas, starting with the 'Ode to Psyche&quot; and ending with the great ode&quot;To Autumn.&quot; Through a close reading of each poem, an examination of each image, and a view of the rhetorical trope, from reduplication to enumeration, which underlies each poem, Vendler provides the reader with a deep understanding of Keats's artistic concerns and meanings.. She demonstrates why Keats' achievement is so extraordinary and provides the critical reader with a method by which s/he may enter into the mind of the poet. For any lover of Keats' poetry, and for any lover of belles lettres, this is a book which belongs in your library."},{"Title":"The Odes of John Keats (Belknap Press)","review":"OK, I'll be the odd voice out. This book is worth reading. The evocation of the thoughts and ideas swirling around Keats during the time in which he wrote the Odes is thorough and fascinating. If you want get a sense for the poetry and aesthetic currents that *might* have informed Keats, then this is a beautiful book to read.My problem with Vendler is that, all too often (though by no means always), she writes as though what *she* thinks must be what *Keats* thought. She makes claims for Keats' creative thought as though her opinions were given. This is the basis for three stars. In truth, Vendler really has little to no idea what Keats was thinking when he wrote the Odes (nothing beyond what he reveals in his letters). I don't argue with her effort to trace what *might* have been at the root of his thought, but even if her opinion is informed, it remains conjecture. When you immerse yourself in this book, just remember that you are not immersing yourself in the mind or world of Keats, but the mind and world of Vendler. She can't and doesn't speak for John Keats. She speaks for the erudite and exhaustive reader who is Helen Vendler."},{"Title":"Modern Philosophy","review":"The purpose of this book is to provide an introduction to \\"Modern\\" philosophy. This term is used strangely in this book, since most Modern philosophers, (Rorty, Dewey, Buber, Rawls, Dennett, etc.) are not discussed. Rather, it seems to focus on the term \\"modern\\" as a post-modernist would use it. Everything pre-Foucault/Heidegger/Sartre, etc.The book is very long and thorough, divided up into chapters that explain a certain topic as various philosophers have addressed the issue. This can be confusing because one philosopher is found refuting another. Throughout most of the book, Roger Scruton takes no personal stance one way or another, but occassionally interjects his own personal opinion. Whenever he does, it is not to the benefit of this book. His thoughts are often ill-developed and strike me as usually being out of place. For example, he starts a two-page rant against consequentialism, but never develops it into a full thought.Because of this, the book often ends up being a \\"So and so said this, but so and so says this.\\" This renders his book very boring and will probably confuse anyone not already acquainted with philosophy. Whlie his characterizations are at least more accurate than Bertrand Russell's, Russell's book on philosophy is certainly more interesting to read.Due to the exhaustive nature and comprehensive scope of the book, I would give it a five star. Due to the boring way it was written and the strange interjections throughout, I'd give it a two star rating. Overall, about a 3.5, but I don't want to be the first to rate it and give it a low rating that may deter people from enjoying the genuine knowledge held in this book."},{"Title":"Marlborough County, S.C., Minutes of the County Court, 1785-1799 and Minutes of the Court of Ordinary, 1791-1821","review":"This is a very complete history of court actions for Marlboro County, SC in the late 1700s and was valuable in my research.

I am a Master Electrician, and I needed a detailed electrical reference book for my own library. Since electronics is a part of electricity, and has a growing impact on the electrical trade, I wanted a book that combined the two. There are a lot out there. Many are overly long and detailed, others are too simplistic or youth-oriented, and some are outdated. This book was perfect. Although it is also intended for classroom use, with review questions and experiments, this wasn't something I needed. These portions are limited though, and don't detract from the book as a whole. Buy it!!"},{"Title":"Electricity and Electronics","review":"I'm a high school teacher using this book to teach a basic electronics class. I'm very disappointed in the quality of writing. What should be simple explanations of basic concepts are loaded down with tangential information and barely related photos. It gets worse when the more advanced topics come up. The authors don't seem to know how to streamline their writing to present key information first, then branch out to more detailed concepts--it's all jumbled together. I have a lot of electrical experience and know these concepts well, but there are even times that I feel confused after reading some of the chapters!I gave it two stars instead of one only because it IS very complete. All the information is in there...somewhere. Still, I will be using a different book next time around."},{"Title":"Electricity and Electronics","review":"This study guide is a useful tool to learn the topics found in the text. A used copy is very affordable and should be purchased along with the book."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I have about four shelves of fantasy books, mostly FR, and I can tell you I almost didn't bother to finish this one. The allure was learning more about the seven sisters, a couple of whom are almost never mentioned anywhere else. The problem with this book is that I didn't get much about them out of it. In fact, I didn't get much of anything.Most of the book is hack and slash, which I can enjoy if it's well done, but it was really just mediocre. The plot was almost forgotten in the sense that it was really used as an action delivery vehicle. It felt a bit like a Arnold movie, one of the really dumb ones like Red Sonya. When the end finally came it happened in kind of a POOF! manner that left you sitting there wondering how someone could write a 370 page book and dedicate about 5 pages to wrapping up the plot. It was almost an afterthought!Plot, development, etc., these were lacking, but by FAR the most irritating thing about Greenwood's writing is the bizarre sexuality he forces upon the unwitting reader. I'm a huge fan of adding sexuality to books if it fits, but Greenwood's romantic touch reads like a sledgehammer to the face. Out of the 7 sisters I believe every one except the ghost shoved her tongue in some guy's mouth - almost in those words. Not only was the style grotesque, in the tradition of 14 year old pron, it was completely out of place. All of these super powerful mages happen to be sexy little kittens who can't control themselves even when faced with massive, life-threatening conspiracies? Bah. Anyone who thinks I'm a prude can find me lurking in any number of Hollywood clubs each weekend, so when I say this stuff was out of place, rest assured it's not because I'm uptight. It was simply poor writing."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"This book is a good source of information about the seven sisters if one is not familier to all their dealings. One thing I disliked about this books was that it was somethings confusing in story line. Otherwise I love the book. It kept moving and that is what I like to see happen. This is a good book for anyone wanting to get a little more information about how the 7 work together to get things done."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"Well like many others I have been waiting for the story behind the 7 sisters. The way Ed has brought them together was very well done. The magic battles were fantastic. I found it hard to put down during these parts. But I found the ending incomplete. One minute things are happening and the next it's all over and happily ever after. Where'd they go from there, what happened in Waterdeep, Skulport and Scourburn. Maybe I should be patient and wait for the next installment, which I hope there is one."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I love Greenwood, especially his character creations, but this book is, at times, awkward reading and a bit of a hodge-podge work. If you want to read about the famous Seven Sisters, it's worth it just for that. But as a novel, it's got a weird storyline that jumps from scenario to scenario, passing &quot;the baton&quot; as another reviewer said, from one Sister to the next. The beginning starts off slow, and I nearly gave up on it, but it finally picks up. Greenwood does impart that Realms flavor to the story, and again, the biggest draw is seeing these fantastical characters. Alot of magic and description of spells and gruesome death going on, and sometimes it seems too much. Too many adjectives in one sentence. But, I'm not sorry to have read it, overall, it was enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend this as a first Realms reading, else you might get turned-off to the series. Several cameo appearances by famous Realms folk. Too much at once for someone new to Toril. But, for those who've read Forgotten Realms before, I think it's worth checking out."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"Well, when I saw this at the bookstore, I jumped to buy it. When I found out Qilue of Daughter of the Drow was in it, I was thrilled. However, the rest was fairly bad. The part of Dove's story when she is disguised as a drow is amusing, and I find her drow persona, Iylinvyx Nrel'tabra, the best character in the book. Qilue's story disappointed me, as she is nothing like she seems in DOTD. The Simbul's story was also fairly amusing, but the sisters' indestructablity grates on my nerves. There were some fairly random scenes in this book that, for all I could figure, had nothing to do with the so-called plot. And as for that, I had to dig very hard to find it. There just wasn't much of a rising action. *Shrugs* But, learning about the sisters I didn't know was fun."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"This book keeps you wanting to read more, because no where is there such a complete book on the seven sisters.The book ties itself together nicely, and also has a good ending that wasn't so predictable. You never know where the story will take you next, or who new will show up, and that's why it's lke an awsome adventure.Also some famous Forgotten Realms characters show up here and that's another reason why I like it."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I consider myself a pretty big fan of the Forgotten Realms; novel form only. I have waited for this novel for a long time and quickly snatched it up. Granted, Greenwood is more of a creater than a writer, I have still read all of his novels.There was some good in this. But not much. The Chosen are clearly revered by the writer; especially Storm. It was almost sickening to witness their courageous, sacrificing deeds. Also, I am not entirely squeamish, but the constant onslaught of naked women with their internal organs hanging out was not exactly pleasing. So the Sisters aren't afraid of getting naked: Fine. But the torture, obscenity... it was hard to read. It makes me wonder about the author.And what was all this for? I'm still not sure. Something to do with a dark god and drow and a mad wizard. How they connect is beyond me.I guess I was just expecting more. More of a plot, more evidence of a special gift, more interactions between the Chosen and their pasts and relationships with each other.The magic was well woven, the spells finely crafted. The red wizard showdown was very entertaining. But I still couldn't hide my dissapointment."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"While I really liked many of Ed Greenwood's contributions to the Forgotten Realms, &quot;Silverfall&quot; is the ultimate failure. The whole story - when one can call it a story at all - is implausible from the first to the last word. The charactes have not even the faintest depth. The Seven Sisters are the Chosen of Mystra, and are therefore beings of tremendous power. Each of the sisters usually has her very own personality and her very own motivations, as well as being quite intelligent and sometimes even wise. In &quot;Silverfall&quot; they are simply a bunch of arrogant fools. They are running about without rhyme or reason and rush headlong into every trap and every danger set for them, missing not even a single one. Half of the time they are surviving their arrogance and foolishness only because they are the great and mighty Chosen of Mystra. The other half of the time it's sheer luck and one must wonder if they are secretly also the Chosen of Tymora (the goddess of luck). Why the Seven Sisters must constanly be unclad is also beyond me ... but that's another story. Everyone who &quot;knows&quot; the Seven Sisters from other sources should give this book a wide berth and keep them in mind as they deserve it."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"Although a fantasy novel can never be described as &quot;unrealistic&quot; without evoking much-deserved laughter, I found that the events in this book/anthology went contrary to the Forgotten Realms genre. The seven sisters seemed to lose the individual personalties and depth of character previously established in other works. Here they were nothing more than the seven sisters, each running around saying &quot;yup, I'm a chosen of Mystra.&quot; Further, the events of the book made the characters seem very shallow, two-dimensional and empty. They were more representations of their archetype, not characters. It seemed as if the author was far more interested in writing the book than developing the characters or story. As a big fan of the Forgotten Realms world, I wish that this book had not been written. The author was clearly trying to evoke emotional responses of fear and potential loss (the deaths of the chosen) in inapropriate ways. With or without the power of Mystra, none of the chosen would have lived that long or risen to those levels of power by throwing themselves carelessly into such danger. Mages of such tremendous power and resources would not have come so close to death in that manner. While I have enjoyed many of Ed Greenwood's contributions to the Forgotten Realms universe, this one I consider a dismal failure."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"This is really just a novel, in which each of the seven sisters passes on the baton to the next as part of a connected story. The device is a bit thin, but the book is perfectly readable, and fine as light relaxing fiction. I'd like more, as ever. Greenwood isn't a particularly good writer, but the work is edited competently and flows easily enough. It's no worse than the Elminster stories.The only gripe I had was with the physical format and cost. It's hard to hold so big a volume, and I object to paying extra for something that won't fit on my shelves.But if you like the Forgotten Realms setting, and have liked other Greenwood novels, I think you'll be happy with this one."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"This is the FR book I've been waiting for, thank you very much! The best of the &quot;Chosen&quot; characters in an all-out magical slugfest. Each of the seven gets basically equal treatment and this, unlike the often confusing Elminster books, shows Greenwood really maturing and improving as a writer. The plot is much less confusing, the cast of characters is small enough to make it possible to tell who's who, and the magical combat is second to none. Also, this book is just BEAUTIFUL, with GREAT illustrations. Totally worth the trade paperback price."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I assume that they liked it, since they read the whole book in under two days. I'm not completely familiar with the Forgotten Realms cast of characters, but I am familiar with Ed Greenwood's writing. I'd certainly recommend this."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I managed to read about 15 pages of this book. I dont think I have ever read a worse book. From the start it reads like one of Ed's kids wrote it. (Does E.G. have kids? Dont know its a figure of speech.)"},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"Ed Greenwood gives us the definitive stories to the seven sisters, no matter how differently they are protrayed in other books, after all, Greenwood is the creator of the Forgotten Realms, so there is no arguement there.The storyline is a complicated and carefully constructed plot, but it is not the essential reading for beginners in the Forgotten Reals world, Greenwood sometimes mentions things that needed to be looked up, and also does not explain other things fully. The scenery changes fast and furious, and this could cause some confusion for the not-so-careful reader, it is a book to be studied over. These are some of the reasons why it is not one of Greenwood's best publications.Other than that, the characters are fine themselves, although one or two of the Sisters may seem a little &quot;odd&quot; at first (for example, Sylune and the Simbul.), but the reader quickly adopts to the style of the story and is &quot;assimilated&quot; neatly into it, this I have to give Greenwood credit for.All in all:Readability: 9 out of 10 Style: 10 out of 10 Storyline: 8 out of 10 (a bit corny in some places)"},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I've seen enough hacked up stories by editors to wonder if this doesn't qualify. The story builds up just fine, but doesn't fit at all with the ending. As a matter of fact. You could burn the last 20 pages and not miss the ending at all. What's there is no good. If it was meant to be a big surprise they at least need to put a little foundation in there to support it. And the cover summary isn't even really accurate. It almost feels like someone rewrote the ending and changed up a couple of characters a'la'gatekeeper or something. Wonderful book if you skip the ending, and Ed Greenwood has had some outstanding novels to date. So, for the fan, worth the buy. For someone looking at Greenwood for the first time, go buy Cormyr or even the Elminster stuff."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"Silverfall I have to say ranks right up there with my other favorites such as the Dark Elf Trilogy. If you just sarted to look at Forgotten Realms and have heard of the seven sisters but not read much about them then I suggest you get this book. You will get to see all 7 sisters at their best. If you have seen and read most of the books about Forgotten Realm then you should already have bought this. In simple terms to all this is a most buy."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I wish I'd read most of the reviews here before picking up this book. I wanted more on the relationships between the sisters, but instead we get one or two at a time. It's not a series of short stories, it's one long novel with different points of view (all strikingly similar.)Frankly, I've only read one other Ed Greenwood novel, where Elminster is in Myth Drannor, because I'm nuts for the history of elves. I disliked his portrayal of elves in that novel, and I dislike his portrayal of people in this novel. Isn't there ONE person in the Realms who can look at the Sisters and not think about sex??This does it. From now on, only Elaine Cunningham stories for me."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I have to agree with the Californian; I, too, read only the FR novels, and was ready to jump at the mention of this book, I have been long curious about the history of the Seven Sisters, and I had hoped to get some info in this one. What I wound up with was a waste of $. The whole ''cabal'' was confusing, none of the groups tied in with each other too terribly well (maybe they were each there just to give each Sister a motive. *shrug*), and the motive of whoever was pulling the strings isn't too clear. This seems more like Greenwood had some free time and was doodling, it doesn't run like his other novels, and it is far too predictable.I do like his humor and (previous) writing style, but I'm tired of the nudity -- I want to read sword &amp; sorcery stories, not a porn mag. I would like to read Greenwood's future novels, I've read all of the previous ones, he just needs to put ratings on the chapters. ;-)Lastly, the ending was simply horrendous...Very disappointing novel overall, although I hope that there will be a history of the Seven Sisters in novel form sometime in the future."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"It's a book for those interested in the characters of the seven sisters; otherwise the suspension of disbelief is precarious and a dissapointment awaits at the end. Ed Greenwood has written much better, unfortunately the seven sisters can really only collectively be found in this collection of novellas."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I thought the writing was excellent, classic Greenwood. The story was engaging, the characters vivid. The seven sisters really shine in this work. I had thought from the title and earlier rumors about the book that the history of the sisters would have been explained better. Instead, the book focuses on a modern day (for the Realms) conspiracy. The ending was confusing, since the entire book focused more on how the conspiracy was going than on the sisters. In the beginning they seem to stumble upon an evil group, and by the end we learn this massive effort and all its resources are for one purpose which barely ties in! I won't ruin it, but be warned."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"I'm truly sorry to report this, but this is easily the worst book I have ever read, especially when you consider that I loved all of his other books.

At the beginning I thought Ed was becoming old or something, but as the story went on I started to see more of the old fashion Ed. To those who enjoy stories of the Seven and writings of Ed GreenWood, I recomend this book. The writer was again able to capture the characters very well, although the beginning was little sticky but the closer to the end you go, the more intense it comes. For all fans, I recomend this novel."},{"Title":"Silverfall: Stories of the Seven Sisters","review":"The history of the seven sisters led me to buy this book, and I had high hopes of discovering the mystery, and attraction that surrounds them. The book was a muddled disappointment, and I was just happy to be finished with it. The story immediately grabbed me, but then i am a sucker for the Drow. The thought of Drow infiltrating, and attempting to take over a town through magical guises was original. Sadly the story gets bogged down in too many characters, and an over abundance in the claok-and-dagger. The ending I thought fell flat, and left me very disappointed in the resolution of the story.

Mr. Anderson has assembled a detailed and engaging history of the &quot;pioneer&quot; period (1850-1930) at the South and North rims of the Grand Canyon (and the cliffs, slopes and water in between). The familiar names of trails and canyons are fleshed into the first hardy folks who endeavored to eek a livelihood out of northern Arizona's unforgiving desert canyon. We meet explorers, entrepreneurs and industrialists. Prospectors stake their claims, both legitimate and fraudulent. Mormons seek refuge from the laws of their own home state. Individuals fight their losing tugs-of-war against the Railroad/Concession/Park Service aliance. While treatment of prehistoric and early Spanish events is adequate to set the stage for discussing the later periods, it is not intended to be comprehensive [see On the Edge of Splendor]. This comfortably readable volume has finally clarified for me the preferential treatment of Fred Harvey Enterprises, the unmistakable ambivalence of the National Park Service toward its patrons (visitors), and the puzzling destruction of historic sites and abandonment of remote access roads by the NPS.

The title of the book refers to his first win in the 1969 World Series, pitching (and winning) game 5, crowning the Mets with their first world championship (against the Baltimore Orioles who had FOUR 20-game winners (count 'em, FOUR -- unheard of today) on their pitching staff). Seaver also reiminisces about his infamous \\"Imperfect Game\\" (as he calls it) where he was pitching a perfect game until the ninth innning with one man out, a rookie named Jimmy Qualls came up to bat and hit a clean single, dropping between center and left field, leaving the capacity crowd at Shea Stadium aghast. This game was against the Chicago Cubs, the team the Mets bounced out of first place to end up not only winning their division, but becoming the National League champs (by beating the Atlanta Braves) and later trouncing the Baltimore Orioles. George Thomas Seaver is class act, in both is his professional and personal lives. I am thrilled to say I had the honor to see him pitch many, many times. There will never be another one like him -- he was the first man to get inducted into the Hall of Fame with 100% of the votes in his first year of eligibility. That says everything: his nickname of Tom Terrific wasn't for nothing!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Game: Tom Seaver and the Mets","review":"Tom Seaver is without a doubt the greatest pitcher in New York Mets' history, and the only non-manager to have his number (41) retired by the baseball club. He's currently in his fifth different decade of service with the Amazin's, first as star player and now as broadcaster. In this latter role he's gained a reputation as part All-Star analyst and part bore. This 1970 \\"autobiography\\", part of the Dick Schaap franchise (and Schaap admitted it was his least favorite book) showcases both analyst and bore, often at the same time.\\"The Perfect Game\\" is not about a perfect game, but rather about Game 4 of the 1969 World Series, an extra-innings affair pitched and won by Seaver, which set up the Mets' championship-clinching victory over the overmatched Baltimore Orioles the next day. Seaver was just 25 when the game was played, and in just his third Major League season. There's not a whole lot of biography in here, and so the book is told in alternating sections, both life story, and pitch-by-pitch account of that ballgame. As a baseball fan interested in how pitch sequences are plotted, and how the separate players work as a team on the field to execute plays, and how you strike out Hall-of-Fame slugger Frank Robinson, you will enjoy this book. Even better, the \\"flashbacks\\" are separated by an extra-wide left-hand margin, so they read twice as fast.The best passages in \\"Perfect Game\\" are those about Gil Hodges, Mets manager and, like Seaver, represented by one of the few retired numbers in left field at Shea Stadium. We learn how Hodges managed his young ballclub to a 100-victory season, against 100 to 1 odds. He did it by demanding constant attention to detail, and with shrewd personnel management. His old-school advice (telling the young Seaver that laughing on the mound was \\"unprofessional\\") could be seen as a breath of fresh air in today's ESPN-ized sports atmosphere. It's a considerable loss that Hodges did not get to issue an autobiography of his own."},{"Title":"The Perfect Game: Tom Seaver and the Mets","review":"I purchased this book at a used book store.The book recounts the 1969 season through the eyes of Tom Seaver, pitcher for the New York Mets. It's ironic, in that Tom's perfect game that the title refers to was a one hitter that he pitched against the Cubs on a wonderful July night in the heat of a pennant race. Tom later was to refer to that game as the, \\"imperfect game.\\" This book also had a special meaning for me because my uncle took me to my first Met game on a warm May night in 1969 when i was 14(I've been a baseball fan ever since). The Mets were playing the Padres at Shea. I remember how green the grass was in the infield. I bought a Mets' year book for 50 cents (wish I had kept it in perfect condition because it's worth over a hundred dollars now on the collectibles market). We lost that game 3-2. However, we won the next 11 straight for our first ever winning streak of that length of games and there was no looking back. The Mets played over .500 baseball for the rest of the season. And you all know the rest what happened in October. I followed every game on the TV or on radio which- ever was available. It was a magical season which spoiled us in a way because since that championship we have expected great things from the Mets year after year.Seaver recounts each game that was played during the season, reflecting on his own progress and the Mets as a team. He also recounted his role in the Championship Series as well as the World Series. He lost game one of the World Series but bounced back to win game four thanks to Eddie Watts errant throw that hit the Mets' pinch hitter (no, I don't recall his name) in the elbow. He was the back up catcher for the Mets.For me, personally it was wonderful to see the Mets win it all even though i was not able to see the final two games of the world series on TV due to school. However, i'd like to extend a special thanks to two teachers who gave us updates on the scores for the final two games; the first was my biology teacher, Mr.Kelly - a Joe DiMaggio look-a-like (God rest his soul) and the second was Mr. Blake, my homeroom teacher, who allowed us to listen to the last two innings on a transistor radio during official class at Bushwick H.S. (we had two schedules - am and pm; our official class was held in the afternoon since we went to 12 periods.lol anyway back to the review. Seaver gives a wonderful narrative of his feelings regarding that seasons and his thanks to Gil Hodges, the manager of the team. A very insightful narrative.

This is either a misprint or a shortened version. It should be over 200 pages.\\"It was inconceivable anyone would travel this way for pleasure\\"Howard Mosher has selected 20 articles and assays from scores written by Sigurd Olson; wonderful introduction by Mosher.Olson taught at UW Wisconsin. He then moved to Ely, Minnesota and became Dean at Ely College. He started canoeing the wilderness of the Quetico-Superior territory in the 20's, later becoming a guide. Further on in his life he became a consultant and activist for various institutions. Sigurd read veraciously, such authors as: Thoreau, Whitman, Hemingway, Drummond, Thompson, and Mackenzie. These men helped influence his writings, and I recommend them highly.This book and others like it are particularly dear to my heart, for I have spent countless days in the wilderness of Canada's Quetico Park. I can relate to the spiritual peace that one finds unique only to the Quetico-Boundry Waters area. It is also a test of ones physical and mental self. I wish all could make a trip to this remote land, it changes ones life.Olson tells us of the hardships of these past voyageurs: the portages, the long paddles, the equipment used, the elements, the ghost camps. Beautiful observations: the wildlife, the drawing toward the wilderness, the humor, the scattered Indian tribes, the nuances we miss or never thought of in quite that way.\\"No country can ever be bleak or forbidding if it has once been a part of the love and warmth of those who have shared it with you.\\"Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Christmas 1940","review":"Christmas, 1940 was not a joyous time for most of the world. Britain was under constant air attack. Japan had occupied much of China and seemed poised for further aggression. And though America was at peace, she too would soon be drawn into a brutal world war.In that dark time almost fifty years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote a story for Liberty Magazine about the meaning of Christmas. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland, Christmas 1940 is a tale about the simple, but susyaining faith of one family confronted with the evil force of the oppressor.Elliott Roosevelt writes in his introduction to this story that his mother's message to the downtrodden peoples of the world was \\"Have Faith...have faith and do not despair. Freedom will again be yours.As uplifting as it was in 1940, Eleanor Roosevelt's beautiful, moving story will remind us all once again of the true meaning of Christmas."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"Celeste Bradley does a wonderful job with this book. I could not put it down until I finished it."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"With each story in the Royal Four series, the stories get more intense and incredibly interesting, not to mention the men are the hottest spies you could ever imagine. This is the third in the series after Surrender to a Wicked Spy and To Wed a Scandalous Spy.When the Fox dies, his young widow Julia stuns the remaining Royal Three when she announces she is his sucsessor. Not only that, she advises she has been acting in the Fox's capacity for the past three years of her husband's confinement. Not only is she young but female! Shocked, the three advise her that they will return in three weeks with their decision to accept or reject her position into the Royal Four. Marcus, the Lion's understudy, had always thought the position of the Fox would go to him and when he finds out that Julia wants the position he agrees to go investigate her to see if she is actually worthy of the position.When Marcus arrives he finds that several young fortune hunters have already been circling trying to win the heart of the new widow, but she cleverly announces she has chosen a fiance, the dandy Elliot. Marcus cannot believe the woman he was so ready to believe a swindler, is so warm and loving and before long he is losing his heart to her for real. When her estate is viciously attacked, he works at her side to set things in order. He starts seeing the strength and character in Julia and wonders if she wouldn't make a great Fox. When he finds a box full of diaries with her wildest sexual fantasies inside, he uses them to get close to Julia and move Elliot out of the way. Julia can't fight the feelings she has for Marcus, she knows her life has to be for the Fox, but can't she this once have a little passion in her life. Soon secrets are revealed that can destroy their relationship and finally decide the fate of the FOX.This book was awesome. My review may tell a lot about the story but I didn't give away the details and surprises in the story that make it an exceptional book. As always in her stories, the hero and heroine have phenominal chemistry and you can feel the sensuality long before either one acts on their feelings. Make sure you have time when you start reading this one because you won't be able to put it down. I cannot wait to read the fourth book, Seducing the Spy!"},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four)by Celeste Bradley was a great mystery romance novel. I had attempted to read this novel before reading the previous novels - it made more since the second time. Lady Julia husband has died and she announces the Royal Four that she is one of them 'The Fox.' They send Marcus to research Lady Julia but he finds himself falling for the her. In the middle of the chaos a murder (Chimera) is trying to destroy Julia Chimera. Great character and great twist I am glad I gave it a second look. Off to find the next Royal Four book - Seducing the Spy."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"Celeste Bradley creates unforgettable characters and wonderful plots, and yes, great love scenes, which I'm sure isn't a comfortable process for an author. Marcus is a wonderful hero (spy)in this book (in his secondary role in Dane's story, he was rather meak and almost a fop, in my opinion) but here he is all man, handsome, funny and romantic. Just a great story. Julia was great, although I thought her visit to Clara should have been done differently. There was no reason Julia had to enter Clara's house as she did, but I'll admit, I loved the way Dalton came to his wife's aid - in his usual romantic way.As usual, the addition of the other Royal Four members was wonderful; the author keeps their unique personalities in perspective. As I said, only Marcus Ramsay seemed different in his own story (a good thing) than he did in Dane's."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"Of the three books (so far) in Celeste Bradley's The Royal Four series, \\"One Night With a Spy\\" definitely had the best storyline. Unfortunately, for me, it also suffered from the some over the top supposed erotic and love making scenes and rather lurid prose. What on earth had happened to the old days when a vital plot, rather than imaginative erotic scenes, was the order of the day?For years, Lady Julia Barrowby had been helping her husband, the elderly and ailing Lord Barrowby, with his work. Lord Barrowby was a member of the Royal Four, a group of noblemen-spies, sworn to defend the Crown. But now Lord Barrowby is dead, and because he had trained Julia as his apprentice and because she had been doing his work for him all throughout his ailment, Julia believes that she has earned the right to be considered as her dead husband's natural replacement. The trouble is that the remaining members of the Royal Four already have a replacement in mind for her husband, Marcus Ramsay, and they are somewhat reluctant to consider her in Marcus' stead. Julia is determined to claim her rightful place, and to make these stubborn men see sense. The last thing she expected though was that they would send Marcus to spy on her incognito. Or that the devastatingly handsome Marcus would slip under her guard, win her heart, learn her secrets and use them against her...I couldn't write a love making scene to save my life, and so have always steered clear of offering any kid of criticism of those who obviously know that they're doing. But when one starts skimming over a good chunk of the book because the prose style makes one snigger, than you know something is not quite right -- the prose style was just too lurid! Also, because I had not really enjoyed the last few Celeste Bradley's novels --they just weren't of the same caliber as her first two, \\"The Pretender\\" & \\"The Impostor,\\" I was pleased to note that \\"One Night With a Spy\\" offered much of what I had appreciated in her first two novels -- a wonderfully compelling and absorbing plot, with a nice dollop of romance, sensuality and humour mixed in. I liked that the heroine, Julia, was intelligent, competent and determined; and that the hero, Marcus, conceded after a while that she was better at her job than he ever would be, and that he had acted in a truly shabby manner. All in all, there is much to recommend; and if only the prose style had been less overblown, this would have been a truly stellar read."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"As a reader, I have always approached this genre as my brain chocolate; wonderful for the soul, not to be considered nutritious. When I want an amazing ride through never-never land, I read Celeste Bradley. Her Liars and Royal Four series is always packed with great adventure and plot but *most* importantly, very seductive love scenes.I think this is the most seductive book in her Royal Four series. I won't go into the plot line, since you can read it here on the page and every other review gives you more than enough information. I will just say this, what is sexier (or more betraying) than having a handsome man read about your deepest desires and then be willing to act them out upon you?"},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"The herorine did not prove that she was spy material.

I probably should not have read the series out of order but I am not sure it would have made a difference.I don't mind erotic prose but it did seem a bit out of place and almost too pornagraphic on the first two pages of the text. This kind of prose tends to occur after a few chapters (and character introductions) but I am sure it helps sell books with it so early on.I did not love the \\"hero\\" considering in the beginning he was pretty anti-female and then later after a few days of passion he then turns on the \\"heroine\\" for selfish gain. He then feels guilty but it is too late for me to really like him."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"In 1810 twenty year old Lady Julia Barrowby is despondent when her beloved spouse septuagenarian Aldus collapses as she owes her life to him and his protection. She insures his time over the next few years is comfortable.In 1813, Aldus dies, but to the chagrin of his Royal Four mates, he as the Fox never trained an apprentice to become the Fox. Cobra, Lion, and Falcon and the Prime Minister travel to Barrowby concerned as the Royal Four has always been there to protect England from outside agents. At Barrowby, the widow Julia claims she is the Fox and has been for over three years. The Lion's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Marcus Ramsay is sent undercover to learn the truth. Marcus, expecting a gold-digger, reads her secret diary and decides to use her desires against her. Instead he finds himself falling in love with the \\"Vixen\\", who he realizes is better as the clever Fox than he is while an enemy of the state from her past plans to take advantage of a mere female.The third book in the Royal Four series (see SURRENDER TO A WICKED SPY and TO WED A SCANDALOUS SPY) is a terrific gender bending entry starring a strong woman who believes her deeds prove a female can be a contributing member. The key to this fine Regency romantic suspense is the change in Marcus; initially he assumes that his female rival is cotton candy of an old man, but as he falls in love he begins to realize Julia is better at the job than he is and not only wants to be her spouse and lover, but also her student. Readers will enjoy this strong entry in an exhilarating series with the climax to come.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"This third entry in the Royal Four series, about four powerful secret lifetime advisors to the king, focuses on the one code-named the \\"Fox.\\" The previous Fox, the elderly Lord Barrowby, has just died, seemingly without having trained a successor. The other three rush to his country estate, where they are surprised to learn that Lord Barrowby trained his beautiful young widow, Julia, to succeed him as the Fox. She informs them that she has, in fact, been performing that role for the past three years while Lord Barrowby was incapacitated. The three men are taken aback by the idea of a woman in their group, and besides they do not trust Julia, so they ask for a few weeks to consider the matter, promising to return. They head straight to Marcus Ramsay, Lord Dryden, who is apprenticing to a youthful member of the Four, so he has a long wait. They tell the ambitious Marcus that he can instead take over the Fox's spot, if he can find some way to discredit Julia or prove her ineligible for the post.Marcus arrives at Barrowby under an assumed name, pretending to be a suitor looking for a wealthy bride. There is already a healthy competition underway for Julia's hand. Julia believes that, as the all-powerful Fox, she would do best to find a weak and compliant husband, so she does not at first view the virile and opinionated Marcus as marriage material. However, as time passes and she sees and experiences more of him - he even invades her dreams - the sexually starved Julia, who had an almost platonic relationship with her late husband, begins to reconsider her criteria in a mate. Also, someone has begun to ruthlessly sabotage her estate, putting lives at risk. This brings into stark relief Julia's need for a strong man like Marcus whom she can confide in. Marcus, who set out to gain her confidence in order to destroy her, is now within sight of achieving his goal, but he has grown quite attached to Julia. Will he obliterate his competition, or will he surrender to her?This story is a little slow to get going, with humorous elements such as the privy calamity tending to overwhelm the first half of the story. The action picks up in the second half when Marcus becomes conflicted about his objectives. It is nice to see the fiercely competitive, cocksure, and somewhat chauvinistic Marcus humbled by kind-hearted and capable Julia. The love scenes could use more warmth, though, and seem mostly physical, without a strong emotional connection. Also, the inclusion of so many passages from Julia's diary is a little distracting. However, Julia is an appealing and sympathetic heroine who shows admirable strength in adversity, and I enjoyed her and Marcus' funny asides. The conclusion was exciting and gratifying."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"Great series good book. I am happy to see a female heroine truly take center stage in one of these books."},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"Of all the Royal Four books so far - this one has been my favorite (but I have a feeling I will love the next one due out in August). In my opinion - the Royal 4 books still aren't as addictive as the Liar's club books - and I love the tension between the two clubs that runs throughout both series. :)Characters: Great tension between Marcus and Elliot (who is also a great supporting character and could be a future hero if CB wants to write more). Throughout the novel we see writings of Julia's own romance story that she develops as a means of \\"escape\\" from her past. Julia is very smart, but of all Celeste Bradley heroines - she stands out as the most emotional and dramatic one I can remember - (and she has a pet lion!!!)Once again - as far as revisiting characters is concerned - Celeste Bradley does a fantastic job! (Dalton from book 2 in Liar's club! *drooool*) And I'm more excited than ever for Wyndham's book (the Falcon) to be released in the late summer. In fact of all the Royal 4, his character has seemed the most mysterious and observant, and I can't wait to see him fall in love and go mad w/ desire!Plot: The flirting scene at the lake is my favorite! I was also surprised that Celeste Bradley even had another important running character throughout her series attacked in this one - great drama enhancer!As far as the romance itself was concerned - yeah, it felt prosey sometimes but compared to the other royal 4 books - this one is steamier.Final Grade: A- (if you're trying to follow along the running story line for the Liar's club books - this one's important.)"},{"Title":"One Night with a Spy (Royal Four, Book 3)","review":"I really have enjoyed this series.

Anyway, The plotline stayed true to the rest of the books in the series. The leading female role went to a hard-headed, strong young woman and the male role was for a \\"man among boys\\" kind of guy. Marcus previously had a role as Dane's apprentice for the Lion in the second book of the series and this novel is all about his quest for power and accidentally encountering love. The Chimera rears his ugly head--with a completely unforseen twist! A few of the plot elements boardered on the edge of unbelieveable (you'll see exactly what I mean when you read it), but overall it was very well-written.

B. has provided a fine read with graceful and interesting phrasing. Her descriptions are easy and vivid, and having a minimap at the start of each chapter is just plain clever..and useful. She invites us to come with her and follow Paul on his journeys; she points out events with enough space to allow the reader into the situations; she offers up without lecturing. What more could you want? No verbosity-no bombastics-but an emotionally rich telling of a fabulously interesting and crucial time and transition in human existence. The book is a brilliant rendering to match the subject she set out to cover. I liked it most of all for its loving manner corresponding to the loving communication of Paul. Highly recommended, and a book you can easily finish in a short time but may want to reread/refer back to. Not a text on the subject, however."},{"Title":"Paul","review":"I received this book as a gift and just finished it.This book about the early Christian leader, writer, and preacher takes a different approach than most biographies, leaning much more to a narrative-style glimpse of Paul: The Man. In many ways this produces a much more readable biography. For instance, the author writes \\"Paul came to Ephesus with the fall rains,\\" instead of couching her phrasing with \\"probably\\" or \\"it is thought that...\\" This makes the book much better for those who either know little about Paul to begin with, or those who would rather not wrestle with a dry, scholarly book on Paul which is easy to put down.Of course, when adopting a narrative style such as Buckmaster has done, one opens up oneself to criticism that the work is full of misstatements and speculation. We have no idea what Paul might have been feeling or what he was thinking about at various points in his life, and some of Buckmaster's prose does seem to plant ideas or concepts which, while plausible, are clearly speculative. In addition to this difficulty, the list of scholarly sources on which Buckmaster relies are probably outdated (pre-1962). While I'm no Bible scholar, I would venture to guess there are sources written since then which shed new light on this subject.Prospective readers should be also be aware that while the author is not evangelical at all, it is clear that the book is written from a Christian perspective. I don't expect this to ruffle any feathers (it is about Paul, after all), but perhaps readers should know that this book is not chronicling the Paul of history, but the Paul of Faith.I think this book is good, especially for readers who want to know more about Paul without wanting to pore over a boring, stale biography, and are willing to accept a little Christian speculation."},{"Title":"Scooby-Doo! and the Halloween Hotel Haunt: A Glow in the Dark Mystery!","review":"My son is an avid reader of all Scooby-Doo books.

It is intricately constructed; in fact, the author appears to have been so enamored of complexity in intertwined plots that he makes the reading labored at some points, the characters suffer from lack of dimensionality, and the narrative suffers from repeated structure, especially with the continuing trials and tribulations set forth by kidnappers and assassins.Mccann clearly has researched history and literature in attempting to reconstruct a gothic sensation novel. He provides almost an excess of period detail and the setting seems to take precedence over character development. The protagonist clearly suffers within a web of intrigue but for all his speculation and effort the reader does not \\"get into\\" his feelings as much as his thoughts. The villains are hateful and approach a \\"mustache-twirling\\" quality. The remaining characters are vague and ill-defined, perhaps victims of the author's intention to have virtually everyone in the book a suspect for wrong-doing. The most serious consequence of this character vagueness is that the resolution of the last peril episode is inadequately explained, for it hinges on a critical change in attitude by one of the major players. The author's cleverness becomes problematic too when, in his sweeping attempt to make this epic cover many years and locales, the plethora of characters are called at some times by their first names, at others by their last names, at still others by nicknames, and some even have assumed monickers in addition! The mystery thus takes on a confusing and frustrating quality.The perils that befall the protagonists have the feel of serials publishing like Dickens and filmed entertainment like Saturday matinees and soap operas. By sheer number the adventures become repetitious and at times strain credibility. Also, particularly in the second quarter of the book, the perils were so sordid and revolting that I felt a sadist for continuing to read. Mccann provides occasional relief from this when he has Scooby make mention of a future thought, reassuring that the current nightmare is survived. Of course, the ultimate fate of the main character (Scooby Doo) is ensured by the narrative structure of the book (first person) and so it is the supporting characters (Shaggy, Scrappy, Velma, Freddy, et al.) for whom we must be most uncertain and fearful, to the extent that our emotional investment allows. I felt the book resolved the mysteries and the events came together in the last few pages in a most satisfying way, with characters behaving with the ambivalence and uncertainty one would expect after such torturous experiences. This novel is absolutely a tour de force in research, plotting, pace, and intricacy. Its weaknesses in character development and human insight prevent it from achieving the depth of a Dickens or Bronte novel. It is more on a par, perhaps, with a Radcliffe."},{"Title":"Scooby-Doo! and the Halloween Hotel Haunt: A Glow in the Dark Mystery!","review":"To my 7 year old and I, the device of \\"seeing the ghosts\\" detracted from the storyline immensely.

At least, as far as current events go. The players, coaches, front office people and the owner are all long gone, either retired or deceased.However, it is still worth reading as a history book. You can learn a lot about the workings of the Red Sox, and read some of the stories that today's Sox fan may not have heard before. Most fans know that Boston may have had first crack at Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays, and those tales are relayed again here. But others, like the racism of the scouting department, or the way in which prospects advanced through the system, were new to me.I would say this book would interest only the diehard Red Sox fan, or a serious fan of baseball history in general. Others are likely to lose interest fairly quickly."},{"Title":"What's the matter with the Red Sox?","review":"Humorous and ironic. A book that perfectly captured the Red Sox up to the 1972 season. It lists numerous contributing factors on how the Red Sox have through the good old boy network, bad choices, and just plain mismanagement took themselves out of contention, and have contributed to our long suffering."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"In 1140, everyone suffers from the bloody Civil War between the supporters of King Stephen and those of the Empress Mathilda. The countryside is filled with heinous crimes, as Oliver Pascal will soon learn when he comes across the raped and battered body of a friend, Lady Amice, who soon dies. Oliver escorts Amice's ten-year old son Richard and her maid Catrin to a relative, Earl Robert in BristolCatrin tries to protect Richard, who she sees as more of a son than a burden. She also feels obligated to Oliver for rescuing them even though she loathes the concept of depending on any male. Still she begins to fall in love with him and he reciprocates those feelings. As Oliver tries to regain his lost lands, he marries Catrin, not knowing that their relationship stands in jeopardy due to external forces having a different agenda.THE LOVE KNOT is a well written according-to-the-book, medieval romance. Sub-genre fans will enjoy the interesting story line that places honor and love in peril though the swing between present and past vernacular is a bit disconcerting. The lead characters are wonderful champions and Robert adds much depth to the tale. Elizabeth Chadwick writes a fine tale that her fans will enjoy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"I wouldn't say that \\"The Love Knot\\" is the best of Elizabeth Chadwick's books that I've read (that will always be \\"Daughter's of the Grail\\") but it is second best, and thus, being written by Elizabeth Chadwick, it is very good indeed.This takes place during the English Civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda (with her son Henry Plantagenet) and follows supporters of Matilda's cause over a period of about 14 years. Oliver is a man just home from the Crusades, where he made a pilgrimage in honor of his young wife who died in childbirth. Once home he finds that King Stephen has stolen his family lands, and signs on with the Empress Matilda so he can get them back. On a journey to Bristol to get orders he comes across a burned down country-house where he grew up, with one almost dead woman he grew up with, her young son, and his nurse. The nurses' name is Catrin.Catrin and the dead woman's son (who happens to be the bastard son of the old king) Richard, are taken by Oliver to Bristol. Naturally, we have a love connection between Oliver and Catrin, both of whom are raw and damaged by the deaths of their spouses. Catrin also starts to learn the trade of a midwife, and thus we are taught a great deal about childbirth and healing in the middle ages (it wasn't pretty.) Reading this part of the book will make you glad that you we born in the 20th (or 21st) century and have access to modern medical care and good birth control!Then something happens in Catrin's life which changes everything, allegiances, love and both her and Oliver's lives. But still they are bound by the love knot that Ethyl, the midwife who raised Oliver and taught Catrin, made for them.As always, if it's by Elizabeth Chadwick you are guaranteed a good read. This is one of her more romantic and less biographical novels, comparable best probably to \\"The Marsh King's Daughter.\\" If you like romance, medical history, action adventure and good twisted plot you'll like this book. I do agree at time the characters are a little stereotypical, but it's not enough to detract from the overall novel.Five stars."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"Pro's - the description of the surrounding is good, makes you feel like you are in medieval times.Con's - the behavior of the characters, practically 21st century (when the heroine leaves her 3 year old twins and 10 year old daughter at home, she first finds someone to watch over them...)Characters are VERY flat. Almost politically correct. Which is a shame as there was real potential there..."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"Even Chadwick's second best novels are a cut above much of the historical fiction genre.This is one of her earlier books and more of a historical romance than true historical fiction, the main characters being fictional. This is the second time I've read the book, in between I had read SKP'sWhen Christ and His Saints Sleptabout England's civil war. Having a better understanding of that complicated period made this novel much more enjoyable than the first time.I don't understand a previous reviewer's comment about Wicca, I didn't get that in the book at all -- all I read was that Catrin became an experienced midwife and herbalist. All in all a very nice story, Catrin was stubborn to a fault, Oliver steadfast and honorable, a truly evil villain and a surprise return from the past of someone long thought dead."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"While most historical romances make the Middle Ages almost TOO perfect, I liked the fact that the Love Knot didn't. It portrayed a knight that wasn't always shining and a lady who wasn't always dressed her very best and making great heartfelt choices. The hearth knight was a poor knight, who didn't have his own castle to live in. I really felt I was dropped in the Middle Ages without all the glamour, just the plain truth. They reminded me of everyday people. Thank you Ms. Chadwick!"},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"This was the second book of Ms. Chadwick's that I had the pleasure to read, and it surpassed the first one by far. The characters had the depth that is sometimes lacking in historical novels, everything was brought vividly to life, from the danger of childbirth in the middle ages to the romance between the characters.An excellent curl up in your favourite armchair book."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"I enjoyed this, tho I found it a bit predictable. It was an entertaining tale involving the war of Stephen and Matilda, midwifery, superstitions, and knights. Oh, and let's not forget romance. The main character is Catrin who has been widowed for three years (or so she thinks) and after being caught in the middle of the Stephen and Matilda war in England, 1140, she barely escapes with her life from an evil band of raping, pillaging merceneries. She meets and falls in love with a knight that is fighting on the Empress's side. Not willing to be dependent on a man and not satisfied sitting in a castle listening to gossip, Catrin learns the healing arts and midwife trade. Just when she is about to marry her knight, Oliver, she runs into her presumed dead husband, Louis. Louis had staged his death previously and now holds Oliver's life in his hands, as Louis is fighting for Stephen and has captured Oliver and his men. While the country is divided between Stephen and Matilda, Catrin's heart is divided between her long lost husband and the fond memories he comes with and her new love for Oliver.Catrin makes a difficult choice and it turns out to be the wrong one. Will she be able to correct her mistake and find happiness with the right man? The drama enfolds in between battles for the crown. Readers not only get a romantic tale and an intriguing love triangle, but details about the long Empress Matilda vs Stephen feud.Four stars instead of five because there were some areas where it seemed to drag on more than it should and it was a bit predictable. As always tho, Chadwick writes with much attention to detail and adds just enough true history to awe, but not bore."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"Continuing on my endevours to read all of Elizabeth Chadwick's novels this year, the October selection was The Love Knot. Set during the years of the Civil War between Stephan and Matilda, rival claimants for the English crown, what had once been a thriving, peaceful land is quickly disintegrating into chaos. Now there are roving bands of mercenaries and troops, wandering the land and laying waste to any small manors or lands, and leaving misery behind.For one knight, Sir Oliver Pascal, newly returned from making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, it's a heartbreaking return. In a ruined estate, he finds a woman who has been badly abused and dying from miscarriage. Worst still, he knows her - she was Amice, the sister of his wife, and the mother of one of Old King Henry's many illegitimate children. Dying, she begs him to take her son Richard to one of the few noblemen still loyal to the Old King's daughter, Matilda. Saddened, Oliver agrees to take the boy, along with Richard's nurse, the lovely Catrin.Catrin has seen her own measure of misery. She was left widowed and alone when her husband drowned in an accident. A fortunate encounter with Amice has given her a home for a time, but now this is gone, knowing that young Richard won't be needing her once he enters a noble household. She doesn't have many choices open to her, without a wealthy family or husband to help. When the small party reaches the port city of Bristol, they are all welcomed into the household of Earl Robert. Sir Oliver will return to his duties as one of the Earl's knights, Richard will train to be a warrior, and Catrin becomes one of the Countess's waiting women. It's stability for now, but Catrin soon finds the closed up world of the women not to her liking, filled mostly with backbiting and gossip.But all of that will change for her when she meets Ethel. Ethel is the local midwife, an aging woman with plenty of good common sense, and a vast knowledge of herbal medicine. She and Catrin soon become friends, and Catrin starts to learn to be a midwife, and quickly becomes a very good one. Too, a budding romance is quickly growing between her and Sir Oliver, even though she knows that he is a landless knight and unlikely to provide her with a life of wealth or ease. And Oliver has seen plenty of heartache in his life, especially when his beloved wife Emma died in childbirth, a memory that sent him off to seek oblivion in war, and now is fearful that love will be just as disappointing as before. But the pair do learn to trust one another, and tentatively agree to marry just as Oliver is about to leave for battle on behalf of Empress Matilda.But the story is about to take a dreadful turn that will test Oliver and Catrin's love for each other. Oliver turns up missing after a battle, and Catrin sets off to find him, determined to ransom him and bring him back with her. What she didn't count on was finding out that her husband - the one that she had thought had drowned - is very much alive, and not about to let her leave him, dangling a devilish deal in front of her that will put her convictions and loyalty to the test...One of the things that I like so much about Elizabeth Chadwick's writing is that not only can she create a believable world for her characters, but also make those characters be people whom you can actually care about. In the hands of a lesser writer, Oliver would have been a two-dimensional sort, think of Tom Cruise in armor, say, and Catrin would have had some sort of psychic ability to let her 'heal' people without benefit of actual knowledge. Instead, thankfully, Ms. Chadwick makes them very human, with all of the emotional baggage that entails. Both of them are people who have doubts - just look at Oliver's fears of losing a woman he loves to the dangers of pregnancy and birth - or at Catrin's having to choose between two men that she does care about, with all of the moral dilemmas that it brings.And that's another fine point with Ms. Chadwick's style that I enjoy very much. Usually in most historical novels, especially those where the relationship is the central point of the story, religion is either ignored, or the reader is treated to some sort of 'hidden' forbidden variety of paganism. This tends to be really rife when a character is a healer of some sort, with every sort of half-baked idea of modern witchcraft pasted on top for good measure. But Ms. Chadwick is smart enough not to insult her readers with this sort of twaddle. She manages to get inside of her character's heads, and keeps them firmly in the time and place that they inhabit.Finally, her stories are terrific blends of historical figures that actually lived, fictional characters that feel like real people, and all sorts of little details about medieval life and lore. Her knowledge of the times feels right, and she knows what happens when and skillfully blends it into her stories. Despite the cover, don't be mistaken that these are those historical romances that get churned out regularly - these are straight up historical novels, with enough action and adventure with a healthy dollop of romance to keep anyone entertained.Four very strong stars for this one. Happily recommended."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"Absolute best book ever written!! So much depth and plot tied together. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"The Love Knot is the story of two young lovers, set during the civil war between Stephen and Matilda. Oliver de Pascal is knight just returned from pilgrimage, who rescues the widow Catrin from a village destroyed by raiders. A romance develops between them, but \\"forces beyond their control\\" cleave them apart, helped in part by a difficult decision that Catrin must make. Years later, after war has devastated England, they are drawn back together. The ending is a bit predictable, but it's the getting there that's the fun part.Elizabeth Chadwick's novels, at least her earlier ones, are a little formulaic. Of course there's the romance aspect, and there's a bad guy who's usually a mercenary soldier. Throw in lots of historical detail and famous persons from the period, and that's usually what you'll get. But despite the predictability of Chadwick's plots, her novels are always detailed in terms of history--be prepared to learn a lot about the 12th century. I do love medieval history, and it's novels like The Love Knot that enhance my interest in that fascinating time period. It's a very real novel that explores both the good and bad bits of medieval life.Another thing I enjoyed about this book was the characters--they're very three-dimensional, coming as they do with lots of emotional stuff that they must work out in order for the story to come to its resolution. Don't be put off by the fact that Catrin is a midwife and healer--as written by a less skillful author, this could have become a clich&eacute;, but Chadwick manages to make Catrin and her healing knowledge believable. This novel is largely about choices, and how the choices one makes can significantly alter one's life--as Catrin's choice does to her and Oliver. The Love Knot isn't my favorite Elizabeth Chadwick book (I thought the way that Catrin and Oliver came back together was a bit too sudden), but I did enjoy this book nonetheless (incidentally, Elizabeth Cahdwick's books are also good comfort reads--The Love Knot was the perfect book for me to read while I had a cold)."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"Whilst some of the period detail is well researched I found the plot predicatble in the extreme. The characters very one dimensional, so much so they might have said &quot;Hello, I'm the evil villan&quot;, &quot;Hello, I'm the handsome hero&quot; and so on.As the heroine is supposed to be a herbalist and healer being taught by a &quot;witch&quot;, why didn't Chadwick do research into medieval witchcraft? She appears to have read a Wicca 101 book and taken that as historically accurate. A Saxon (yes, SAXON) witch babbling about the Maid, Mother and Crone? Come ON, you don't even have to do a LOT of research to be able to tell the difference between Saxon beliefs and modern Wicca!!!Very poor as far as I got (and that wasn't very far)."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"The Love Knot begins with the pillage of a small village and the rape of a woman now on the verge of death. Oliver Pascal finds his dead wife's cousin lying in agony having been raped multiple times by soldiers of King Stephen's army...and so the tale of tragedy and the struggle for true love begins.The Love Knot is the story of Oliver and Catrin, bound together by the perils of war and the fear of death during child-birth. Oliver is a knight still grieving the three year loss of his wife who died in child birth. Catrin is a servant-woman whose life is uncertain at the beginning of the story. She too is grieving for her dead husband.Oliver rescues Catrin and the son of her mistress, who is also one of the many bastard sons of the late King Henry. Oliver vows to keep the two of them safe and takes them to Bristol, home of the Earl of Glouscester. There Catrin befriends Oliver's relative, Elthel, a mid-wife and healer. Ethel soon teaches Catrin all she knows, earning herself a reputation as a good mid-wife.During all this, Oliver and Catrin fall in love, only to have their devotion for each other tested when Catrin's long-dead husband turns out to be alive.This story is sad and heart wrenching throughout, as was life in the 12th century. Reading this book brought me back to that time, a time of tragedy, not just in war but also with true love. It was like taking a journey through time and I was absorbed in it. It read very easily and was exciting and beautiful. I highly recommend this book to all who feel like getting caught up in passion, romance and ultimate scandal...not to mention a good battle between heroic knights!"},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"Much of Elizabeth Chadwick's research is carried out as a member of Regia Anglorum, this is an early medieval re-enactment society. Her writing in recent books has become much more accomplished. She now writes about the period with the convictions of her obvious knowledge of the subject and has also made a subtle change from writing what were in effect historical love stories (nothing wrong with that) to historical novels with a love interest.The book is set in 1140 and England has not settled down to life under the Normans. It is over 70 years since the bastard Duke William set foot on English soil, but hatred is still simmering in English hearts and this hatred breeds unrest and civil war. Oliver Pascal chances on a village raided by mercenaries and rescues the survivors. One of them, an orphaned boy is the illegitimate son of the old king and his mother's maid, a young widow call Catrin.Oliver escorts them to Bristol Castle and they are accepted into the household of Robert of Gloucester. Catrin finds herself falling for Oliver, but she is bored with the frivolity of court life and when Etheldreda the old midwife offers to teach her the secrets of her ancient art, Catrin jumps at the chance. But the midwife's life is fraught with danger, not least in the appearance of two men who threaten the couples lives . . .The author's style is slowly changing, to my way of thinking for the better, but what does remain constant is her knowledge of the period about which she writes and her ability to draw the reader into the story, until they could almost be there. This is a rare talent indeed."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"This story centers around Oliver Pascal, who returns home from a pilgrimage in the Holy Land, only to find that he has lost his lands to Flemish Mercenaries, in the pay of King Stephen of England.

He rescues Catrin from a razed village and brings her and young Richard, illegitmate royal son and half-brother to Robert of Gloucester, to Bristol. He and Catrin eventually fall in love, lose each other and come back together in time. But not before they undergo many adventures during the turbulent times of Prince Henry II and King Stephen. This was a wonderful story, and I couldn't wait to read it at every opportunity. It portrays not only what life was like for the nobles but also for the common people in great, descriptive detail.

If you like/love medieval stories, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"I won't go into detail about the plot since other reviewers have already done a good job with the recap. As always, Elizabeth Chadwick does a great job illustrating the early turbulent period in the English history. However, where I felt let down was the underlying plot relating to Oliver and Catrin. Maybe it was the author's attempt to not be lumped into the history romance category, but I felt the sudden resurrection of the long-dead husband was a red herring thrown in to create a non-existent conflict. For Catrin, who otherwise is strong and intelligent, to make such a stupid choice based on adolescent feelings was out of character. Also, regardless of his being her husband, it felt wrong to have her succumb to his seduction so immediately after years of absence, especially coming on the heels of her supposed devotion to Oliver. The rich history setting made up somewhat for this misstep."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"(Read this in 2010) First off, I'm not super-psyched about medieval tales, whether it's HF or romance. If it's about royalty or at least has a significant dollop (like 50%+) of war and/or politics with razor-sharp characters, I'm OK with it. (I don't even mind really OTT bodice rippers since I find that stuff interesting in itself.) But leisurely pastorals are not my thing, nor in-depth detail about the daily life of the mid-level classes or peasantry. This book has a lady's maid as a protagonist and is heavy on midwifery and pregnancy. Probably not the best book for someone who loathes children. So when I started to read it, and it became clear what direction it was going in, the going got a lot tougher. But the author comes highly praised by lots of folk, so I figured that I was missing something or that things would get a lot better. Eventually.This was a bland and predictable romance with a rather cranky heroine who wore on the nerves early on, and her subsequent stupidity did little to alleviate the irritation. The few major plot points were obvious from a long way off. (Randal de Mohun? Hullo! And might I add, \\"Duh, Catrin, you stupid bint.\\") I ended up skimming most of it after the first 100 pages failed to ignite interest. Worse yet, like Twilight, I found myself dreading picking it up again after setting it down for an hour or two because the next slog was worse than the last. I was surprised that, even skimming it at a brisk gallop, I knew exactly what was going on to whom. The composition was a bit herky-jerky, with odd little chapter-capping \\"...and meanwhile, in {someplace}\\" paragraphs about what was happening with one of the secondary characters in an effort to keep it all neat and tidy before moving on. Too many scenes focused around midwifery and herbal craft - it became dull after awhile as the same information and details were regurgitated with only another new detail added.Given all the praise surrounding this author, I was honestly expecting something good, even from her secondary tier of works. Chalk Chadwick up alongside Stephen King, Laura Kinsale, and David Gemmell as Hyped-Yet-Disappointing Authors.ETA (4/25/11): I learned today that the author uses the \\"Akashic Records\\" aka psychic channeling of a vast intergalactic library of human experience on the atomic level to get details (which are then verified, of course!) for her books. I wasn't impressed with the two books of hers I'd read before on other grounds. This new bit of knowledge pretty much put the nail in the coffin of me ever bothering to pick up another book by this author again. I'm skeptical enough so that I couldn't look at it as the serious HF I'm told it is. If I ever discover that Colleen McCullough consulted a psychic with a special library card and translator goggles in order to make Republican Rome so vivid and her characters so unforgettable, I'll eat my dirty socks and post it on Youtube.But I appreciate that Chadwick is upfront about her unorthodox research methods. Because some readers like being informed about such things in order to make better decisions about what they choose to spend time/money on."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"I found this book to be a very good read. It has all of the things you want in a book. I liked the main characters a lot. It makes you feel your right in there seeing it all happen.

LOL I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about knights and survival of the fittest or smartest."},{"Title":"The Love Knot","review":"England, 1140-1153. Oliver Pascal returns to an England full of chaos. A civil war had broken while away on a pilgrimage, leaving his country in death and pain. He and his friend find a young woman on the brink of death. Young Amice had been someone he admired before he married another, and now she is with child and in danger of losing her life. It is there where he meets Catrin and Richard. Richard is a one of many bastard royal sons and Catrin is his nurse. Feelings emerge between Oliver and Catrin, but the conflict between King Stephen and Empress Mathilda tears them apart. Not only that, but Catrin's husband, once presumed dead, is back in her life. Heartbreak and struggles ensue. Will Oliver and Catrin ever be together? Even if they are apart, the love knot that binds them together cannot be untied...Historical references, star-crossed lovers, political intrigue... It's all here folks! Then again, you come to expect that from Elizabeth Chadwick. Hers is a voice that cannot be ignored, and the historical accuracy in her novels leave you turning the pages, eager to know how everything unfolds. Yet her language is quite modern. But rather than making the story sound anachronistic, it serves more like a translation of the way people spoke at the time. Believe me, you won't be thrown off. What attracted me to The Love Knot is that this isn't as biographical as most of her other works. I admit that I don't possess a great deal of knowledge on this particular era (I do know about the fashions, languages, and mores though), but at least I don't have to guess if the protagonists are real-life characters or not. Not that I mind the biographical novels. William Marshal is one of my favorite real-life figures, but my ignorance in anything before the sixteenth century keeps me from enjoying those to the full. This is also one of the most depressing stories I have read. All of the things the protagonists have to overcome are heart wrenching. The Conquest and The Marsh King's Daughter, my favorites so far, are more or less that way too. The backdrop of the conflict is, of course, wonderful. I don't know a great deal about this particular Civil War, but Chadwick's wonderful writing helped me fill in some blanks. Anyway, I very much loved this book. It made for a rather intriguing read, creating a good turn-of-summer-season read.

Book Four kills that momentum halfway through its pages. Leaving a successful formula that is similar to a bad B-Rated Mystery-Thriller - the series takes a very preachy turn. Even after one removes the heavy-handed bully pulpit from the story - there's not much to be praise-worthy with what's left. The first three books focused on excellent character and plot development, and the preachy aspects took a deep backseat to those methodologies. Sorry Mr. Lahaye and Mr. Jenkins...your novel doesn't live up to the expectations of the first three in this series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I'm reading The Left Behind Series. The book I'm on now is book four Soul Harvest. The main characters in this book are Chloe, Buck, Ken, Rayford, Mac, Tsion Ben Judah, Amanda, Hattie, and Loretta. This book takes place after the Rapture of God. They are trying to get as many people as possible to find Christ before the Glorious Appearing of God. At the beginning of the book Rayford and Buck are trying to find their family. They can't find Chloe, Amanda, Tsion, or Loretta. Loretta and Amanda both die. Buck finally finds Tsion, and later he finds Chloe with the help of Ken and Tsion. They get a call from Hattie, a non-believer, saying she is trying to get to them. They go to find her and find out that she is going to be kidnapped by Carpathia. They rescue her before he finds her. At the end of the book the next judgment comes. It is hail stones and balls of fire that come from the heavens. These books always are very good. They show you how much God loves you and it makes you feel good.One thing I didn't like about this book was that they made Amanda and Loretta die. Amanda died in a plane crash during the earthquake. Loretta had been leaving the church and her car flipped over on top of her. They were both one of my favorite people in this book. The worst part is that now they are making Amanda a possible bad person. They are saying she was a spy working for the Antichrist, Carpathia. Rayford and Mac find the airplane and get Amanda's laptop. The plane had landed in a river though so the computer is water-logged. They have another believer who is also a computer wiz try to find any information. They find some that may connect her to Carpathia. \\"The lists of encrypted files from Amanda's hard drive are evidence extensive correspondence between her and Nicolae Carpathia,\\" (LaHaye, 422).My favorite part of this book was when Buck and Den dressed up as doctors. They were trying to get Chloe out of the hospital because Nicolae was trying to take her away. Ken was called Dr. Airplane because he is a pilot. \\"Excuse us Doctor, ah-\`and Chloe says,' \\"Doctor Airplane\\"' I had to bite my tongue,\\" (LaHaye, 265). It was funny because they made up a disease. They were trying to sound like they knew what they were talking about, but really they had no clue!One thing I wonder abut is Hattie. A girl in the book is pregnant with the Antichrist child, or Nicolae child. I wonder if she will keep it or not. Also she is very sick and hasn't came to Christ yet. Will she die and if she does will she become a believer in time? \\"She sleeps too much,\\" Chloe said. \\"And she is so pale,\\" (LaHaye, 407).This book is really about telling people that Gods loves you. The authors don't want anyone to live through this period of time. It is very devastating and dangerous. They want everyone to have the chance to accept Jesus as their Savior, so when the rapture does come you will go to heaven. I like this book and it has made me realize how important it really is to have a relationship with God."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"THE ENTIRE, LEFT BEHIND SERIES, IS AWESOME !

It seems incongruous that such a wide audience has been following this series, though of course it is better that they read this pabulum than other drivel a la Celestine Prophecy.

No matter how you try to twist it, a careful reading of 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17 clearly shows that the rapture will take place when &quot;the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout&quot; (NKJV) at the time of the second coming, NOT centuries before. Premillenial Pretribulation eschatology is a set of falsehoods based on a jigsaw approach to Scripture and a mistaken interpretation of the book of Revelation and biblical prophesy. Revelation must be understood first of all in light of the first century context in which it was written. You must also realize that it, along with all biblical prophesy, is God's holy Word spoken to His people throughout the centuries, NOT just some collection of jigsaw pieces out of which we can piece together a map of future history. Revelation was NOT written solely for the entertainment of 20th century North American Christians who imagine they see it about to be fulfilled. For a better understanding of Revelation than what you will find promoted in &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; and other books of its kind, read the simple (but not simplistic) little book: &quot;The Book of Revelation: A Cartoon Illustrated Commentary&quot; by Vic Lockman. The fact that &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; and the other books of this series are so popular is a sad commentary on how so many North American Christians are deceived by the false doctrine of premillenial, pretribulation eschatology."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The world takes sides because we are a product of our environment.

Nicolae Carpathia is the anti-Christ and more of his evilness is displayed. The 3rd and 4th Horseman are unleashed and calamity strikes the earth and those left behind.These books are a great work and those who believe or aren't sure what to believe begin to understand the bible and the point of the books, to prepare yourself and make a decision to follow Christ and accept him as the Messiah. I enjoy them because they make the rapture and the prophesies of what is to come so real, the meaning of the prophesies are intrepreted by the authors but they make sense. The characters are real and are flawed, they make mistakes, they fight for what they believe, they experience pain and agony, happiness and joy. You want to be there with them, helping in the cause, at the same time you hope to never have to be there, that you're taken in the rapture and not left behind."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"So far, I've read all eleven Left Behind novels, and while they are not perfect, I think that some people don't give it enough credit because of unfair comparisons. People often point to We All Fall Down and The Christ Clone trilogy as better novels, and in a way, they are, but they are also very different. Left Behind seems to be more of an introduction to the subject of the End Times, a series that is reaching out to all people of different ages. It's not particularly well written, but it is clear and straightforward. The characters are not particularly realistic or interesting, but these are not character studies, these are novels that are trying to give people an overview of this concept, and they do that quite well.To compare these to other novels with similar themes is a little bit unfair. We All Fall Down is much better written and more intelligent, but the focus of that novel is much more intensley spiritual and more of a character study that uses the End Times as a backdrop to explore complex issues of evil and salvation. It is for more mature, serious readers and it's aim is very different from Left Behind. Likewise, The Christ Clone is more of a techno-thriller, interested in exploring how, realistically the End Times could arive. I will admit that I enjoyed these other books more than Left Behind, but that does not take away from the fact that Left Behind still does a decent job with the subject. They are not great novels, but they are nowhere near as bad as some people are saying."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is amazing...

And it went on for PAGES. From there it picks up a bit but keeps falling back into the kind of writing that would not make it through an undergraduate workshop. Some reviewers have complained that the books are becoming too character-driven. I don't mind that, except that the characters themselves are so shallow. The first rule of good writing -- show don't tell -- is violated on almost every page of this tedious book.I enjoyed Left Behind and have read the others as they were published out of curiosity. No big deal, it only takes a few hours to read each. But the writing, which was never really good, has become the worst sort of hack work."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The authors of this series betray their patriarchal, anti-woman bias in this book. The female characters are given no development whatsoever and are only passive, second-class cardboard cutouts.For example: At one point, special attention is drawn to the fact that one of the female characters is barefoot. Then later on that character is revealed to be pregnant! Here is a subtle statement by the authors that they think that women should be barefoot and pregnant.Of the book's three main female characters, two become pregnant and the third dies. This is further evidence of the authors' evangelical focus-on-the-family bias. Evidently women should bear children and live in supporting roles to their leading men, or else they should be killed off.I am not a crusading feminist, but it concerns me that millions of young women are reading this series without critical thinking about what the authors are really saying. If this series wants to be more balanced, one of the two male protagonists better get killed off soon."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"In part 4 of their second coming series Tim &amp; Jerry have increased the pace and the action. The first two books in the series provided the good foundational background on the main characters which allows this book to take off. That's not to say that readers must have read the others in order to understand this installment. This is a stand alone book but I don't see how you could read this and not want to read the prior installments.

Oddly, being a Christian and knowing where all of this is going, does nothing to dull the excitement of following the story as it develops.The vivid writing of Lahaye and Jenkins makes it possible to visually put yourself into the scene and almost experience the subject matter firsthand.If you are a believer and have not read any of these books, you are not doing yourself justice. These are great writings and do a great job of bringing the Word of God to life in a new and vibrant manner."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I stopped reading this series after #4 (Soul Harvest).

I'm glad I did, because I read it with a more critical eye than if I'd chosen to read the serie's cheerleaders' reviews. I must admit, I enjoyed this one as much as any of the others. If you read it for escapism, as is the intention of most series, you don't really want a lot of details bogging down the flow of the story. The authors accomplish this feat. Their point, I'm sure, is to both entertain and inform. It is far more accessible and understandable to the layman than is The Revelation. It will also be an aid to those who actually sit down and read the biblical version. The authors, though at times in the previous books tend to make the main characters superhero-like, have done a good job with showing the vulnerability of the big three in this one. Poor Chloe has been beaten up pretty badly two books in a row! Doesn't matter how she looks, Buck loves her just the same. The books are addictive, and I'm probably going to have to run to Sam's Club and get the next one. I can't wait to decode Amanda's correspondences with Nicolae. I had a funny feeling about her in the previous book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"To all those criticizing the writing style, you're missing the point. For years, men have ignored the Book of all time. LaHaye and Jenkins have woven a story of intrigue that would reach all ages and levels of intelligence. But the bigger picture is that they're telling the story in modern-day terms because the days are short. This has made the book of Revelation live for me as never before and I was raised in the church. I'm sure it has gotten the attention of many who are re-thinking their values and getting their lives in order. A big thank you to the authors for making it so plain!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Now, you've heard from every other reviewer, that these books aren't very well written. Well, they're right. But you've heard enough from them about that, so I won't bore you with how bad the writing was. I really don't think these books are too bad. I only have one problem, well actually 2 problems: 1: I don't think these books need to be dragged out past 8 books. If the writers were good, then I'd say the heck with it, go ahead. But the fact is they aren't good writers. Look at the Harry Potter series. There will be seven of those, but the author is a great author. Also, there was a mistake in interpretations in this book. It was the first I've come across, but it's a big part in the story. If you're familiar with the story, you know that all believers get a mark on their forehead so they will be recognized as Christians. Well, in Revelation, chapter 7, It says that only the 144,000 witnesses will get that seal on their heads. Out of all the things that happen in Revelation, that has to be the most understandable. I don't see how the authors could have missed something like that. Anyway, these are just my opinions. Also, if you have questions about the &quot;End Times,&quot; don't worry about it just yet. Every Christian should be more concerned about how to live their lives right now, than worrying about what is going to happen in the end times."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I did not find this story as believable as I think it should have been. Probably the best Rapture novels on the market right now, at least in my opinion, are \\"In His Image\\" (book one of the Christ Clone Trilogy) and \\"Conquest of Paradise\\", both of which I read several months ago. These books display the realism, intensity and suspense that make for incredibly exciting and unforgettable stories. The Left Behind Series, on the other hand, peaks the reader's interest, but doesn't seem the slightest bit realistic. If you liked \\"Nicolae,\\" \\"Tribulation Force,\\" and \\"Left Behind,\\" you'll enjoy The Christ Clone Trilogy and \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" even more."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE BECOME BETTER WRITERS SO I CAN AT LEAST JUSTIFY MY ADDICTION TO READING ALL OF THESE BOOKS!Having now read 4 of these books I can at least say that it is easier to look past the trite, simplistic and hackneyed writing. The dialogue is still like listening to 3rd graders play make-believe and the situations the characters get themselves into are sadly contrived. However, with each book it becomes easier to look past that and enjoy the serial-style excitement these books offer. The vapid characters have become less-annoying, like any friend that occasionally gets on your nerves.The storylines become more complex as we make our way to the Glorious Appearing heralded in the final book. This complexity is due largely to the fact that we have so much back story now, and that may be another reason I continue to enjoy these books. Don't get me wrong, these are NOT complex books. One just becomes numb to the egregious flaws in the writing and carried away by the world proffered in this scenario.This book tends to be a bit more blatant in its preaching, but the messages are not bothersome. While they do seem to be dropped into the middle of a chapter like a commercial for Jesus during your favorite soap opera, you are willing to role with them.This book could have easily been cut in half (as they all could) especially since each of these books covers only about 1-2 weeks of story time. The authors waste so much time describing each character's actions, I often feel as if it is being done on purpose to stretch the series out for another book. Are they trying to get the message out there about God or are they trying to sell more books? You decide. The Tribulation is 7 years, and we get to read about it one day at a time.From the other reviews I've read here the Christians that read these tend to believe they are the greatest books ever written (outside of the Bible, of course). To them, please read something by Steinbeck or Maughum and appreciate the Left Behind books for what they are: a fun repast that fictionalizes and dramatizes a very frightening and unknowable biblical event.The non-believers tend to find them drivel. To them, lighten up! Find the nut buried in the sand. Your preaching is far more offensive because you have NO foundation to preach from. Have you ever stopped to wonder about the idea of Faith?I simply wish the Christian faith could have been better served by good writing. Bad writing will alienate this message from getting through to so many people and further the cause of those who make fun of the faithful.And yet, I will continue to read every single one of these books. I give it two stars solely because of the writing. If there was another rating for message and content, I'd give it 4 stars. laredarel@aol.com"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"If you're in need of Sunday-school remedial lessons you may find something of value in these incredibly light-weight novelettes.

In contrast, read Glen Kleier's complex and spiritually satisfying supsense thriller THE LAST DAY and you will see how much gold can be mined from this rich topic of the End of Time. For my money, there has to be more to a novel than simply a validation of fundamentalist Bible interpretations. I'm also looking for a story, characterization, and theological insight. These books are very disappointing in that regard."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"out of the first four books, this is the most exciting one"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"A Review by JessicaAs prophesized events continue to be hurtled toward the Tribulation Force and the rest of the world, Buck Williams and Rayford Steele are on a search for their lost wives. Just as they had expected, they are now becoming the main target of the Anti- Christ. The Tribulation Force will have to out smart the Anti- Christ's powerful guards, have secrecy among fellow believers, and go into hiding all in order to protect or even save their own lives.I loved the amount of action in this book. The authors keep you on the edge of your seat the time. An example of this is of the first seven or eight chapters while Buck and Rayford are continually looking for wives, Chloe and Amanda. Only problem with this is that they are wanted be every Global Community guard and cannot get caught. I also enjoyed reading about each character. Even though they are the same characters as in the first three books, the authors continue to add attributes to each character that keep you hooked on them. The relevance of this book is another thing that influenced me to give this book five stars. Everything that happens in this book is an interpretation of anything that could happen during the actual Tribulation. Although only a fiction story, everything that happens in this book gives you a piece of mind of what Hell on earth might be like.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an action-packed book with non-stop suspense or to readers who are looking for a good Christian story."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This installment of this series has been the best since the original. I finished it in 2 sittings, literally being unable to put the book down. I do have one minor problem with the story line, however. My issue concerns Amanda. What was the purpose of this character? Or should I say, this &quot;type&quot; of character. I am reminded of old Star Trek episodes where you beam a guy in a red shirt down with Kirk and Spock just so you can kill them off. Amanda's character served no real purpose. I did like the plot twist where they suspected her of being an interloper, but even that was a stretch. Had it been suspected that Buck, Chloe, Rayford or maybe Tsion was the rat, it would have been far more interesting. Why? Because these characters had been developed over 2 books prior to Amanda. I care about them, and really didn't care about Amanda. She was just kind of thrown in during &quot;Nicolae&quot; and I was indifferent to her character the entire time. In fact, I was bothered that we got an entire book featuring Buck and Chloe's courtship (Trib. Force), and no development of Amanda and Rayford's-yet were expected to identify/care about this character and their relationship. When they finally did &quot;discover&quot; Amanda, I really didn't care. It wasn't like it was one of my favorite characters. I felt worse for Donny, and he had about zero development. Also, it's about time Nicolae starting acting like the &quot;Antichrist&quot; again. He hadn't really done anything worthy of his title since the first book. His indifference to the disasters and growing disdain for the Trib. Force was a nice touch. Anyway, that's just my two cents. The book is outstanding and it grips you from end to end. I really enjoyed the exchanges between Rayford and &quot;Supreme Commander Fortunato&quot;. Classic. The &quot;seal&quot; was ingenious. I only wish we as Christians could see those seals now. Can't wait for &quot;The Assasins&quot;."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Alright, so, if you're here, then I don't have to tell you how poorly written this series is. The characters are cardboard, there is no pacing, there is no sense of style and the plot is cliched, repetitive and completely devoid of real tension. But, you might reasonably respond, none of that is the point to this series. This series is meant to convert the masses, and therefore, we might posit that we ought to judge this series based on its religious and moral content.If so? Then this series is even worse off than judging it on its artistic merits (and it has practically none).First of all, to re-establish the fact that this is a poorly written series, allow me to quote this choice segment from near the end of the novel. The context is that Ray is investigating an airplane that has crashed and now rests underwater, a grave for dozens of people. He's searching for his missing wife, whom he fears is one of the dead (p. 402): \\"All he saw in his fading light were the backs of five heads and the heels of ten feet. Seven shoes had come loose. He had never understood the phenomenon of the contraction of human feet in the face of violent collision....\\"Truly, genuinely dismal. Just awful. Here, you can tell that the authors decided to do a few minutes worth of research, and, finding some tidbit about contracting feet or somesuch, they just couldn't leave it out. You know, for verisimilitude. The fact that, while scuba-diving in an underwater airplane, searching desperately for his wife, and suffering from a bad head inury, this is a really lame thought for Ray to be having, pulling us completely out of the suspense of the scene? Well, the authors don't quite get that sort of thing.But, like I say, perhaps we should concentrate our critiquing efforts on the presentation of theology and ethics found here. After all, that's obviously what's most important to the authors. And so, let's have a little bit of theological conversation between two of our Tribulation Saints (210):\\"'God has proven personal to us, Mac,\\" Rayford said. 'He doesn't always answer our prayers the way he we think he will, but we've learned he knows best. And we have to be careful not to think that everything we feel deeply is necessarily true.''I don't follow,' Mac said.'For instance, I can't shake the feeling that Amanda is still alive. But I can't swear that this is from God.' Rayford hesitated, suddenly overcome. 'I want to be sure that if it turns out I'm wrong, I don't hold it against God.'\\"See? Rayford gets this deep feeling about Amanda's still being alive. If she turns out to be alive, then Rayford knows that the feeling came from God, and he praises God for \\"assuring\\" Ray or something like that. However, if Amanda isn't alive, then Rayford knows that his initial feeling wasn't from God, after all, but just his own hopes overblown...No wonder Mac didn't follow. It isn't followable.But my big problem here isn't the authors' lack of logic. Oh, sure, they haven't even been *introduced* to logic, but no, my bigger concern is the morality. Throughout this series, they've been inspired to use the series as a pulpit for preaching against what they feel are society's ills. Fair enough, except, rather than making anything resembling an actual case against any of these things, they've been content to merely smear them through association (i.e. the Antichrist supports it, ergo it's just as evil as Fundamentalists always said it was). In this way, the authors look to tarnish organizations like the United Nations and hot-button political issues like abortion, cloning and fetal tissue research. Look, there are several good arguments to be made against things like the United Nations (and also good arguments for it)... but, that the Antichrist might use it for world conquest? Is not a good argument. (Also, it's not even a good Christian argument, for God's will is obviously that the Antichrist have dominion for a time, yes? Therefore, arguing against the U.N. appears to be attempting to thwart God's plan...)Not always preaching against, sometimes the authors preach for things. For instance, in the character of Chloe, they preach for the \\"natural\\" submission of women to men (307):\\"Don't parent me, Buck. Seriously, I don't have a problem submitting to you because I know how much you love me. I'm willing to obey you even when you're wrong. But don't be unreasonable.\\"This is not the independent woman the authors introduced us to in the first couple of books. After almost disappearing from the narrative altogether, Chloe has re-emerged as a caracature of what the authors believe is the ideal Christian wife. That is: obedient. And here, they try to make such obedience sound reasonable because it's done \\"because I know how much you love me...\\" but ask yourselves this: does Chloe love Buck any less than Buck loves Chloe? No. Yet the authors would *never* give Buck a speech about how he obeys Chloe and submits to her (even when she's wrong). They give Chloe this speech because she's a woman, and the authors believe that it is a woman's duty to submit to her husband, and obey him.Apart from social observations, let's take a look at the character--and morality--of God as presented by this series. As a good starting point (and the central plot element of the end of the last novel, and most of this one), the \\"Wrath of the Lamb\\" earthquake that devastates the earth.What I find interesting about that quake is: according to the authors, it's God's work. Now, in chronicling the 'End of Times,' the authors have been quick and clear to lay a lot at Nicolae Carpathia's doorstep. He's the Antichrist, after all; a bad, bad man. Yet, come to it, God has managed to wreak more destruction than Carpathia. I know that the authors, and most readers, would sift these acts of destruction into \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" camps, but for someone who isn't Christian (like myself) it's a bit hard to come to that conclusion, just based on what I've read in this series. God's earthquake doesn't seem to be any more discriminatory than Carpathia's nuclear attack--they both wind up killing people both moral and immoral, Christian and other, right? They're both launching their attacks on the populace in an effort to gain better control of people, right? Win more people to their side, right? Honestly, other than the titles we've bestowed upon them, how is someone expected to figure out which is the force of good and which is the force of evil, when, for all I can tell, they employ the same tactics and have the same goals?The big difference seems to be: God is *more* powerful, is *better* able to massacre people, and therefore we'd be wise in backing him up. Do you know what argument LaHaye and Jenkins have yet to make? That God is more moral in some observable way, and therefore worthy of love, respect or admiration. So far, the only thing that they've proven about their deity is that he's not afraid of murdering millions of people to make a point. God seems to be \\"good\\" and \\"moral\\" in LaHaye/Jenkins' world because he says so, and will slap you down hard if you disagree.Of course, this is my beef--my personal point of view--I get that. I only wish the authors had some recognition of their own point of view, and how it colors their writing (and how it limits it). For instance, a good portion of the early part of the novel is Buck's trying to find Chloe (seems that girl is always gone missing), who they're worried has been killed by the quake. Had the quake, somehow, been the work of Carpathia, Buck would be burning with all sorts of anger at the cruelty and inhumanity of the Antichrist--at how casually the Antichrist could butcher people. Instead, Buck is filled with a sort of quiet resignation, because the quake is the handiwork of a \\"loving\\" God. Surely the kind of God that can cause these sorts of horrors must give a moral person pause...? Yet...\\"The chopper lights illuminated an area of twenty feet in front of the craft. Mac suddenly unclipped his belt and leaned forward. 'What is that, Ray? It's raining, but it's red! Look at that! All over the snow!''It's blood,\\" Rayford said, a peace flooding his soul...this show, this shower of fire and ice and blood, reminded him yet again that God is faithful. He keeps his promises.\\" (410)Yikes! Christians of LaHaye and Jenkins' stripe I find a bit... disturbing. They have no problems in upholding a God as being moral and loving, even as he slaughters millions (and condemns untold amounts of them to Hell, as he arbitrarily limits their opportunities for conversion/salvation through their early deaths). Yet they condemn as evil a man who kills a lesser number, even though that man is conforming to God's plan for us every bit as much as the earthquakes, comets, etc. They find comfort in raining fire and blood, but are troubled by independent women and embryonic research that could wind-up curing diseases and thereby saving lives.If LaHaye and Jenkins are right--if this series really does reflect Christianity and the character and morality of their God--then God is wicked, and a truly moral person would have to take a stand against him, even if it were futile. There is nothing loving about this \\"loving\\" God, no matter how many times we assert it is so. And anyways, even if they're right metaphysically, this series is still incredibly poor in terms of writing, characterization, plot, etc. Being religious and being right doesn't make a person a competent author."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Even as my eyes are glued to the last few pages of this book, I have become increasingly convinced that these characters exist by the grace of God alone, since they are all such extraordinary idiots! Tsion Ben-Judah alone, among the believers, is a character worthy of respect.I am fascinated by the plot and have been cross-referencing my Bible to more clearly understand what Revelation, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Isaiah actually state, though I echo a reviewer of _Nicolae_ who lamented the egregious absence of intelligent Christian fiction. Have we seen the last of such writers as C. S. Lewis?Mr. Lahaye and Mr. Jenkins, with all due respect, please credit your readers with more resourcefulness, intelligence and sense of humor in your future books. Please do not bore us with unnecessary recaps of past books or overexplain technology. Realize that the characters' histrionics are more laughable than their lame attempts at humor. I must admit that I was glad when Hattie went to the &quot;dark side,&quot; since it would constitute considerably less dialogue for her.By all means, however, please continue to deliver your interpretation of the end times events, and please continue to use the Scriptures as your guide. You have a vast audience of readers hungry for the message but who are frustrated by wading through such careless writing."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is a wonderful series that I just can't seem to put down. I've read through six books in the series in just over a month. Yes these are fictional books, but they are based on biblical prophesy and it has, in an uncanny way, helped me to begin to understand the end times and why such a loving God would allow such turmoil and destruction. Even those who do not believe should read this series. It is action packed and will take you through all the emotions and bring you close to the characters. I will continue to read the series, as I am excited to read about The Glorious Appearing."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Okay, this is where the book series took a turn downward for me. I don't know if it's because the subject matter changed, I don't know if maybe the writers were running out of steam, I really don't have a clue why I began to lose interest with this book, but I did. I liked it in general, but it had a different \\"feel\\" to it than the other books. The \\"preachy\\" feel that the other books did not have, this book had - as though the book was trying to convert people to Christianity by reading the book - instead of making the characters and the storyline be about people having to choose. I was not disappointed in the book as a whole, but as a part of the Left Behind Series up to this point, it was not on par with the three that came before it, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This story picks up just after the \\"Wrath of the Lamb,\\" the great earthquake affecting the entire world. Our heroes Buck and Rayford, on opposite sides of the ocean, search for their loved ones, praying to find them alive. In the aftermath of the quake, the battle lines between good and evil are more clearly defined as people become more in awe of Nicolae or more clearly sworn to their divine beliefs in God.Slower going then some of the previous installments, this story will still engage readers, just not quite to the extent of preceding works. There is still plenty of action here, with Nicolae's attempts to thwart the efforts of the Tribulation Force, and the desperate searches occurring around the globe of survivors for their families and friends."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest, being the 4th book in the Left Behind series, takes off where book 3 left off with the further adventures of Buck Williams, Rayford Steele and co. as they fight against the antichrist Nicoloe Carpathia.Now I loved the first 3 books, but this one left me a little puzzled. There was not really all that much happening in this one.It was a very easy read, in fact i read it in just over a day, it's almost too easy though and not very challenging. There is a bit of redundant writing in this one, over a period of 8 or so pages, the author describes 3 different people as being &quot;in great shape&quot;, I thought this was quite lazy writing.I'm a pre-trib rapture believing Christian,(phew), so adhere to the basic beliefs of the story. I was as a Christian however quite perplexed by the behaviour of the main charecters. It seems in fighting against the antichrist, the heroes have to lie an awful lot! I always thought lying was a sin, but these guys do so at seemingly every turn. I understand that many times there lives were at stake, but still, upholding Christianity means being truthful I always thought.Overall, I enjoyed reading it, but hope the series improves and that the charecters learn a bit more on how to suffer and still hold true to their convictions.Thanks for reading my comments."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I really enjoyed this fourth book in the Left Behind Series, and found it better-written than the second and third books in the series. In the second and third books, there was a lot of rehashing and repetition about what had happened in the first book (for new readers who might be picking up that book alone, not have read the earlier books).This book is packed full of action. Several characters die (but not the core group, obviously). Nicolae becomes highly suspicious of Buck and Rayford. A spy, apparently planted by Nicolae or Fortunado, is discovered in the midst of the Tribulation Force.It leaves me eager to go out and buy the next book, especially as regards the spy, and what that spy has transmitted to the enemy."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all of the Left Behind Series and have loved reading all of them. Soul Harvest was my favorte because of all the excitement in the book. I would have to say if you would want to understand everything that is going on you would have to read the book. In the middle of the book there a hord of demands that have mettal shells that can't brocken, they look like gaint moisquitoes that bight all of the none beveilers, the people that are bighten try to comight suicide, But the Bible sayies that the people must live and pay for the sins"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The drama of those left behind is continued through the fourth series book titled Soul Harvest. The series written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, based on the rapture, begins with the disappearance of millions. During the novel Soul Harvest characters survive a global earthquake which shuts down many transportation systems and the ability of the main characters to communicate with loved ones. The main characters Rayford Steele and Buck Williams search for ways to get in touch with their wives and be reunited with the Tribulation Force.Because the plot is based on the rapture a main theme seen through out the book would be the importance and influence off the Bible. References to verses in the Bible are revealed through Rayford&#65533;s studies and Ben-Judah&#65533;s teachings that are placed on the Internet for the access of the 144,000 witnesses.Most of the characters can be described as stock characters, which either play a good or evil role. Because most characters were not fully developed at the beginning of the novels the reader can not understand the role of the characters until later in the series. The obvious character Rayford and Buck play a good role while Carpathia, the anarchist, plays a deceitful and manipulating role.The plot of Soul Harvest is manly formula and somewhat original. Because this book follows the description of events and follows the basic format or the Bible the plot was already developed. Although most of the book was pre-formulated it also was original in the way that the authors created characters and added details."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book was exciting!

It is great fiction with a plausible plot. I think the writers have done a great job in creating a story that incorporates the Word, I applaud them for the detailed imagination that so many of us lack. I read some of the not-so-favorable reviews and want to say that I think some readers have to remember that this is F-I-C-T-I-O-N. It is great to escape into a story, but apparently some people need some perspective. This is entertainment, when people let their emotions rise and fall on something that is not reality, it's scary!

I can't see where these people are getting that it is written on a grammar school level. Is it because there are no explicit language or vulgar thought-provoking scenes? I hardly feel that it was written on a school-age level. Being a school teacher, I should know. I do admit that &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; was a little drawn out. However, it was still very good.

The authors should have spent more time on the trumpet judgements and less on Amanda.(I am looking forward to hearing if she was involved with Carpathia or not). They did a really good job of setting up suspense for the next book. I am looking forward to the movie.

Also, please jsut admit that these are 250 page books, not 400.

If it doesn't make you think about your own situation if Christ were to return at this moment then I would take a serious look at myself.

I was greatly disappointed to have read so much on the search for loved ones only to find at least three major world events crammed into the last chapters. surely these events if better covered would have inproved the reading of this book.

Fortunately it's not as evident in this book as in the last two so the authors may be listening after all. The search for Chloe and Amanda is dragged out way too long and unnecessarily so. Although the final pages are quick moving and heart-pounding, the middle is TOO slow. Food for thought to the authors.I'm looking forward to the next book, but don't see the necessity in writing an additional three to complete the series.

Questions I would not be asking if he spent more time developing three dimensional and complex characters to inhabit this hellish world.

Unfortunately, it is beginning to drag out. We continually read about Rayford's love for Amanda, each characters past history, and Tsions thoughts on the end times (in detail). Despite this, it is easy to become wrapped up in the story as each character faces new challenges. This is not an entirely believable book however as the characters are not developed to their full potential. Read it for what it is, a thought provoking work of fiction. There are plenty of other books on eschatalogical studies."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is just as spell binding as the previous books in the Left Behind series.

We also follow Chloe and Buck after the Great Earthquake and Tzion as they hide in an obscure little duplex. Another great book!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is a great book. It's inspiring for all. Christians and nonbelievers alike should read this book as well as all the Left Behind books. It helps explain scriptures and gives an insight to what is to come after the rapture of the Church. Read it, study it, and pray for all those who could be left behind and the hardships they may have to encounter."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The fourth in the Left Behind series, this book picks up with our main characters immediately following a devastating global earthquake. Buck and Rayford are searching for their loved ones; Rayford's wife Amanda (one of the few characters in this series I care very little for) has her integrity called into question - was she truly a believer? or was she working for Carpathia? - and she's missing; Tsion Ben-Judah begins to post his teachings online and antics ensue to keep the website encrypted so he may continue without GC interruption; and hearts really are turning in great numbers to Christ. Carpathia is on a rampage (when isn't he...) to rebuild his Global Community. Believers begin to recognize a \\"mark\\" on the forehead of other true believers (this will play a major part in determining Amanda's truthfulness) and allows more espionage, because really, how else will they have any clue as to who to trust!

After an earthquake of the population is gone taking with it members of the tribulation force, Amanda and Chloe are both missing and the home base for the tribulation force has been destroyed. Buck goes searching for a pregnant Chloe and Rayford goes on a deep sea dive to find the body of his wife Amanda White.So many things are happening to the tribulation force throughout this book, Tsion Ben-Judah has made the decision to return to Israel in order to teach the 144,000 witnesses. Hattie Burham is found pregnant and in an abortion clinic. They have also learned of a plot that Carpethia plans to kill Rayford and Hattie. Since the earthquake the world has gone crazy, television is full of nudity, torture, and sexuality. The tribulation force has also noticed that believers have a mark on their foreheads that only other believers can see, which helps in recruiting new members to the tribulation force.Another Left Behind book that will keep you glued to your seats, this book is action packed and twists and turns come at every corner!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The story keeps getting better and better! This book begins after a catastrophic earthquake has taken place. Only Israel was protected. Rayford Steele is still working as a pilot for the antichrist and the way he talks to him is sometimes very humorous. The antichrist is, as well, and it's interesting to imagine what he will really be like.When the book begins, Amanda and Tsion Ben-Judah are both lost as Rayford and Buck look for them in different parts of the world. Later, doubt is cast on Amanda concerning whether or not she is/was really a believer. The main action of this book concerns Rayford searching for her or her body, and trying to discover if she was really a Christian or was working with Carpathia, the antichrist.This book is a fast-paced read and I highly recommend it along with the rest of the series. I read Soul Harvest 8 years ago and it's exciting to come back to it again."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This fourth book in the best-selling Left Behind series allows readers to watch the willful fracas between the evil incarnate Nicolae Carpathia and newly founded followers of Christ.

Jenkins chronicling the events that take place in the world during the end times. The books follow several main characters as they fight for their lives and for their faith as the world makes its way to the last days.In this book, the world has experience a global earthquake. The members of the Tribulation Force who survived are looking for each other amid the chaos that has ensued. While Nicolae is determined to rebuild his Global Community, the Believers of the world are sharing their faith and seeing a soul harvest that has never before been seen.This is the point in the series where things really start getting bad for the world. Things were bad before, but now the judgments are coming to the earth. The story is fast-paced and action-filled, but it is also sorrowful because so many terrible things are happening.This series of novels is a fictionalized account of the events of the end times. I enjoyed the whole series. While this book is geared towards Christians, there is enough action and depth to it that should appeal to all."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The fourth installment in the \\"Left Behind\\" series, \\"Soul Harvest,\\" picks up after the wrath of the Lamb at the end of book three - a devastating earthquake that kills 25 percent of the earth's population. Buck and Ray spend much time searching for their wives and dealing with the utter devastation the earthquake caused.Much of the book deals with, as the title would suggest, harvesting souls - both on a small, personal scale and large, worldwide scale - touching on the 144,000 witnesses mentioned in the Scriptures. Followers of Christ soon realize they are marked with a seal from God, allowing them to recognize one another. By the end of the book, \\"the world was taking sides\\" - between following God or Nicolae Carpathia.The true colors of some characters are either questioned or even come to be truly revealed throughout the book. Nicolae's evil spirit because even more apparent.Through all of the trials and hardships, a few members of the Tribulation Force find some happy news ... but I'll keep that a secret!The book ends with the start of the Trumpet Judgments: the Angel of the First Trumpet throws hail and fire to the earth (\\"This is like the ultimate fireworks,\\" says Mac); a fiery mountain falls from the sky, causing widespread tidal waves, loss of sea life and boats; and the meteor Wormwood falls, turning much of the earth's water bitter.Also, by the end of the book, one member of the Tribulation Force faces devastating news - news of loss, possibly betrayal and confusion.An excellent read, and a great way to understand the goings-on of Revelation.Five stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The events in Soul Harvest, book four in the Left Behind Series, are a continuation of the action begun at the end of Nicolae. The world is reeling after a devastating natural disaster. Buck and Rayford are searching for their wives, making new friends along the way, and leading folks to the Savior as the opportunities arise. Important lives are lost. But eventually those of the Tribulation Force who are left gather for encouragement and to make a new plan. Then they're off again to various corners of the globe, which allows us a bird's eye view of the world-wide Tribulation. However, one believable constant in every story is how--no matter what dangers they face from the chaos around them--the believing characters show concern for individual lives.There are several interesting developments in this installment, which I attribute to the imaginations of the authors, Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. I enjoyed what they envisioned as far as how technology will be used to spread the message of the Antichrist and keep tabs on all the peoples of earth. This was especially impressive when I re-read because this book was originally written eleven years ago. (Actually, maybe I should be nervous at how technology has developed in that short amount of time.)And I loved the method devised for Christians to identify each other. Many Bible scholars believe the judgments which are poured out from Heaven during the Tribulation will not harm the saints. So the authors came up with a special mark that appears on the forehead of every true believer. Miraculously, only other believers can see the mark. This enables the Tribulation Force to determine whom to trust and to mix in with the global community when necessary.This book also highlights the effect on the culture after the Holy Spirit is taken out of the world. During the story, one of the great accomplishments of the world leader is reestablishing television signals. Once TV is returned to the masses, the content worsens to incorporate every sin and perversion imaginable. All moral restraints have been removed. It's a great illustration of how the presence and prayers of Christians influence everything around us to some degree. Sadly, when that influence is gone, unrighteousness rules."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is an o.k. book/series . . . but only if you are looking for material for you elemantary age sunday school class. Why did they bother to release a series of these books specifically for kids when this series fits that age group so well already. The basic story line, the writing style, and the unrealistic human concepts in this book are perfect for children, as they should be the only people who actually believe this garbage. Don't get me wrong, the basic message here is the truth. The Rapture and the Tribulation Period events that may occur at any time in the near future. Beyond that, however, very little in this book is plausible, let alone realistic. I give it an &quot;A&quot; for concept, and an &quot;F-&quot; for everything else. Unfortunately, that averages out into a big ol' whomppin &quot;F&quot; in my book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Just because a book such as this one offers teachings and wisdom toward what we find in Revelation, it doesn't automatically make it a good book.

It's sad, b/c had this been a well written work, this series could have helped many more people find their way than it has."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Not as interesting as the others.

I kept reading hoping that the quality would improve only to be rewarded with several biblical calamities jamed into a few paragraphs - almost like the authors said &quot;oh, and this happened too but it is not that important to the storyline so we'll just throw it in and go on&quot;. I also agree with several of the other reviewers - if this was a realistic view of what might happen the Tribulation Force members would all be long gone. Very disappointing, however I am holding out hope for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Don't get me wrong.

Wanting more. Just like Perretti's, Elwood's, and T. Davis Bunn's books. But Soul Harvest is a dissapointment. I expected it to be the last of the series. Now I find out that I might have to wait until the year 2001 (If I am still alive :) to read the end of the series. Not that this story isn't in the book of Revelation, but.... Well, let's sit back and wait and see if we can get to the end of it, or the end will come before the series end. Just one more comment and I am out of your hair: After reading review after review of this series, I come to ask myself a question or two: 1: If we all agreed on one single issue, wouldn't it be a better world? 2. It really makes me wonder why if it bothers some people so strongly the way the books are written, why bother reading them for?? Or is it that they touch a spot in your soul that you didn't want to acknowledge or didn't know was there? Are this books questioning your christian walk?? Perhaps the fact that you might be one of those &quot;LEFT BEHIND?&quot; God Bless all and let's hope we don't have to live this drama personally, and have to realize that we are as humans as the characters of these books. LIVE EACH MINUTE OF YOUR LIFE IN SERVICE TO YOUR LORD, AND JUST LIKE IF IT WERE YOUR LAST, FOR YOU NEVER KNOW IF IN THAT BLINK OF AN EYE THE LORD WILL COME AND YOU WILL BE ONE OF THOSE LEFT BEHIND."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"It's annoying how long this series is dragging out. Over and over I wonder, &quot;When is Carpathia just going to shoot them?&quot; It's like the villains in James Bond movies who could just shoot Bond, but end up talking on and on about their plans, allowing Bond the opportunity to escape.

From book one in the ongoing saga of The Tribulation Force, the authors leave the reader with a horrowing look at what is coming in the days ahead. DC Talk's &quot;I'd wish they'd all been ready&quot;, rings in your mind as you read the continueing tale of the &quot;force&quot; and the reader is sucked into the story with it's swivling twists and turns in story-line; although you are told what events will shape the story.In the saga a select few of inviduals who rise against the anti-christ in the final 7 years after the rapture are unqiuely linked to each other, Nicole and through swiftly-woven plot twists you are left with your mouth gaping open, dripping with beads of anticipation of what is to come.A rare combination of great writing, a great story and characters you can believe in. Even if you don't have a working knowledge of what Christianity is about, the books paints a ! horrowing tale as the bible as it's compass for what is to happen in the world's final years.ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all four of these books and really don't like the ideal of waiting untill 1999 for the next book. I highly recommend this book for everyone, especially those who are not Born Again Christians. I appreciate someone writing books that tell the truth and how it will be for those left behind. If I didn't want to become a Christian after reading these books then something must be terrible wrong with me. Keep up the good work guys and don't let people discourage you. Everyone has their own opinion but you must be doing something right to get so much response. I am going to go and buy the young adult version of the Left Behind series. I have told my Students in Sunday School that they all need to read these books and also to read Revelations because they go hand and hand. Thanks again and God Bless.

Can't Tim and Jerry get number 5 written and published before Aug., 1999? The series is extremely thought provoking and makes me sad to think (know?) that I will have loved ones alive during the Tribulation is Jesus comes for us in our lifetime. Motivates me to prayer for them. Thanks, Tim and Jerry, for your perseverance in writing these books. Even though I feel they could be condensed into fewer than 7 books I'm going to stick with it and read them all.

I feel that it has really changed the way I think and what life is really about. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wonders if they will be in the rapture.

However I don't see this poor example of Christian authors getting any awards or standing out in the world of literature. It sounded like a movie made into a book.

Not a way to keep readers."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the fast past of this lastest novel in the left behind series.

Face it folks. The writing is laughable, the story is a joke, and the characters are as shallow as a half filled kiddie pool. It's kind of hard to believe, b/c Left Behind was so much better. The way I figure, either the publisher is rushing the authors or the authors are getting lazy. There's no development here, just wasted space. The worst part is, it's so poorly written and yet people flock to buy it and the rest of the series. I can only assume that this means that there is no competition for Christian Sci-Fi books. Also, I'm getting a little tired of hearing people defend this book just because it has a thought provoking Christian basis. Just b/c a book has a good bassi doesn't mean it's a good book. I don't care if someone wrote a book which contained the secrets to eternal bliss. If the writing was as bad as it is in this book, I still would call it dung. Oh well, no use crying over a terrible book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After reading the first three, especially Nicolae, I was more than excited to see that Soul Harvest came out earlier than the expected August release. However, unlike my most favorite in the series this one left me a little empty. I felt that first Nicolae and the two witnesses didn't really do much and the search for Amanda was a bit pushed aside and drawn out. The search for Chloe was on the other hand riveting. The most disappointing aspect was that it was primarily lacking in spiritual content in many places. For instance, those who are new to end time events may sit there wondering what LaHaye/Jenkins are talking about since there are few Biblical references to the events. The other thing that left me disappointed, as well as others as evidenced by the other reviews, are as the following. 20% of the book is a review of other events that happened in the first three (If you didn't read those the authors should have forced the reader to go to those first by leaving this out, but refreshing using the forward). 60% of the book is general filler that can confuse the reader that he or she is baited into shelling out more money and getting very little in return. And 20% on the theme that most of us anticipated. One of my suggestions for the authors is to explain more. For instance, what is wormwood. A better explaination for this phenomenon would have been that the tidal waves that occured due to the asteroid caused the sewage and waste to back up into the water supply thus causing the water to become bitter, wormwood. This is an idea brought about in a similar and very well written book by Pat Robertson---The End Of The Age. I like many other readers look forward to the next book, Assassins, coming soon (although I wish it were sooner). But as a plea to the authors, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE concentrate on the plot and be more detailed on the Biblical explaination of these events. Overall a good book. Keep up the good work guys!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest has to be the most wonderful book in an already powerful series. Not only are the characters real, but the basic theme of the book and then entire series IS REAL. Everything that these two gifted authors use as background, ie, the Tribulation, Rapture and rise of the AntiChrist has been predicted for nearly two thousand years...and WILL happen. I have been comparing these books to the Bible, and the events are there, just waiting for God's own time. I could hardly believe it when I saw that Tyndale decided to release this book early. And I am glad they did. Now, all we need to do is wait for the remaining three books to be written and published. Of course, if the Rapture takes place before they write these books, we can always ask them in heaven how it was to come out!!!

Use a bigger font, triple spacing and wider margins. Well, that's exactly what the authors did here. You can tell just by looking on the pages that this book should only have been about 200 pages long, and the publisher just formatted it with as few words as possible on a page in order to make the book big, long and expensive. They know they have a captive audience anyway, so never mind if there isn't enough material here to really fill a book.Too bad the authors have already committed to a seven-book series. So little goes on in this book (and the whole series) that they probably could have done the job in three tightly-edited books of half the length. But then they wouldn't make as much money, would they?"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":". . .concerns me for a number of reasons.Reason One) The writing is really poor. For someone like myself, who grew up reading the Classics -- and who was always challenged to \\"reach\\" and to \\"strech myself\\" with regard to my reading, the quality of the writing (or lack thereof) was a significant \\"turn-off\\".Reason Two) The character development is virtually non-existent. While great writers (Charles Dickens comes to mind) frequently used \\"flat characters\\" as a literary device, the authors of thisseries seem ONLY to use \\"flat characters\\". The \\"Left Behind\\" characters seem to be \\"all good\\" or \\"all evil\\" and make the \\"jump\\" from evil (or unsaved) to good with a minimum of struggle. I don't see this as realistic. As the series progresses, the only truly interesting character -- and the only character who seems to be developing a personality is Nicolae! (And I don't think that it is the intent of the authors to promote sympathy for the bad guy!)Reason Three) The theology presented is presented as \\"the\\" correct interpretation of Revelation, embraced by all \\"true believers\\". This is nonsense. The theology of Revelation propounded in this series is a 19th century invention, accepted by only a very small minority of Protestant Christians. It does not represent what most Christians (regardless of denominational affiliation) have believed about Last Things for the entire history of Christianity.Reason Four) I find the underlying anti-Catholicism derogatory and offensive. If the authors have theological disagreements withCatholicism, I freely respect that. However, Catholicism is not accurately portrayed here -- rather, it is caricatured. Again, the identity of the \\"false prophet\\" is clear; the concept that the \\"false prophet\\" will be Pope is also clear -- and that Rome (and specifically the Vatican) will be the headquarters for the new \\"World Religion\\" is also clear. As a student of history and theology, I find this offensive in the extreme.I note that Amazon.com has, in the past, posted disclaimers with regard to certain openly anti-Semitic material available. I wish that similar disclaimers were posted with regard to antagonistically anti-Catholic materials as well."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"All of the Left Behind books are poorly written, have plastic, stereotypical characters and fail to address any deep moral or religious questions.

I would highly recommend this series to anyone, believer or not, who is in search of the truth about how things are to be in the end times.

First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I've enjoyed the three previous books but there were some areas that I found problematic. One such area was that the books were predictable. This is the first book to have any significant twists. Another problem was the thin character development but after four books I deffinately identify with Rayford and Buck. My final complaint was that despite all the terror and horror that was mentioned it was all distant. I never felt it. The main characters were in possitions of privilege and we had more interaction with the geopolitical aspects but not with the pain and suffering. We didn't feel the tribulations of the tribulation but were fascinated by the pollitical mechanisms of it. This book was different.

I first picked up the books 6 months ago and couldn't get through the first one. Now, I can't put them down, I can't explain the change. While the writing is sometimes tedious, the story as a whole is captiviting. I can't wait to read the next one. I feel like the author has taken bibical prophecies and put them in a way we can understand them. I don't plan on being &quot;left behind&quot;. I am also amazed at the number of reviews these books have. I have looked at other &quot;best sellers&quot; and found less than five reviews. These books have created hundreds. Interesting don't you think!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Pleasantly enough, this fourth installment of the popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; series didn't leave me in literary pain. There's finally a small degree of plausible character development, and the action has picked up tremendously since the first three books. There are still points about the quality of writing I find disturbing, but overall this is one I'd recommend. After the overwhelming disappointment of the first three novels, &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; is a fresh lease of life to the series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The authors keeps one reading all night long. As a retired professor, this fiction-non-fiction is one series I do not think can be topped! I've read hundreds of books and not one has ever kept my complete attention for hours without sustenance of some kind. I've never written comments on any book(s) before! Such insight-kudos to the authors!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This series is fabulous. I found one of them a little dry, I think it was the second one, but since then am hooked again and am now reading &quot;Apollyon&quot;, which looks to be as interesting as the others. These character developments are outstanding. The anti-Christ is sinister and very frightening in a too nice kind of way, the worst kind of way. I'm concerned over the recent pregnancies announced though, what will happen to the children, who can only live to age five if at all? The books draw you into issues such as this, they make you wonder about the characters and situations during the day while at work, at home, it stays with you. To me, this is a sign of excellent writing. I was told after &quot;Assassins&quot; there won't be another until spring of 2000 and already I am obsessing over that. Keep reading this series folks, you won't regret it. And God bless the authors for finding a most unique way to allow people to inspect their own faith."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have just finished this book. It only took me one day to finish it. I was so grabbed by the story. I have read all the others but this is the one I read the fastest. They are so real and compelling. It makes you stop and think about whether or not you would be left beind. And if you were left behind it makes you change you mind QUICKLY!!!!. I can't wait to get the next books."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"To realize what the book of Revelation is telling you about the 7 seals and 7 trumpets I found myself hoping and praying with the characters as they look for their loved ones and felt their emotions throughout the book. Again, this book brings the writings of John the Revelator to life and easier to understand his writings. Another in this series that makes you glad you will not have to go through this period of time if you are truly saved and living as Christ-like as possible."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After what I thoought was a slightly slower book, Nicolae, the 4th installment, Soul Harvest is much more action packed and diverse. It probably deserves 4 stars, however I am still having trouble with some of the campy dialouge. Being a Christian myself, I am totally aware of the 'Christian' way of writing books without using secular or graphic dialouge, however, to make the characters more believable, they must drop the &quot;Gee Whiz&quot; &amp; &quot;Golly&quot; type statements. The worst abuser is Chloe (though 22), she talks like Robin from the 60's Batman series. Even the best Christians I know still talk somewhat like it is 1999.As far as the story goes, we finally see more action when it comes to Buck, and the introduction of many new characters to help flesh out this novel universe. The additions of Mac and Ritz, and Dr. Charles are welcome.Some astounding developments happen with Nicolae's 1st hand man, and it is somewhat comic the interaction between him and the Pontifex Maximus Peter Mathews. The world is only big enough for one of thier ego's.It seems that by the 5th installment, we will finally see some more fast paced action that takes this religious novel to the standards of a good spy story."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest was the most interesting and facinating books in the Left Behind series. I was completely locked in to the characters and what was happening to them. The suspense held me to the book until the wee hours. When I finished it, I had to really reflect on my own salvation."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I was not at all thrilled with Soul Harvest. After the exciting build-up from the first 3 books, I had a feeling the thrill was going to taper off at some point and this book is when it happens.The Tribulation Force continues to infiltrate and work their schemes against the Anti-Christ. They also include new believers into their force but the question is: which one(s) can't be trusted?An underground website continues to be a thorn to Carpathia and his administration. Which adds to some thrills as his forces attempt to locate the rebels.Maybe it's the magic number of 3, but after the last book I had a hard time enjoying this one.Like the other re-released books, Soul Harvest includes trivia, a look at how prophecy is coming to pass and other \\"latest ground-breaking news\\" on the biblical end times front.This book was provided for review, at no cost, by Tyndale Publishers."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After the devastating earthquake, Nicolae Carpathia seems to be immune to the suffering around him which draws suspicion.Rayford and Buck search for their loved ones among the wreckage and chaos. People are watching events happening while prophecy is beginning to be fulfilled.Belivers can easily idenify one another as the search for others like them begins.The novel is suspenseful and the reader feels drawn into the story. The continuation of familiar characters along with the introduction of new characters in the book brings with it new excitement. Like the first 3 novels in this series, this one also challenged my faith bringing a new understanding of end times prophecy in a novel format. I would recommend this sequel to others as it was enjoyable and enlightening."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"\\"The world is reeling from a great earthquake.

Meanwhile, Rayford Steele and Buck Williams search for their loved ones who haven't been seen since before the earthquake.\\" (taken from [...] )Soul Harvest finds the Tribulation Force heading up a mass, world-wide movement to bring more souls to Christ, much to Nicolae Carpathia's ire. I loved how this story showed that despite the Antichrist's reign and the control he had over the world, God still reigns sovereign and will not be denied!One of the things I liked about this series is that LaHaye and Jenkins allow the story to develop in-depth bringing both Biblical truths with some what-if fiction.

Even those who do not believe should read this series. It is action packed and will take youthrough all the emotions and bring you close to the characters.I enjoy them because they make the rapture and the prophesies of what is to come so real, the meaning of the prophesies are intrepreted bythe authors but they make sense. The characters are real and are flawed, they make mistakes, they fight for what they believe, they experiencepain and agony, happiness and joy. You want to be there with them, helping in the cause, at the same time you hope to never have to be there,that you're taken in the rapture and not left behind. This book matches the intensity and excitment of the prior three installments, usingthe environment outlined in the Book of Revelationsto tell the continuing story of Rayford Steele, Buck Williams and the rest of the Tribulation Force.This installment has enough twistsand turns to keep the reader interested from start to finish.

I think \\"Soul Harvest\\" is the best of the four. I even got my wife hooked on them. We were glad to see \\"Soul Harvest\\" when it arrived early. Now we can't wait for the next book to come out! The audio tape books are especially dramatic with the voice characterizations. The characters really come alive! I also like that it's not preachy and the story is wonderfully woven with twists and suspense. I recommend this book to anyone. I'm just trying to figure out which of my non-christian friends to give it to first! I'm not at all surprised the movie rights to the first two books have been sold. These rank right up there with Tom Clancy's best. Two thumbs WAY WAY up!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have really enjoyed this series thus far, however the authors seem to repeat too much information. There is no need to constantly retell events and stories that have already happened. Good books will refer to past events and build upon them, but not retell them. The authors seem to waste valuable words repeating information over and over again. This gives many readers, like myself, the impression that the books are drawn out in order to increase the number of books in the series. Such a publishing technique is common in secular writers (Robert Jordan being a prime example). My advice: focus on the storyline and make it believable. Christians everywhere can learn a lot from how the authors have pieced together the endtimes event. This is wonderful if they make it true and consistent with scripture, and avoid long, drawn-out commentary. The author's philosophy on a number of issues is certainly apparent during the reading of this series. No one can be comple! tely impartial, even with the word of God, especially with matters of prophecy. Thus, it is a fictional account. Although I cannot say that I agree with everything they represent, the overall Biblical consistency is very impressive. I applaud their efforts to create a believable and consistent fictional account of the endtimes."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I enjoyed reading Soul Harvest, as I did with the first three books. However, I was very disappointed with the ending. Too much was left until the end and then jammed in. I was sorry there wasn't more time with Rayford sharing his loss over Amanda. I would like to see fewer major events happen and more detail on those that do."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all four in the series and have found each one to diminish in intensity. I read the first three books in just 2 weeks and was anxiously awaiting *Soul Harvest*, only to find it a filler to bridge the gap to book #5. I understand the significance of a seven book series, however, it is obviously a stretch. Mr. LaHaye could have cut out 150 pages right out of the middle of *Soul Harvest* and not skipped a beat. I read it in 5 days only because I know I will need the background for book 5. Hopefully Mr. LaHaye will submit a &quot;leave you on the edge of your seat&quot; installment next time or he may lose some readers before the series is concluded."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"the book takes place right after the Gigantic earthquake.

I've read every book in the series, and it is basically on par with the rest of them. A couple of area's could have been dealt with in far greater detail, and I felt some important issues or events were skirted because of possible time constraints. The Hail-Fire-Blood, the Ball of Fire and Wormwood were given just honorary mention, and they are some very important and cataclysmic events in the book of Revelation. I'm not being critical, just expressing some thoughts. Biblically, I feel Tim LaHay and Jerry B. Jenkins are right on target, and their interpretation of end time events is theologically sound. I look forward, with great anticipatioin to &quot;The Assassins.&quot; Gentlemen, keep up the good work. Your work has challenged me spiritually, to enter into a closer walk and relationship with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I love the way the Apostle Paul ends many of his epistles. I feel it is appropriate to end with it. &quot;Ma! y the love of God, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you always.&quot;"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book (series) keeps my attention like a John Grisham book.

Picking up with the aftermath of the great, worldwide earthquake, Buck desperately searches for his wife, Chloe, and the rabbi, Ben-Judah. Rayford is at odds with Carpathia over his missing wife, Amanda. While making a convert in his copilot, Rayford learns Amanda may have been working for Carpathia.Though the world has lost about 25% of its population, the economy seems to chug along, unaffected. People expect and get all kinds of services, as the Global Community begins rebuilding immediately.Rayford actually says he would like to kill Carpathia himself. So why doesn't he just crash the plan at his first opportunity? I guess he's not willing to give his life for his beliefs.The interpersonal relationships are the most interesting in this volume. Peter the 2nd is a hoot as the Pope Plus with his never-ending pomposity. Left Behind is a great big Christian soap opera with some truly original developments, in the form of crosses appearing on the foreheads of the believers, but only visible to other believers. Combined, it keeps you craving more."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Even though the entire Left Behind series suffers from underdeveloped characters and anbolutely unbelievable dialogues, the istallments that came before Soul Harvest were a good read if only just because of non-stop suspence and action... This book, unfortunately, lacks both almost entirely.

The Tribulation Force learns that there may be a mole in its presence and they welcome new members. You will also read of the first of the trumpet judgments.This book, as well as the series, creates an excitement with its pacing and interest in researching the text in the Bible. In my opinion, this serves the purpose of this series.The author does get caught up a bit in the story so that the disasters coming with the judgments are completed too quickly. Most of the trumpet judgments are over and done with in just a few pages. Although these things are bad, we never really get to see the impact it has on the believers or non-believers.Nonetheless, I would recommend reading this book as a starting point to reading the Book of Revelation."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I love the Left Behind Series, it got me excited about reading again.

I have to agree with another review that Nicolae was a bit slow, but Soul Harvest gets it all going again."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is one of the best books of the Left Behind series! Mayhem and chaos abound just after the great Wrath of the Lamb earthquake. The adventures of Buck Williams and Rayford Steele continue, as they keep on struggling against evil antichrist Nicolae Carpathia, try to convince their unsaved friends of the truth, and look for their missing wives. Buck joins Dr. Ben-Judah in a quest to find Chloe whether she is dead or alive, and Rayford teams up with another pilot for plenty of high-flying escapades.Besides all the Left Behind action we've come to know and love, this is probably the most humorous in the series, especially with Buck and Tsion trying to get into a hospital, and discovering certain smudge-like things on their heads. The judgements and the supernatural battle of God vs. evil are fantastic- but this is no fairy tale with everyone living happily ever after. There is a dark tone of real suspense, as not all of the characters are alive by the end of the book.Also- I know one shouldn't judge a book by the cover- but Soul Harvest has an awesome one, I think!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"&quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; by Jerry Furland is a much better read, makes a lot more sense, and the best part, it is probably exactly where we are headed in the year 2009.

Although there is lots of action in Soul Harvest, I found the plot simple. Worse it moves at a ponderous pace. There was less biblical support for this book than prior efforts.

She was looking for this book in the series and it peeked my curiosity. I haven't gone to church too many times since my father's death several years ago, but I have been intrigued by my friends recent rediscovery of the church. Unfortunately, my career path does not afford me too many Sundays off in which to pursue a more hands-on return to the church-world, however I saw this as a possible way to see some of what is going on there. I seem to remember some of this from church in my childhood years, but of course it didn't impress me much then. I have to agree with some critics who say that this type of scare tactic may be a bit overboard for trying to convert people. It is a good eye opener for those of us who may be on the fence, but this is not a good starting point to get people to accept Jesus. No one should have to be threatened into believing anything, but especially in someone as kind and gentle as the Savior. These books tell an excellent story and give us all something to think about, but in our rush, rush, rush world we need to slow down sometimes and think about right now. I would encourage people to read these books and take whatever you can away from them, but do not focus your life on preparing for the Rapture or the hereafter. Live for today, share your faith and all of the good things it provides with your friends, with your family, live in Jesus' love everyday."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The pace has definitely slowed down, and the enthusiasm is fading. The series started off okay, but the tediousness of the searches went on and on for hundreds of pages, and it could have been shortened a lot. Not that I'm against a longer read, but for God's sake, use the pages wisely! If the authors want to have 400-page novels in a multi-volume series, they ought to spend much more of their material on character development, like Dostoyevski and Tolstoy do, not on mindless dialogue that feels like filler. They're slipping."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Please don't get me wrong, I love this series and it is what got me into reading the Bible after a 25 year lapse! For that, I am extremely grateful and I will continue to read this series, HOWEVER. I am sorry to say, I found this book very boring. Most of it consists of a search conducted by Rayford and Buck for their loved ones lost in the Wrath of the Lamb earthquake. It seemed to me the series had reached a standstill, and I was bored. The ostensibly &quot;thrilling&quot; parts, like Buck's rescue of Chloe from the hospital left me cold, wanting more interpretation of Scripture, and less &quot;thrills&quot;. I wish the authors would get back on track, and quit wasting my time and money.

Can't seem to find my other books in the series though... they are being passed around continuously to non-believers."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The series is tediously strung out. A short story would adequately entertain and present the plot and character development in Soul Harvest. Left Behind is vastly more engaging with its novel plot's imaginative and believeable interpretation of the End Times. Hopefully, it will reach a wide audience. If you like the series, read them all, but be prepared for exasperatingly overdrawn scenes and boredom as the series drags on. The real turn-off in all the books is the authors' absolute lack of any technical understanding of how things work. The continued functioning of the world after such widespread catastrophic destruction is ludicrous. The impossibility of it all is beyond any grace I could extend while wading through the nonsense to glean what little story there is in Soul Harvest. I gave up. The book's too silly. Invest your time reading the Bible."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Get it over with already. I don't mind it when authors stretch out a book/series a little but only if the authors stretch it using interesting filler (character backgrounds, cultural quirks, tons of detail) but these guys are wasting too much time with drivel. Really smelly gooey stinky drivel. Oh wait, I just described the book. This series was a great idea, no doubt about it. It has a solid message and started off fairly strong. It could have been not only a classic piece of literature, but also a marvelous tool for converting many people missing Christ. Oh well, at least they're trying. Apparently not too hard though."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I don't see how anyone could dislike this series and especially this book. I've heard many say this is on a middle school level or lower. I am a sophomore in high school and I believe it must be on a slightly lower level than some books so you can understand the book and its concepts. If you want it on a higher level, try to understand everything in the book of Revelation in the King James Version and see which you prefer. I personally rate this series at the top of my list, and this book, by far, is the best one in the series. It scares me to death to think of what will really happen when the Rapture does get here. Good job!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the latest &quot;effort&quot; of Mr. Jenkins and Mr. LaHaye. The vast majority of the book is spent looking for people and then he decides to throw 3 major events into the last 25 or so pages. This is very poor writing and is the exact opposite of the stunt they pulled in book 2, Tribulation Force, when they went with the &quot;6 months later&quot; gag throwing in a new character out of left field (Amanda) and everyone buddy-buddy and getting married. You don't spend 400 pages writing about one event (people wandering around looking for other people) and completely introduce a major event and resolve it in 2 pages (like a meteor the size of the Appalachian mountain range hitting the earth)! Either the authors were pressed to make deadlines and threw this in or their writing skills are beginning to come to light. They are excellent story-tellers (which is why the series is so popular), but it appears their writing talent leaves something to be desired. These books are beginning to remind me of some 2-bit TV soap opera. If you want to read a well written novel, try DEADLINE by Randy Alcorn. Read it and you will see the difference between good and poor writing."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Having written the stunning article \\"The Wrath of the Lamb\\" in the previous book, Antichrist Nicolae Carpathia suspects that Buck Williams is a Christian.

Lahaye and Jenkins show the emotional chaos and worldwide destruction through excellent descriptions.This book begins during the 21st month (halfway through) Nicolae Carpathia's reign. We see the fulfillment of more prophecies as we travel to Iraq, Israel, America, and other world communities. Life is now comprised of living in underground shelters, evangelism through direct contact and web sites, finding enough to eat, clean water to drink, and other Christians with whom to work.As prophesized, Nicolae knows that his time to rule the world is half-over. His hunger to devour the souls of those still on earth is his driving force. The general populace still sees him as a benevolent ruler, but we see behind the scenes where murder and anger rule the man-the Antichrist.Lahaye and Jenkins show more character development than in previous books and the action is fast paced and demanding. Some familiar characters are dead, but new ones take prominence in The Tribulation Force.By this point in the series, I was completely hooked. I had a hard time putting the book down, especially since I knew I had seven more on the bookshelf. As soon as I finished this book, I grabbed the next one.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The book that I choose to read was Soul Harvest. This is the Fourth book in the Left Behind series. Tim LaHaye, and Jerry B. Jenkins write it. The book is written very well. It is very descriptive, and uses a lot of imagery. The authors use the religion in the plot very well. It makes me actually believe that the rapture will be like it is described.Dr. Tim LaHaye is the person who thought of the entire Left Behind idea. He is a prophecy scholar, minister, and educator. He has forty nonfiction works that have sold more than 11 million copies. He lives in Southern California with his wife. Jerry B. Jenkins is an author of more than 100 books. Ten of them have been best sellers. He and his wife live in Colorado Springs.This book begins with the explanation of how Rayford Steele, and Buck Williams survived the wrath of the Lamb. The wrath of the Lamb was a global earthquake that occurred in the twenty-first month of the Tribulation. It is very evident in this story, that the world is starting to go toward the Trumpet Judgments, and the great soul harvest that was prophesized in the Scripture. As the world is starting to do this, Rayford and Buck start to look for their loved ones. Their loved ones are scattered around the world, so they travel all over the place trying to locate them. They go from Iraq all the way to America. They travel from the desert sand to the Tigris River. At the end of the book, Rayford and Mac are scuba diving in the river, and find a 747 under the water. While searching the bodies, Rayford finds a row of five bodies all in their row still. One of them is a woman who is holding a laptop case. Rayford recognizes her as his wife. He feels as though he should stay down there, and when the air runs out, just die with his loved one. Mac doesn't allow that, and pulls him up to the surface. The author kept me interested by using all his descriptive writing. I could actually visualize the scenery, and what was actually taking place. I think that the story is interesting, mainly because it takes religion, and makes it into a very good fiction book.The characters are just like a normal person. They are just like any other family person, except now they have found that they must turn to religion because the antichrist is coming. I think that Rayford is the most memorable character to me. I feel his pain when he doesn't have any of his family members around. Then at the end, when he finds his dead wife, I felt very bad, and I could see why he wanted to take his life. He didn't really have much more to live for, except for him.The theme of this book is that loved ones are always with you, even if they are not with you in person. They are with you in spirit. The authors are saying that life is just a stepping-stone to the bigger thing, heaven. I agree with the authors on this point. God only put people on this earth to mature them for when they get to heaven. Without people on earth, then there would not be the same kind of heaven that there is.I thought that this book was a very good book. It had very good writing techniques as well as a plot that was very interesting. There are no other series that uses religion as its main plot. The authors use a lot of descriptive writing to make the reader picture what is being written. This quote is describing Bucks girlfriend. \\" Her hand felt like a feather, and she seemed fragile as a newborn. What a contrast to the strong woman he had loved and come to know. She was not only fearless, but she was also smart. How he wished she was up to being his ally in this.\\" Pg. 253. This passage describes when they are taking off from a golf course. \\"Ritz throttled up and gradually increased the speed. Buck felt his pulse race as they roller-coastered the hills of the fairway, engines screaming. Ken hit the flat stretch and throttled up all the way. The force pressed Buck to his seat, but as he braced for liftoff, Ritz throttled back.\\" Pg. 222. This passage shows how the authors use scripture to make the story better. \\"I don't know if I'll find my Bible again, but I remember lots of passages. One of the first I learned was Romans 10; 9-10. It says, \`If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Pg. 133. This quote reflects on how Buck looked for his wife, but with not much hope in finding her. \\"Even with Tsion just around the side of the house, Buck felt overwhelmed with loneliness. His eyes stung with tears as he dug and grabbed and lifted and tossed in what was a likely futile effort to find his wife. Pg. 70. These quotes, and others all reflect on the writing styles of the authors. I think that almost every style of writing that they chose was a good choice.Professional Gail Hudson says that the book is very well done. She says that is written on the same pace as Tom Clancy and John Grisham stories. She says that its gripping scenes just make a vivid imprint on readers' minds. She also says that it is a book where believers can think of this series as a tangible and thrilling testament to the book of Revelations.This book was overall a very good book. Most readers would enjoy reading this book. The people who would enjoy it the most would be religious people. They would understand about what was all happening, and the signs that are seen. The only people who would not like to read the book would be an atheist."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I agree with one previous reviewer in that if you are this far into the series, you are probably hooked and the reviews probably won't sway you. I know that is true for me. I read this book immediately after Nicolae, and continued with Apollyon following, so I don't remember specifically which events happened in which book. But I can say this about the entire series....it is adicting. I can't seem to put it down. This series, while some would say &quot;preachy&quot;, depicts the TRUTH about Jesus Christ. Sure, the characters are fictional, and the story itself is an interpretation, but the truth of Christ it always unchanging.I love to see prophecy fulfilled, and anyone can find that today just be reading the newspaper, but this book takes a step (a small step) into future prophecy. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I just finished reading this very good chapter in the Left Behind series. Alot of the action sequences(I'm calling them action sequences because I don't want to spoil it by giving more description) were well written. I can't wait to read the next book, as well as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"If you're reading the series, read the first few pages and the last few pages of this book and skip the rest. Move on to book 5. You won't miss a thing.It seems the authors are trying to stretch this series for far more than it's worth. None of the books are terribly well written but this was the worst by far. The story line crawls along though there is almost no character development through this installment.This book should have been a chapter in the preceeding or subsequent books in the series. Usually a paragraph was enough to get me to sleep each night."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"To all lovers of the LEFT BEHIND series, let me recommend another sensational author you will love: Glenn Kleier. His novel, THE LAST DAY is nothing short of brilliant and I believe you will find it just as astounding as I have. It's become my all time favorite novel and I'd like to share the great enjoyment it gave me."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"These books seem to be getting less and less realistic as the series continues. If half the world's population has disappeared or been killed off at this point, then chances are there won't be much fetal tissue research or cloning going on. But these issues are mentioned just so they can be identified as evil symptoms of the end. And if a worldwide earthquake really knocked out every highway overpass from Chicago to Madison, then the characters couldn't have very well driven from Chicago to Milwaukee to Minneapolis and back in the time given in the book. There are tons of overpasses on the interstate, one every few miles, and even with a sport utility vehicle it would be slow going getting around each one that had collapsed.The antichrist doesn't really seem all that scary, either, nor his aides and cohorts. Maybe the authors need to read some biographies of Hitler and Stalin or something. If this Carpathia is truly the epitome of evil and villainy, then he should be a hundred times as nasty as he is."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The lame plot in this series is just pathetic. Here's an example: The Antichrist develops a worldwide cell phone network run by solar power. It's called Cellular Solar, or Cell-Sol for short. Get it? &quot;Sell soul.&quot; Ha, ha, very funny.If that's the best attempt at humor LaHaye and Jenkins can come up with, spare us the rest of the series and just wrap it up now. Don't prolong our agony. Just nuke the world already and get it over with."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Have you ever found yourself lost down the path of decision-making? Choosing a certain product to buy, a certain place to go or the very familiar self-question of which side to choose. However there are moments in life when the decisions are in black and white, it's a moral decision between good and evil.Nicolae Carpathia antichrist of the fist 2 years of tribulation has risen. Within Nicolae's leadership of the global community, he tends to bring the world global peace. Raise the people of earth unto one. But in the long await of Nicolae's promises, the people of the earth must live in fear and despair. Will people open their eyes and actually see if God is communicating with them?It is through the haunting of the recompenses and stumbling blocks, of not only the present but also the past, that the people will question themselves and their faith. People will search deep within themselves finding who they really are, but also who they will come to be. Figuring out some rather extraordinary information about them. Just sometime we all find something within our selves that others would not expect.In many times throughout a person's life, they will be forced to make decisions. Weather they like it or not. Rather it go smooth which is exactly what everyone would choose, they will be faced with many problems, causing other people not to make the same mistake. Therefore helping themselves and other people. Weather it be known or not, there are people in the world who will surprise you by offering help.Soul Harvest is the perfect book for the newborn Christian or the older Christian. It is also a very good read for the one who may be interested about the Christian faith. The book can target such an indifferent audience young / old or just curious. The book of Soul Harvest is sure to lift your heart and, make you actually think how thank full you are for the simple blessing that you receive every single day. It is a great reminder of how much worse a simple situation could turn into without God on your side!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is definitely the best of the series that I have read so far! I couldn't put it down! I got it on a Thursday night, and had finished it by Friday evening. It is action packed, and full of suspense! If you have read the first 3, get this one today!!!! Of course it leaves you wanting more, and I am ready to dig into Apollyon!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Of the first four books of the Left Behind series, Soul Harvest has to be the most action packed one. Now that Rayford and Buck have survived a global earthquake, the wrath of the Lamb, they now struggle to find their spouses. Rayford searches for Amanda, but doesn't know if she got on the plane that she was supposed to. Buck looks for Chloe which takes him on a six hour drive with a few high speed chases in between. As their journey progresses, they find that they have the symbol of unity, a cross on their foreheads that can only be seen by the followers. As flaming hail falls from the sky, this book continues to leave you wanting more.I cannot give this book five stars because of the level of writing. Every other review will tell you that these books are writtin on an 8th grade level, and I'll say so once again. These novels can't be compared to Crichton or Clancy at all. But this could also be a good thing. These aren't books that make you think real hard, you don't need a dictionary to read them, and they're an easy read which them really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After having read all 8 of the left behind series books over the last 3 weeks I can only say with a short word, WOW!I have read some people reviews criticizing the books for being to bland and written for a young audience. Most of what is written in these books comes from a book that is often referred to as bland and not very exciting, this book is affectionately known as the Bible. Do I have problems with these books I would have to say yes, consider if you would the cost of jet aircraft and jet fuel for said aircraft would be astronomical. Planes somehow being able to fly great distances (Israel to Illinois is over 5000 nm) without refueling stops add to the disillusion of the story. But this is why this work is referred to as fiction and not non-fiction, if it were based on more factual data the story would have more realism yes but it would be no less entertaining. There are portions of the books that do seem to drag along but for the most part books keep a good pacing and a wanting from the reader.I read from other readers that there is no cussing and other sins committed by these new believers, for this I can only state that sometimes people can radically change with God in their lives and perhaps that is something that these writers are attempting to convey with their writings. One thing that does bother me is the fact that the writers have now decided that 1 book a year will be all the put out for the series, is there a guarantee that there will only be another 4 books in this series? After all the first 42 months of the tribulation consumed 7 books and anyone who has read revelations will tell you that the next 42 months of what will be known as the Great Tribulation will be twice as intense as could every be imagined in the first 42 months. So is it possible that without an increase in the size and material explored in these next books that the series could become 15 or more books? If that is the case the rapture may occur before this series is every completed.I personally think some people are taking these books to replace the bible, instead of what these books are intended to be.And for those who still consider these books so poorly written let me point to you two of the most poorly penned books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The author of these two books is Dr. Robert Davis, they are titled; The Plutonium Murders and the Doomsday Kiss.Do I think the likes of Stephen King, Tom Clancy, John Grisham or others I will not list here have something to be frightened of by these authors the answer I am ashamed to say would be no. The vast majority of people in the world will never know these books as great writing or entertainment. I give the books a 5 star rating although in actuality I would say for character and plot development it would receive a 1 Star, for writing quality a 2 Star, for a reasonable plot and research a 2 Star (this being generous) but for overall being something I would recommend to others for the pure entertainment of everything I give the books my full recommendations."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"In Soul Harvest, the world is recovering from the wrath of the Lamb -- a global earthquake in the 21st month of the Tribulation. Nicolae Carpathia begins a worldwide rebuilding campaign and becomes enraged by an evangelistic effort resulting in the greatest harvest of souls the world has ever seen. As more and more judgment prophecies are fulfilled, hardly any skeptics remain. Even the enemies of God recognize whom they are fighting, and the world is compelled to take sides.The reader follows Tribulation Force as they journey from Iraq to America, from six miles in the air to underground shelters, from desert sands to the bottom of the Tigris River, from hope to devastation. While Rayford Steele and Buck Williams, earthquake survivors, search for their loved ones missing since before the earthquake, they find strength in Tsion Ben-Judah's spiritual leadership.This installment of the saga will keep your interest from start to finish. Even though you may know what will happen next, the excitement of following the story development is not dulled. Without divulging too much, plot twists and turns in Soul Harvest make for very entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"With SOUL HARVEST LaHaye and Jenkins have finally hit their stride. The fourth of the Left Behind series, this book combines the catastrophes of Revelation with some action, intrigue, and even some really interesting minor characters.The major characters are finally presented with some real problems (other than the major problem of being left behind), some real struggles, some real disappointments, and some new friends. This book introduces us to the excellent characters of Ken Ritz, maverick charter pilot, and Mac McCallum, co-pilot on the Antichrist's personal jet, and a few others.The story is consistently interesting in this book, and the outcomes of all the situations are not predictable. I look forward to reading the rest of the series, and recommend it to those who want a series of fast-reading and diverting books."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I am a 20 year old college student. I claim to be a Christian but after reading these books, I noticed some repriortizing should be done. Believe me, being in college and trying to complete this is a major task. So, here goes my message for the book. I am inclined to agree with the majority of reviews for the Left Behind series. I started reading the series in June and have just completed the 4th book, and I have come to one conclusion. These books have a mysterious addicting power. I am holding my copy of book 5 here, ready to read it. The message of the book of Revelations is laid out in a easy to read, easy to understand manner, but the message is TOO is to read and understand. The book deserves 3 stars because a captivating message is hiding behind a weak plot and a 2nd grade reading level. I'm sure the authors had good intentions, making the book easy to read for everyone, thus spreading the message further. But, I personally think they have underestimated our powers of comprehension. Yet, like most others I will continue to buy and read every book in the series!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"These books will take you on the ride of your life! The characters emotional battles as well as their physical emcumbrances will take you on a wild trek of emotions. Their struggles are realistic and the story line follows scripture accurately.Much of the story is involved in rescue missions after the earthquake and the suffering they endure as a result. Will Buck find Chloe? What will happen when new trumpet judgments unfold? Tsion's messages offer hope to those who will receive it--even those who read about it in this book.If Jenkins and LaHaye's interpretation of scripture is correct--about the rapture occuring before the great tribulaion, and I believe it is--then I'm thankful that I won't have to suffer through it. Will you? These novels are inspired of God and timely, because time is running out. Prophesies are being fulfilled regarding Christ return.

I came on-line just to write this review -- that is how much I loved it!But, let me tell you, I was waiting for the Trumpet Judgements to occur, since I knew that they sounded so -- for lack of a better word -- cool! I won't give the whole book away, but let me just tell you that two or three of them will occur at the end (and I do mean the end!) of this book. Although I believe that the best part of the book is at the end (or the last 50 pages), the whole thing is very good and very well written.I must go now... I need to read &quot;Apollyon&quot;...

The fate of Chloe, Amanda, Hattie and others are plotted, with surprising results, and more of the 144,000 witnesses are revealed. Nicolae Carpathia's position is strengthened, and the relationship between himself and Rayford is becoming increasingly strained.It is probably the best of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series yet, as the action is continuous, and there are surprises around every corner.

My husband and I enjoy reading these books and look foward to each new arrival. It is so good, we stayed up till 2 am to finish reading it aloud, despite the fact my husband had to work the next day! It is so interesting to see how the story lines up with the Biblical prophecy in Revelation. I am anxious to read the next 3 books! Regarding the other review, I had read part of it and was disappointed that the reviewer disclosed some information regarding the story line. However, I was still surprised by the events of the book and enjoyed reading all of it. I don't feel the story was ruined for me. Soul Harvest is a well-written and exciting book. I also appreciate the authors' centrality to what is most important. Well done, sirs!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I enjoyed soul Harvest, mostly because I am a sucker for action novels with apocalyptic events and I've come to like the characters, despite the fact that they are virtually interchangeable. In soul harvest Ray, Buck (the cradle-robber), and his college-girlfriend-turned-stepford-wife are in real trouble when the big quake hits and they are all separated. Can Buck find Chloe? Can ray find Amanda? Do we care?I admit I never liked Amanda, and found Ray's mourning, and hand-wringing a bit annoying. Ray's obsession with proving Amanda's innocence was ridiculous, and reading about another saintly dead wife is a drag. Likewise Buck's frenetic search for Chloe reminds me of the last book when Chloe injured her foot in the quake. I'm not a big fan of Buck/Chloe romance either. He's way too old for her.My reservations aside, I LIKED Soul Harvest. Much less preachy than previous novels, and some good characters were introduced.I still feel LaHaye lacks the ability to write deep characters, as his Christian characters are too saintly and lack flaws. Once a character becomes a 'believer' it seems to make him a mindless flawless robot who all believe the same way. No variation. No questioning. LaHaye seems to equate Christian=Zombie. Also the Trib force seems a little callous, and cruel. Towards the end of the book when they were badgering sick Hattie to \\"Find God\\" I was disgusted. It reminded me of the Catholic priests badgering the Hawaiians to convert as they lay on their deathbeds suffering from pox. It's up to God to judge who will go to heaven, not up to the tribulation force. When Ray says he believes Hattie will go to \\"Hell\\" because she hasn't been born again I felt he'd crossed a line into a judgmental bigot. Only God will decide who will go to Heaven and Hell. Not Ray.4 stars. Read it for the action, and a bit of good religion. Don't expect much from the characters. They're all alike, and sometimes their sanctimony and pretension can be tiresome."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I thought this was the best book written in the sereis thus far. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I must admit that I was quite taken in as was Rayford about Amanda and can hardly wait to see what messages are on her hard drive. This is a must read for any christians curious about the trumpet calls or Revelation in general."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"First of all, I'd like to say that I can't stop reading this book. I found Nicholae not quite as temping to read all the time, but this one I can't leave it alone. Likely due to the earthquake and how it disrupted the mundane.Secondly, I'd like to comment on Good intentions, horrible execution. We read this book from the perspective of basicly three individuals. Three people who were happy with their lives until God raptures His believers. These people could be any of us. I don't feel it is far fetched. How does one write a book with the world's perspective, and not key characters. Their feelings are real. Their actions are real. Every day some older guy marries some younger girl. This is reality! Determination to be with someone you truly love is also reality. Seeing your love dead and wishing to be with him/her is reality. The Tribulation Force of close believers is real. Of course there would be hundreds all over the world during the tribulation. Dr. Ben-Judah is called by God to teach and spread the word so unbelievers can be saved from an eternity of Hell. I am glad for his willingness to share his knowledge.For the record - I rather enjoy the pages with large margins. Feels like I am reading faster. To me it is what is written on the pages that draws my attention. Not petty things like the margins, and book thickness, and age."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I borrowed a copy of Left Behind and read it in one night.

TO MY WONDERFUL SURPRISE, Soul Harvest was released a month early. I 'left behind' Left Behind, picked up Trib Force, Nicolae and Soul Harvest. The story keeps getting better and better...and building in its intensity!! I loved the humor of Chloe around the middle of the book, the vivid portrayals of the judgements brought upon the earth and the realism of the charachters. Some of the charachters in the book who reject the gospel message remind me of some the low ranking responses on here. Jerry, Tim--if you're reading this, get through the rest of the series quickly!!!

You almost tempt me to go pick up the kids series :)"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"&quot;Left Behind,&quot; (the series,) was an easy read, with an also too easy to follow plot. I preferred Jerry Furland's view of a more realistic turn of future events in his novel, &quot;Transfer: The end of the beginning.&quot; It has a more believable scenario, is less opinionated, and is more intelligently written than &quot;Left Behind.&quot; &quot;Transfer&quot; left me wanting more, and thankfully there is-it is the first novel of a trilogy. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have now officially taken sides on the issue of this immensely popular series. While I probably will finish the series, it is not worth all of the hype that it has received. There are plenty of other Christian fiction novels that are better written, more inspirational and have characters that are more true-to-life.In this 4th installment of the series, the story gets a little bit out of hand. The events of the book of Revelation become very turbulent - lots of people dying in catastrophic events - and so many people seem to ignore the presence of God. More troubling to me however was the way so many of the main group of characters suddenly became believers. With no prior faith and comparatively little information they all of a sudden are giving their life to God. while I feel this would be wonderful it did seem a little bit far-fetched to me.The main circle of characters we are used to reading about seems to be all we get to read about. I would have been interesting in knowing more about what the general population seems to think about the events in the book, but apparently the authors don't (or aren't creative enough to give life to the masses). The characters don't seem all of that concerned about others either. They are not evangelizing (with the exception of Ben-Judah) and are hiding their faith. This doesn't make me want to be proud of my faith and would not convince an unbeliever that Jesus is Lord.Why 3 stars?: The series is losing steam. Long passages could have been cut out of this book (and its predecessors for that matter). The characters are getting more and more fantasized and less like real people. A disappointment, though I have to admit I probably will grit my teeth and finish out the series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"For so many years, a Christian's only real option to read quality Christian literature was to read the marevelous C.S. Lewis. I feel blessed in the the last couple of years with the outpouring of quality literature now available. What's more, the different books are all very different. Left Behind is a wonderful introduction to the theology behind the End Times and a great series for all ages. We All fall down is a great book for more mature, intellegent Christians who wsnt to explore the individual ramifications of the End Times and the one on one relationship of a man who has fallen away from God. The Christ Clone Trilogy is a thrilling, Tom Clancey like look at these events, full of unexpected twists and turns. I know some people like to argue the various merits of these books as compared to each other, but I think they are all worth reading and feel lucky to finally have such a wide variety of GREAT Christian literature available."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"It seems to me that every book following &quot;Left Behind&quot; is merely a repitition.

If the war broke out and there were serious earthquakes, would you report to a minimum wage job? ( the clerk at the car rental) 2. Most of the world population is dead or dying but people manage to hang out online. 3. Chicago experiences nature at its worse yet, these guys still manage to drive to Milwaukee. ( I can't even get around in Chicago when we have a snowstorm or a Bears game ) 4. The women are M.I.A. in most of the novel. 5. The women are either bad, dumb or obedient. 6. The female characters are undeveloped. 7. The first half of the story drags. 8. This book slams Catholics. 9. The anti-christ is scary if you think a corporate CEO is scary. 10. The ending was disappointing."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The series as a whole is fantastic. The third book was a bit slow for me but the ending made me sit up and take notice. Soul Harvest kept the pace going. Buck and Ray looking for their wives, wondering if Rabbi Tsion was alive, all of that was great to read. I cannot wait for the next book, but i will."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I can't say enough good things about this series.

The characters and situations they encounter are believable and teach valuable lessons to all readers. The authors leave you hanging on waiting for the next book due out next August. Read all 4! You won't be sorry. However, you might choose to spend hours reading! I know I did and loved every minute."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"&quot;Soul Harvest&quot; is a book that made me use every emotion I have. &quot;Joe the baker&quot; was hilarious! Parts of the book were a little slow such as the search for Amanda and Chloe but if it were real life, they would probably be almost impossible to find. The authors did a superb job on this series. My 13 year old son has read the series right along with me. It was a great way to spend part of our summer all though it didn't take long to read. Please hurry with the next book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"My grandchildren and I have loved all the books in this series and this is probably the best of the lot. We could not put it down. It is so wonderful to find a book that is Biblical, exciting, well written, AND that grandparents can enjoy along with their grandchildren. Thanks to LaHaye and Jenkins! We can hardly wait for the next one. Kathryn and Rachel Presley"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The fourth book of the Left Behind series again has me praising God for His grace and His love. The suspense was killing me as to whether Chole and Amanda were still alive. Buck is still thrilling readers everywhere with his narrow escapes and Nicolae is becoming more and more arrogant. Thanks to Mr. Jenkins and Mr. LeHaye readers can gain a clear understanding of future events predicted in Revelation. The message is clear...Come to Jesus NOW!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have been looking forward to this book for sometime now. I was plesantly surprised at the additional characters introduced and the pace of the action. The pages kept turning, (I read it in less than 24 hours after buying it). However, I had a feeling of being rushed during the last 50 or so pages, and thought they should have spent more time on the firey hail-storm, etc.I was excited to learn that a very clear presentation of the &quot;Gospel&quot; was laid out for all to see and read! I would recommend this read to everyone, but would suggest starting from the beginning of the now four book series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After reading through many of the other comments, I must agree that it will be hard to wait for an entire year for the next release. I was almost hysterical at the end of Nicolae and told my pastor, who knows Tim LaHaye, to tell Tim that he had no right by letting us hang, not knowing what happened. Once again, he has left us hanging. As an avid reader, usually of murder mysteries, I am thrilled when a book grabs my attention and I can't put it down. This has happened with all four of these books. I read Left Behind in 24 hrs, staying up till 3 in the morning to finish it. Tribulation Force was 48 hrs and Nicolae a few days. Soul Harvest I finished in two days, reading it at every chance I got. I've heard people say that friends and family members are getting saved because of these books. I eagerly look forward to number 5 to see what happens. (I must say that every book I read, I am relieved that I won't be here on earth to experience it. I'll be one of those that disa! ppears during the Rapture...)"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all the books so far .

It has been a gentle reminder of the things to come and the importance of the here and now!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book was an excellent followup to this wonderful series. LaHaye and Jenkins have an outstanding grasp of the events that are prophecized in Revelation. As these events unfold before us daily, the authors give a very plausable depiction of what could happen."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I thought this particular book may not have been the best in the series so far, but it is still great. It's wonderful to be able to read a great story that's fast paced, interesting, educational, and Christian. I've read Revelations many times and understood it so much better from this series. If you have friends that are &quot;lukewarm&quot; Christians or not Christians at all, this will definately fire them up! I beg the authors to please hurry and finish the series (before the rapture preferably) because I strongly feel these events are imminent. Don't wait to take sides!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This, the latest in the series by Lahaye and Jenkins is still as powerful as the previous books in the series. Excited to find answers to some lingering questions, I was upset to turn the page and find it the last in the book. This series crosses all religious boundaries. Although touted as religious reading, I think those that would never pick up a \`religious' book, would enjoy the drama and human struggle of man &amp; woman finding their place in a world torn apart by cataclysmic phenomenon. --- Start with Left Behind and be prepared to run out or stay in and order the rest of the books in this series. I, myself, will find in hard to wait until February to find out about the Great Meeting in Israel, what is on Amanda's disk and Hattie's conversion."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I found Soul Harvest to be thought provoking.

Lets hope the books bring others to Christ."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all four of the books that are out and it is a very exciting story.

I enjoyed this book due to the suspense level it had in it. Searching for their loved ones...Buck and Rayford start becoming more of a nuisance to the Antichrist. Carpathia is finally losing his patience toward the end of the novel with the prophecies in Revelation becoming fulfilled. However...one disappointing factor to this work was little detail and not much time spent on the beginning of the Trumpet Judgements...especially the second and third ones."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Though so far the first four could have been combined into one book, and it's very easy reading, these books are some of the best I've ever read. Can't wait till the Assassins comes out!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest, the fourth book in the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, changed the way I viewed my unsaved friends and family. After reading this book you are sure to feel an urgency about evangelism. There is not a page in this book that will make you want to put it down. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Excellent, these books should be on every best seller list. What an execellent way to witness. If you don't know where your going when you die, or if you think you might be wrong, these books will make you think."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Yes, they took a long time to find the ladies. But that's realism. In reality, when events such as these occur, it may very well take that kind of tenacity for day to day life. I have read the entire series as the books are released, and I can't wait for book 5, which should be out in 4/99, I think. It's frightening to think this is how it could all happen. Let's hope that if this is how it happens, we aren't 'Left Behind'-God bless and be with you all, and read not only this book, but the whole series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I loved Soul Harvest as much as the rest of the series because I can't get enough of these characters and want to know more about the end-times. These series really helps me to understand Revelation which can go right over your head. I feel it was necessary in Soul Harvest to set up for book 5 &quot;Apollyon&quot; which I just finished. That that book speeds up alot and is very exciting and frightening. Run, don't walk to get it."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"These books are so interesting! I have recently finished reading about the Soul Harvest and am currently reading Left Behind the first book. My mother and I have argued about who should read this book and are now sharing it. I am reading it currently and it is very interesting.

MY SISTER IS SMART, SHE IS WAITING UNTIL SHE HAS THEM ALL AND CAN FINISH WITH ALL BEING PUBLISHED SO SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WAIT."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Here's a thought about Christian fiction in general and this series in particular. A few years ago an article in Christianity Today reviewed the state of contemporary Christian fiction, and it made this perceptive observation. There are two major genres of Christian fiction: historical romances and end-times thrillers. In other words, Christians either have a sentimental, nostalgic look back to the past, where things may have been simpler or &quot;more Christian,&quot; or they look forward to an apocalyptic future where God stomps out all his enemies. Unfortunately, this means that Christians are not doing much critical thinking about how to engage the world in the present.Clearly this series falls in the latter category. I hope and pray that all the fans of this series, which of course are legion, are not simply gleefully and passively awaiting God's judgment on unbelievers but rather are spurred on to Christian discipleship, obedience and evangelism in the present. Is passing around copies of these books the way to do that? I'm not sure, since it seems like LaHaye and Jenkins are primarily preaching to the choir. Christians need to think carefully about how best to present the good news of Jesus to the world in today's present setting, not some speculative future-tense scenario."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"What a great way for the authors to do their Christian duty. The authors are witnessing to thousands if not millions of people through their fictional series &quot;Left Behind.&quot; I was sad to read so many negative comments about the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. The authors are sharing their talents to spread the word about Jesus Christ and to help build His kingdom. Although the series is fictional, it is based on fact. It's reality people! All the prophecies in the series are from the Bible! The Rapture is going to happen! No one knows when the Rapture will occur not even Jesus or the angels in heaven! Only God knows! The authors just want everyone to be prepared. I truely belive Jesus will tell the authors, &quot;Well done my good and faithful servants.&quot; All over the world, there are people who really DO NOT know the Lord and there are people who just simply reject Him. (Note: It is mentioned in the Bible that people will reject Jesus). For those who do not know Him and have read the series thus far to learn of Him, stay with it, and don't give up, because the Lord shall never leave you. And for those who choose to reject Him, the Lord knows you not. If you are rejected by the Lord on judgement day, you shall be condemned to the Lake of Fire which is worse then being in hell. (I hope everyone knows and understands that even the souls in hell must stand before the Lord on judgement day.) The flesh is weak and I know everyone will not be saved, it is to be expected. Just like the series, even today, we must choose. There are only two sides to choose from: Stand with the Lord or stand with man. (Hint-Hint: Man never wins)"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is not quite up to par with the other books in the series. It reads slower and is more confusing because of the jumping around.Still conforms to Revelations."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I've read a few negative reviews of the book and the series for that matter, and it's dissapointing. I'm not saying that because I loved it everyone should ... well actually I am saying that.I mean come on people ! There are very few places to read an adventure like this and still &quot;raise the Matchless name of Jesus Christ &quot; at the same time . Although , I thought the writing in the first book in the series paled when compairing it to &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; I've loved every minute of the reading.

Tim and Jerry have a real gift--I can envision everything from the devestating, worldwide earthquake, to the hail, fire and blood . These books were impossible to put down, and I lost much sleep over them, but they're worth it! I would recommend these books for believers and non-believers alike.

I'm looking forward to the next book. Finished it in two days. I just could'nt put it down. I really wish that the end of the book had more story to it instead of waiting to the next book. I think they should just make one big book so we don't have to wait, but as long as there maiking it I'll wait. Can't wait to the next book!

GOD BLESS YOU BOTH!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I couldn't wait until August. Much to my surprise the book store called sooner than I expected. I rushed to get it and started reading. After having read the first three books I feel as if I know these people on a personal level. I found myself crying with them as well as cheering them on. And Tsion Ben-Judah, well, I can just see him frantically typing on the internet sending out the message of salvation. The &quot;sign of the believers&quot; was a wonderful element. Wonderful book ! I will be looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"If you haven't picked up your copy of Soul Harvest yet, what are you waiting for? Jerry Jenkins has provided another terrific novel for the Left Behind series. I really enjoyed Soul Harvest and even laughed my way through a good portion of some of the scenes, especially those that occurred in various hospitals. Great book! Great ending! Jenkins leaves his readers hanging on for The Assassins, the fifth book in the series. Too bad we have to wait another year!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"OK, to show you how much I enjoyed reading this book, I will tell you this. It is 11:20 am at the time I am righting this, I bought the book at about 12:00 yesterday. I started to read this book and I couldn't put it down. I read it all in about 10 hours!!!!! It was funny how many major events got mushed into the last couple of pages, but I am expecting &quot;The Assasins&quot; to pick up right where this book left off. Even if it doesn't and you want more detail, go read your Bible! It is all in there. Anyway I don't want to disclose any of the story so I'll just thank the authors for another job well done. I reccomend anybody to go right now and buy these books."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"LaHaye and Jenkins have done it again. With the release of &quot;Soul Harvest&quot;, they compently intertwine the sadness and frustrations of living in such a time of crisis while still keeping up with biblical prophecy. I do however agree with previous reviews about certain reviewers revealin information that could by any chance ruin the book for someone (obviously that happened). But for the book, i think it could not have been done much better."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"While I'm not one to rank the Left Behind series among my alltime favorites, it has been an enjoyable read. Until now, that is.Soul Harvest is a disappointing filler that seems more an effort to cash in on the series' overall success than an integral part of the story. Whether or not the authors planned to expand the series to 7 books from the start I don't know, but it would appear that they have decided to take a good thing too far. More time and dialogue goes into deciding whether or not to open the briefcase of a dead man than the anti-climactic judgements of God rained down upon the earth. Where I put down Nicholae eager to devour the next installment, after finishing Soul Harvest I feel empty, a little cheated and only mildly curious about what comes next."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest is easily one of the most memorable entries in the Left Behind series. It picks up from the cliffhanger in Nicolae, with the Tribulation Force (and the world) in chaos and searching for missing loved ones. SH includes the introduction of some memorable characters, Leah Rose and Doc Charles, the painful searches of Ray and Buck for their wives, and the discovery of a new safe house.I can easily recommend Soul Harvest as one of my favorites in the Left Behind series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"this is a fablous book and it teaches what might happen some day. so read it . it is a grat book and the way it is writen is by 2 authors and each writes a part for each caharactor and it is really neat, even to the detail and the dialog of the story is great."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I enjoyed this 4th in the Left Behind series, though at times it was a bit too preachy. In fact, I found the Apocalypse series, DOMAIN, by Steve Alten to be far more realistic and scary, especially the recently-released RESURRECTION. Alten's take on the afterlife and his images of Hell were...well, startling."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The series was based on an intriguing topic, but the author took so disgustingly long to say anything the only thing left in the series was suspense, and the only suspense was: WHEN IS ANYTHING EVER GOING TO HAPPEN??"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is the best one I have read this year.

I just simply couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is mostly about the earthquake... ...Buck and Chloe find out something very interesting. Buck starts to say goodbye to The GC's Magazine... ...Foundation is laid for the next book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is the 7th book I've read in this series. It is hands-down, the best-imaginable way to happily endure an otherwise unsufferable 40 minutes on an exercise bike. Or a tiresome day in airplanes with bad air. It is well-paced and well-written. The four books I have read concurrent with this series were by Robert McNamara, Edward Said, Jamling Norgay and Thomas Gold, so I frankly object to reviews I've read that suggest these books are written for those with an 8th grade intelligence levels. They are exceptionally entertaining - the ultimate escape from a tedious situation."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is the latest book that I have read by these two authors. Through this I was able to witness and share to non believers. These two authors have managed to write a book on the end times just as they will be according to scripture. no series of books have affected this much as this series has. This a definite must for any Christian. Adding these books to your bookshelf is something that you will never regret, I certainly haven't and i have all 8 of them. If you buy any books this year please buy this series, the series is amazing it really is."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest proves to be the best in this series. If you have started from Left Behind, Book 1, you have a terrific sense of the major characters, their goals, and their point of view. You can identify with at least one of the major characters and Soul Harvest will have you reading to learn the fate of each of them. This book won't let you put her down until you've read the very last word."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"My favorite one of the series.The narration goes to a whole lot of characters.The best part is Rayford going undercover in Carpathia's underground base which adds to the suspense."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Another enthtralling addition to the series.

It is very hard for me to put down these books. I enjoy them thoroughly and recommend them to all of you who find reading the bible boring."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"LaHaye and Jenkins' fourth book in the series, again offers a slow and winding ride to the Glorious Appearing of Christ. Though not as slow as Nicolae, it's still in the early stages to know if it's going to get better. Though I'm now 1/3 of the way to the end of the series, I have a sneaking suspicion they probably could've condensed it into seven books instead of twelve.I'm a Catholic and I love stories from the bible and am very interested in the Book of Revelations, so I had high hopes for this going in, but I feel like I'm going to end up with a 'meh' feeling at the end. Instead of increasing the urgency of the times, the authors take every chance they get to preach the word to every new person they meet. Okay, we get the point, accept Christ into your hearts or you won't be accepted into heaven.I don't mean to seem blase about the whole thing, but you want people to be entertained as well. The authors dispense with the obvious thrill aspect and fill it with boring exposition. Example: A quarter of the world just died...DIED. The horrors around them should be horrendous, the stench should be overwhelming. I wanted to feel that apocalyptic sense of urgency and yet it was played off like a day at the doctor's waiting room and \\"let's read the bible some more.\\"It could've played out like a thrilling Christian movie on a grand scale, not a 17-hour sermon."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Ok the first book was good, the second slow, the third one picked up for me and now, I'm having hell (pardon) getting thru this one. Last book we spent a lot of time trying to figure out where Buck and Rayford were and now we are looking for Chloe and Amanda. I think it's becoming a bit repetitive, but hopefully it speeds up again."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"From the very first letter of the alphabet that my eyes looked upon inside this series of books, until the very last period of the very last sentence, I was hooked. Each one of these books absorbed my attention like no other book has ever done in my life. Biblically sound, theatrically entertaining, and brilliantly written, the Left Behind books will inspire you to dig into God's word and take the pieces of news from your T.V. screen and match them right smack-dab up with the prophecies of the Bible. Your hair will stand up, your heart will race, and you will find yourself helplessly caught in the suspense. Once you finish one of these books, you will desperately race to your computer screen or your local library to pick up the next one!Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor ofIt All Began...

But you keep reading in hopes that something will turn around and it will get moving. I read it because I had read the ones before and wanted to know how the story ends.

It touches the heart of Christianity; the reason Jesus was sent to earth. I found everything about this fourth book in the series to be pleasant. It was like reading a letter from a family member (one you actually love) or a good friend. It has been years since I first read this novel, but still remember its original impact: motivation to seek the face of God like never before. Let's fact it - these novels are about leading people to Christ...they do their job well."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This series is the best! I'm about 20 pages away from the end of this book and then I'm immediately moving onto the next book (apollyon) This book as you already know is the fourth installment of the Left Behind Series. &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; continues from where the book &quot;Nicolae&quot; left off. The earthquake... Cameron Williams aka Buck, is looking for any survivors from the earthquake. He finds many dead and few in NOT injured. In the mean time Rayford is convinced that his wife Amanda is still alive. But in their previous mentors notes was something quite disturbing to the Tribulation Force. Well, not everyone knows of this yet, and some they do not wish to tell for it could destroy ones life. I can't tell you what happens, because that would ruin the story for you. But if you wanna know this secret and read some interesting yet funny stuff you are in for a treat! I was laughing so hard and crying at other parts.

After one catatrophic plague after another, the world will some experience the Trumpet Judgements as described in Revelation ch. 8 & 9. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit brings about the great Soul Harvest and the 144,000 Jewish witnesses are sealed of the twelve tribes of Israel [Revelation 7]. Rayford Steele and Buck Williams search for loved ones from different parts of the world. The journey takes you from Iraq to America, from the air to underground shelters, from the desert to the Tigris River. Steele and Williams do everything they can to hold off the destructive path of Nicolae-the Antichrist.

The authors have once again brilliantly delivered another intriguing masterpiece. I didn't think it could get better than 'Nicloae' but once again the authors have out done themselves. If these books don't enlighten Biblical end time events I don't know what will.Glen Kleier's &quot;The Last Day&quot; was also an awesome 'end time' novel, however I have to admit I love how the authors of this series take time to go into intricate detail, providing a combination of adventure and Biblical interpretation."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"As far as Judgment Day novels go, this pales in comparison to such soul-rattling books as Kleier's THE LAST DAY. The characters in HARVEST are weakly developed and the storyline feels contrived, artificial. Each book in the LEFT BEHIND series seems to lose more steam. For harder-edged, more reality-based suspense, read Kleier."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I found Soul Harvest to be engaging and very riveting. The ideas and mysteries presented made you want to move along and see what was to come next. The writing style, as with the entire series, is open and very easy to read. To me, accuracy in Scripture is necessary, and I believe LeHaye and Jenkins have succeeded. I recommend this book and all the books of the series to anyone who is truly interested in the end times."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Don't read these novels after reading good fiction like Sophie's Choice, The Last Day, The Triumph and the Glory, or Catcher in the Rye, Jenkins and LaHaye suffer in the comparison. I'm all for the idea of spreading the gospel because we need all the we can get in these times, and I'm a believer, but one shouldn't confuse support for these books with support for Christ. Many people liked Left Behind, and even Tribulation Force, but let's be honest here, these last couple efforts have been feeble works of fiction. I've posted my e-mail address above if anyone cares to try and persuade me I've missed something in Nicolae and Soul Harvest."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"A friend recommended I read the first book.

I cannot wait to get my hands on the next two books. I thank God that the authors have brought God to the forefront.

How comforting it is to know that my hope is secure in Christ Jesus, and that I don't have to worry about the tribulation. However, it should also spur us on as Christians to witness to others and share the gift that has been so freely given to us. I encourage you all to think about things in terms of eternity.

Get it today!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The whole series of these books are truly incrdible. Even though no one can predict the acutal happenings and the lives of individuals &quot;Left Behind,&quot; this series is Biblical. No matter what you are interested in, these books will capture your interest. Besides in this world of &quot;whats in it for me?&quot;, these books let you know."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"If you are going to read #4 in the series any review you read will be of little benefit as by now you are hooked in and will read it anyway. If you're new to the series this is by far one of the more exciting books, in a fantasy sort of way. Afterall good fiction should entertain and you shouldn't question the credibility of a good story if you're into it. There is lots of international intrigue that would make a good action type thriller. Of course a good script that would embellish the efforts of LaHaye and Jenkins would make it all the better. My main problem with the series is that it is is written at a juvenile level. Maybe the intent was to reach as many readers as possible or maybe there are just that many poor readers but I do wish the content was a little more geared beyond the 8th grade. The message as you know deals with the authors interpretation of the Bible but the preaching is minimal in this one as the action takes over much of the plot. A pretty easy read for believers and non-believers alike."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Seems like most of the reviewers of this series are Christians, so I thought I would contribute a non-believer's view--it may surprise you that this series is one of the most addictive I have ever read.So why would an atheist like this overly preachy, poorly written book series? Because it's a great story--it's that simple.The book of revelations has always interested me--I especially liked Stephen King's The Stand, and The Omen movie series, but this series of books has taken a more literal interpretation of the Bible, which is intriguing. I like the idea of following a small group of people through the Tribulation, seeing how they deal with the wrath of God, etc. All great stories have conflict--and what could be a better conflict than good vs. evil?; throw in earthquakes, firey hail, and general mass chaos and this is a perfect recipe for a good book.By the way, this book has NOT made me more of a &quot;believer;&quot; as a matter of fact, I am probably more of an atheist now than ever...the more I read and learn about the Bible, the less I believe any of it actually happened. That doesn't mean it isn't interesting, though. I will continue to read and study the Bible and its messages--after all, we atheists don't have ANY book to follow."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Faster paced than the previous books in the series, this book shows our heroes in serious, life-threatening situations. The good guys vs. the bad guys become more evident and active than in the previous editions. New mysteries are revealed that will virtually turn the pages for you, screaming for answers such as the real story behind Bruce's death and what will be found on the bottom of the Tigris River. But the most memorable and humorous line in the entire series so far can be found in this book - One of the characters says, &quot;If this is the 'Wrath of the Lamb', then I think I better make friends with that lamb!&quot;"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I think that this is my favorite of the Left Behind books so far. This novel basically covers what hapens immediately before and after the 'wrath of the Lamb'--the great global earthquake and the sixth seal judgement. If you're just looking at this book, read Left Behind, Tribulation Force, and Nicolae first to get the full impact. Fabulous book; can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Perhaps you feel that the series has been somewhat predictable. Soul Harvest had a couple of twists and turns of the plot that made it extra-good reading. I do believe I enjoyed this one somewhat more than Nicolae.I enjoyed the two new characters in this book - both Rayford and Buck gained a new Christian brother that helped them in their adventures. The idea of the sign of the cross on the foreheads of believers (which is visible only to other believers, but not oneself!) was very interesting.The whole series follows a &quot;Pre-Trib&quot; point of view. The word pictures that Jerry Jenkins paints remain vivid in the reader's mind. The characters and the events which are SO memorable really &quot;flesh out&quot; the events described in Revelation. The potential problem is that people could think that this is exactly how things will happen. While it is a widely-held point of view, and a well-respected one, the series is still fiction.I have studied the book of Revelation before and I know that as a result of this series, I'll definitely be studying it again soon!I would encourage anyone who is enjoying the Left Behind series to check out the authors' non-fiction book about end times Revelation theology. It's called &quot;Are We Living in the End Times?&quot;These books ALL leave you hanging at the end - a good reason for reading them one right after another!WARNING: the end of this book is somewhat gruesome; however, I read very few little fiction of any kind, and gory stuff almost not at all!Please check out my other reviews of Christian books and Christian music."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After reading through many of the other comments, I must agree that it will be hard to wait for an entire year for the next release. I was almost hysterical at the end of Nicolae and told my pastor, who knows Tim LaHaye, to tell Tim that he had no right by letting us hang, not knowing what happened. Once again, he has left us hanging. As an avid reader, usually of murder mysteries, I am thrilled when a book grabs my attention and I can't put it down. This has happened with all four of these books. I read Left Behind in 24 hrs, staying up till 3 in the morning to finish it. Tribulation Force was 48 hrs and Nicolae a few days. Soul Harvest I finished in two days, reading it at every chance I got. I've heard people say that friends and family members are getting saved because of these books. I eagerly look forward to number 5 to see what happens. (I must say that every book I read, I am relieved that I won't be here on earth to experience it. I'll be one of those that disa! ppears during the Rapture...)"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The comparisons between end-times novels which have been made by other reviewers is probably useful, so here's my take on the matter.Last Day makes no attempt at all to adhere to scriptural prophecy. It is, in fact, less accurate scripturally than The Omen movies or End of Days. If you want a fun read and don't care whether the story has any connection to scripture, it's okay.Left Behind is an action adventure written primarily for Christians with a huge cross-over into the secular market. It sticks very closely to scripture and to prophecy of the time during the Tribulation. There is never any doubt of the authors' position and which characters are good and which are bad. Beyond that, there's been so much said about Left Behind by other readers that probably every possible opinion has been expressed. Some love it. Some hate it. Personally, I like the Left Behind series a lot.The Christ Clone Trilogy, my definite favorite among the list, is written for a secular audience with a big cross-over into the Christian market. Through most of the 3 books you don't know what the author's position is or which (if any) of the characters speak for him. Only in the last book do you find out he is a Christian and that he is using his story telling ability to reach the lost with the Gospel and the danger that faces them if they do not accept it.We All Fall Down is a story of a man forced to make decisions about himself and God when faced by undeniable evidence that the Bible is true. It's an interesting exploration in character but the author's development of the events of the Tribulation is muddled and very thin. The thing most Christians object to about We All Fall Down is the non-stop use of extreme profanity by the main character. It was hard for me to get past all the f-words, and I certainly would not say I enjoyed it, still it made me think."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"One series of books that I never wanted to read was the Left Behind series. I'm a Christian (Episcopalian), but I never liked the idea of turning the Bible's prophecies into an easy-reading fictional account of what would happen. But a few days ago, I decided to take the plunge and actually try reading them.The authors' style wasn't all that great, to me. The books seemed too... I don't know... the dialogue was really cheesy, and the plot lines were VERY impossible (this coming from a person who likes Dickens). But I guess you can say that they weren't WRITTEN to be that way-- they were written by two ministers to communicate the last days of earth in an understandable way for people who don't necessarily read the Bible.I started with Left Behind, then Tribulation Force, then Nicolae, and, in three days, had them finished. I didn't come away liking the books as a whole, but they did serve a purpose:As soon as I finished Nicolae, I opened up my Bible to Revelations and started reading. I have a King James version, so I'd always been a little intimidated by the wording, and the books clarified what a few of the prophecies were that I might not have understood otherwise.So, my final conclusion. Don't use this as an alternative for the Bible-- there really ISN'T an alternative for that. But do use them to greater understand the prophecies of God and Jesus. I think that the authors would love to find out that they were of use, in that respect.--Me"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"In Soul Harvest, Rayford Steele and Buck Williams, having survived the Wrath of the Lamb, start a search for there loved ones. This book is mostly about searching for loved ones, and cleaning up what damage has been done, but there is also the epic struggle against the Antichrist. After landing safely and Iraq, Ray tries to find out if his wife is still alive. Buck, who has a few bumps and bruises, starts looking for his wife, Chloe. Buck also finds Tsion Ben Judah under the church in a hideout.I read this book because I'm a Catholic and I wanted to become closer to Jesus. I knew that this series is based off of the last book in The Bible, \\"Revelation\\", but it's also teaches you about the ways of Jesus and what he did for us. I continued reading this book because I wanted to learn about Jesus, and that I was attached to the characters. I turned ever page wondering what was going to happen to them. I longed to know if Chloe was alive and if Amanda had survived a plane crash. \\"And what about Chloe and Buck in the States? And Tsion\\" (LaHaye/ Jenkins, 1)?The title, Soul Harvest, means that the world is about to take sides. 144,000 Jewish people will convert to Christianity, and will be protected by God. Also, true Tribulation Saints will receive a sign that only true tribulation Saints can see. So basically, true believers will be given a sign which will tell who the saints can trust. \\"Rayford remembered as if it were yesterday\\" (LaHaye/ Jenkins, 107).This book reminds me of The Passion of the Christ. The Passion tells about what Jesus did for us, and this book talks about that a lot. In The Passion, Jesus dies for us, and in Soul Harvest, we die for him, because this book takes place right after a worldwide earthquake. The biggest and most obvious reason that this reminded me of The Passion is that they are both about Christianity, and the ways of Jesus, \\"Captain Steele, schedule that flight\\" (LaHaye/Jenkins, 424).I think that readers learn a lot about the ways of Jesus and \\"Revelation.\\" The theme in this story is a difficult one. It's probably, don't give up or keep trying or good always triumphs. This reminds me of when I was 4 and I got lost in the grocery store. I spent what seemed like hours looking for my mom, and I couldn't find her. It also reminds me of when I was lost at Fort Meyers, Six Flags, Disney World, Wal-mart, target, Mejiers, Kings Island, Holiday world, Sioux Falls, and Pittsburgh, (Yes, I've been lost a lot.) If you have ever been lost for hours or lost something else, then you can relate to this book, because it's about finding your loved ones. If you read this book, make sure that you are familiar with the Bible, and that you have read the first three. It's a really good book and I hope that you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The fourth book in the series follows the main characters as they recover from the aftermath of the global earthquake. Rayford is trying to confirm if Amanda was on a plane that crashed into the Tigris River, while Buck desperately tries to find a wounded Chloe before GC officials find her first. I appreciate any light-heartedness or humor that the authors write into these books, since the content is naturally often dark and forboding. The funniest scene in the series so far occurs in this book, as Buck and his friend Ken Ritz - wounded and drugged - pull off a hospital rescue with more than a few glitches. While the book moves along at a good pace, I still found it incredible that the majority of the book covered such a short amount of time, just a few weeks. Looking forward to reading the next book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"OK,OK,OK. There are some things that LaHaye and Jenkins should cease rehashing in every book, such as Rayford's &quot;near&quot; infidelity, each character's past and coming to Christ, and Tsions Internet writings. On the other hand, you must agree that the series do hold a certain appeal. And that appeal grips the reader even if they think the series continues with the &quot;Grace of God alone&quot; ( a reader from Seattle) or thinks this books is &quot;the worst in the series&quot; (Ashley). I would be the first to agree that the series is a very light read (Mark) having &quot;simple words&quot; (a reader from Clemson) but many people are still addicted to read and follow through to the end (Pat Caneday). For those of you who are not for certain if you what to start the series, DO IT!!!!

The story takes place after the anticipated earthquake. There is lots of mystery in this book with Rayford and Buck trying to find Amanda and Chloe (both are either lost or dead, and Rayford and Buck have no idea which). We also get to meet other believers in this story, such as Mac and Ken, who both have finally come to believe. Of course we also see more of the evil Nicolae is capable of. I really have to say that each book keeps getting better and better. Soul Harvest kept me glued in my seat till I finished it!

For those who are on the fence, these books may nudge you in either direction. For those who have no hope in a moral ascendancy over their actions that is redemptive, this series may not persuade. For myself, I found &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; by Jerry Furland a much more credible vision of the future. For those not already in the choir, perhaps &quot;Transfer&quot; is the best introduction to the future as it most likely will unfold."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all 4 books in the series and this is the best so far. While the characters speach can be a little stilted at times, the character evolution and the action more than make up for it. I was also surprised at how little some of the Judgements were mentioned while others were written about in great detail. Can't have it all I suppose. I am very excited by the series and can't wait to read more. For critics who dismiss these books as misinterpretations of Revelations, give readers credit for at least reading these spiritually motivated books and perhaps the sense to explore further on their own."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I enjoyed this continuation of the series very much. The dive into the Tigris River at the end of the book will keep you guessing about Amanda for a while. The only part that I did't like was that they didn't spend more time discussing the mountain and Wormwood. One would think, with all of the movies that have been produced pertaining to asteroid impact, that they would have talked a little more about the collisions since this is a major topic of the day. Except for that one detail, I loved this book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I love how everybody is lambasting this series as hate speech because it puts forth strong christian morals that are the foundation of this country's very beginnings. Our love of religious freedom is what spurred the founding fathers toward revolution in the 1700's. Our love of conservative christian values helped us increase our work ethic and lead the charge that was known as the Industrial Revolution. It is only after the true hate speech spewed by the likes of Madalyn Murray O'Hair came into existence that this country fell behind in industry, education and every other area you can think of and name.This series is a call for Americans to get back to the foundations of what made it so strong for 200 years. If you can't swallow the bitter pill known as the truth, that's your problem, not the writers' problem. These books are well-written and very timely. They carry with them a very truth-laden message that Jesus is what he claimed to be... Messiah. He is \\"The way...\\" to the Father. You can accept it or you can deny it but you have a pretty dark interpretation of what will happen if you deny The Son. And if you missed it, the answer is real simple. Deny the Son and THE SON shall deny you before The Father in Heaven.Accept the SON and your soul will reap the rewards at Harvest time.There's a lot to these books. People just need to learn to enjoy them for what they are. Christian fiction. Look, it clearly says on the book jacket (or back cover depending on the version you buy) that this book is Bible based. If you aren't willing to read it with an open mind, why bother reading it?This book (and the others in the series) exist as exactly what they are. Wholesome Christian Fiction written for a Christian audience or for those looking for answers to questions regarding Christianity. For those who read this and attempt to use is as a means through which you can attack Christianity, your attacks are baseless, first of all. But they also do not belong in a book review. Works such as this should be graded based on their purpose and the quality of the writing therein. As such, I highly recommend this book to all those looking for this type of literature. Christophobes need not apply."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Again, couldn't put it down.

Like the other books, the characters are running around, looking for eachother, trying to find new converts and giving lengthy moral preachings. Towards the end there's a meteor approaching Earth. This could have been spectacular, but it goes nowhere, and then the book is over.If you're looking for a boring book, you can trust LaHaye and Jenkins to churn them out because they know millions of \\"born again\\" Christians will pay them to do so.

The women in the story although Christian are wives, lovers, secretaries etc. There are no female heroes so far. Hattie Durham, the blonde bombshell who almost hit it off with Rayford Steele is pregnant with the child of the antichrist and since abortions are not a possibility with this group I am curious as to how L&amp;J deal with this issue.This is an action adventure series and L&amp;J provide the necessary tension to keep you guessing.

This man and his partner are being used by Satan himself to decieve millions of Christians across the nation concerning the truth and the end times of this earth, and this is making me sick. Tell me why Tim LaHaye, who has never studied theological doctrine or mastered the Bible's teachings, has sold millions upon millions of books regarding prophecy. Prophecy, a subject which has been revered and studied intentisively by theological scholars and Christians alike since the time of Christ. The verse that I started with clearly tells us why. If Tim LaHaye really loves God, than he would respect His Holy Word including God's sacred prophecies. But instead of writing a book strictly on the Holy prophecies of God to bring Him the glory, Tim chooses to envelop God's sacred prophecies with his fictitious novels known as the Left Behind Series. Now what were his motives for doing this? To interpret the scriptures correctly, or to sell millions of novels and receive the wealth and fame for himself? For those of you who read his novels, did you desire to truly know what the Bible says concerning prophecies or did you enjoy having your ears \\"tickled\\" by his fanciful writing. \\"but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires.\\"In the past year, a man completed devoted to God, has taken up the monumental task of writing a new book to help clear the confusion behind the modern view of Biblical prophecies.

Mr. Wohlberg has been earnestly studying Biblical prophecies for the past 25 years. Everything he comments on is strongly supported by the scriptures and he encourages every reader to evaluate the Bible before establishing an opinion. The book is concise (220 pages), uses simple language, and is jam-packed with years upon years of extensive research.

I don't think so. Why is Ben-Judah the only person in the world that knows anything about Revelations. There is no way that the entire Christian world would have to rely on Ben-Judah for teachings, and if they did, there would be no way they could all communicate with him.How can a group of six people be called a Force. The six people in the Tribulation Force are not unique. I have no doubt that there will be thousands of groups like the Tribulation Force when the rapture comes. Not just one that is the center of the end times universe.Why does Buck rescue Chloe from the hospital. She was not in danger. How could he take care of her. He couldn't. She should be dead now.In soul harvest, Rayford wants to die when he sees Amanda is dead. He says he wants to die so he can spend eternity with his &quot;love&quot; (or something to that effect. Did he mean his first wife which he totally ignored and almost cheated on, or his second wife that was probably a spy for the Anti-Christ (I don't know if she is since I have not read the next book.)Two more things. First, do not listen to the book on tape. That guy drives me insane. He acts out the voices of every person. Why couldn't he just read the book and let us figure out who is talking. It is not that difficult.Finally, when a normal book is published, it comes out in hardcover for about $25, and then in paperback for about $7. Why are the paperbacks in this series the size of hardcovers with large print and the biggest margins in history and a cost of $13. the print is so large and the margins are so wide. Normal books are twice as long and cost half as much."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book was riviting, exciting, spellbinding. It brought the predictions of revelations to life."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, although there were some REALLY slow places in it. One thing that really stood out to me was the part where the Christians have the cross marked on their forheads----but only other Christians can see them. I LOVED that! However, I must admit that I enjoyed the first three better than this. BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all the books so far, Left Behind, Tribulation Force, Nicolae, and Soul Harvest. I had gotten all the previous ones from the library, but decided to purchase this one and pass it around to those of us who are reading the series. With all the lying and deception by Nicolae in this series, and the number of people that are being led down the track today by certain individuals, it is surely timely. Incidently, many say &quot;Wormwood&quot; is actually the English translation of Chernobly where the nuclear accident took place in Russia. Any coincidence?"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I felt that this has to be one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read. The writer's style is smooth and captivating. The word usage and games played between the characters are hilarious and the whole book is an edge of your seat thrill ride."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I love the series and this book was very good. I just think to much was made about finding Amanda.I think more should have been added to the judgements that came in the last two chapters.At times I was wondering how much time passed between events. I just wish that I didn't have to wait so long for the next book to come out!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read Left Behind, Tribulation Force, Nicolae, and Soul Harvest, and I thought that it was the best out of all of them. It was very interesting, and kept me reading. I read it in one day! It definately deserves five stars, and I suggest that everyone should read all four of the left behind books!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am a Christian looking forward to the fulfillment of Revelation. But, I am also a avid reader and can recognize good writing. I really enjoyed the first three books. But the latest book repeats too much, gets bogged down in detail rather than moving the story along. I love the appeal of &quot;novelization&quot; of this difficult area of Biblical prophecy. It brings to life the difficult language of Revelation so that the average person can get a good picture of what MIGHT happen. The emphasis on the MIGHT happen. In the end we must realize, that no one knows how all these things will transpire."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I loved the book, one of the best in the series. Easy to read and follow and impossible to put down (I read it in a day). If you haven't read the series, I suggest you start with &quot;Left Behind&quot; and continue through the series until you reach this book. A wonderful piece of fiction for all ages."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The series has been a good read but as for me and my house, give me the excitement of a fiction series like The Zion Chronicles which plays like a John Wayne war movie and tells the real story of Israel in 1948 . Reading about the actual prophetic fulfillment of Israel becoming a nation changed my life. Those books helped me live the opening volley in the return of Christ in our generation. The Left Behind series is a look at what if...what if I was left behind. But I read the historical fiction seires of the Zion Chronicles ten years ago and I'm not going to be left behind! Israel became a nation and I'm looking up! This series has a long way to go to catch the Zion Series in the excitement department!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This was the most enjoyable book to read in the series, but at the end I felt betrayed that a main thread -- teasing the reader along through most of the book -- was left unresolved. I'm done reading this series until it is complete; then, I am sure I'll enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read the whole series to date and Soul Harvest has been the best so far. You can identify so well with the characters and this book is so intense that you can hardly put it down. I even read it at stoplights while driving. I can't wait for the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book like the previous books in the series is extremely engaging. I have the hardest time putting it down because you are so anxious to find out what is going to happen next. I think this book was the most exciting and suspensful so far of the series. I can not wait until the next one comes out for sale which I presume will be any day now. They are being passed along to friends and family to read. Not only for entertainment but for a wake up call as to what will be happening very shortly. Thanks for this great series. I love them."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Look at the number of responses this book has generated! Have you ever seen so many reviews of a novel on one generic bookseller's site?? Obviously a work of its time, this book has people talking about Christ's return and the end times. If the authors wanted to achieve one goal, I would posture that this is it, wouldn't you?In response to those who berated the authors for writing &quot;beneath them,&quot; I don't think this book would serve its purpose if the style was not accessible to as many as possible. It may not be written for Einstein, but would you rather have them write for an audience like those who believe they know everything there is to know about Revelations? What would be the point? Let's think about the greater good this book is achieving by witnessing to those who may have little experience with the Bible. If this has sparked even one person to open the Bible and change his/her daily life, it has achieved purpose in our society.I am anxiously awaiting Apollyon. I assume that even those who thoughtlessly rated the book as one star will buy and read it too, even if it is just to affirm how much more they know than Le Haye and Jenkins about the end times."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Should Christians be concerned ? , Why, we'll probably be long gone.

I can hardly wait for the next one to be released. This book, as well as the others, is a must read for anyone. Especially those who have slipped away from Christ. The book is fiction, but it has many events that are foretold in the book of Revelation. Be sure and grab a copy and read it, but once you open it you will not be able to put it down. It will be open until you finish it. It will make you realize that you don't want to be one of the ones Left Behind."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I read this book in one siting. Compared with the previous books, it was &quot;lacking&quot;, but it is also a necessary link. On the whole, the series has been worthwile (and an excellent read.) Reading about the choices made by the characters has made me question my own choices. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"These book are the best books I have read in a while and they bring the Bible to a place where you can see and understand what is going to happen I can't wait for book 5 when is it coming out."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"What can I say? These books have captured me hook, line, and sinker! I have always been very intrigued by biblical prophecy and the book of Revelation. It has been exciting to follow along in the scriptures as our characters are taken throughout the world in the search for truth. However, I want to remind everyone to be very careful. THESE BOOKS ARE NOT LAW! They are only fiction. Extremely well-written, but fiction nonetheless. The Bible is the only true authority on the end-times, and only God himself knows how or when thses events will take place. Despite that, I encourage you to consider these books carefully. If you're just looking for adventure or romance there are many other books that will better satisfy you. These books are meant to be taken SERIOUSLY!!!We may not know the day or the hour... But Jesus is coming! Be Ready!Feel free to contact me if you have any comments or just have questions concerning the books or the book of Revelation.JC"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Although the story itself is interesting, I can't imagine this going another three books. I got bored in the middle and waited for it to end. It's so repetitious. I felt like I was reading the same details over and over."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I find Soul Harvest to be a very interesting and hypnotizing continuation of the first three books. As soon as I received the book, it only took me a couple of days to read it. The biblical story along with the twist and turns of the story keeps the reader completely enthralled. It also begs the question, &quot;Could the end times be like this?&quot; I introduced not only Soul Harvest, but the first three books to a good friend of mine, and she felt this story was excellent! Both of us are looking forward to the remaining three books! In conclusion, I think this story would make an excellent movie!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"\\"Soul Harvest\\" book four in the LEFT BEHIND series is as well written and riveting as its predecessors. The prophesied global wide earthquake has occurred and both Rayford Steele and Buck Williams are searching for their wives and their pastor Bruce. Devastation is everywhere they look yet God is filling their spiritual needs by way of new converts and by Tsion Ben-Judah's teaching. The Left Behind series is not only inspirational it is an easily read, page-turning narrative developed from the pages of \\"Revelations.\\" The author's talent seems to expand and grow with each succeeding edition.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read all of them up to The Mark which comes out this month. I couldnt put them down and now I have read them a second time. Very good interpretation of what will happen in the end times. No one should miss this set of books!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After finishing &quot;Nicolae&quot;, I was nearly ready to give up the series. I'm glad to say that &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; has helped keep my footing on the story. The aftermath of the prophesized global earthquake and it's effects on our heros made this the most involving read. It seems the authors finally have faith that their readers will remember who's who, because they avoid the tedious recapping of characters, and how everyone came to be a member of the Tribulation force. The other plus for me was the minimized involvement of the severely underdeveloped female characters in the book. From the first this has been one of the most unbelievable aspects of the series. The courtships of Buck and Chloe, and Rayford and Amanda seemed so wooden and forced that it's hard to connect with them. Feminists would have a field day with lines like Chloe's,:&quot;Don't parent me, Buck. Seriously I don't have a problem submitting to you because I know how much you love me. I'm willing to obey you even when you're wrong.&quot; Maybe in 1950! However, those complaints aside, the book is much more enjoyable overall with a clever twist that catches you off guard,some new characters who may be around for a bit, and enough action to keep the pace at top notch. Here's hoping &quot;Apollyon&quot; is as good."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I really enjoy the story lines and the characters. That alone makes it worth reading. I don't agree with everything they write - I personally would be more afraid of the antichrist. But my only complaint is the repetition. I would have enjoyed this better had I had a condensed version. There is so much repetition in the books. It is like today's tv news shows - they are constantly telling you about the story ahead, but never showing you that story. I wish it had been written a little tighter.Definitely worth reading though. Very thought provactive. Kudos to the authors."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book was as stimulating and thought provoking as the others. I've enjoyed all six books in the series and can't wait for the seventh one to come out. If you ever tried to interpret the book of Revelations, this could be it! I highly recommend this book to everyone (along with the first three). They're very exciting (and sometimes very scary!). I would suggest reading them in order starting with &quot;Left Behind&quot; so it will make more sense when you get to this one which is number four in this awe inspiring series. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins are wonderful authors."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Following the devastating worldwide earthquake that is the Wrath of the Lamb, both the world's Tribulation saints and followers of Nicolae Carpathia alike struggle to survive in a literally upended world. As Buck Williams and Rayford Steele search for their missing wives, unsure if either woman even survived the global cataclysm, scholar Tsion Ben-Judah's Internet evangelism draws so many truth-starved souls even the Antichrist is taken aback and left scrambling for a response. Meanwhile, Carpathia's pregnant former lover Hattie Durham struggles with the twin burdens of her unwanted child and her own sin. Will she accept forgiveness in time? And a potentially devastating secret begins to slowly emerge that could shake the Tribulation Force to its foundations. Like every book in this series, SOUL HARVEST is a fast, easy, and exciting read that succeeds both as a thriller and an introduction to basic end-times theology. The characters are believable and charismatic and the authors work in some nice humor to lighten a frequently grim tale. Like all Left Behind books, SOUL HARVEST interprets Revelation through strongly Evangelical eyes, but the greater Christian truths invoked in the story--like God's unfailing love for each of us, the reality of true evil, and an impending day of judgment--go beyond denominational boundaries. A highly entertaining read and food for thought as well."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"After reading \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" by Britt Gillette, I was instantly turned onto biblical end times literature, and I just started reading the Left Behind series. The first book I read in about a day, but I finished books two and three in about a day and a half before finally getting around to this one.\\"Soul Harvest\\" focuses on the massive evangelical revival prophesied in the Old and New Testaments. In the twenty-first month of the tribulation, a massive earthquake wreaks havoc on the world, leading the global community's citizens further into the arms of Nicolae Carpathia (dictators thrive in such conditions). Carpathia looks for personal glory as he attempts to rebuild the world's decimated cities, but the evangelistic revival brought on by the pouring out of the Holy Spirit and the efforts of the Tribulation Force confound his efforts. As a result, he unleashes his rage on God's chosen ones, and the Tribulation Force must fight to stay alive...I can't wait to find out what happens next. I look forward to reading books five through twelve, and I encourage other Left Behind fans to pick up \\"Conquest of Paradise: An End-Times Nano-Thriller\\" as additional reading. It's the book that got me into this series, and whoa, what a book! What \\"Left Behind\\" lacks in realism, \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" adds in abundance. A little less subtle than the Left Behind series, the antichrist isn't readily identifiable from the beginning. In fact, since I wasn't expecting to read a tribulation novel, it totally blew me away. The prose is more advanced and the international politics is identical to the current world scene and the war on terror. Peppered with biblical verses, \\"Conquest of Paradise\\" will turn even the most hardened skeptics into believers, or at least it will make them think twice. No one can afford to miss it.Book five of the Left Behind series brings us \\"Apollyon\\" - the destroyer demon unleashed on the world during the tribulation. Looks like things are going to get even more dangerous for the Tribulation Force, if that's possible!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Ah, Christian Pulp Fiction. It had been nearly two years since I last left off reading this series. I really hadn't missed much. SOUL HARVEST starts off where NICOLAE ended. The world is in utter chaos as a worldwide earthquake has devastated the entire globe. Buck and Rayford spend most of the book pulling James Bond type stunts in attempts to find their missing wives. Tsion Ben Judah is preaching to the world via the internet and Carpathia, even though he is supposed to be the Antichrist, seems clueless a lot of the time. The worldwide catastrophes that plague the Earth are skimmed over as they happen or are referred to in passing.I was looking forward to reading this after NICOLAE. However, I'm afraid the series peaked with that book. You know how things are going to end and I'm afraid the authors aren't going to explain much about how the planet gets there. Still, SOUL HARVEST is better than TRIBULATION FORCE. Not too bad Christian pulp fiction."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book is definately not as deliciously suspenseful as the second book, but I found a few of the plot twists very good. The overall message is of course one of Christianity prevailing and that's always uplifting to read. I'm definately hooked on the series now, for better or for worse! I think the only thing that I can say I didn't like about this book is that the writers have a tendency to use the same phrases over and over. I think they get bored and either need to make the books shorter, or get more creative. All in all, much better than the third and a very entertaining book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I think that it is a wonderfully intertaining book series. Though most people take this stuff very seriously. I think the characters are wonderful and the story is very well written. The only thing is that at the end of a book it always leaves you on a cliffhanger. Oh well, I guess thats what makes the books so entertaining."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have read some of the other reviews on this book and I believe this is one of the best series of books I have read to date. I make no apologies, I would re-read. Keep going Tim &amp; Jerry. Please write more!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I had thought this one would be a bit of a yawner; I was wrong. This is the best book so far in the series. I really liked the way the action cut back and forth between the main characters and their equally tense situations. Quite a bit was revealed that I didn't expect. The series is taking some very imaginative turns. I felt much closer to the characters and the sorrows of the world. The dissection of politics among the anti-christ and his followers is masterful. I had never understood why he kept Rayford Steele around so long until it made sense later in the book. I must admit I didn't see that one coming. I was surprised with the ending of the scuba diving expedition and have many unanswered questions in regards to what they found. Now I've got to read the next book!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Soul Harvest along with all of the others is written so well that you actually FEEL that you are there. It's SO real. Before I read these books, I really never knew anything about the last days. Everyone of these books helped me understand about the end times and that I really need to be ready. This series tells the unbelieving story of 4 people who are left behind and realize they were missing something. As they go on through the judgements and natural phenomenons prophecied in the Bible they you realize what a God we have. They bring more people to Christ and live only in the faith that God is omnipotent and reigning over everything. It's a series you MUST read! They are awesome!!!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The first book in this series &quot;Left Behind&quot; was so exciting to me that half way through the read, I ordered the other three available books in the series. I must tell you that my sister and I have not read books together since we were children and, in fact, I have not seen my sister read a book in nine years. However, I convinced her to just take a look at &quot;Left Behind&quot; Saturday morning. She finished the read and picked up (#2) &quot;Tribulation Force&quot; as I set it down to start on (#3) Nicolae. Sunday, I read (#4)&quot;Soul Harvest&quot; then handed it to her. We didn't discuss any of the books until finishing &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; and agreed it was wonderful. Being Christians, we can appreciate the faith of the main characters and I'm pleased the writers led me through a Bible study course in this exciting novel. &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; answered so many questions for me about the end days. It was exciting and frightening, yet offered moments that made me smile. Most important to me, &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; is a story of hope. I look forward to the next one. Then I intend to read the entire series again with my highlighter in one hand and my Bible in the other. So much to learn and so little time. God bless Mr. Lahaye and Mr. Jenkins."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I flew through &quot;Soul Harvest&quot; in four days, but that did not mean I was not disappointed with its flat characters and weak plot. The series started out so well, with the fascinating concrete illustration of such cosmic, abstract events like the Rapture and the rise of the Anti-Christ. But in &quot;Soul Harvest&quot;, Jenkins and LaHaye have let their characters direct the action, and the book degenerated into a sappy melodrama. Everyone knows the characters all hate Carpathia and he is evil, so the authors don't need to dwell on that point every single time Carpathia appears in the series.I hope the next books return to the profound, strong depictions of epic events. I will finish the series regardless of how well the books are written, but I hope my disappointment ends with &quot;Soul Harvest&quot;."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The series was moving along great and than this. I didn't like Soul Harvest. The writing felt rushed and rough. Come on guys, slow down a little. Better to wait for good writing than push out a book like this one. I hope the next one is better. I'm looking forward to it.-----------------If anyone out there wants to read a great thriller, order, 'The Fist of God' by A.T. Nicholas. It's a cool, 'good vs evil' story with some original ideas. There's some street language in it, but the themes and the positive message the book communicates is too good to pass up. It's a great read while you wait for the next LaHaye and Jenkins book."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"What a waste of time. I love books about epic events and global crises, but after surviving the torture of reading a comic book level plot like Jenkins has tossed our way with Soul Harvest,I think I'll stick to GOOD books like &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; or &quot;Schindler's List&quot;."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I did not find this story as believable as I think it should have been. Probably the best Rapture novel on the market right now--in my opinion the best ever written--is &quot;The Last Day,&quot; by Glenn Kleier, which I read several months ago. It has the realism, intensity and suspense that makes for an incredibly exciting and unforgettable story. The ending is inspired and totally unexpected. If you liked &quot;Appollyon,&quot; &quot;Tribulation&quot; and &quot;Left Behind,&quot; you'll enjoy &quot;The Last Day&quot; even more."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This series has been a major step for me in my new Christian walk, not because I am taking the word of the books as fact, rather because the content in the series has me referencing the Bible, the Word of God, in every chapter. Soul Harvest had me referencing, once again, Revelation, 1John, and 2John, and more. It has me searching for and studying the promises, the real Word of God. I received Left Behind as a Christmas gift (how appropriate) from dear Christian friends. I was rivited to it. In fact in future books, I bought both the audio cassettes and the books so I could get through them quickly as I was so excited to get on with the story. The cassettes also allow me to share the story with other new believers, and some of my non believer friends, in a shorter period of time.I've read some of the 1 Star reviews and I have to disagree with most of their comments. Remember, this book is fiction, but, if we reference the facts that this fictional account is based on (found in the Bible), and we research the Word of God along the way (...the Bible), we will see God's promises in black and white. Mr. LaHaye's and Mr. Jenkins' writings are drawing me closer to God's word. Bringing others into God's word, and ultimately into a relationship with Him, is what all Christians are to do and is something that I pray I can do for my friends and family each day. These books are an inspiration to me in that way and I will faithfully complete this series and, of course.....continue to pray for patience for the next book to be released.My Pastor's comment as we discussed the Left Behind series ... &quot;It is only for God to know how the end times will play out! In the meantime, study the Bible/Revelation so we are prepared!&quot; We are blessed by Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins' faith, knowledge of God's word, and their interpretation of end time events! Thank you and God Bless!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Just like its predecessors, Soul Harvest provides an amazing visualization to the otherwise cryptic book of Revelations. I must however, agree with other commentators, in that the end did appear cluttered and rushed, yet I can not agree with those who feel it lacks plot or character developement and at the same time is too drawn out for the purpose of selling books. There appears to be no easy way to nourish the reader's need to understand all that is happening with the characters, nourish the soul with the biblical references and understanding, and keep it short. I look forward to 3 more books, if that is what it takes to recreated the entire book of Rev. Many may be offended by the series apparent disregard for the variations of beliefs regarding the timeline of the end times (pre-millenialism, post-millenialism, amillienialism, etc...). The important thing to remember is that the authors are writing a fictional novel on how they interperet the scriptures. The reader may have a different chronology, yet can still recognize the reality of the scriptural content, and how it could happen. There is no deception being woven here, only two men's brilliant and creative interpretation. All in all; an Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I think that this series is great and of course some parts of it are a little unreal. It all depends on what you would call real. If you do not believe In the Bible then the book will not have the effect on you that it would if you are a Christian. The book is a good example of how it could happen."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"My wife has just gotten me to sit down and read the first four books. I could not put them down. I looked to see if any new ones had come out yet and read all the reviews. To some of you I say right on and remember that this is how it could be. To others I say, this is a story and though the authors may have taken some liberties it still places biblical teachings in the story. To others I say get saved and you might have a different view. The global point to all this is to boost Christian spirits to have a closer walk with God (PRAYER). It is also a tool that can be used to get non-believers thinking. If just one person excepts Jesus Christ as their savior due to this book in some way is it not worth it all? For by grace are we saved through faith!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The series started out very well, but with each new addition it has gotten weaker and weaker. The writing level has recessed to the point of a kid book. I was very dissapointed with Nicolae, yet decided to check Soul Harvest out just to see if I could get a little closure. I'm almost sad to say that Soul Harvest was the first book I never bothered to finish. Poorly written, it jumps from topic to topic, ignores some important issues, and spends way too much time on issues with no bearing. Am I disappointed? Yes, but only b/c I let myself get my hopes up prematurely. Oh well."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"My frustration and dismay parallel Rayford's as he discovers that his &quot;rootbeer lady&quot; wife is possibly leading a double life. I panic for Ray as he dives in dark murky waters to prove to himself that Amanda is alive; and as he finds his answer, I am caught wanting to shout at LaHaye and Jenkins to tell me, tell me...was there a smudge on her forhead? I actually find myself praying for the safety of these committed Christians, and am projected into a section of history that I never plan to experience for myself. LaHaye and Jenkins definitely made this era in history alive for me and for everyone to whom I loan this book as a witnessing tool. I can't wait to experience the next book in the series! It is to the glory of Our Coming Lord and Savior Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"While the book took too long to search for the missing ladies, it was still great! In the next books I hope they include more facts and details about the times to come. But by the time they finish the series it will be a wonder if all these acts haven't come to pass!! Hurry up guys! There are a lot of eager readers out there! Keep up the good work and never deviate from the truth. God bless!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Now I have to wait until August for the next book in this series. The authors have me hooked, and I am anxiously awaiting news on Rayford Steele, Chloe and Buck.Many people I know are talking about this series, and have thoroughly enjoyed it.

The book is so well written. That whole Amanda thing is shocking yes, but it adds a nice twist to the story. Now that Nicolae is starting to show his true colors, all the Christians, including the main characters, are in grave danger. I think that Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins top each previous book with the new one. The books leave the reader eager to press on, yet afraid to turn the next page. I am 17 years old, and I am addicted to this series. There are now supposed to be 8 books, and I believe that each one will continue to get better and better."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The book was very interesting and entertaining.

The whole &quot;Amanda&quot; thing was a little unbelievable and unnecessary. One thing this series does do is remind us how precious time is and that we should be about the Father's work. Whether you are a pre, mid, or post-tribulation believer makes no difference. The fact remands that without Christ you are doomed no matter when or how it plays out. If these books do nothing else they get you thinking about that."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I must admit that Soul Harvest wasn't as captivating as the first three books but still informational on the end times.

It's great way to capture the concept of what's going to happen. I believe Christ is using these great authors to show how in their mind the world will end. What I mostly enjoy is how much effort they put into it with a base what scriptures say with an excellent storyline in it to get the whole scenerio into the right perspective. I don't care whether you say that the book is great or boring but when it comes to saying that all they want is money and fame, how can you be so ignorant. I pray that many will see that soon.

It is of my opinion that this &quot;Left Behind&quot; book series is extremely informative to the teachings of the Bible book of Revelations &amp; some of the prophecies from Nostradamous. Yes, the characters are NOT real... however, the contents, and the predictions are biblical and VERY REAL. Tim &amp; Jerry just helped clarify the deep meaning for those of us who want to see, to become more watchful, and those of us who are listening, the ability to hear. Jesus uses all the right people, all the right tools, and at just the right moment - to open the eyes of His family. Now, the choice is yours... Do you want to be a part of His Kingdom? Especially after reading in these series of what lies ahead? They've left no room for mis-interpretation. Pick up a Bible and read in Revelations. Tim &amp; Jerry aren't sugar coating it!

I must say that I was very disappointed with the story of Soul Harvest. 400 pages were spent with no major events. (except the sign on the foreheads, that was cool). The search for Chloe and Amanda way to long. What I could not understand is how could the book end the way it did. The authors dribble about not much for 400 pages and then conclude 3 major events in the last chapter (2 major events in just 2 pages). I would rather have been hanging with the book ending just before the first meteor hit. So much was tied in the last few pages that it was completely unbelievable. Then it ends with Rayford and Nichloae talking as though its business as usual.

I can guess what is going to happen!Perhaps Amazon should review the reviews so others don't tell us the ending and therefore eliminate the need to purchase the book!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I have to admit I'm hooked... reading these ridiculously bad, foolish, and just plain mean-spirited novels is like watching an old Ed Wood movie. It's so horrible that there's almost a genius to it; there's an element of fascination that just grips you. The fourth book has had the most action so far, and the scene where two characters dive into the Tigris river to search a downed plane is great.I've never read anything quite like this series in my life, and I like to consider myself an avid reader of all kinds of fiction. I've never come across characters so static, so contradictory, and so poorly executed that they're almost brilliant in themselves. Pope Pontifax Peter Mathews, evil world leader Nicholae Carpathia, his right hand Leon Fortunado, ex 747 captain Rayford Steele, and Cameran &quot;Buck&quot; Williams, the abstruse and world renown journalist (who couldn't write a decent church marquee if his static life depended on it) are all so poorly crafted and unbelievable that they deserve an underground cult following of college students who pride themselves on devouring B movies. But unfortunately that would never happen because the theme of the series is so hostile and inhuman that no one in his or her right mind (I'm crazy myself) would continue reading after the first book.I have never come across anything that so grossly downsizes and eliminates so many necessary human emotions. For example, the characters (who are initially presented as intelligent) never doubt their faith and wonder why they'd want to spend an eternity doing nothing but worshipping and worshipping and worshipping... in a sense, becoming a Borg, the cyborg-like species from the Star Trek series. Eternity in itself is a paradox: without time and the passage and flow from past to present to future, eternity has no meaning because there is no past, present, or future. And they never ponder why so many great women and men who inspire us, teach us, or make us laugh are cast into an &quot;eternity&quot; of hell while they, who seal off their minds and become belligerent to any form of world peace and world government, get to spend eternity with their god away from many of their &quot;unsaved&quot; loved ones. No, there is never a mention of doubt or retrospect, nor any form of sexuality (I applaud them for using no curse words -- a tremondous accomplishment-- but the word breast isn't even used in the whole series), or any of the depth of emotion that makes us human.Plus the series has no basis in reality whatsoever. Apparently, the renegade evangelist-rabbi can preach via the Internet on a &quot;Central bulletin board&quot; that apparantly everyone has access to and can hold unlimited messages. Oh yeah, it's entirely anonymous too! Where can I find this wonderful place? I want everyone to hear my message, I want to get hundreds of thousands of responses to my writing. Oh yes, I also want to have the ability to post new items in this mire of congestion and have everyone know it's instantly me and not some imposter or one of the millions of replies. Anyone who's ever touched the Internet or has a working mind knows this is ludicrous nonsense... although I will admit it's not as dumb as the world moving the U.N. to Iraq, or everything being pretty much back to normal a month after a global, ten pointer earth quake.I was horribly disturbed by a passage in this novel, one of the rabbi's messages on the central bulletin board. You can find it on pages 323-330. While it does have a Nazi propaganda-type beauty to it, it's a threat against any proposal of any kind of disarmarment or world peace. It's even written, and I quote, &quot;I have never hidden that I believe the very idea of a one-world government, or currency, or especially faith is from the pit of hell.&quot; Now I consider this an insult to any intelligent pacifist. What the characters in the novel want is in fact a one world-government, one world currency, and one world faith, but instead of it being free for all people and ideas, it's a dictatorship where one religion exists and any thought that goes against the bible's doctrine is eradicated. That is a church directed communism, ladies and gentlemen.[Speaking in context of the book] If the one world government was led by someone other than Carpathia, who is corrupt and evil (though not as evil as this dangerous hostile thinking), the main characters would be terrorists, their goal to plunge the world into a new dark age where knowledge and thinking are restricted. Of course, I'm leaving out the supernatural elements of the rapture (which are all way out of chronological order by the way) so I'm not entirely being fair to the work.I think a lot of people are forgetting that this is merely fiction, a form of conjecture. I don't know the future. You don't know what's going to happen. We only live in the now. Nothing is good or bad, only thinking makes it so, as Shakespeare said. I challenge those of you who swallow this dogma to be like Huck Finn and run away with the slave -- risk the chance of hell to see the truth of our universe.Regardless of my parallel views, I'm a fan of the series and look forward to the next release.I'd like to close this review with something by Osho, a truly enlightened one who I will see in hell along with billions of others, yet I'd much rather be there than spend an &quot;eternity&quot; (think about that) with people like Pat Robertson and James and Tammy Bakker and David &quot;Son of Sam&quot; Berkowitz. Bear with me, I'm paraphrasing.A missionary approached me one day. &quot;God created the world,&quot; he said.&quot;Who created sin?&quot; I asked.&quot;The devil did.&quot;&quot;Then who created the devil?&quot;&quot;Why, God of course,&quot; he replied, though he was at loss.Now who is the original sinner?"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I've long been enamored with apocalyptic literature; something about a world slowly dying simply captivates my interest. So I was excited to hear of the Left Behind series.The problem, however, is that the series gradually turns into more of an evangelizing text than a quality novel. Long, boring religious asides take up pages at a time while major apocalyptic events are expressed in merely a few paragraphs. Three trumpet judgements seemed to breeze through in mere pages.While I enjoyed the first three books of the series, Soul Harvest seems to be sending it down a slippery slope, degenerating into a long religious tract. At the moment, I am reading Apollyon (book #5), and find it just as slow paced. However, I continue to read in hopes that it will pick up."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"So far I've read the first four books of the series and have found the story lines very enjoyable. My only regret is that the books are very poorly written. The writing in Left Behind was so awful, I almost didn't finish it. As an example of this poor writing, it took four books before we are given a description of what Chloe actually looks like. However, if you are not looking for great written works of fiction you should find that the story lines and chase scenes are quite exciting and I am looking forward to completing the series. As far as those who want to debate prophecy, none of us really know exactly what will happen so it is no need to take the authors interpretations so seriously. I am reading the stories strictly as fiction with the hope that I gain a little insight and understanding to some of the more difficult passages of Bible prophecy."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This is the fourth book in the Left Behind Series. It continues just after wrath of the Lamb--a global earthquake in the 21st month of the Tribulation. Our two main characters, Buck and Rayford, are once again the ones the story is built around. But this time you want to keep up with both stories as they work to see who is left alive. We watch them both try and find their spouse's. We also see that the world population is starting to realize they need to take sides...choosing to align with Christ or the Anti-Christ.... At the end of this book we see the beginning of the Trumpet Judgments.This is the best written of the four book yet. There is actually a couple of twist in this book, which is nice. And once again the story does flow. That and the large print, I was able to read this book in a single afternoon. For the first time, I will go directly to the next book in the series and follow the story line."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through &quot;Soul Harvest&quot;) are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone. These books are the shallowest of shallow, with about as much intellectual stimulation as a bowl of cold oatmeal. There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--&quot;The Last Day.&quot; If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, &quot;The Last Day&quot; delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile &quot;Left Behind&quot; stuff!"},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"...As far as writing talent, I have been VERY disappointed with allthe books in this series. At first, I gave them the benefit of thedoubt, thinking the writing was so simplistic so younger kids could read them too, until I discovered they have a young kids version out for this series, at which point I was just saddened. So don't expect a well-written novel, as I feel each book's writing has become more and more simple with each release. And by this, I don't mean the story doesn't flow, because it does. It's just written in such simply words that even a grade-schooler could read it without any problems.As far as content, you'll find stuff in here you like, I don't doubt that, but if you're like me, you'll be skimming many areas because you don't care about every single step that every single person takes to get from point A to point B. It's a tedious read at parts, but if you like the study of the end times, as do I, or like reading Christian novels, as do I, then these books will suffice. But don't base your belief system off them until you know more than just what's presented here, and certainly DON'T read them if literary content is your main goal as you won't find well-WRITTEN novels here. If it weren't for that fact alone, I'd be devouring these books as they came out, but as it is, I've read them after friends buy them and are done with them since I am interested in the story, but not the work it takes for me to constantly forgive the writing."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book starts off as Buck and Captain Ray search for their wives on opposite sides of the Earth, following the gigantic \\"Wrath of the Lamb\\" earthquake. It takes nearly 300 pages for Buck to locate his wife, while in all that time Ray does nothing but convert his co-pilot and arrange to get ahold of some scuba gear to see if his wife died in a plane crash into the Tigris River. What's my point? All of this \\"action\\" could very well have taken place in the first chapter alone. The pacing in this book is about as fast as your average glacier. Anyway, things pick up a bit in the last third of the book. Buck and a pilot friend go off to Denver to rescue Hattie, and nearly get killed. Ray finally gets to dive in the wreckage of a 747 to look for his wife. Carpathia plots against the fake Pope, Peter Mathews. And God sends a humongous 1000-mile wide asteroid to crash into the Earth. Two, in fact, one of sulfur and one of rotten wood.OK, so this book [is bad]. Thank God I got it at the library for free. Un-Christian though it may sound, I tend to suspect the authors and the publisher are in cahoots to drag this series out as long as possible, to milk every last dollar they can out of the chumps who actually spend their own money to read this stuff. Furthermore, the writing is rife with basic factual errors. Considering that several of the main characters are pilots, the authors make little effort to learn anything about aviation. For instance, when Buck and his pilot friend Ken try to fly to Minneapolis in Ken's Learjet to locate Buck's wife, they take off from a golf course! Any pilot will tell you this is absurd, even in a landscape that hasn't just been ravaged by an earthquake. And a 1000 mile wide asteroid would have become visible hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, not a mere few hours before impact as described in the book. Finally, the whole plot line has an aura of unreality to it. Despite having just suffered the worst disaster in the history of the Earth, within a few days of the earthquake Buck is flying into Minneapolis St. Paul Airport, talking to air traffic control and arranging a rental car, all as if nothing of import had happened. Of course they also seem to have no problem buying food and taking care of their other basic needs. At no point do we get the sense that people have just survived a truly devastating event, instead it seems that life gets back to \\"normal\\" very quickly.But all this pales in comparison to the basic premise of the \\"Left Behind\\" books. And that is this: We are expected to believe that we should love and revere a God who is basically a sadistic psycho. I mean, the whole Tribulation is God's way of getting us wayward humans to love, accept, and follow him. For seven years, according to these books, God will win our affection and loyalty by unleashing a series of horrors upon us. God is basically like a sick stalker; if we refuse to love him then he will terrorize us until we do. When humans act this way we put them in jail or an insane asylum. It would seem that humankind is more evolved and civilized than the God described by Messr's Jenkins and LaHaye ....."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"This book just drags on and on. Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character. Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either. One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name. You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books. One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"It takes too long for Buck to find Chloe and for Ray to find out what happened to his wife as a result of the earthquake. Also people see Chloe running outside during the earthquake? Other people talk about running around. If this earthquake is really as big as it's suppose to be, no one is going to do much running because no one could keep their balance. I am a survivor of a 9.2 and it was impossible to stand or walk and I would assume this &quot;Wrath of the Lamb&quot; is suppose to be bigger. I also don't understand in the series where the authors get the time frames and the 7 year period or the rapture. I am Christian and I believe Christ will come. I am not aware of a place in the Bible where it reports that Christians will be taken into heaven for seven years and then return with Crhist. There is some misunderstanding on the part of the author. In reality the various seals aren't open over a short period of time at the as the book has them taking place. Each seal represents 1000 years of earth's history, so much of that has already happened. We are late in the sixth seal or early in the seventh seal. I have to admit is is interesting reading inspite of the flaws. I find the description of Chloe quite different from how I would picture her to be. I would see her as about 5'1&quot; and 100 pounds with short, straight hair and a pixie-like appearance, who wears multiple earings and perhaps some nose rings before she was saved."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The decription of the global earth quake was one of the most compelling aspects of this book. I liked it because it gave a pictorial description of one of the most mind boggling events in the future.

Tim LaHay and Jerry Jenkisn may very well be exceptional writers in their respective fields of education but since they do not write secular novels (per se) they left some issues up in the air with only a brief explanation and made Buck and Chole seem silly at times when they only have 7 years so why drag what seem like normal issues out. They don't live in normal times! This book was ...oookkkk but not the best so far...you have to read it to get to the next level...but not the writers best."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"Quick read-total fantasy.

I didn't read it until I'd finished all the LEFT BEHIND series to date, but when I did, I understood what is missing in the LEFT BEHIND books. I've never read a book that made me feel closer to the real presence of God than LAST DAY. It exceeds the LEFT BEHIND novels on all levels: plot, characters, story line, suspense, and downright fear of God. No, it's not a witnessing tool. Far from it. LEFT BEHIND is better for that purpose. But if you want a novel to make you think, and make you better understand how Man has warped religion away from God's initial design and more toward Man's purposes, LAST DAY will stand the hair up on the back of your neck. I recommend it unconditionally over LEFT BEHIND. In just one book, it covers vastly more spiritual ground than the entire LEFT BEHIND series combined, and that's a fact."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"It certainly attempts to literally interpret a very difficult and symbolic text. I believe a more realistic approach must factually account for how the world is changing and where that change is likely to take us. For non-fiction, I urge all to read &quot;The End of Privacy&quot; by Reg Whitaker. Then take the next step and devour &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; by Jerry Furland.The Left Behind series often left me behind due to the incongruous plot lines. Why do things happen the way they do? Does God have to intervene to move events or does God merely describe what will be? I think the latter make the most sense to me. It puts man where God said we would be-in charge and free to work our will either in obedience to His Law or to our own desires. This is not theological Rocket Science as demonstrably, most of the earth continues to act according to their own desires."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"To those of you writing complaining about having things completely spelled out, well for your information not everyone went to Harvard. There are several out there who need it spelled out. God has given us a great start to understanding his Bible and prophecy.

I applaude them for making it so clear that my teenagers have become avid readers of the series and their Bibles. My children tell me the are reading the book of Revelation and trying to figure out what will happen in the next book before they begin it. Priase God for Authors such as Mr. Jenkins and LeHaye. Our family is eagerly awaiting the next book. Thanks for a great insight."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"I must say, this series has captivated me. Not because of the writing, but because of the content of the story. The end times are fascinating and this book brings them to life. That's why I enjoy them so much.

Sure, I am also annoyed by many things in the book, but I am able to look past the trivialites and enjoy the big picture. I am starting Apollyon today."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The element that has made these books successful is the way apocalyptic scripture is woven into modern life -- it's definitely not the goings-on of the characters. I could not believe the authors devoted almost 420 pages of character &quot;development&quot; and then gave the first three Trumpet Judgements a mere 4-5 pages at the end of the book. (I think the Wormwood comet that poisons a third of all water was covered in 3 paragraphs.) Come on guys, how the judgements impact the survivors after the Rapture is your story -- not how Rayford thinks he can find evidence of his wife's end on a plane at the bottom of a river (is it that even remotely pausible?)."},{"Title":"Soul Harvest: The World Takes Sides (Left Behind #4)","review":"The reason why I wrote what I did to summarize it is that like all the others, once you start, you can't stop.

Yes, the writing style is simple, but that just makes the book(s) easier to read. Secondly, as to the complaints that the books are sexist, that's just silly. The character Chloe is as strong a female lead as anyone can hope for.The biggest improvement in this book over the preceding books is that the writers have really developed their suspense. Without giving too much away, let me just say that in the beginning, there are two characters who are missing, and it takes the entire book to find out what has become of them. There is also question of certain characters' true loyalty, and that too is a twisting, turning, precarious adventure.

Silly question. Of course you have. You're reading about it right now.I've finally decided I'd read it and \\"kindled\\" the book. Mistake. I probably should have taken it out of the library. Think about this. There are twelve-thirteen? books in the series. Each one costs between 5 and 10 dollar a piece. Figuring the usual $10 kindle price, if i were to buy twelve of these, it would (will) run me $120For a book. That isn't a masterpiece or a piece of antiquity. So what's the draw for people to lay aside their hard-earned and possibly disappearing cash?It's not that well written. (Sorry Timothy LaHaye) It's simplistic and the characters are not well developed. Plus, redundancies! Don't even get me started.If they cut all the repetition, they'd probably have a long \\"The Stand\\" type novel.But, the story about the end of times, the coming of the Anti-Christ and the Tribulation; and, it has me hooked.So my point?

He describes the activities of that center from a cultural anthropologist's point of view. Unfortunately he has to to hide any actual references to people there, like for protecting himself from law suits or personal disadvantages within that center. Therefore the book seems to be rather artificial. The lengthy anthropological introduction wants to rise the level of the book, but following chapters do not fully utilize anthropology. So it's neither a real scientific book, nor an exciting real-life story.

Only about 25 million live in this land about the size of the U.S. Long distances, a limited rail system (yet, the Trans-Siberian is the world's busiest track), and almost no paved roads make the airplane's role crucial. Many industrial workers earn 3X that of those west of the Urals.Siberian raw materials accounted for about half of all Soviet hard cash receipts. Steel is also produced, taking advantage of rich coal deposits. Unfortunately, many of the region's cities are also severely polluted.Perestroika allows citizens to protest the pollution, open practice of religion, and some open elections. Economic reforms are also creating problems for factories producing low quality goods.Building on the tundra is difficult - requiring either insulation (sand, rock) or deep pilings to bedrock. Energy exploration is a major activity.\\"Last Days of the Gulag?\\" documents a French journalist's visit to what is said to be the last Soviet labor camp for political prisoners - only 38 prisoners left. Torture by freezing still exists. Stalin had sent 17-25 million to labor camps from 1928 to 1953.Some have been imprisoned for trying to escape the U.S.S.R.

However, the title does say it all.Mr. Russell first takes us on a history of the shamanic use of herbs and entheogenic plants and calendrical time tracking through the matriarchal ages of the Bone, Copper, Bronze, and Iron ages, showing the progressive development of patriarchy with the advancement of agriculture, which eventually led the tribes away from the female-as-shaman ancient (matriarchal/lunar) practices.He then delves into the history of entheogenic plant usage in Sumerian, Babylonian and Canaanite/Judean rites as well with the Essenes at Qumran and the take over of patriarchal sun worship. Then he follows into the Greek shamanic Olympian and Eleusinian Mysteries, their entheogen practice, suppression--and the development of Christianity out of the politico/religio mess of the shamanic-suppressive fascism of the times.He shows us how the Christian icons used today are related to ancient, shamanic rites and entheogen use as John Allegro suggested in the Sacred Mushroom and the Cross with the Amanita Muscaria. However, Russell doesn't stop with just Amanita, he makes many plausible suggestions toward alternative entheogens that may have also been employed.The final tie in he makes is with the ancient shamanic tradition and the War on Drugs. The Modern Inquisition, written by Harry J. Anslinger, is almost verbatim of the Pius outlawing of entheogens over 1600 years earlier.His presentation of the history of entheogens reminded me much of Professor Carl Ruck's style of writing whom he does quote often, though without the heavier Christian slant.Those whom are offended by direct and honest commentary on the horrific history of Christianity may find this book offensive or \\"attacking Christianity.\\" Russell doesn't find the need to sugar coat the disgraceful and murderous shamanic-inquisitional origins of Christianity.The problems with the book: 1) it is a little dry. 2) His ideas of the origins of patriarchy with the invention of agriculture does not coincide with new research by Dr. James DeMeo in Saharasia, based on Textor data, showing the Saharasian region's desertification as the actual cause of patriarchy and armament (see also Discover Magazines Aug. 2005 article: Are the Desert People Winning?). Furthermore, it would have been helpful for Russell if he had tied in the work of Social Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski in \\"The Sexual Life of Savages\\" (1929), or, for that matter, the work of Dr. Wilhelm Reich in \\"Invasion of Compulsory Sex-Morality\\" with this excellent work.Overall, the book is very well researched with many new ideas. A great addition to any library. 5 Stars!"},{"Title":"Shamanism and the Drug Propaganda: The Birth of Patriarchy and the Drug War","review":"This book consists of two parts. This first documents that psychoactive plants have been used in religious experience dating back to prehistoric times. The book is thoughtful and well researched, with a number of illustrations not usually presented even in graduate level texts.The second part is an angry denunciation of orthodox Christianity in favor of gnosticism. Using rather creative methods the author develops a picture of Jesus as a military leader who sought to overthrow the Roman empire. This is certainly different than the description one usually encounters. He continues to find in gnosticism the \\"true\\" tradition of pharmacological shamanism.The book suffers three major flaws. First, the author never really describes what shamans are or how they function in society. The reader is left wondering if the term isn't simply used as a catchall to describe people who take drugs. Second the author never distinguishes between sacramental use of psychoactive plants and recreational use. Thirdly, in the middle ages there was validity in railing against the temporal power of the Christian church. Writing in America today, hundreds of years after the reformation, in a judicial climate openly hostile to the expression of Christianity in a public forum, blaming the injustice of the world on the Christian faith hardly makes sense.Still, in the end, the author's principal thesis holds. As he argues, for the government to wage war on the sacraments of other cultures is to wage war on those cultures. In a society that advertises itself as multicultural and open to diversity it is unclear why this is the case."},{"Title":"Shamanism and the Drug Propaganda: The Birth of Patriarchy and the Drug War","review":"I give this book 3 stars because of its dense amount of information and its potential to be a landmark book in the field of entheogens and religion. This book, however, reads more like an encyclopedia of anthropological eras, than anything else. The book has no introduction, and no conclusion, and no thesis to tie any of it together. The book is ultimately a hodge podge of information waiting for somebody to make some sense of it. In this regard it may be a good resource, but it offers little else. I hope that the author will at least go back and add an introduction to this book so that the readers will at least know what his purpose in writing it was."},{"Title":"Shamanism and the Drug Propaganda: The Birth of Patriarchy and the Drug War","review":"Top-notch content. Explains how entheogens were ubiquitous but were suppressed by the institutional Church. Definitely recommended. Covers ancient Western entheogenic origins of religion.The book lacks statements of how the line of argument proceeds through the chapters and sections, but the content is excellent and much needed."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and Sorcery of the American Native Peoples","review":"Something that's always annoyed me is reading that \\"Native Americans believed...\\" like there was only ever one tribe with one set of beliefs or customs. Yes, there are similarities; as Joseph Campbell has shown, all mythology is human mythology and the same themes appear repeatedly world-wide. That doesn't mean that there aren't subtle differences from tribe to tribe. There are differences in beliefs, in ceremonies--in all the specifics. That is what I most appreciate about this book. It is a compilation of the beliefs and practices of specific tribes, each tribe represented by an expert on that tribe, with emphasis on the specifics. The only critism I have of this book is simply that I want more--more of the specifics to go with the cultural analysis. Just the same, this is far more satisfactory than most Native American resources I've seen."},{"Title":"Witchcraft and Sorcery of the American Native Peoples","review":"Too often people tend to forget that the Native Americans were once everywhere between Alaska and Tierra del Fuego, and that even after conquest many Native peoples still held their traditional lands. This anthropological survey, however, does a wonderful job covering most of the Americas. As the title implies, this book is a study of witchcraft and sorcery of the Native Americans. Not of religion or shamanism, but of socially taboo magical practices (though, it should be noted, there is some relationship between beliefs of witchcraft and traditional religions). Better still, this book looks at beliefs of witchcraft in both traditional religion and in post-contact religion. Again, people tend to forget that Native American culture is still alive and well, changing as time goes on just like any other culture.Over all, the book covers 15 different Nations, giving a wider view at the beliefs of magic across aboriginal society in general. Each Nation more or less represents a specific &quot;culture group&quot;. After the introduction, which explains the book pretty well, we get a brief look at the Inuit of the Arctic and their beliefs in soul loss, violations of hunting tabboos and the tupilak (a sort of familar type creature that witches used to kill). Then he goes into witch-killings amongst the Subarctic Kaska, power gaining and sorcery amongst the Menomini of the Great Lakes (covering Traditional, Peyoteist and Catholic views), relationships between shamanism and witchcraft in the Skokomish of the Northwest Coast and Traditional and Pentecostal responses to withcraft to the Nez Perce of the Plateau.All of these chapters go in depth in looking into Native cosmology and views on witchcraft, often providing charts and Native words as well as accounts of witchcraft gathered from Native informants. He continues on to look at charms and witchcraft complexes amongst the Six Nations of the Iroquois (representing the Eastern Woodlands). Then he goes on to the Southwest, which is divided into two chapters to provide a contrast between the Athapaskans (in this case the Apaches) and the Pueblos. The latter is particularly interesting, mentioning the punishments for witchcraft as well. Going into Latin America, we are presented with a look at the Tecospa and Tepepan, which provides us with pre-Columbian Aztec views on witches and evil, and later Catholicized views both amongst the Mexican Indians and the mestizos. Related to this are two other sections, covering the Quiche Maya (modern day) and colonial-era Andean cultures, which provide further insight into the ancient Native American empires of the Maya, Inka, Moche and so forth.He also devotes a chapter to the Mapuche Indians of Chile and how their society reacts to sorcery. Rounding out the book are several other surveys, including the Akawaio Indians of Guyana, the black Caribs of Belize and the Obeah beliefs of Roatan and the Caribbean (these often include Indian as well as African and European influences). Overall a good survey, if a bit in leaning towards North America. It would have been nice to see him cover the greater whole of Amazonia and interior Brazil (there are many Native American tribes left in that region), if not the extinct Yaghan and Ona of Tierra del Fuego. Still, it is a wonderful overall survey of Native American views on witchcraft.The only real commentary I can add to this brief overview is that it is an anthropological text book. Unfamilar readers may find some of the accounts uninteresting, and be unfamilar with some of the concepts and terminology (technical spelling of Native words is given, for example, to help with pronounciation but without a chart). Also, witchcraft in this book means witchcraft, malicious magical beliefs and practices. This isn't an idealized or romanticized look at &quot;pagan religion&quot; or some such so don't get offended if you believe your a witch. However, if you are familar with social sciences, you should appreciate this book immensely."},{"Title":"A Prophet Reads Scripture: Allusion in Isaiah 40-66 (Contraversions: Jews and Other Differenc)","review":"Deutero-Isaiah occupies a significant place in the cast of Hebrew prophets. He is at once of the same generation of the great exilic prophets Ezekiel and Jeremiah, while at the same time a seminal figure for the lesser prophets. His quest to legitimize his message comprises a lyric corpus that poetically alludes to his predecessors. Prof. Sommer successfully examines Deutero-Isaiah's allusive tendencies and places the prohet within a framework of Hebrew prophecy that instructs us as much about the words he spoke as it does about the context of his tradition.

One of the recurring criticisms of the book is that it paints a dishonest picture or too rosy a picture of Maria and the Trapp family (This book was written in the late 40's or early 50's.) Several reviewers mentioned the recent story on the TV series, Biography, which told what they felt was the &quot;real story.&quot; Well, it's a shame that the book, Maria, is now out of print. This book was published in 1972, and Maria is much more honest about her sad childhood, and she does not leave out many unflattering pictures of herself. She also tells about her time of atheism and how she came back to her faith. One part of the book details how &quot;blazing mad&quot; she was with God after she married the Baron, and felt that God had &quot;rejected&quot; her as His bride. In another part she details her deep guilt after her husband's death, since she felt that in many ways she had made his life miserable by her &quot;terrible temper&quot;--she makes it clear that the Captain was the quiet and gentle parent in the family, and also discusses how much she disliked the fact that the &quot;Sound of Music&quot; portrayed him as a stern disciplinarian. Maria also tells how much trouble she had letting go of &quot;control&quot; of the family business and how she feels she made mistakes as both a wife, mother, and grandmother. So, you see, Biography's &quot;expose&quot; really had to come, at least somewhat, from Maria's own words. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is that, at times, the writing is a little hard follow in that it jumps around. However, I did get the feeling that Maria was talking and reminiscing, which is part of the reason for the &quot;jumpiness.&quot; Maria's earlier book was written in a different time when people didn't reveal as much about themselves as they do now. The later book is not a &quot;tell all&quot; but strikes a good balance in that I think Maria genuinely wanted to let people see her strengths and weaknesses and what God could do with such a flawed and imperfect individual."},{"Title":"Maria","review":"The Sound of Music is a favorite movie.

It is simple. When her lips are not moving. In her first book, written in 1949, she tells of the time she met the Captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to the scene in the play and in the movie. She even mentions that the Captain used a whistle to call the children.In this book, she states that the Captain was not at home when she arrived, and that Baroness Matilda introduced the children to her.Hoping that no one will notice her contradictory lies, she blames the producers of the play for (falsely) portraying her husband as a stern disciplinarian. Well, give me a break. It was her 1949 book, telling of the whistle, that gave them the idea. There is also a chapter in the 1949 book about &quot;the baron doesn't want it.&quot;So, she invents the story, and then blames us for believing it."},{"Title":"Thought power, its control and culture","review":"Annie Besant,as always,writes in clear,inspirational language.

For some reason, Amazon continues to publish this review under the wrong book, one that does not feature artwork by Rachel Isadora, even though I pointed this out to them.This book is a verbatim retelling of the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale. The story is not embellished or changed in any way. The tale is illustrated with \\"luminous paintings, capturing the mood of a snowy Victorian winter...\\" (from the book jacket blurb).Since the tale is only one and a half pages long, that makes for a slim book. The odd pages feature a paragraph of text , about three sentences, while the even pages feature a painting illustrating the text. About 13 paintings.The book is hardcovered with two additional paintings, and you get a paper book cover mirroring those two paintings and the bonus blurb.I can't see reading this story to a child. It's just too dismal. You can't read it without crying. It's an adult topic and an adult treatment. The powerful story is designed to make an adult think and reexamine his behaviour.I rated the paintings with only three stars because they're good enough, but did not blow me away.

And Other Stories","review":"It is the illustrator's artwork that brings Hans Christian Anderson's story to life, wherein a little girl eventually dies. She was just a little match girl whose only job was to sell matches on the streets in an old Victorian town, most likely in Europe. Her father sends her out into the streets with a box of matches, basically begging for money. As she walks through the town, she tries to keep warm; she watches the other people going about their routines on this very cold New Year's Eve, the night before the New Year begins.Somewhere on her walk, she loses one shoe, as they were too big to start with. She was cold and hungry and poor. No one took pity on her. As she wondered through the town, she sought cover in corners between buildings. She passed many brightly lighted buildings and houses; she could see inside that people were celebrating, and here she was \\"out in the cold\\", and alone.As she struggles to keep warm, she lights one match after another, and dreams of happier places: a big roaring stove in a kitchen, a beautifully arranged table with food for a family, and one, a brilliantly lit Christmas tree with thousands of lighted candles. Each \\"dream\\" comes to a close when the match burns out, and all she is left with is a burnt out piece of wood.As she falls asleep, sitting on a curb, she notices some bright stars in the sky; she is reminded of her Grandmother's word that \\"when you see a star fall, a soul is going up to God.\\" In a brief moment, she sees her grandmother appear to her and gather her up in an embrace. She pleads with her Grandmother not to leave; she even asks her Grandmother to take her with, so she will not vanish like all the other beautiful things: the beautifully lit table, the warm stove, the brilliant Christmas tree.In her dream, she attempts to keep her Grandmother with her by lighting a whole bunch of matches, as she longed to\\" keep her grandmother close to her.\\" In the dream, the Grandmother lifts up the little girl and takes her up to God. The next morning, the little girl is found frozen to death, in the very corner between two buildings, on the last night of the year. Now, she is with her Grandmother and God.Now, please note, all of this takes place in the little Match Girl's dream, and Hans Christian Anderson tries to bring this legend to us to remind us that God is always with us, always waiting to bring us home. As the story ends, there are two brightly lit stars in the sky, probably Grandmother and the Little Girl.Sometimes a child has a very powerful dream that needs to be heard by the adult. Be attentive to what the child is saying, always offering comfort. Most of Hans Christian Anderson's stories have powerful lessons to be told. Keep that in mind; they are just stories, even though, during that time, little children and grown-ups did walk the streets begging. Be cautious, be kind to them; you never know if they are a message from God."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl.

That we can transform our own world if we transform our minds. The young girl used her imagination to picture herself out of the situation until it happened. Law of Attraction?

Happily Ever After-that is a fairy tale all in itself. I read this when I was 6 or so. I felt said for her too like every one else did. I tried to save a dumped kitty in this horrible snow storm. I don't think she made it so I bought this book to comfort me. I'm 42 and when it snows I imagine the older sick people with hypothermia and a late bill for heat. That is creul. I think that this book makes you understand death is not cruel, the people are. Death is a better place to be, rejoiced and released of suffering. I think it should be for teens. Not for anyone younger, a good way to start to learn sympathy and empathy. You can not deny this happens."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"This review is of the edition illustrated by Blair Lent.The Little Match Girl is a classic fairy tale about a little girl trying to sell matches to earn money for her family on New Year's Eve. She is unable to sell any and she is afraid that she will get a beating if she returns home with no money. She crouches in a corner by a building and burns the matches to keep warm. As she burns each match, she sees visions of a New Year's Eve dinner, a beautiful Christmas tree, and her late grandmother. She burns all of the matches in an attempt to keep her grandmother with her and she is then carried up to heaven by her grandmother. The little girl is found frozen to death the next morning with the pile of burned out matches.This book might be enjoyed by children ages 8 and 9 who are beginning to develop a sense of empathy and to question death. Parents might want to read this book with their children around the holidays to teach them the importance of thinking of others and appreciating what they have. The concepts of poverty, child abuse, and death may be too disturbing for some children, however. The dark quality of the black-ink drawings reflect the sadness of the story, while the limited color representing the little girl's visions highlights the small amount of joy the she was able to experience at the end of her life. In addition, the straight lines of the European buildings and steps seem to symbolize the little girl's matchsticks."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl.

And Other Stories","review":"Of all the wonderful works written by Hans Christian Anderson, this one, The Little Match Girl is probably one of the most well known and is the one that is probably the most controversial. By controversial I mean that is it is one of the few stories where parents truly need to know their child and determine the proper time and place to introduce them to it. Please keep in mind that I am referring to the original story, the one told here, and not the watered down version; the Disney type version that is becoming more and more common and available.In the original story, and Rachel Isadora through her art, and in producing this book, has pretty well stuck to the story line as presented by Hans Christian Andersen. We have a poor little girl who is forced by a cruel father to go out into the city on New Years Eve and sell matches. It is cold, snowing and the little girl is not only hungry but barefooted and inadequately dressed. Huddled in a corner in an alleyway, rejected by all and fearful to return to the father who will beat her if she sells no matches, she starts lighting matches one by one and with each gleam of light is treated to a vision. A warm stove, a wonderful dinner, a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and finally a vision of her loving grandmother who takes the young girl in her arms and they soar in a halo of light and joy, far, far above the earth, where there was no more cold, no hunger, and no pain...for they were with God.The next morning the little girl is found frozen to death.Now folks, this is a sad story. I was first exposed to it when I was about five years old when my mother read it to me. To be frank, I cried and it gave me nightmares for years after. In my particular case that was okay though. I learned lessons here; valuable lessons as far as I am concerned. Not something I enjoyed, but certainly something I needed.This is not necessarily a \\"feel good story,\\" and to be frank, I would wonder about any child or adult who is not touched by it. The artist has depicted this happening in what is probably Victorian London. It must be understood though that this could be anywhere in the world at any given time. As my mother explained to me, those were hard and unforgiving times when people did not care about such thing...not like today! She let me ponder this story and her comments for a bit and then explained to me that this sort of thing not only went on at that time and during that era, but still goes on to this very day and the second we forget it; forget the plight of those who are starving to death, freezing to death and are abused, then we are no better than the people of the story. She stressed that we must be better people and learn to treat those who have less than we do much better than they treated the Little Match Girl.This is one of those stories that I would hesitate to read to a group of children I did not know. Each parent needs to decide whether or not their child is able to handle this story and understand the several messages here. The story certainly ends with a good Christian message, i.e. the little girl is taken away to a better place to be with God, but it is somewhat difficult to reconcile the non-Christian actions of the other people in the story that were perfectly willing to let this small girl starve and freeze to death. This is a story that needs adult interpretation from an adult reader when it is presented to the very young.Yes indeed this work can and should be classified as a classic as it brings out the exact emotions the author intended and is quite well written. The book should not be ignored because of the sadness and I might suggest that it is a wonderful tool to teach compassion. If you think about it thousands upon thousands of children are facing an identical plight even as I write this review! Do think about it! On the other hand, it will most certainly hold a bit of emotional trauma if not handled correctly.The art work in this particular version of this story is excellent. Rachel Isadora is master at her trade.If you decide to introduce your child to this story, then this work is ideal and I do highly recommend it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl.

And Other Stories","review":"My favorite tale by Hans Christian Anderson has always been The Little Match Girl. The poignancy, the helplessness...it moved me deeply as a child, and still does. Naturally, then, it was a story I wanted in my own library, to share with my daughters, but with so many versions, which to choose? It was blind serendipitous luck that the version I ordered, because the cover drew me in, was adapted and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney. I love it. And that seems like a feeble way to describe my emotional reaction to it.It is an incredibly moving version, both the text and pictures. Set in a large turn-of-the-century American city, where horse-drawn carriages are sharing the road with automobiles, Pinkney's version highlights the poverty prevalent in such big cities. His match girl has a more homogeneous, easily overlooked face. But don't let that fool you into thinking this is a bland version. The pictures, to me, reflect the rough life of the poor. From the very first picture of the story that shows the fear and destitution and hopelessness on the children's faces as they work in the cold attic to make small bouquets of flowers to sell, to the hungry longing on the little girl's red-cheeked face as she stares at the food on a cart on another page, to her little hand cupped around the lit match as she sits on the snow covered sidewalk in her torn stockinged feet.... It a good thing you can't see me now; the emotion that his drawings evoke in me in really quite embarrassing.And yes, my children love it, too.Thank you, Jerry Pinkney, for making this hauntingly beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl.

Not a book to read to your grandchildren. Maybe teenagers can get through it without getting too teary eyed. I'm glad I purhcased it as a collectable but when I saw The Little Match Girl reunited with her grandmother in heaven, it was too much for me. Shows you how good this book really is."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"Tales of the unbearable, in one form or another, are as old as mankind itself. Every culture has them, for they serve an important psychosocial and religious purpose.And Andersen's tale is among the best known: an innocent child--loved at one time but now despised and forsaken--falls victim to neglect and the elements. It is impossible to read \\"The Little Match Girl\\" and not be moved. Technically, the story goes even beyond tragedy, since the girl is presented as utterly pure and faultless. (Can anyone discern a parallel here?)But even in the saddest and most desperate of circumstances, faith and hope triumph, and ultimately God's love brings not only everlasting life, but the company of the people we loved on earth. \\"The Little Match Girl\\" ultimately affirms the promise of Christianity.Is the story suitable for your child? It's hard to say. One the one hand, most young children cannot really absorb the death, say, of a schoolmate, and often grieve far less than the adults. When I was 7, a kid in the neighborhood died of encephalitis after measles. Though I was hardly happy at the news, I was not mature enough to experience real sorrow (as with the death of a parent), and went on with my comic book. A story, on the other hand, can be more powerful than reality for children, who usually project themselves into the action. Therefore, I would consider carefully whether or not this story is appropriate. My daughter at age 7 was unconsolable when her hamster died, and I suspect that \\"The Little Match Girl\\" would have been very hard for me to take at that age.For those secularists who were disturbed because the little girl goes to heaven with her grandmother, I understand. I was an atheist once, many years ago. But remember that, like it or not, Christianity is the foundation of the Western world and is thus, even more than political correctness or Enlightenment dogma, in the very air we breathe. Virtually every line of Shakespeare can be traced to scripture, so we can't really expect Hans Christian Andersen, in 1846, to end his story with a government bureaucrat arriving just in the nick of time with a social program. For the story to have a point, the little match girl HAS to die.Such stories are extremely difficult to bring off, as just one slip into mawkishness can break the spell. In that regard, Andersen does not succeed fully, though I acknowledge that translation might in some cases be to blame. Further, he might indeed have intended this as a children's story, and felt compelled to pen \\"poor little girl,\\" \\"poor little creature,\\" \\"poor little child,\\" \\"poor little thing (in some editions),\\" and finally \\"poor little one\\" in case the reader was missing how sad the situation was. And perhaps after \\"and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain,\\" Andersen thought that children would need a spelling out of the obvious: \\"for they were with God.\\"I'm tempted to try the CD of \\"The Little Match Girl Passion,\\" by David Lang."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl.

With no way out, this youngster turns to her own rich inner life to help her transcend her impossible situation.

We received it for Christmas for our 4-year-old daughter. She won't read it until she is old enough to find it in the library catalog all by herself, if I can help it.I read over some of the other comments about how this is the saddest Christmas book they have ever read, and how important it is to expose our children to the importance of empathy and action for people in need. I agree that these are very important morals to teach our children - but maybe you should try action (soup kitchens, food pantries, adopt-a-family) instead of making your child sob right before bed.Hans Christian Anderson is an amazing writer and I look forward to introducting my child to his stories (unadulterated by Disney) - but when she is a tween and can handle learning about Anderson's milleau and how that influenced his writing.This book is especially inappropriate for non-religious families.

Sure she saw her grandmother and she's with her grandmother now, but that isn't the message that is conveyed in the story. I would have rather the girl wised up about going home with no money, realizing the world was a pleasant place to be after seeing the &quot;light&quot;, as she struck all the matches she had.

He beats her whenever she fails to bring in a satisfactory income for her work.One night, after a day of no sales, the child, frozen to the bone, lights a match. A glorious vision of a Christmas tree appears. The vision fades away when the match burns out. The second match the girl lights shows a Christmas feast. This feast of illusions dies too, with the match.The third time she lights a match, her beloved, deceased grandmother appears. The girl runs to her, never to return to the cold again.

It is truly the saddest holiday story I have ever come across."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"Everyone need to hear this. Even if you find afterwards you can't breathe for a moment, and you find yourself stumbling in a haze of tears and grief. I don't think that we were ever told that we would be spared such things if they would bring good.The whole point of this story is to bring the searchlight of compassion and charity into the heart. Too often we tend to think ourselves poor. In Andersons day we would all be considered rich compared with most of those about. And fortunate. We are enlightened enough (at least in Britain) to help people with no jobs and who don't quite know what to do next.This is quite a stern message and a wake up call to everyone. Perhaps it is the very sternest message which can be given to some people. It is very, very sad, but you have to remember that the girl does reach paradise, as do many every day, and if this is too sad, then, well, there is no answer beyond the consolations of heaven.The story speaks much about the sanctity of human life on earth, and I suspect that this will become a more pointed message in the Western World as time goes on this century. If death happens in this way, if there is ANY possibility of this happening in your city (there is in the one I am in, but small), we should be listening to Christ:&quot;I was hungry and you gave me no meat, thirsty and you gave me no drink, naked, and ye clothed me not, sick.. and in prison.. and ye visited me not...&quot;We ..

I was able to make a personal connection to the text because I too was a young girl who was impoverished at the time. I knew what it felt like to be cold and hungry and I related immediately to the main character.I came away from reading this book with empathy, sympathy, and knowing the truth: Not everyone has been blessed with having their basic needs met. In addition, I experienced a great joy when her grandmother takes her up to heaven to a better comforting place.I came away with the concept that death was not something to be feared or a bad thing, but something that might be comforting andpositive. I have always loved this book. Because even as a child who was struggling I too had many things to be thankful for in comparison to what the little match girl had. The underlying message is powerful and real."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"This book is very sad, but it has beautiful pictures. It can make young children cry at some times. This girl had to sell matches, and if she didn't she couldn't go home because her father would beat her. It took place at Christmas time, so it was very, very cold. The little girl sat between two houses and lit a match. The first match lit up a big iron stove. The next match revealed a beautiful Christmas dinner. The last one revealed a beautiful Christmas tree.

It is a classic story of a little girl who is alone, poor, cold, hungry and afraid to return home becasue she has sold no matches. As she is freezing to death, she lights the matches to keep warm. As she lights them, she sees all the lovely scenes of life that she has missed...Finally she sees her loving grandmother who takes her to Heaven. The story's deeper meaning is that there are things worse than death, and with the little girl's death, she is no longer hungry, cold and unloved."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"This was the tale of a poor young girl that was trying to sale matches to people on the streets to make money to keep her family warm. One night she went out and was told by her father not to return without selling all the matches she had. No one wanted to buy any matches and she didn't want to go home because she was afraid that her father was hit her. She decided to curl up on the street corner and light some matches to try and stay warm. When she lit the matches magical things happened. She saw really pleasant things within the flames. In one of them she saw a great feast and all her family together. In another match she lit she saw images of her grandmother and this was something that she really treasured so she lit the rest of them to see if she could see the images of her grandmother again. This time it was like her grandmother was right there with her. All of the sudden something happen, she had a warm feeling and she flew off with her grandmother to heaven.This is a really great story. It is very sad but it is one of my favorite tails. The way that the images in the matches are described are great and you really get a feeling of the cold and what the girl is feeling. There were great pictured to accompany the story. When the end of the story comes around and she is flying off with her grandmother I have more of a feeling of happiness because she is now happy up in heaven with her grandmother. I think the author got across a great array of emotions within this book and the book is one that you could read over many time and still have that feeling time and time again."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"One reviewer here has written that \\"fairy tales are supposed to be happy.\\" Why?If you stick the word \\"Disney\\" in there, then maybe the sentence is true... but in real life, fairy tales are supposed to be a vivid, even exaggerated introduction to the world of morals, virtues, faith and the fantastical, among other things. If you look at the butcher job Disney did with the original story of the Little Mermaid, you'll see what most people today are expecting when they pick up a fairy tale.In this book, unlike anything Disney has ever done, the little girl dies, peacefully, on a freezing street corner, after a short and too-brutal life, joining her grandmother in heaven because the grandmother was the only person who ever loved her and treated her with kindness. She is neglected by strangers, abused by her father, and eventually burns up all her matches trying to stay warm.So. This is a sad fairy tale. As grownups, we can get used to it. But should our kids?My feelings are mixed about whether or not this is a book that is appropriate for children. I recently did read this edition, with the wonderful, lush illustrations by Rachel Isadora, to my own big and little girls (14 and 5 - quite a spread!) to find out.Should I have used them as guinea pigs in this literary experiment? Well, I'm not so sure.Dd2 (5) seemed fine; fascinated, actually. She has been exposed to many fairy tales, but this probably stood out as one of the most vivid things she's ever been read. Perhaps because death is so unexpected in a kids' book. Should it be?On the other hand, dd1 (15) was utterly shocked, and spent a while screaming that it was a TERRIBLE book. She forbade me to read it to dd2 again and I ended up putting the book away until it had to go back to the library... so we really did read it only that one time.I don't know if I regret having read it to them. Probably not.Probably, if it had just been dd2, I would have kept it around and just had whatever conversations naturally flowed. We did have a couple of talks after reading this, about belief in heaven, for example. A couple of times, she just asked me to summarize the story for her, and I did. I think she would have loved to flip through it and gaze at the illustrations for quite a bit longer, but because it upset her big sister, I did put it away.In the end, I think I would rather read my children something sad but REAL (ie genuine thoughtful literature, a \\"living book\\") than all the Disney princesses out there. So I don't regret reading it.I was surprised at how strong dd1's reaction was, but looking back, because she's older and more attuned to cultural and emotional nuances, perhaps her reaction is not surprising at all. It IS pretty outrageous to write a kids' book about death, but Andersen, a master storyteller, has pulled it off.Think about your own kids before bringing this book home; in that sense, I think it's not a great gift item, however \\"seasonal\\" it may be. Know how they react to things that are upsetting, in stories and in real life. And then decide if they'll be able to absorb the larger messages of this book - charity, heaven - without being overly disturbed."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"This story is about a little girl who tries to sell matches to people in the streets in order to make money for her family. One day her father was furious for the lack of funds his daughter was bringing home. He ordered her to stay out on the streets and not return home unless she had sold her matches. After walking around in the freezing cold and snow she was scared to go home and be beaten when she had not sold the required amount of matches to return home. She tucked herself into a corner and rested. After feeling the bitter cold and snow the little girl decided to light matches in an effort to stay warm. With each match she lit a magical vision appeared. With each match the little girl saw warm loving Christmas scenes. Some of the scenes were a feast, a fireplace and finally a warm memory of her grandmother. With this memory and loving scene the little match girl was brave and comforted. Soon the warm comfort of her grandmother allowed her to be comfortable and whisked her away to heaven.The author wanted everyone to believe in happy memories and warm thoughts no matter what emotional state you are in, or whatever social class or size. This is a wonderful story with beautiful pictures that just help the authors' words in describing the warm feelings. You actually can feel the warmth of the little girls visions through the matches.I love this story. It gets me choked up when I read it. But the little girl was so peaceful when she left to be in heaven with her loving grandmother. Everyone's wish is to be loved no matter where you are in life, simply to be loved and filled with warmth."},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"I know that for those who have read this book have found it be disturbing for little children. Honestly, I don't think Hans C. Anderson would have intended this book to be just for adults. I believe he had a heart felt message for all ages. Also, the fact that it introduces real life and after life for a child is very good. Plus, it can also teach a child many other lessons. I am definitely going to read this to my kids. When I first read the little match girl I was not expecting the ending at all. So when the ending did come I cried. It affected me so much. The heart wrenching story of this little girl really hits you hard. Please read this book.~Mayuka"},{"Title":"The Little Match Girl. And Other Stories","review":"What would you do if you saw a little girl with bare feet and tattered clothing? Would you help her out and buy the matches she was selling? Would you just pass by her and never thing twice about it? Most people would just pass her by. That is what happed to this little Match Girl. No one helped her out and unimaginable things happened to her. Read the story and find out what happens.I think the message that this story is trying to give is that you shouldn't just pass up the chance to help out people that are in need. For example, in this story the little girl was very poor. If she didn't bring home some money, her fater would beet her. You should try to help out people when you can. What if that person was you? You would want to get helped, right?"},{"Title":"The Book of Secrets","review":"I found this book in a dumpster at a pretty low point in my life.

I bought this book for my husband and he found it to be just what he expected."},{"Title":"M31","review":"Stephen Wright is one of the most original and inventive novelists working in the English language. His work is shocking, provocative, astonishingly rich and subtle, and peopled by characters so lifelike you can practically smell them. Wright's imagery borders on the poetic, while his satirical viewpoint is one of unparalleled ferocity and intensity. If you want fiction that changes the way you see the world around you, Stephen Wright is for you.While M-31 (his second novel, published in 1989) is not quite as bold and polished as Going Native (his third and last to date, published in 1993), it is still the work of an apalling talent. Presently, I am tip-toeing through his debut, Meditations in Green, a booby-trapped novel set largely in the Vietnam war which may well be the best fictional representation of that conflict ever written. But like all his books, it defies genre and easy categorisation.One day, perhaps, Wright will get the recognition he so richly deserves. Until then, he's the best-kept secret in contemporary literature."},{"Title":"M31","review":"i read this novel years ago, but the feeling of it still stays with me. i'd read a very favorable review of it in the New York Times Book Review. So, i bought the thing. After four pages, i was convinced that this guy was the worst writer in the history of the planet. On page five, i was convinced that he was one of the best. something just \\"kicked in for me.\\" in place of fragmented sentences and randomly shifting points of view, there came a highly stylized narrative technique that seemed to have been invented for the sole purpose of telling this bizarre, weird, curiously powerful, and engrossing tale. And, ps. if you want another great book, totally different from M31...I have a recommendation, but it may just be a \\"guy\\" book. It's Money, by martin amis. not only is it extremely well-written, but it's THE FUNNIEST BOOK IN THE WORLD. happy reading - david"},{"Title":"M31","review":"Richard Wright is a very talented writer. I would compare him to some of my other favorites like Denis Johnson and Chuck Palanhniuk. This book is probably not his best but due to his excellent writing style its worth a read. I won't give any plot summary other than to say this story follows a husband and wife team of ufologists and their inbreed family. The book loses its focus towards the end and some major plot holes are left unanswered. But if you like any of the afformentioned authors I'd check this book out."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"This book is awesome. The perfect teen rock story. It's realistic without being boring, and funny without being silly. I don't even think you need to know or even like rock to appreciate the story.There wasn't a boring moment in the whole story. I hope there might one day be a movie or a sequel. I can't get enough of this book."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"It was an awesome book. Molly became a virtual hero of mine. I fell in love with the characters and couldn&#146;t put the book down because I had to see what happened next. I got attached to it then when I was finished I was all bummed out. The ending was so sad and moving that I cried. Yeah, don&#146;t laugh.Sometimes it was angsty, sometimes it was fluffy, and sometimes it was sad. I wanted it to go on, like a sequel, but in the end I just read it over about nine times. This was a book that was FUN to read!"},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"This book is good, but it made me sad way too much. The book draws in with all the drugs, alcohol, sex, and depression. I was never a fan of books that involved drugs and alcohol, as long as they teach you a lesson.

Who makes a bunch of 17 yr olds the \\"hottest thing\\" after they only play 2 live shows? This book is ridiculous, it will give tweens the wrong impression of the music business, and this entire book is laced with inappropriate mishaps. Not to mention how bland the writing is. These characters are not developed well at all, and Manning mainly focuses on Molly (who is the most confused and poorly created character of all time). The writer basically made this poor girl out to be an idiot. Don't even get me started on Jane. If you're going to make a girl in a band a drug addict (cliche much?) at least make it believable. Give her a reason! Don't just go \\"Hmm, I think I'll throw in a slutty drug addict chick\\" and then don't delve into her psyche a little bit. The \\"magazine articles\\" within the book were tragically awful. NO ONE would ever write an article like that. Bottom line: The story would be slightly interesting had it been writen by someone with more writing skills."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"I am not a spelling bee queen but I noticed many spelling and grammatical errors in each chapter.

This book proved to be very interesting because it all started with three girls who wanted to start a band called the Hormones. The main charater Molly is the guitarist and singer. Her two best friends Jane and Tara play bass and keyboards. After one of there first gigs, the three girls meet two other boys, Dean and T. Dean decides that the Hormones need a little something more. He and T join the band to help the girls out. The Hormones become a major hit in England and then tour America. During the tour Molly faces some very drastic decisions that could get her in deep trouble. I enjoyed reading this book mostly because I just got myself a guitar. I've always dreamed of being a singer when I get older. This book showed me the trials that a person must go through to get into the music business.If you are a girl that just wants to be a super star, I advise you to read this book.(...)"},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"When I checked this book out from the library, I started reading just as we got in the car. I didn't put it down until I fell asleep in it. I really fancied the beginning and at first I really fancied Molly, because she reminded me some much of myself. However, after she met Dean and after their first rehearsal, the book really took a down fall. Molly started getting really immature and irrational and talking like she was in the third grade. There were some good parts but there were also a lot of dissappointments (...)"},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"When I first saw this book I just had to pick it up and read it. I just had to know why this chick was called guitar girl. Its pretty much about a girl who starts a band in London [by the way it may take you a little while to get that this story is set in London]. Her name is Molly, her and her friends pair up with Dean and his friend. I was unable to put this book down. This book is about all the things that take toll on a band. Sex, drugs, fans, and of course the music. Jane, T, Tara, Dean and Molly are all rapped up into the crazy rock and roll world. I do hope they make his movie on film someday.By the way the ending is sad and makes you want to cry but at the same time feel all fuzzy inside."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"Would difinitely love to see Guitar Girl come out for the kindle.very gripping for young adults and great story."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"I first saw this book reviewed by Teen People and I thought it looked interesting and then I had a chance and I bought it. I am glad I did. It was a good story. Sarra Manning is one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"Guitar Girl should be read by everyone in a band or who wants to be in a band. It teaches you a lot, and shows what it is really like. It warns you never to sign a contract without checking it with a solicitor. However, it is not as good as Diary of a Crush, which is Sarra Manning's best work."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"At first i was intrigued by this book. I spotted the cover and read the inside flap. \\"Okay,\\" i thought, \\"It's about a guitar playing girl who's making it big. I play guitar, she plays guitar, i think i can relate. Should be pretty good.\\"When i started reading it i really enjoyed it, it was well written with believeable characters. The reason it only got four, instead of five stars? It was kind of a rip off of the Sex Pistols' history. I had read ROTTEN by John Lydon (johnny rotten) a few months earlier and the similarities were uncanny. The drug thing with molly's friend (sid vicious,) the fact they had a very possesive manager (malcom), and a stylist that freaked if Molly wasn't wearing the right thing (vivinne). And there are more that i could tell but that would give away the ending to the book. So i find it to be a modern-day girl version of the Sex Pistols that's no where near as hard hitting as the real thing.I'd recommend this book to pre-teens interested in the music life, and when they hit the age of around 15 or 16 buy them ROTTEN for the full on, real story."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"It was a good book. Molly was cute and relate-able as she tried to be different, fill her perceptions of a rock star, and her romance with Dean was believable (to me, anyway, I know people in real life who do the whole \\"I hated him until we started making out in the middle of an argument\\"). She didn't act like a punker-than-thou brat, she was a real girl trying to keep her head above water. A few people have complained that Manning lifted the plot more or less from the Sex Pistols' story, and they're right, but probably most of Manning's readers are either two young to know about the Sex Pistols or aren't interested in them enough to learn their history. If she did do that, I think it's kind of cool. Once again, the ending was semi-realistic and not a complete deus ex machina like so many teen books I read. So hey, go for it."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"The debute novel, Guitar Girl, by Sarra Manning shows several different stages of a teenage girl's life. Molly Montgomery was a girl who was classified as a \\"loser\\" in her school. Very few people reconized her. However, this all changed after getting her band to play at a local club. They hired a manager and hit the road to fame. Along the way, Molly found romance, fame, and the truth to the music industry. Everytime Molly discovered something new it just made her more disappointed. Finally, she was tired of being manipulated by her manager. She packed her belongings and headed home. Her popularity with her friends and fans was destroyed. To top it all off, she was being fied for a heafty amount of cash. However, that didnt stop Molly because she had a letter form her hero to keep her living.I think every young adult should read this novel.

The baginning was cool. Molly was fun. The middle was fine. The whole Dean thing was annoying, but believeable. The end was a gyp. It was kind of depressing. If I were Molly, though, I would have quit LONG before she did. Knowing me, I would have left after the English tour and gotten P. O.'d at Jane and the... manager... guy... I can't remeber his name. But, anyways, after he threatened me I would have tried to take him down myself. That would've so cool, if she'd, like, gotten a gun, and.... Oh, sorry, I'm off on a tangent. I'd like to see a reunion tour. That would rock really hard."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"Wow, what a book. The beginning, middle was awesome. The end was okay because it was weird and ended too soon. Overall i would recommanded this book.

What more could you want in a book?"},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"I thought this book was fantastic (obviously). You really get onto the emotional rollercoaster that Molly rides while during her time in The Hormones.

At the party, they meet Paul who becomes their manager. They do a few shows and interviews and then they go on tour. They meet people and find out what it's like to live the rock star life. They find out that some people aren't as trustworthy as they seem. I read this book because I want to be a rock star. Girls who want to be rock stars should read this book because it's awesome.I really liked the characters, setting, and the theme of this book. Molly described the characters in a funny, but descriptive, way. She described Dean as \\"...quite cute. Tall and lanky, but somehow managing to bypass weedy. Dark tufty hair, good cheekbones, and a T-shirt that would have looked like Hello Kitty if Hello Kitty had devil horns and a blodd mustache.\\" The theme was the \`life of a teenage rock star', and I liked that because I'm a musician and I like reading stories about musicians. In the story, you can tell she's a musician because she says, \`I know it was me who decided that we should form a band. I think I even said, \\"Hey, we should form a band.\\"' I didn't like the prologue because it tells you what happens at the end and I didn't want to know that yet.I loved this book because I want to be a rock star and it shows what people e really like in the music business. Some people are honest and others aren't.

They do, and the band gets signed to a record label and they are as big as everyone knows teen pop can get. But it aint all fun and games because Molly has to deal with a power abusing manager, the fact that Dean and her hate eachother (or maybe they're just pretending because they have the hots for eachother), and the effect that being in the spotlight can have on the young and famous.

The story line unravels and follows a rock n' roll journey through an industry that can seem glamorous and unattainable to many. Molly and the Hormones were the lucky ones - sort of.This book was awesome! It was an emotional read with all of the great elements of writing - settings, conflicts, protagonists, antagonists, climaxes, and an ending that was revealed in the prologue, but hit me like a hot white revelation in the epilogue. I will read this book again! I want to buy a paperback copy so that I can scribble notes to the characters in the margins. I want to buy a hardback copy so that I can sit it on my desk as a reminder that life can often give us what we want - but it may not be what we expect. Wants can often be heartbreaking and always seem to come with a few bumps and bruises.I'm very good when it comes to reading the last pages and paragraphs of books or stories - I don't do it. I like to read from beginning to the end. This book's prologue gave a quick glimpse of what the ending would be, but then the first chapter began a flashback of events that lead to the conclusion.Molly Montgomery is 17 when she learns to play guitar and write songs about Hello Kitty. Her inspiration is Ruby X, a musician and lyricist, who Molly identifies with as starting a revolution for girls who love to rock. Molly starts her own band, the Hormones, with her friends Jane and Tara. Life for these three high school misfits takes a sudden turn when they meet up with Dean and \\"T\\" and are discovered by business savvy and smooth talking manager, Paul.Molly's heart is about changing the world through music; Paul's heart is about boosting his bank account. Molly's band mates fit into the glitter, glory and gore of making the rapid climb to being stars. However, for Molly, the climb for the Hormones is rocky and rough and she often stands on the sideline and watches as her own hormones rage. Molly eventually makes a decision - but I won't tell you what it is."},{"Title":"Guitar Girl","review":"Guitar Girl, written by Sarra Manning is a gripping book about three teenage girls, Molly, Jane, and Tara, who start a band to be part of the \`girl revolution.' It offers a rollercoaster of emotions, as the suspense rises and falls all throughout the book.Molly gets the idea to start the band and the others love it! They meet a guy named Dean at one of their gigs who says he and a friend could help the band. They sure did, and they joined the band too! At the first gig they all did together they meet Paul, who wants to be their manager. They have many struggles when they tour together especially with Dean's new girlfriend, Sandrine.They all seem to lose their sprits when they go to America on tour. Jane starts having problems with drugs and alcohol, Tara begins to act really mean, and Dean and Molly have a very discomforting kiss.When Paul discovers all this is going on, he starts to tell every band member the same thing, \\"that they are the most important person,\\" and that sparks huge controversy within the band.Sarra Manning is a teen queen. She is the editor of many huge teen magazines including Seventeen. She has written five books, and is working on her sixth. She lives in London with her dog.I thought the book was really engaging.

This book is mainly for teenagers, I can say that now, even though it is in the young adult section anyways.
