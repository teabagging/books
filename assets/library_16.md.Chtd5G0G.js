Throughout the book, Dorian Gray becomes very popular and attracts all sorts of attention just by waltzing into a room. People find him so innocent and pure, he's alluring (which soons turns sour.) But they don't see his other life. His loathing of the once-beautiful portrait which now displays his age, sins and iniquities. This deep hatred drives him to do many strange things in this dark, twisting tale of morale, age and youth. The book follows Dorian through love, loss, murder, disdain, hurt and ofcourse, happiness. Because it covers most every subject, its a wonderful classic, and a must-read.Though because its written in England in the 19th century, some of the vocabulary is bewildering. Its best to read with a dictionary near by or atleast some knowledge of English Literature and diction."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A comely, vain, innocent young man named Dorian Gray gets his portrait painted and hides it away in an unused room in his house. After a love affair with an actress goes terribly wrong, he notices that his portrait has altered itself in a curious way. He proceeds to live his life by indulging himself in episodes of increasing debauchery and immorality, wrecking other people's lives and committing blackmail and even murder, and all the while his portrait bears the physical signs of his aging while his own body remains young and fresh. The novel offers some weighty questions: Would we choose to be immoral if we knew we were immortal? Is an artist's work the manifestation of his own latent immorality? Are the world's imperfections, sins, and shames represented better through art than through reality?As much as I admire Oscar Wilde's great play &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest,&quot; I must admit that I found some faults with this short novel of his. Despite its florid prose and dialogue containing wickedly caustic wit and punchy aphorisms that evoke a time when conversation was an art, the novel has a strangely artificial, stiff tone. With dialogue that sounds like it would have to be rehearsed before spoken and many scene descriptions that seem like stage directions, it often reads like a play that's been converted into a novel. Interior furnishings are described in the meticulous detail of a Sotheby's catalog; a nice touch, but what's the point? This is an intriguing novel that combines elements of gothic horror and social satire, but it is marred by too many moments of unintentional goofiness."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In London, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets up with a wealthy young gentleman, Dorian Gray.

In certain parts of the book he starts to show a nervous side of himself. He does this because he is witnessing that a certain picture of someone is changing before his very eyes. Whose picture you're asking, what do think that I'm going to tell you! Stop asking, and read the book already. Anyway, the setting of this book is taking place around the Victorian Times in England. In England there is an art studio in which Basil Hallward, the artist that paints a certain picture, works and spends most of his time. The problem in the story all started when Dorian spoke a &quot;request.&quot; He &quot;requested&quot; that, &quot;Why can't this picture age instead of myself?&quot; Dorian will be scared of what happens after the next few months. One person enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was great reading. This person loved how the author used vivid details in all his characters, especially Dorian Gray.

Not only do I have much of the book highlighted, but it is worn from reading again and again. I would definitly reccomend this brilliant novel to anyone who wants to walk away with a feeling as if they've discovered a treasure they must share with the world."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and nave young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty. Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful. As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals. A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture. As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait. It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you want a new slant on this classic novel, read 'The Ripper Code' by Thomas Toughill. This is the book which reveals that Oscar Wilde was blackballed by the Oxford Union."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful and witty tale about a depraved man. His ugly soul is mirrored by his ever-changing portrait while he retains his youthful visage. Suspenseful throughout. A classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar WildeI have downloaded this ebook and have found it to be the most well thought out in terms of navigation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's classic gothic tale of a man who is granted his wish to remain forever young is still a fine and compelling read. Dorian Gray is captured at the height of his physical charms in a painting and soon discovers that the corruption of his body and soul is reflected in the painting while he retains his youthful attractiveness. His life becomes one of increasing debauchery and narcissism.The most quotable of authors, Wilde uses a friend of the young man to deliver an endless collection of axioms and witty observations that add another dimension to the plot.As Gray becomes more convinced of his invincibility he grows more callous toward others and his actions become less human and more monstrous as the story progresses."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Am I no less agreeable?

Dorian teaches me a very important lesson:You can never escape the consequences of evil and regardless of how fortunate you are in some areas of your life, there are always lurking in our souls those moments of shame and regret.I know that the book has many messages about narcissism, beauty, art, conscience, friendship, social classes and other topics, but Dorian's inability to shake his evil actions is what I will remember the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wow. This was my first Wilde, and I don't think it will be my last. Another reviewer said that this book was about people doing horrible things, and yet the book was impossible to put down.Nearly everyone knows the story. Dorian Gray wishes that his portrait will show the ravages of time and wickedness while he remains young and beautiful - and he gets his wish. I knew that Dorian's life was going to be ruined - and at times I could predict what was going to happen next. Usually that turns me away from a book. But Wilde's storytelling is so delectable, so riveting that (to use a cliche) it was like watching a train wreck. Terrible to see, but I couldn't look away. I was fascinated.I have heard complaints about the 'flowery' language, but I loved it!Being the overthinker that I am, this book also raised some questions for me: Was Dorian really corrupted by Lord Henry, or did Lord Henry merely show the world Dorian's true hidden nature? Was Basil to blame somehow for painting the portrait? This was probably Wilde's goal - to make us think, and to make us question our hidden nature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ever since I got my kindle, I've been downloading free classics and The Picture of Dorian Gray was one of them. I remembered it was an option to read for our British Literature final paper so it caught my eye. I started reading the book knowing absolutely nothing about it and within the first few pages I was caught up in its beautiful writing and witty banter between the characters. It's a great story about how a man basically trades his soul for his youth. Wilde writes about the debauchery that Dorian goes through without being so literal about it, which is probably because he was living during victorian times, but it's great because it lets your imagination wander. He doesn't outright say that Dorian seduces women, gets high, or is bisexual, but you assume all of that from his writing. This is not a story that teaches you to choose the \\"good\\" path in life. It's a story that tells us that if we could be a little hedonistic without consequences we would. I'd love to live Dorian Gray's life for a week to know what it feels like...but then have it erased from my life.The negative reviews were basically that the book is boring. I admit there was this one part of the book where it describes everything that Dorian Gray bought, but it's only for a chapter. Another negative reviewer wrote that this book is full of quotables without substance, and well, I don't think the quotes are a bad thing. It's funny! I personally love reading all types of books, both classic and modern, but the ones that keep me fascinated are the classics. The style of writing is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It felt longer than the actual (approx) 280 paper pages it is. I skipped over some of Dorian's ranting about 60% through. I've never skimmed like that... Even in Anne of Green Gables.

Nice ending, but I feel like it was a bit abrupt.SIDE NOTE ON TECHNICALLY EBOOK ASPECTS:The chapters are not recognized by Kindle. You cannot advance by chapter as in other books."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rather impressed as I have never read this one. Although, there are a few typos on the Kindle version."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though many of us no longer believe in \\"corruptible souls,\\" Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" still holds up as literature and a container of meaning. Though the metaphysics of the novel were likely a mere literary device even in Wilde's day, they nonetheless strike at something deep. Essentially, they ask two perennial questions, \\"what does it mean to be a good person?\\" and \\"How do I know if I'm a good person?\\" Unlike most non-literary mortals, the extremely corruptible (aren't we all?) Dorian Gray has direct empirical evidence of the state of his \\"goodness.\\" He receives, via a Faustian pact sans Faust, a \\"soul mirror\\" from the hapless painter Basil Hallward. As Gray develops from an innocent, almost waifish, youth endowed with irresistible masculine beauty into the Marquis de Sade of the English leisure class, the painting records his increasing dissoluteness. In trade, his physical being retains all the luster of youth and beauty he possessed at 18. This would provide a near irresistible bargain for many twentieth century people, and one wonders at the number of real but metaphorical equivalents of Gray portraits that exist today. But universal belief in a soul, especially as a \\"chalkboard of one's self,\\" has become quaint (even those who believe in a soul probably don't imbue their lives with this belief). Who then, apart from religious adherents, today really worries about \\"damage to the soul\\" in an eschatologically consistent manner that would make Wilde's book blare a meaningful warning signal? Hasn't such thought gone the way of the ether and phlogiston (even though exorcists still dwell among us)? Why read this novel?The simple answer is that \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" remains great literature, though even that concept carries far less weight today than fifty years ago. But if by \\"great literature\\" we mean a story with depth, intrigue, drama and unforgettable characterization then maybe more antennas perk up. Many have also called it a \\"horror story,\\" so perhaps one can subsume it under precursors to Steven King and other morally based modern horror novels? Whatever convenient label one puts on such works, great stories, be they novels, movies, video games, hieroglyphics, songs, dances, buildings, or even a splotch on the sidewalk, teach us something about ourselves. They flip that often neglected \\"introspection switch\\" somewhere in our wiring that supercharges the wonder mechanism. So regardless of the now ancient metaphysics and 19th century ethos of this novel, the telling of such a story as a \\"horror fable\\" still touches that ineffable part of us that strives for \\"goodness,\\" whatever that means. Dorian Gray explores this theme by depicting the abstraction of goodness in visual form that morphs in sympathy with some objective measure of that quality. This in itself summons the creeping question \\"what would my portrait look like?\\" As well as \\"what standards would make my portrait writhing and horrid?\\" The novel suggests, amongst other things, that disregarding the situations of others and focusing selfishly on one's own pleasures makes one corrupt. Sybil Vane's tragic end, arguably the result of Gray's selfish cruelty, produces the portrait's first \\"scrupulous twitch.\\" We still experience these wispy twitches today, with or without a belief in souls. But our increasingly individualistic world throws rationalizations up for any parallel behavior. In a curious twist to the enlightenment-inspired right of \\"pursuit of happiness\\" we suddenly find ourselves morally justifying the destruction of others in the name of principles of \\"individual freedom.\\" This novel seems to eschew such thinking all the way to Gray's macabre and unforgettable death scene. The portrait wasn't so detached from the body after all, it seems. Reducing the book's \\"moral\\" down to a platitude such as \\"selfish hedonism doesn't pay\\" belittles Wilde's achievement. Though really, it says as much but in a beautiful and horrifyingly satisfying way. And it says it in a way that even touches the modern sensibility. Fables can still have impact in an emergent posthumanist era.Another reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is that, being Wilde's only novel, one can claim to the unknowing that \\"I have read all of Oscar Wilde's novels\\" and come across as quite educated indeed. Of course Wilde was well known for his plays. And the sensibilities of the playwright do appear throughout this short book, with the exception of some long passages of narrative summary in the book's second half. Copious dialogue inhabits large sections, especially when the loquacious Lord Henry Wotton spews his neo-hedonist views. These play a role in Gray's corruption and also suggest a fear of contagious and dangerous ideas. Can ideas corrupt? \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to say \\"yes.\\" But this novel will not corrupt. It will entertain, being a great story, and it will inspire thinking, because it has substance. And since it spins a great yarn it also has the ability to moralize without the appearance of moralizing. Double bonus. So voluminous reasons exist to pick up and chew at this old tale, either in fiber or electronically. And, finally, if you're going to write only one novel, make it a jaw-dropper. Wilde did."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful beautiful copy. I was delighted to receive this in the post. It looks like an aged piece of literature--which it is.

However, towards the middle of the book, the plots descends into a lengthy tiring description of artifacts (musical instruments, stones and jewelry, portraits and so on) that really break the rhythm of the book. By the time I reached the end, I was quite fed up with this inventory of objects.

Indulgence and youth and beauty -- these are things that really matter in life.Good book. Bad moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nothing that can be said of this book will truely do it justice- you must read it to understand it.Some books are so clearly written that when a character voices a thought all you want to do is agree and quote it so others can see what you didn't even know- but have now relized- you were thinking. This book offers rich ideas on everything in life guided by the moral decay of Dorian Gray who's fulfilled wish of youth becomes the means to vices and sins. Meanwhile two friends offer opposing advice- and through it all there is no black and white and moral judgement. Simply a tale of human desires and dissapointments. Though it was written long ago it could have been told today and still ring just as true (perhaps with just alternate form of transportation and letters being sent via e-mail)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be. Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become. This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth. Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story. What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Oscar Wilde published his only novel back in 1890 he caused much excitement among the literary critics and the society as a whole. And I'm a little bit puzzled because there is no evidence that the book deserves some negative feedback. It seems to me that someone who criticizes the ideas in the novel and summarizes it as an \`immoral' demonstrates high level of hypocrisy. This is art and art is about freedom of imagination and expressing. If we expect from art to represent only moral emotions we experience in our daily life then art wouldn't worth so much.The story of the book is somehow very simple. A young and innocent man named Dorian Gray fascinates an artist so much that the artist finds inspiration even in his only presence. Basil Hallward confides his secret obsession to a friend of his named Lord Henry Wotton and at that very moment Henry decides to meet Dorian. From their meeting on, their relationship is the main point around which the story evolves. Henry is a cynic person who has very provocative and fascinating way of declaring his position for most of the aspects of life. His attitude is uncommon for 19th century London high society and could be characterized as immoral. Dorian gradually adopts the lifestyle Henry proclaims and indulges in taking maximum from the life no matter the cost and no matter who will have to pay for it. On the other hand a rash desire expressed by Doran that the portrait Basil has painted of him ages and Dorian himself stays forever young becomes true. With always innocent look on his beautiful face Dorian is in a very good position to take maximum of his life and he does it. By breaking norms, recognized by high society he ruins lives of most persons attracted and charmed by his beauty and charisma. Lord Henry stays always beside him as a \`spiritual' mentor while Basil goes to the background of Dorian's world. The picture Dorian hides in an abandoned room in his house shows not only marks of aging but also is a mirror of Dorian's soul - everything he does reflects on the picture's face expression which turns to an evil grimace that disgusts Dorian. Finally he comes to a moment that feels sorry for the life he had chosen and decides to make everything possible so that to restore his portrait's humane look as much as possible.The end of the story proved quite an intriguing to me and I feel somehow confident that such an end seems to be the most logical for the story although being drastic and direct in his representation.The writing style of Wilde is of a person who knows very well what he has to say and in the same time you don't get feeling that someone is trying to teach you something. On the contrary - this novel looks like a very good related story. On some moments too much attention is paid to the details, something that represents more successfully the atmosphere of the story but the movement suffers a little bit.I personally am in deep sympathies for Lord Henry's character. His directly stated position on the topic is very often shocking but the interesting part is that you could stay and think a while and take from it what you appreciate. Nothing in this world is completely wrong I think. Just be careful not to fall into blind deviation and become second Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With today's slippery morals and exhausting vanity, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an eerie comparison to &quot;then&quot; and now. There are many interesting scenes in the book that make this book very exciting. It is about a man who, upon receiving a portrait of himself, is so upset that it will &quot;mock&quot; him with it's permanent beauty, while he will age and decay. He makes a wish that he will remain young and beautiful and the picture will age and take his sins for him. In the end, though he is beautiful on the outside, he is horrendous on the outside.Definitely a good read for high school students. It's interesting and short, and not as cumbersome as other Romantic novels can be. You can relate it to today's times and it is not a hard read. I did not want to read ANY Romantic novels but I am very happy that I chose this one! And you will be, too!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book offers its readers a chance to understand the meaning of true beauty and the reason why time passes the way that it does. If you enjoy really good quotes that make you think, this is a great book for you. It made me think of ideas and concepts that I had never thought about before. Some reviews of novels say they could &quot;never put the book down.&quot; But what happens when the book is over and it goes on the shelf? I would like to hope that, with this book, the wheels in my head will keep turning, and I will continue to think about the concepts it brought up, and apply it to my own life. I think you will do the same if you read this novel by Oscar Wilde"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde tries to argue in the prologue of this book that literature, as a form of art, is not moralistic and that people therefore should not treat it as such.In all honesty, however, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an extremely moral book; it's just hard to decide what exactly the moral is. The very good and the very bad do not fare that well in this tale of elitist debauchery, while those who go the middle path and avoid both evil and righteousness seem to do quite well. Wilde once said that he wanted to be like Dorian Gray (evil), was perceived by the world as being Lord Henry (moderate), but was actually like Basil Hallward (good). Does this mean that Wilde, by his own moralistic views, was inevitably doomed, regardless of what he tried to be or actually succeeded in being?Anyway, all of this moral stuff is very interesting, but don't fear; the novel isn't terribly philosophical and pretentious. Instead, the book has a by-and-large well-done and consistent plot, and by the end of the novel, when all of these questions of right and wrong are flowing through your head, you can barely recall how on Earth Wilde slipped all that philosophical stuff by you without seeming lofty or ridiculous.I read this book to compete in an essay contest, but I never got around to writing the essay and I'm still glad I read it. A quick and amusing romp through the darkest corners of upper-class 1800s England; recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I absolutely loved the novel written by Oscar Wilde, The Picture Of Dorian Gray. When I was beginning the novel it was a little slow and even a little dry. But, as the plot thickened and the story went on, I can say it is one of my most favorite books ever read. Dorian Gray, the main character, is obsessed with his good looks and his youth. Gray sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. But his close friend who is an artist paints a portrait of Gray. As the years pass Gray doesn't age but the picture does. His conscious and eternal youth ends up becoming well ........ You'll have to read to find out.People most likely to read and enjoy this novel would probably be late teens and older. Mainly because it has a lot to do with being young and having all the time in the world to do whatever and learn and experience so much. It also is a little bit harder to read for someone younger. I would really recommend this novel to everyone. The story is great and has a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Rod Stewert once sang that &quot;every picture tells a story&quot;, and in no case is this more true than of one Dorian Gray. By now everyone knows that young Dorian makes a childish wish that a beautiful portrait of his should age in his stead, and that he should remain forever young and vibrant, and somehow this wish is granted. What follows is a tale of increasing debauchery and depravity that poison a man's soul, while leaving no visible clue upon his face.This is not the most entertaining or gripping novel that you will ever read. Far from it, in fact, but the real merits of the novel come not from the action and plot, but from the extremely clever dialogue and the shredding social commentary. (not surprisingly, this novel took a long time to get published, and was later used as evidence against Wilde during his trial for indecency) Wilde takes several shots at the aristocracy, especially their values, as well as art itself, hedonism, and the very concept of morality.Perhaps the finest aspect of the novel are Wilde's quotes, often through his favorite mouthpiece: Lord Henry Wotton. Henry serves as a goad to Dorian through all of his excesses, and he waxes philosophical upon almost any subject that he can get anyone to listen to. He's wonderful and horrible all at once, and best of all, he doesn't even believe half of what he says. This is definitely a 'classic' novel, and well worth the read. Again, if you're expecting high paced action you'd probably best look elsewhere, but if you're in the mood to think a bit, then chances are you'll enjoy &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a very sinful, witty, humorous and beautiful book. This has got to be Wilde's most personal work, one can tell from the writing itself that Wilde really put himself into these pages or maybe what he wanted to become. The tale of Dorian and the tale of Wilde have the same kind of \\"tragic ending\\" to it. Wilde's downfall of being accused of homosexuality and Dorian no longer being able to bear the pain of his acts and conducts bring tragic endings to their lives. I think that every person has or has had for a certain amount of time the wish to stay forever young and beautiful, the burden of time not affecting you at all but something else, in Dorian's case, it was the painting, anyways I'm rambling on and on, do read this book, it's 2:00 am right now and I have a Physics exam tomorrow, today actually, anyway, do read it, it's enjoyable, funny, touching and everything else that a good novel should be."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY has enough going for it to retain its classic status for some time to come. It is loaded with epigrammic sentences by a writer who continues to hold interest. Its concept was highly original and has inspired generations of science fiction, fantasy and horror literature since its debut. Wilde stows a lot of his themes and notes on society and character into its pages, so that it often reads like a stack of dispatches from the late 19th century. The dinner party scenes are priceless. It is certainly worth reading in order to understand why Dorian Gray has entered our language, so often alluded to.While possessing the above traits, the novel does have its flaws that are more pronounced under the glare of contemporary light. Wilde's bigotry shows through. Some of the passages are melodramatic and wooden. Dorian Gray's physical beauty is a work of art, and as Wilde says at the outset, all art is useless. However much he embodies many of Wilde's ideas, he remains rather vapid, even when he is at his most corrupt. Part of that is due to the fact that many of the actions that condemn him are only spoken of or hinted at. Mostly we see the highlights, the suicide of a young girl to whom he was unjustly cruel and some subsequent deaths."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Loved this story in school and it just gets better with rereading.

Wilde is a genius of literature. Everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is a classic about the timeless quest for youth and beauty. The desire to find a fountain of youth rings as true today as it did in 1890 when the story was first published. Dorian Gray is a young and dashingly handsome man. When he looks at a portrait that was painted of him it stirs up the regrettable fact that he's at the top of his game now and will never look better. He's irritated that the portrait will continue to look the same and in a sense mock him as he ages in real life. What's a man to do? There was no such thing as plastic surgery back then, and Botox was unheard of. Dorian laments: \\"Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!\\" Boom. He gets his wish. That brings us to the old adage, be careful what you wish for. Being young and beautiful is wonderful--at first. Many, many years later, it can get tiresome, at least for Dorian. Dorian doesn't know what to do with all that time. He studies many things and that part of the book got a tad tiresome for me. But stick with it, things get better and a lot more interesting. I thought this was a great book. I liked the story and Wilde's writing style. It's a classic \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was one of my favorite reads as a pre-teen so I was eager to read it again 50 years later. What I learned was how differently I understood the story. As a young person, I enjoyed the premise and the supernatural aspect of the subject. Wouldn't that be cool sort of thing. But now, I see the struggle between good and evil, self-indulgence versus altruism, hedonism versus retraint and self-respect. I wish I had appreciated more of that as a young person; it probably would have helped me avoid some of the pitfalls of growing up. A provocative read for all ages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was really creepy and haunting. It was incredible, though, even though the style of writing could get a little boring at times, with its long descriptions.

The title character, the beautiful and naive Dorian Gray, sells his soul so that he can remain beautiful forever. Instead of his body ageing, a portrait of him suffers instead. What follows is a tragic tale of decadence and hedonism as Dorian Gray succumbs to a lifestyle of excess and debauchery. The painting acts as Dorian's own soul, mutating with each sin he commits, while he remains untouched. Dorian's journey through the recesses of his own mind is a harrowing study of human nature and one that is impossible to put down."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot.

Even though there is no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading this book I chose it because of the Author.

I'm a fan of Oscar Wilde, and I could'ntmiss this great classical novel. The book is dominated by two amazing and strong personalities :Dorian Gray,a character full of life, and his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.The story is deliciously dark and unusual, and as far as I know this is the only novel Wilde hadever written. It provides an interesting look on the society of the time through this multi-layeredstory, and Dorian Gray is a perfect representation of the human species. The novel depicts anundeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, and allows thereader to understand better why it upset the British society that was emerging from the socialconstraints of Victorianism. I appreciated the beauty of his writing style, always elegant, witha flow that looks like poetry all along the book. The conversations exchanged are also witty andpoignant.Maybe some people could find the flow of the story quite slow, or with too many descriptions,which may not give enough room for imagination. Also the text was a little small, but remainedvery readable.Anyway, I highly recommend this book.

You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic). On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs. We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another. If we're lucky, we see him before the fall. There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption. Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption). We've probably even seen him near the end of the process. Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant. It covers the process of corruption very well. The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!

READ IT NOW!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I used the built in dictionary regularly with this story which is rich with precise descriptive language of the 19th century."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I found the first half or so of this novel the stronger, more interesting part, mostly for the unbelievable abundance of mercilessly satirical paradoxes of the cleverest quality.The building of the story around three characters, really quite different, is satisfying; though, as the story goes on, it's really only about Dorian and his mysterious portrait.The most prominent character for the first part is Lord Harry, the mouthpiece for all of the novel's notoriously subversive paradoxes. People may find him irritating because of his supercilious, scornful intellectual brilliance - they may even be jealous of him because of this, like I was to begin with; and then others will most likely be offended becuase of his espousal of an immoral aestheticism which disregards corrupting social consequences. Yet, I find Lord Harry as remote and inflexible in his decadent aestheticism as any unsympathetic moralist I've ever met in fiction - it's just Lord Harry chooses to be moralistic in a paradoxical, unconventional way. His attitudes are exclusive and unbending, and he lives out his beliefs uncompromisingly. He is impatient of any other view - yes, he is highly moralistic - a brilliant character. I don't think he's meant to be taken too seriously, in the sense that one tries to warm to him or learn from him, like one does with central, powerful characters in other stories - he does not serve that purpose. He's not there to be engaged with; if you attempt it, he'll laugh at you and push you away. He has a weary dislike of you before you even begin reading. So, if you try to make yourself like him, it won't work, and you'll dislike him all the more, and may dislike the novel because of it. Don't upset yourself: read it in the right way. It fully deserves it, because there are pages and pages of gifted prose to be in awe of.Dorian can be likeable because of his sincerity. If I've mistaken him and he isn't really sincere, then I like him because at least he's never at ease with himself for his bad actions - though even that might not be totally true! Well, he is not the same as Lord Harry; he doesn't repulse your advances towards him as a reader like Lord Harry. He's not untouchable.I don't think the story is making any great moral point. Such is the beauty of the writing style and the ideas and the way the people are, rather than who they are, that I think the characters are secondary, in some strange way. The tragedy that befalls two of the main characters near the end of the book isn't heart wrenching. But that isn't a fault of the author's in not making them likeable enough or not developing them well enough; because, like I say, they are slightly removed from us. What is presented for our delectation is the beauty of how they are, more than the morality of how they ought to behave."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In books, magazines, television, etc. in the English-speaking world, we often come across references made to Oscar Wilde, as many people quote his witty sayings and lines. Having come across so many of these references and quotations myself, I was hesitant to pick up any of his works, assuming that to understand and appreciate Wilde I would have to be some kind of a literary scholar. Let me set the record straight: this is definitely not the case at all, as Oscar Wilde is very down to earth and easy to understand.He is a gifted writer and I understand now why people quote him so much. He's a master at putting thoughts to pen and paper so ingeniously. After I found out for myself what he was all about, I regret that I never read his books earlier. I picked up this book that included various works and I was truly amazed at his genius. He interlaces humor with the heavy so cleverly.In all of his works you can easily identify a so-called \\"dandy\\", a male character whose one role is to make flippant but ironically true remarks to the dismay of stuffy characters. The quotes we so often see or hear are usually remarks uttered by one of Wilde's dandies. Offering tongue-in-cheek humor with wholehearted honesty, Wilde called a spade, a spade but could so with such brilliant wit. Oh if only I could be even half as gifted with the pen!I am not going to write about any plots of the stories and plays, as other readers have done that already. I simply wanted to say that if you have never read anything by Wilde, I highly recommend you do. I am confidant you will enjoy. You could end up like me, frantically longing to get your hands on as much of his writing as you can."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Innocent and young Dorian Gray is seduced by some bad influences, and taught to worship youth, beauty, and sensation. Due to a passionate prayer, the physical effects of a life dedicated to self-gratification and pleasure-seeking are borne by a painting of him instead of by his own body. The story focuses not on the actual events of Dorian's life, but the discussions on the philosophies supporting such a life. To this reviewer, the message is that a life of selfishness and self-gratification corrupts, and in the end we can have no separation from this corruption. Dorian Gray is a tad slow at times, as the conversations can get long, but it is still educational, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never would have thought this interesting combination of Marlowe, Shakespeare, and Dickens possible. For those of you who follow my writing, you know that I really liked Mr. Wilde's \\"Importance of Being Earnest.\\" And his \\"Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is enough to put him right up there with Mr. Marlowe, Mr. Shakespeare, and Mr. Dickens. Like any good tale of terror, the story starts normal and plausible. We only get to know Sybil for a short while, but she delivers a very touching passage on her love for Dorian which prepares her very sympathetic character. Her brother is prepared early and resurfaces with good timing. Basil is well drawn as the artist who has an interesting fascination with Dorian. We only see Alan Campbell briefly, but we are permitted to feel some sympathy for him when he is forced into a criminal act and finds himself overcome with anxiety. Harry is a well drawn character who not only provides comical touches, but jokes (unknowingly) about many dark thoughts that are undoubtedly revolving in Dorian's mind. And Dorian? What a wonderful creation! First we get to see him as a normal person. Soon afterwards, we see his dark desires. We see him fall in love, and then we see his love turn to abuse. But even as we see his character descend into evil, Wilde never quite permits us to forget that he is human. This is especially prevalent when he longs for his childhood innocence. Wilde masterfully builds tension when Dorian's unchanged face starts to raise questions. And as if this were not enough, Wilde allows Dorian's reputation to degenerate with his character. What's left? Only beautiful and excellent wording, magnificent suspense, terrifying moments, dramatic irony, some well placed comical touches, etc, etc, etc. This is a phenomenal book that offers an interesting combination of Marlowe's techniques (showing pacts with evil), Shakespeare's techniques (articulate wording and passages), and Dickens' techniques. (Fierce humor side by side with pure terror.) DO NOT let this phenomenal masterpiece get away!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I made it through both high school and college without ever having been assigned this book. Over the years I have read plenty of Wilde's works, but for some reason or another, missed this one over and over. I recently sat down, and decided that it was time to give this a read. To be honest, I knew very little about this actual book prior to reading it, other than it involved a picture that aged rather than he in the painting.I expected to have difficulty reading this book, since it had been such a long time since I had read anything from the Victorian era, however the language was surprisingly simple, and Wilde's wit is as sharp as ever. Almost sharp enough to harm the reader should they not be forewarned or guided through the readings. Should someone of a weaker mind read this book, it would be easy to fall into the trap of Dorian, who himself was poisoned by a book and the words of his friend.Summary without giving too much away: Dorian Gray is an Adonis-like beauty, young and full of life and innocence at the beginning of our story. His beauty has attracted the obsession of a painter who paints picture after picture of him. Basil (the painter) tries to keep young Dorian pure and in love with life. Henry, a friend of Basil's comes to the studio as Basil paints his master work - a portrait of Doran. Henry fascinates young Dorian in his vile manner of speaking and sarcastic wit. His talk instills in Dorian both a fear of losing his beauty and a lust for all that is selfish and vile in life. Dorian's notable debauchery follows in exquisite detail with Henry always along for the ride to prod young Dorian down the wrong road. Several suicides and a murder or two later, complete madness begins to make its appearance.Wilde was brilliant in his writing of this book, he captures the time perfectly... the lust of it, the sexuality of it, the debauchery of it... all in the name of truth. In their words they say things that their hearts dare not to believe and their smiles are masks hiding the truth. And what if someone believed in these lies? What if they lived their life according to what they had been told? Then they would be Dorian Gray... and we will see what happens to him. This is a brilliant read, and for those of you who will have to write papers on it... the story is not long, but it is thick with meaning. There are very few stories that I would give 5 stars to, this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Published in 1890, this novel by Oscar Wilde is a startling, fantastic portrayal of fin de siecle indulgence and hedonism.The novel is dark in its tone as it describes Dorian's fall from purity, and it involves itself heavily with suicide, death and supernatural occurences. The novel is also somewhat satirical, as Wilde makes reference to the absurd state of social affairs in Victorian London. Ironic and suspenseful, the novel keeps the reader interested in each plot development, and keeps the reader engaged and moved by the beautiful, carefully crafted prose.The story begins with Lord Harry Wotton, utterly captivated by a painting by a friend, the artist Basil Hallward. The painting is of the handsome and unspotted young Dorian Gray. Dorian is stunned at the worldly knowledge of the older gentleman, and soon finds himself under Lord Wotton's care and attention. Harry, the eternal pessimist, schools Dorian in his existential, hedonistic view. Dorian wishes in his vanity that the beautiful painting might age instead of he. When Dorian falls in love with and coldly rebukes a young actress, he returns home to find that the painting bears a faint expression of cruelty and callous; a certain sneer about the mouth. His wish had come true; \\"the canvas [bore] the burden of his passions and his sins.\\"As the story goes on, Dorian falls further and further into his own mind, indulging his every whim, strangling the lives of most everyone he touches by the ropes of scandal that Dorian is entangled in.Resonating throughout the story are the themes of power and love, overriden by vanity and swept beneath by slight homosexual undertones (easily overlooked by anyone who wants to overlook it).I thoroughly enjoyed this novel; the characters were well-developed, and I could identify with Dorian's desire to find a balance between his selfish motivation to indulge himself and his moral need to free himself from his sins. It is the endless plight of human existence: The moral drive to overcome the sins of our nature. The way the novel was written gives the reader a deep appreciation for Oscar Wilde, and the way in which he writes. The novel was a little difficult here and there, not because it was verbose or stylistically challenging, but merely because it was very in-depth. The book itself is a beautiful work; but moreso than the book itself are the ideas behind it. This is a book that makes one think about consequences of actions, the importance of emotions, of repentance and redemption.I would highly recommend this book.\\"Something has changed you completely. You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.\\" - Basil Hallward to Dorian Gray, Chapter 9."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have always heard of Dorian Gray, but never got around to reading it until now. Very well written and a wonderful Gothic classic. This freebie is worth downloading. The devil seems to be none other than his so-called friend who points out some truths to the shallow Dorian. That begins his unravelling. I won't be commissioning any portraits of myself - ever! (Reviewed from my Kindle 2)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The tricky plot, the accurate psychological analysis, the theme of the double, of pleasure and sin make this novel still an up-to-date one and I was really fascinated by the scheming protagonist who, in a way or in another, can be told to represent the human being in all his aspects. Compelled by my teacher to read it, I didn't think this book could give me so many hints. Thanks to Oscar Wilde I had my first approach to the Aesthetic ideolgy, absolutely one of the most involving and interesting: let's do &quot;Art just for Art's Sake&quot;! Dorian Gray embodies the new intellectual who thinks life should be lived as a work of art, so that it is possible to stop the destructive power of time. He also stated the only reality is that of impressions and sensations, and everything in life should be done in order to experience every kind of sensations, no matter how to do and what society could think. Well, I'm just a teenager and maybe for this reason I share some of Wilde-Dorian's instances: like me, the protagonist tries to reconcile wills of rebellion, linked to his soul's corruption, with desires of worldiness. In conclusion I think this is one of the best book I've ever read - and I have read al lot. I would suggest it to everybody who's willing to descover the most intimate and deepest aspects of his own soul!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a beautiful book in layout and design. Oscar Wilde was many things, but for me he is an Artist first and foremost, and with this book The Belknap Press pays homage to a brilliant writer. The novel's reception is an intriguing story. I have recently purchased OSCAR WILDE: THE CRITICAL HERITAGE, and it beautifully relates the history of the book's reception. One unsigned review, In PUNCH, begins, \\"The Baron has read Oscar Wilde's Wildest and Oscarest work, called DORIAN GRAY, a weird sensational romance...\\" Another review, in DAILY CHRONICLE, begins, \\"Dullness and dirt are the chief features of Lippincott's this month. The element in it that is unclean, though undiniably amusing, is furnished by Mr Oscar Wilde's story of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY.

This is a beautiful and definitive edition."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" provides a cautionary tale about the dogmatic pursuit of youth and beauty at the cost of one's own soul. Wilde provides an insight into the hedonistic lifestyle that he lived and championed. Indeed, one of the basic tenets of Wilde's philosophy - aestheticism - is presented in contradictory terms. While aestheticism attempts to redefine art as a means of beauty with no moral purpose, the novel's artwork - the portrait of Dorian Gray - shows the moral consequences of Dorian's hedonistic and narcissistic lifestyle.In a way, Dorian is the work of art, for he never changes his appearance. It is his portrait that is burdened with the sins and iniquities of Dorian's wickedness, for his portrait becomes haggard and disheveled as Dorian's soul sinks further into a dark abyss of nefarious behavior. On the outside, Dorian shows the luminous beauty of youth and a pure mind, yet the true soul of Dorian is diseased and dying. Any attempts at changing his inner essence only reveal him to be a hypocrite and egotist.Another cautionary tale is that in one of idolizing others and falling for their influence. Dorian begins his descent into immorality when he becomes enamored with Henry Wooten's philosophies that \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it\\" and \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.\\" The cynical and satirical Henry Wooten espouses his hedonistic lifestyle, yet does not become entrapped in it like Dorian. Then, it is Dorian's influence who corrupts and ruins the lives of nearly all those with whom he is intimate.It is easy to see why this novel was criticized and decried as immoral in Victorian England. From the first chapter, there is a definite homosexual undertone. Henry and Basil admire Dorian's beauty and Basil declares that he cannot live without seeing Dorian everyday. Indeed, Basil's fondness of Dorian could just as easily describe romantic feelings toward a woman. Although there are heterosexual relationships, they are shallow and fleeting. Dorian's own deplorable actions are never revealed, save for opium, yet his corruption of young men implies that he engaged in acts of \\"gross indecency\\", the very same acts for which Oscar Wilde would be tried and convicted years later. Perhaps Wilde is attempting to justify his own lifestyle and criticize moral judgments, for \\"it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"Although this is essentially a dark, Gothic novel, it does contain scenes of wit and humor. Henry's dialogue and witticisms convey the same tone as many of Wilde's highly acclaimed plays. Through satire, Wilde reveals the superficial nature of the aristocracy. Despite rumors of Dorian's sins, he is still highly desirable in London society, as his beauty and youth trump all.This is a superb novel by Wilde. I only wish that he would have honored us with a few more novels."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was quite the read.Dorian Gray is a young man who has exquisite, wonderful features. He is good-looking. He is a model for Basil, a painter. Basil paints a portrait of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry, one of Basil's friends, meets Dorian and remarks how sad it is that Dorian will not always retain his youth and beauty. Dorian grows sad about this - and thinks, if only this picture would grow old and I can always stay young! He envies his own picture, because he thinks that the picture will forever retain its youth - while he will bear the wrinkles of life.Then things start becoming strange. After an unpleasant experience with his fianc&eacute;e, an actress, he looks at his picture and notices a cruel twist of the mouth. This is only the beginning. As Dorian makes his descent into debauchery and sinfulness, the picture bears the weight of his actions. Everytime he commits a transgression, the picture grows uglier and uglier. The picture becomes his sort of \\"conscience.\\"This book is one worth reading. I had heard of Dorian Gray and was curious. Wilde's writing was descriptive, yet easy to read. It is one of the easier classics, in my opinion.The only flaw to this novel was, at one point, there is a stage where Dorian collects a lot of things - like embroidery, etc. It describes the things he collects and makes lots of references and allusions to seemingly random people (perhaps famous people in history?). This seemed to me like a non sequitur, and just lots of rambling. Furthermore, it was confusing because I didn't know who the people being mentioned were. It was tedious, although I endured it. I'm glad I did, because the story progressed wonderfully.The ending is... quite morbid, but didn't come across as a complete surprise.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth your while. It will make you think - is eternal youth worth it? It will trigger lots of probing questions in your brain.

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had heard speak of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I must admit I did not expect the depth and clarity of thought, the utter honesty to be found in this short novel.

If I could, I would make this a part of highschool litterature versus many other pieces we were given to read. It is indeed a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book. Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil. It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder. The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk. It was a quick and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it.&lt;u>Plot&lt;/u>The plot is intriguing and has been used in other stories, though I think this one has more depth than I've seen before. Essentially, Dorian makes a wish that he will be forever as pristine as the painting made of him and that instead the painting will take on it the toils of his life. Whatever supernatural forces allow this to happen are irrelevant...the wish is granted.It's more than a simple \\"young forever\\" contract. Although age plays into the plot in a couple of places, the primary things that distorts the picture are the vices that Dorian engages in. The first transformation of the painting happens after an intense argument with the first woman he loved. It was interesting to me how quickly Dorian recognized the cause of the change for what it was, but had he belabored the motive for too long, the pacing of the book would have stalled and become unacceptable.Dorian uses his \\"power\\" to be ruthlessly reckless in his living. Dorian Gray becomes entirely uninhibited, taking everything to its limit, seeking absolute pleasure. He even sneaks out at night (so as not to tarnish his pristine reputation) to the \\"bad side of town\\" and lives a sort of double life in opium dens with gangs and prostitutes.In many ways (perhaps because I so recently read it), I felt many similarities to the morale commentary presented in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I felt that Wilde did a better job of delving into the psyche of the hypocritical character, largely because we were able to get into Dorian's head and think and feel with him, while in Jekyll/Hyde, we were kept at a distance by a third person narrative.&lt;u>Characters&lt;/u>There are three pivotal characters in this book.The first, obviously, is Dorian himself. For the first many chapters (perhaps nearly the first half of the book in fact), I wasn't terribly pleased with Dorian as a character...he felt very flat to me. He was basically a mirror to one of the other primary characters (Harry) and didn't ever show his own opinion. He was hailed as pure and beautiful. Perhaps it's all the art references in the book, but I often felt as if Dorian existed more as a classical statue than as a living, breathing character. As his interaction with the 'picture' progresses and once he takes some rather unexpected steps, he became a deeper character and a lot of fun to be with.The second primary character is Lord Harry (or was it Henry...blast those Brits for swapping those names interchangeably so often *grin*). Harry exists as the provocative, cynical, always-with-a-comment-about-anything mentor to Dorian. Harry is absolutely encouragable and a lot of fun to listen to. His speeches often have to do with the pursuit of pleasure at any and all costs and the hazard of a virtuous and peaceful life. His influence over Dorian is profound. As I mentioned above, it often felt as if Dorian existed merely as a mirror for Harry's advice. Harry didn't seem to follow all of his own advice, but Dorian took it readily to heart and strove to live a 'come-what-may' existence. Harry had some of the funniest and most profound comments of the entire narrative. He's a fabulous character.The third character I want to point out actually existed as more of a background character, but I feel the need to call him out merely because of his pivotal involvement in the plot. I actually can't even remember his name now...but it will suffice to call him, \\"the artist.\\" He's the one who paints Dorian's picture. He's the one who introduces Dorian to Harry. He's the one who tries to give Dorian good advice to counter all the reckless advice that Harry poisons him with. The artist was kind of like Dorian's \\"Jiminey Cricket\\"...his conscious that was often (always?) ignored until it was far too late. He showed up in surprisingly few scenes considering the huge importance he had to the plot.&lt;u>Style, Pacing, etc&lt;/u>The language used in this book was truly beautiful. Wilde wrote flowing, vivid descriptions of characters, places and actions. At times it was very poetic. It may be a bit too flowery for readers who don't enjoy that sort of description...it came very close to being 'over the top' to me in a few places. Still, I generally enjoyed the formality of it and the life it gave to the text. The first dozen or two pages were tedious to me...whether because of the language or just the style and thematic pacing, I'm not sure.The pacing was a bit slower than I would have liked. The main difficulty I saw was that Wilde was trying to present so many themes that he often had to result to lengthy passages praising or condemning one thing or another. There were often very long monologues by one of the three primary characters mentioned above. Harry's were generally offset by bits that made me laugh by their extremity while speeches from Dorian and the artist sometimes made me want to slap them and tell them to shut up.&lt;u>Overall&lt;/u>I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered \\"climax\\"...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood.Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering.****4.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a rather difficult book to get through. Lots of old English and lots of footnotes describing what the words or phrases meant. I struggled through about 3/4 of the book, but then it picked up and I managed to get it read. In the end, it was worth the time and effort but does take some patience to get through. Not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It makes one think what would happen if one were to remain young/immortal. Part of our lives revolve around aging, preparing for that, and what have you, while Dorian doesn't have to. It's really interesting to see how his inside goes on decline while his outer self remains young. It's overall a good read, and I'd recommend this to anyone who is in need of a good, classic read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was difficult to read at first. I accept that the great ones always take a while to hook you as they build the characters. It has been a while since I read this book and yet much of it is fresh in my mind. Not a beach read. It's too deep. A story like no other I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While this is Oscar Wilde's only foray into novel-writing, I must say it is justifiably called a classic. The use of descriptive language and mood is exquisite.The only downsides that I can mention would be how slowly it moves in some spots. Once in a while, the story takes sort of a vacation, and you are given a lot of details that don't really apply to the overall plot. Some of the things that are discussed are good at shedding light on some of the things that Mr. Gray was doing throughout the years that this book took place, but they can get a little boring. Truth be told, I skipped most of one chapter because it went on, and on, and on about the things that piqued Dorian Gray's interest. It doesn't stop there, but it explains why it did, what he did about it, and some other people that he associated with while he was pursuing a certain subject, like gemology. In this edition, many of the names that are given through these pages are given an endnote in the back, but to the average person these don't hold much interest. Even to some hardcore fans of classic literature and Gothic Horror could find certain chapters (one at least) very tedious.That being said, there is certainly more good in this book than needed to balance out the less interesting parts. In the beginning, we get to see where the corruption of young Mr. Gray comes from. As the book progresses, you can see the corruption finally consume him, culminating in a surprising finale. I read at work, and my jaw dropped more than once, which I only realized after a co-worker brought attention to it. Even though most people have heard of the themes in the book, this is a fine example of taking an existing theme, and making it into a brilliant new idea.The ideas contained in this book can be a little disturbing to some with a weak stomach. Some of the language can be a little stiff and hard to read, but remember it was written in the 1890's.This book is highly recommended for anybody who has an interest in the Classics or Gothic Horror. Not for the faint of heart, but if it's ever crossed your mind to read The Picture of Dorian Gray, pick this book up! If you want to start reading Gothic Horror, I would suggest something a little lighter to start with -- Edgar Allan Poe, The Phantom of the Opera, or something like that. Those are a little easier, and give you a good idea of what the genre is all about.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\`So, Henry, how is that young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of yours progressing, hem?Lord Henry paused to saviour his glass. Pleased, he set it down, just so, beside his dinner plate, and turned to Lord Fermor.\`Pundits say troubles come in threes, Uncle,' replied Lord Henry. \`What the pundits omit in their gabardine rush to spread their misery to others in a foolish attempt to alleviate their own, is that the best in life never travels solo. Take, for example, the wine and dinner before us. Both French. Together they constitute a meal to entice the gods down from the Mount. When did you ever come across a bad French meal, or a good French man? Yet when wine and food march together, they repay the Creator.'\`No doubt,' replied Lord Fermor, \`but you evade the issue. I asked about the young chap you have taken into your entourage, you know.' Lord Fermor struggled to recall the name, \`that chap who poses for Mr Hallward here.'Basil Hallward felt the heat of recognition first on his brow, then running through his whole body. A retiring man, more at home with his easels and sitters than at high table, he shrank from the public glare.Recognising the signs, though failing to sympathise with them, Lady Agatha piped up.\`Mr Hallword has many sitters, do you not, Sir.'\`Er, yes, indeed I do,' replied Mr Hallward, grateful for the prompt. \`For example, just today I encountered a young man of exquisite appearance, youth in all its pomp. He has promised to sit for me. Lord Henry, I fancy, will try to take him away and teach him of the world, thereby spoiling him as a object d'art.' He laughed to denote humour, simultaneously glancing at his friend to convey the serious meaning behind his joke. Keep away Lord Henry, the glanced announced, shielded behind the laughter. Keep away from this young man lest you send him on the eternal search for fulfilment and in so doing corrupt his soul.Lord Henry roared.\\"Why Basil, you surpass yourself! Hiding a serious message behind a joke so that you may deliver it in public. Would that the Good Book decked itself in such garlands, the better to frighten the masses. You are a greater artist than your canvasses know.'\`I fear my husband is avoiding your question, Lord Fermor,' laughed Lady Victoria. \`When it comes to hiding a serious message behind the veil of farce, he may rival Dante himself.'\`What is the name of your young beauty?' Inquired Lord Henry amidst the general humour. \`I only ask,' he pressed, \`so that I may avoid him. Let us hope I have more success than Eve, who expressed no desire to harvest the only tree in the garden that contained a serpent, until admonished not to. Of course,' Lord Henry continued, \`our Creator did not warn off the firstborn with laughter on his lips. Had he done so, perhaps we would be consuming ambrosia still. Mind you,' he reflected, \`this French cuisine is an adequate substitute.'\`Yes yes yes Henry,' broke in Lord Fermor, \`but what about your young Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? Has he a fine future, seeking the dark mysteries of life of which you profess to be so fond?'\`Should he avoid hubris, I see for him a long, comfortable and satisfactory life.'\`And should he fail to avoid hubris?' teased Lady Agatha.\`Then I see for him immortality in print and prose. Hubris is man's affirmation of his living soul, his insistence that all must be as he ordains, and his rage that it is not. Should Basil paint hubris he would reveal Caliban.\`Modesty, on the other hand, is pleasing to the casual senses but fleeting, like snow on the chimneystack. Modesty and prose combine to produce the barely adequate. Hubris and prose combine to produce immortality, but not personal happiness.'\`And this choice, modesty of hubris, is one you see before Dorian Gray?' queried Mr Hallword.\`Dorian who?' Lord Henry responded. He reached again for the reassuring certainty in his wine glass. \`I was referring to my Prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Oscar Wilde.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde is definitely a disturbing book. I think there is great worth in reading it, particularly when paired with a book such as Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe or Les Miserables by Victor Hugo. Contrasting Dorian's sordid downfall with with the heroic ascension of Uncle Tom or Jean Valjean is particularly beneficial.The Picture of Dorian Gray begins with Dorian, a young and handsome gentleman who is involved with philanthropy, sitting for a portrait while his new friend, Lord Henry, a sarcastic and hedonistic man of society, watches on. Dorian is described as being \\"unspotted from the world\\" and his beauty inspires the artist to his very best work. Lord Henry exclaims how lovely the portrait has turned out, but laments that it is too bad that the picture will stay young forever, whereas Dorian will eventually age and lose his youth and beauty. A vexed Dorian makes a wish that he will stay timeless and the picture will age instead of him.Taking Lord Henry as a mentor, Dorian sets out to apply Lord Henry's selfish and narcissistic worldview into nearly every facet of his life. In time, Dorian realizes that his wish has magically come true. He remains beautiful, while his painting takes on all the consequences of his wicked actions. As the debased Dorian sins more and more, the picture becomes more hideous and tortures Dorian's soul.Despite being filled with Wilde's signature wit, this is a haunting story showing the consequence of selfish character and the downfall of the soul due to despicable and hideous behaviors. Dorian loses his inner beauty long before he realizes that his soul's ugliness will destroy him.It's interesting to note that he chooses a French novel as his own Core Book, a personal classic which guided him throughout his life. In comparison, Uncle Tom and Jean Valjean both chose the Bible as their Core book. Near the end of the book, Dorian laments, \\"You poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.\\"Wilde clearly shows that books exert an amazing influence over our lives. We must be wise in our choice of what we read. As Thoreau once said, \\"Read the best books first, or you may not have the chance to read them at all.\\" I would only add to that, \\"Read the best books most often, for they will color your soul.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic and moving novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde discusses man's desire for youth, as well as his involvement in vanity. A tale of two differing personalities, the story is enticing, yet grippingOscar Wilde does an excellent job of revealing the contrasting atmospheres throughout the book. He does a fine job depicting the lighter side of Dorian Gray with images of life and excitement for example when he is getting painted, the light is bright and it takes place near a garden filled with beautiful flowers. Wilde is also able to portray the dark and menacing side in Dorian Gray as he eventually commits murder. Dorian Gray comes off as such a complicated character which makes him so interesting. He wants to fulfill his desires but is unable to do so successfully. People can feel how each person has a part of Dorian Gray in him or her. We all have our flaws we want to fix, but we should not become obsessive over them or it leads to destruction as seen in the book.The story is fascinating in that it is able to capture reader's interest because the mysteries in the plot are so intriguing. Although the book has that characteristic gothic element of a man living without the fear of death or consequence, The picture of Dorian Gray is still an accomplishment because it is written beautifully through the character description.The Picture of Dorian Gray is worth the read, as readers are guaranteed to be captivated by the mysteries the character Dorian Gray holds."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Story:Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.How the story is arranged:Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending, -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've developed a general rule to avoid free Kindle editions of virtually anything, and it paid off handsomely when I picked this edition. There were two Penguin Kindle editions. This one for $.99 and another for free. As with other free Kindle editions labelled \\"Penguin\\", the edition was not Penguin, it was a \\"Pocket Book\\" edition. This one, for a buck, is true blue Penguin.To further validate my point, this edition has many addins which are often missing from a cheap Kindle edition. First, it has a history of the book's writing and publication, an outline of Wilde's life, an excellent bibliography covering both 19th and 20th century works, two appendices on 19th century reviews of the book and on the provinance of this edition. It also has notes on the chapters which explain things understood by a late 19th century Londoner, but which have been lost to us. An example is the term \\"Japanese effect\\" referring to a style adopted by some late 19th century painters, mimicing some aspects of Japanese art. A leading example was the great portrait artist, James MacNeill Whistler.In a word, it is a complete, genuine Penguin edition, cheap."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was reading the graphic novel: Jaka's Story (Cerebus, volume 5) by Dave Sim and Gerhard (which I strongly recommend anyone to read, together with the sequence: Cerebus, volume 6, Melmoth) when I met the fictional character &quot;Oscar&quot;.In that story, &quot;Oscar&quot; discussed with Jaka's husband, Rick, about a poisonous book (&quot;The Picture of Alfred Douglas&quot;), written by a certain Lord Henry Wotton! Any resemblance with the reality? :) &quot;Oscar&quot; told that he asked to Lord Henry how did he explain his success after saying that &quot;to be popular one must be mediocre&quot;? Lord Henry answered him that &quot;in this matter as in many others, he was the exception that proved the rule&quot;.Reading these passages, I was charmed with the Oscar Wilde character and decided to read the true &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; written by the true Oscar Wilde.I think the passages in Cerebus clarified to me what this book was about (modern graphic novels have the power to illuminate one's thoughts). One should not read this book looking for coherence. All the characters are incoherent, and this is one of the genial points in this book. People are not coherent, so fictional character must not be coherent either!In the preface the author, himself, says that art is quite useless, though it is the thing he loves most to do! The artist Basil says initially that a picture, done with heart, belongs to the artist. Later, he gives the picture to Dorian Gray. Henry Wotton throws along all the story a series of poisonous thoughts that he doesn't follow!Other genial point is that Dorian, although being evil (and could be considered a villain in his own story) is not punished for what he does!Sybil Vane commits suicide because of him, but nobody was able to connect her death with him. Later, he kills Basil, but he just disappears with the body, with no consequences. Near the end, when we think that he is going to be killed by Sybil Vane's brother, he escapes easily from him. Only when, by caprice, he makes the foolishness of trying to destroy his portrait, is that he finds death. That is, he dies merely by accident, not because of his vicious or crimes.If, instead, he just tried to cut the picture he would learn that it would have the effect of hurting himself physically. Then he would guard the picture, and proceed living his life of eternal youth and beauty (that is, until some day some insects, or rats, or something, decided to eat his canvas... :) )These are for me the mistakes of many writers, and what turns the end of many stories so boring and so unsatisfactory! The first one is that they want to produce a plot and tie all the characters of the story (as though it was necessary, and as though all characters deseverd to be well developed!!). The second is to try to create characters that evolve learning with their mistakes (as if everybody learned with their mistakes and stopped continuing doing them for all their lives!!!).Borrowing the words of Lisa Simpson (in one of those funny, crazy, genial, Simpsons' stories), the moral of Dorian Grays story is that it has no moral!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"All art is quite useless. Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century. Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake: he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty. The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality. At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it. Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young. Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach. It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain. Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art. Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity: \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy: the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is quite a book. Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability. His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks. All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies. We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel. You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting. What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture. But his detachment is what is so crucial. He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element. But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice. I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism. He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book is very interesting, although it starts out slow.

It may be fiction, but truth lies within the pages of this book. Oscar Wilde has painted a truly perfect representation of the human species with his character Dorian Gray. A character so full of life that you can't help but be drawn into the book. I was unable to put it down after reading the first page!When you open this book, you are not just reading a story, you are looking into a mirror. You see yourself in Dorian Gray's position as he goes through his trials and tribulations. Regardless of who you are, everyone feels and, at some point, thinks along the line's of Dorian Gray. For some, they may have even traveled down a similar path. It is for this reason that Oscar Wilde was able to create such a realistic character. He created something that people can relate to because each of us has a Dorian Gray within us, at least, to some degree.I don't know if Wilde meant to be so philosophical or psychological with this story, but it is a work of genius. I believe that this book should be part of the required reading material in some age appropriate schools. I doubt that it will, but I feel the character of Dorian Gray and his 'life' would be an eye opener for many.I highly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely curious about it. I honestly cannot understand why this has a single bad rating! If your still not sure after reading the reviews, check with your local library about borrowing it.

Utterly infatuated, Basil Hallward captures Dorian's youthful beauty in a portrait.While posing for this portrait, Dorian meets Basil's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, who charmingly preaches hedonism. Lord Henry's efforts to corrupt Dorian work quickly. Convinced that youth and beauty are the only things worth having in life, Dorian looks upon his finished portrait with cruel jealousy. His image will never grow old, but he will.One wish sends the plot of the novel into action: Dorian wishes the portrait would age, while he stays youthful.Enter a lover whose heart Dorian breaks. Her despair coerces her to suicide. With her death on his conscience, he notices an evil glint in the eye of his portrait. Over the years, Basil's painting begins to age. Dorian sabotages reputations and even commits murder, all the while looking as young and beautiful as he did on the day his portrait was painted. However, the portrait-a grotesque reminder of his double life-documents every immoral act.Focusing on duplicity and aestheticism, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a captivating and cinematic tale. Oscar Wilde's knack for dialogue is what made him a famous playwright and parts of Dorian Gray are rich with clever play-like exchanges.Lord Henry's wit is exceptionally tantalizing. But he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, whereas Dorian adopts everything Lord Henry preaches with the conviction of a Southern Baptist. He's basically just a dumb pretty person that everyone coddles despite the fact that he's a terrible human being.**Side note**The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's only novel. The book was scandalous when it was released in 1891 because of clear homoerotic undertones. Dorian's lovers are both men and women. Though not overtly sexual, Basil's infatuation with Dorian is questionable. Wilde himself had an affair with Robert Ross."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read quite a lot and I have not been so entranced by a book in a very long time. I finished it in one day, because I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book, and all other Oscar Wilde works for that matter."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a Faustian novel, and one of the first ground-breaking pieces of gothic literature along with novels such as \\"The Castle of Otranto\\" by Horace Walpole and \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho\\" by Anne Radcliffe. Based on this merit alone it is worth reading. If you're a connoisseur of literature it's mandatory, and if you're not, it's highly recommendable.It tells of the life of Dorian Gray, who, upon meeting Basil Hallward (his painter's) friend Sir Henry Wotton, begins to fret over the ephemerality of his youth, and makes an involuntary wish for...Well I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll leave that out. Chances are, going in, you know the premise of the novel, but I still don't want to risk a spoiler. Either way, slowly, he starts to lose himself, and the gentleness of his nature, and he is driven to \\"sin\\".It's a good read in many ways. For one it is an easy read, it can be enjoyed whether you are sitting at home or travelling. In another it is thought provoking, you could pull about two hundred quotes out of it and apply them to your daily life (and I'm not exaggerating). And lastly, the story line is gripping.If you're approaching this after experiencing Wilde's plays then I should warn you, there is no comedy here, in fact there is barely even a resemblance to the tone of his plays (although some of the dialogue is fairly similar).Either way, this is a damn good read and I certainly recommend it.If you're interested in gothic literature, this is highly, highly recommended, as are the above titles."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story is pretty standard. Art comes to life or rather the other way around in this case. Oscar Wilde knew how to write to entertain and this novel is no exception. The characters except Dorian all come off as rather shallow, but I suppose that is the point of the story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"definitely an interesting book. a classic. would read if you are into classics. quite violent and shocking. i should have seen it coming, but it was still good"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This haunting tale is fraught with discussion points ranging from the \\"curse\\" of beauty to the state of our souls to the consequences of our decisions and actions.

Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is one of the most elegant novels in the Gothic canon; that it is also one of the most sinister is hardly surprising given Oscar Wilde's curious aptitude for tempering the macabre with the sensuous and the frivolous with the fatalistic.A considerable scandal upon its publication in the early 1890s, the novel still reads as slightly homoerotic, even if only in the most clandestine and aphotic of ways. Woven through its themes of beauty, decadence, age, and the nature of art is a thread of shimmering doom that becomes more poignant the longer one spends with DORIAN GRAY and the more one considers its relationship with its author.It is a peacock's fan of luminous wit and glimmering color, dripping with venom and smelling of strange perfumes. We are all familiar with the general flavor of things: an innocent and exceptionally beautiful youth has his portrait painted one fateful afternoon; upon viewing the piece, he is paralyzed by the sudden revelation that one day he will be old and hideous while the painting will retain its beauty and life. In a devil's bargain, he wishes that it would be the other way around. And then, under the influence of a particularly deleterious gentleman, Dorian Gray begins to change: his innocence gives way to corruption and his beauty seems apt to languish under the spell of opium, cruelty, and languor. One day Dorian notices that the painting has begun to transform, while he himself retains all the beauty of an innocent despite the ever-swelling ocean of his sins...Few works of literature are as effervescent as DORIAN GRAY and just as few are as utterly pessimistic; that it is capable of fusing remarkably disparate parts into a whole that is absolutely cohesive is a fascinating example of its author's gifts. Like Wilde's SALOME, DORIAN GRAY is as colorful as it is bleak, and even its weaknesses, in context, seem like strengths.Seldom is an artist's most famous work also his most erudite and brilliant: this is one of those works. I have approached it perhaps six or seven times in the last five years, and each reading has left me more enraptured than the last--which is high praise for a novel that relies a great deal on suspense and aesthetic splendour. I consider it one of the finest things I have ever read--daring, sultry, venomous, eloquent, and radiant in its own decay.(From my Gothic fiction blog:[...]"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My impetus for reading this book, since I read few novels, was a book entitled \\"The Ripper Code\\" by Thomas Toughill. That book's author posed the theory that in writing \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Oscar Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at one of his erstwhile friends, and possible homosexual lovers, as London's \\"Jack the Ripper.\\" This intrigued me, particularly since Wilde's book was published only a year or so after the last of the Ripper murders, and, as Toughill noted, Wilde and his suspect lived only about six miles from the Whitechapel district, where the murders took place, and Wilde clearly chose the date of the last Ripper murder, November 9, 1889, as the date which brought his story to its climax. So, in reading this book, I couldn't help but bear that in mind.After reading this book, it is clear that Wilde based some, if not all, of the main characters in his novel on persons whom he knew and, in all likelihood, on actual conversations he had had with those and other prominent people in London society. And there are certainly clear similarities between at least two of the most prominent characters in his novel and Wilde's friends: namely Dorian Gray, himself, and Wilde's presumed suspect, George Francis \\"Frank\\" Miles, an artist who contracted syphilis and died in 1891 shortly after the final Ripper murder; and Dorian's first love and suicide victim, the young actress Sybyl Vane, and the actress, Lilly Langtree, who Miles and Wilde both knew in her early days and whose career they clearly advanced. Other than that, however, there is little to suggest that Wilde was attempting to point the finger of guilt at Miles or at anyone else.As for the novel itself, I found it to be extremely interesting and hard to put down. I was particularly impressed by the author's apparent insight into human nature, as reflected in some of the ideas expounded on many occasions by Dorian Gray's friend and mentor, Lord Henry Wotton. Some of those passages were rather long, and perhaps a little tedious, but still interesting if one persisted. I consider this to be a classic which most readers would enjoy, but, in my view, Wilde simply drew on his experiences and chose certain events and characters to help sell his book. Frank Miles can rest in peace --- at least for now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was an amazing book that had an incredable thought process. It was very good and I advise as many people as possible to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A great classic. It's better the second or third time.Dorian Gray, a fabulously good-looking young man with a poetic glow about him, starts out innocent and pure. His more worldly acquaintances spoil him with many observations on how wonderful it must be to be young and fabulously handsome.Reflecting on his own beauty in an amazingly like portrait of himself, his obsession becomes never growing old. The earnest prayer he utters before the portrait grants his wish. Now only the portrait will show the effects of age. And the stains on his character.For the rest of the book we see his life become his beauty. All the other important things in life fall away. Everyone wishes they could have his life of fortune and youth, but they have no idea how his soul is suffering. Neither does he.There are some passages that might appear wordy. There are many moving and inspiring passages, if one takes the time to reflect on them.This is a great book. Your teenager will probably be assigned to read it in middle-school or high school; you should read it too."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is a classic novel suffused with intriguing philosophies along with discrete ethical lessons. Oscar Wilde encorporates conventional defeating human dispositions such as superficiality, idolatry, and obsession into an astonishing tale of the life of a young man conflicted between morality and a hedonistic culture. The storyline is dynamic and captivating while the words play smooth and melodious. &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; is thought-provoking and certain to interest a variety of readers. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"that would be the ideal way to describe Dorian Gray - an impressionable young Adonis on his Hedonistic quest for a life which itself is a work of art. Society artist Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian Gray which ages and hardens as Gray's quest lead him to a remorseless and brutal lifestyle is the mirror to his soul while his physical form remains as youthful as ever. The book builds up beautifully towards the climax. Wilde's generates idle irreverent amoral and bitingly sarcastic dialogue as if out of thin air."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a masterpiece of English literature from the 1800's. It's easy to see why the book aroused so much controversy when it was released, and why it had an integral role in Wilde's subsequent imprisonment: the moral dilemna the book presents is disturbing even today. Wilde was truly a great writer; it's obvious from reading this book. Not only was his wit top-notch as is often ackwnoledged, but his prose is very smooth and polished, very refined. Wilde's attitudes towards art are well-known - indeed, he says in the book's introduction that \\"all art is quite useless\\" - but it seems obvious now that he was a natural talent. I hesitate to say things like He was meant to be a writer, but it certainly seems true of Wilde. This is one of the books that shakes our moral foundations. Wilde's high-class lifestyle is well-documented - it seems his surname was utterly appropriate - and one can definitely see where the plot and perhaps some of the details of this book came from his own experience. Undoubtedly, the main premise of the novel - a man selling his soul for eternal youth - most likely sprung from a desire that Wilde himself expressed. Perhaps he was having doubts about his hedonistic lifestyle even when this book was written, several years before his imprisonment. One can conjecture all one wants, but the fact remains that this book is a marvelous piece of work. The wonderful, polished prose is a joy to read - with aphorisms abound - and I, for one, see it as a deep regret that this was the only novel Wilde ever wrote. We missed out on a lot of great literature, especially with the general disdain the plays are now looked upon with in our society. Alas, read this masterpiece, and you will miss out less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book in 6th grade and have loved it ever since. It's rich and compelling words are fantastically written and portyayed in the mind frightfully real and visual. Oscar Wilde is one of my all-time favourite writers and I congratulate his excellence of writing and choice of description. After his two year sentence on Abnormal Sexual Vice his career literaly ended but even though he is gone, his writing is still fresh, enjoyable, and always a favourite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"&quot;Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist...&quot; says Oscar Wilde's Basil Hallward - and every book is the author's autobiography. Wilde provides an irresistible coupling of his fascinating wisdom and seductive voice in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY, a self-portrait.In a story of forbidden love, Wilde languishes in an idyllic setting eager with curous onlookers whom he delights in stimulating. He insists upon being provocative and alluring, taking 'strange pleausre in saying things that he is not sorry about having said.' THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is an image drawn by a lover whose passion for realism is transcended only by the hands of a writer who leaves everything to your imagination. As Dorian Gray protests, &quot;Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to.&quot;But this IS a book about thinking - and deeply. A book that fathoms the deep erotic recesses of the human heart and speaks its language perfectly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray was definately an excellent book, although the wording was somewhat outdated. It is an excellent piece of work, but I just had one question about it. Do you really think it was all Dorian's fault that everything happened? I believe Dorian's horrid fate would never have existed if Lord Henry had not been introduced to him. Lord Henry put outrageous ideas into an innocent litte head, and should be noticed as the fault of all of Gray's actions. It just killed me that no one realized what was really happening! But besides that question of fault, it was a grade A book, that I would read again, but not without a dictionary by my side. I recommend it to anyone who likes intelectual reading, and who is willing to sit through outdated talk. Just go for it, it's worth your time, and better yet... it's a short novel!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A tale of beuty, love, innocence and cruelty. Wilde did a wonderful job of telling the story of young Dorian Gray, a timeless beuty that never shows his age and whose face never displays his sins. He betrays close friends, is fuel for many a suicide, is down right cruel and unfeeling to any of his numerous loves, is selfish and self immersed; yet his young, beutiful face never shows a trace of ill being. Being in a room with him, drowns anyone with pleasure, peacefulness and charm- it is impossible to look at his face and believe that someone so sweet and innocent in looks would commit any of the evil he is rumored to have done. Instead of himself being affected, a portait of him as a young man endures the strain of his uncouth behavior.This timeless tale, set in England at the turn of the century, would be an excellent story line for any modern novel and would make a wonderful movie. Wilde's writting style is proliferic, poignant and delightful. It captures the language of the time period, yet was easy to read and easy to relate to. Wilde conveys the evil of the aestetic world and how it can drive one to stop at nothing for fear of losing it. And though he hints at such controversial topics such as drugs and homosexuality; it is neither detailed nor graphic; and is only slightly touched on. Throughout the novel, Wilde creates an image and lets the reader fully develop it for himself. I absolutley adored this book and highly reccomend it to anyone. Not for a moment did I think it dull, or too wordy. It is a very easy read (which is difficult to say of such a classic), and incredibly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book fits Wilde's description of a cigarette as a perfect pleasure - portable and brief, yet leaving you unsatisfied. Like Dorian Gray himself, this book is superficially charming, with its numerous and clever epigrams, but with some very ugly undercurrents, e.g. virulent anti-semitism, misogyny, and homosexuality. We never connect emotionally with Dorian Gray, who never matures into a complex or interesting character, but remains as some gay ideal with psychosis. Read Henry James' &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; or Edith Wharton's &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; for a far better written, devastating attack on Victorian morals and hypocrisy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Indudablemente Oscar Wilde es uno de los m&aacute;s grandes escritores de la Literatura Universal; pero m&aacute;s que eso fue uno de los pocos que se atrevi&oacute; a enfrentar a una sociedad adoctrinada y primitiva, siempre dispuesta a estigmatizar aquellos que no se alineaban con los patrones impuestos por ellos mismos.

Most of the book is what used to pass as witty dialogue between stifled, elite Englishmen and women. Most of this dialogue displays the thinking of a totally amoral Lord Henry who verbally paints everyone he meets as a slivered character reflecting his own amorality. To Lord Henry, one's belief in anything is proof of one's deranged thinking. Both he and Dorian experienced continued hedonism but with no gratification.The reader is forced to accept the premise that an artist painted the portrait of Dorian and in so doing captured the young man's soul on the canvas. While Dorian lived the portrait kept aging while Dorian retained his outer, youthful appearance. Thus no other living character in the story had any evidence of the aging ugliness of the portrait. At Dorian's death the living portrait, the soul of Dorian, returned to its pristine, youthful glow.Throughout the story the reader is joined with the character Dorian in accepting the portrait's brutal transformation. But with the array of deaths that followed Dorian's heartless cruelty the reader kept being confronted with the pointlessness of the tale. The reader would like to have witnessed Lord Henry's response to the apparent suicide of Dorian Gray who he worshipped throughout the tale.

Dorian Grey is one of the most bizarre charecters in literature. I guess we all have a little bit of Dorian Grey in us at times, hopefully in small doses. Lord Henry, the quick witted,brilliant companion is none other than Oscar Wilde. Aremarkable book. If it were written today, there would be lot ofcontroversy as the male charecters bond so freely.

The first few pages are incredibly interesting. They are written extremely well and are filled with facinating ideas. That doesn't last long, though. After the forthy-somthing page the reader begins to understand that Oscar Wilde uses a lot of words to say nothing. And he does say something, you won't notice it because it's strangled to death with a lot of useless information.However, I do think the book does make a good read. You can't really blame Wilde for writing the way he does, since he, himself, says on the second page of this book: &quot;The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one adimers it intensely&quot;, and Wilde does admires his work intensely and for that we &quot;owe' it to him to read &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I enjoyed reading the book, and thought that it was a great allegory.

But, cultural handicaps aside, let's give Wilde his due: The book is a treasure trove of wit--from his brilliant epigrams to its very fascinating plot, which anticipates Magical Realism by at least 50 years. That is to say, when one thinks of &quot;Twilight Zone-esque&quot; writing one is put in mind of Kafka, Borges or Grabriel Garcia-Marquez. The best in World Literature.

It is beautifully done like a silk tapestry or a work of art. His ideas about life and what place art has in life are equally as interesting. It is obvious to the reader from the moment he or she picks up the book that it is mostly about art, as the title itself shows---The Picture of Dorian Gray. It becomes clear to the reader Art was the true basis for this book. Dorian himself is a physically beautiful man who collects art, and he enjoys all the splendor of a fashionable existence. Oscar Wilde was a man who also shared interest in these things so it clear that the base for his most successful book is his ideas about art ( as show in the preface) the relation ship between artist observer and art. The characters in this book are playing the parts of his opinions of art wonderfully and in doing so reveal to the reader their inner most thoughts and feelings.Dorian and his painting that he holds so dear each have a different place in Oscar Wilde's ideals as the art and the artist .One of Oscar Wilde's statements about art is \\"The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the artist is the artist's aim\\". (3). Dorian's outside appearance that he \\"reveals\\" becomes an illusion, a sort of mask, which hides or \\"conceals\\" his inner unhappiness and inability to live. Dorian's outer persona becomes his \\"art\\", the elegant illusion that he offers to the world, while his inner feelings are the \\"artist\\". Dorian's \\"artist\\" is his soul, but in fact while he is revealing this beautiful surface to the world and enchanting everyone he is concealing his true self. He separates himself from the aging and corrupted painting. Putting on this act is to \\"conceal the artist\\" which is the artist's aim. For Dorian Gray, hiding away all signs of aging and keeping up a surface youth, beauty, and innocence is creating himself as a work of art. This point is further illustrated in the text when after basil's visit to him he nearly goes mad about protecting his painting or his soul \\"when his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly, and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen.... yet he thought it best to be on his guard...his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work ...Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing...Now, it was to hide something that had a corruption of it's own, worse than the corruption of death itself-something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\\"(103-4). The most obvious point that this paragraph shows is Dorian's need to \\"conceal\\" his soul or himself. The Venetian coverlet symbolizes Dorian's \\"art\\" or need for splendor and beautiful things to conceal his true identy. Dorian's need to conceal himself is shown with literal symbolization he is taking his art or Venetian coverlet and putting it over his \\"painting\\" to hide his soul. As the paragraph goes on he describes the painting or his \\"soul\\" in a way that shows you his true feelings about his soul he thinks of himself as being corrupt, horrible, and worse than death and naturally wants to separate his art or outter self from his painting or inner self. Oscar Wilde's theory's about art and artist's relationship connects perfectly with Dorian grays feelings about himself.Dorian has no conscience about other people's feelings because he does not expect his own which relates to Oscar Wilde's opinion that an artist has no ethical sympathies. Oscar Wilde says, \\"No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style\\" (p. 3). Dorian seems to be without human emotions. He remembers his parents only through their outward appearance--- the lips or shape of the face that he has inherited. He does not remember their feelings for him or his attachment to them. It may have been that he was raised without emotional ties. The only time that his family is mentioned, Dorian calls his memories of them hateful (p. 103). In Victorian High society, feelings and emotions were considered less worthy than opinions or ideas. This has caused Dorian to grow up and not understand moral conscience he believes that the only thing that is important is new innovation and ideas, because he was taught to be that way. That is demonstrated when he decides to show Basil his soul:\\"You can tell the whole world about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you, if they did believe; they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do\\" (p, 133). He says that his age---the end of the nineteenth century---was more pre-occupied with style than substance, so his youthful glamour---and the fact that the had a secret for escaping ageing---would inspire envy and imitation, not horror. But it is show in the story with basil's reaction to the painting or his \\"soul\\" that people will in fact be horrified by someone who destroys their soul by keeping themselves enterally young and beautiful or renovating their \\"art\\". And by saying \\" I know the age better than you do \\" he is actually proving the opposite and that he doesn't have any ethical sympathies because he so obviously doesn't the nineteenth- century does care about a persons soul. It also relates to the modern day struggle over plastic surgery whether it is a way to keep yourself beautiful or a way to become obsessed with your appearance and destroy your morality you could say that a modern day Dorian Gray is a Michael Jackson someone who is once loved and admired by his public but then after turning to plastic surgery and shopping to better his appearance he becomes a joke and loses his admiration much like Dorian Gray. They both do not relate to the public and have lost their moral conscience do to constantly trying to better their appearance or better their \\"art\\". Dorian Gray doesn't understand other people's ideals because he is not willing to except the fact that he thinks of his internal self as an ugly disgusting thing. Dorian plays into Oscar Wilde's opinions about artists not having ethical sympathies because he does not understand moral conscience of his society. He also shows the reader his inner feelings that he thinks of himself as something awful.Basil and Dorian are like art and observer basil's ideals about Dorian are mirrored on to him. Basil Howard's influence is reflected in this quote from the preface; \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their own peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" (p. 3). The spectator in this story is Basil Howard. Basil Howard sees Dorian through his own eyes as a beautiful young man who is full of life and innocence. Basil's soul of truth, love, kindness and caring for others is put into his painting. Dorian's external appearance is appreciated by a spectator (Basil) so it begins to mirror what the spectator sees, and other people also come to see Dorian as a prince of art. Like when an observer looks at art they interpretative it in their own way. This is shown when basil comes to talk to Dorian about the way he is perceived to society \\"I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want you to get rid of the hateful people you associate with...you have wonderful influence, let it be for good and not evil\\" (p, 132). This shows basils admiration for Dorian and the way that he thinks of Dorian that it mirrored in the way that he will see him. He is in fact saying that he wants to lead a life where the world respects him and that he has wonderful influence because all he knows about Dorian Gray is what he knows about himself. In the page before basil talks about Dorian's face and the way that he looks means that must not be a bad person but that is only a surface opinion, like that you have of art, once you learn something about the artist, you interpret in another way. Basil doesn't know Dorian's \\"artist\\" or soul he doesn't see him he only sees himself, so basils beautiful heart and soul are projected onto Dorian's appearance. Again Oscar Wilde's ideals of the relationship between the artist and the spectator are interpreted on to his characters Dorian is just a mirror of basil, Just as art is just a mirror of the spectator. It also shows that basil wants to respected by the world, and have wonderful influence.A person could spend days and pages and pages explaining why Oscar Wilde's ideas of art reflect on the characters of The Picture of Dorian Gray and what it reveals about the characters true feelings. Here are the most important Dorian Gray and his painting reflect on the his ideas of the artist and the art, Dorian Gray and his ideas of artists not having ethical sympathies, and that Dorian and Basils relationship is the same as the art and the artists relationship. And a person could also go into the fact that according to Oscar Wilde's ideals about art the critic is he who can translate into another manner and I hope that was done in this essay.please anyone don't steal thi sessay as your own, because believe it or not if your teacher is smart and will type in the first sentance of this essay in google and this will come right up and you will be expelled.thank you for reading"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Who knows? But right-wing orthodox Catholic monarchist readers will be required to steel themselves through the first two chapters which consist of a drawn-out slap fight between Elton John, Graham Norton and Ian McKellan. Now I like a cat-fight as much as the next guy, but a tussle among effete Brit cats with man parts is just icky. So the narcissistic homo-erotic banter opening the book was significantly under-appreciated by this reader. But after you get through those chapters the book gets much, much better.It is difficult to maintain that the book represents a defense of amoral Aestheticism, since the embodiment of the aesthetic ideal, Dorian Gray, is shown to be a damned man. That is not to say that Wilde embraces Catholicism in the novel, as the narrator often posits confusing opinions on issues of conscience and sin. At times Wilde seems to suggest that only immoderate (quantitatively speaking) behavior is immoral; and yet, at other times, it appears some actions themselves ought to be avoided. Is Wilde acknowledging that there are exceptionless moral norms? And what is the reader to make of rotten Wotton, whose epigrammatic phrases seem so akin to Wilde's? Hallward points out that Wotton's cynicism is a pose. He never says a moral thing, but he never does a wrong thing. So are we to take his Wilde-isms seriously? Are we to take Wilde seriously? Wilde says art is neither moral nor immoral, yet Gray is poisoned by A Rebors, a book by another decadent author who, oddly enough, also converted to Catholicism. And then there's the picture itself, the fruit of Hallward's homosexual obsession, which is clearly cursed, in spite of its initial apparent beauty.Wilde's protests notwithstanding, it is a book with a moral informing the reader that he cannot escape his conscience, that he cannot reject nature and nature's God, and that the wages of sin are death. But therein lies hope, for if God is to be believed regarding the wages of sin, then why should we doubt Him regarding our Redemption? Unfortunately, this message is made ambiguous by an author who, rather than unintentionally creating a distorted image of an idea that cannot be fully represented, intentionally peppers the novel with paradox for the sake of cuteness. But the Truth is not cute. He's terrifying, and Wilde knows better. Therefore the book is best left to the orthodox or the decadent. The lukewarm will simply be confused."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray was a tedious read. I did not particularly enjoy it that much, although I acknowledge that it is a good piece of literature. It is very well written and full of details and vivid descriptions. The story is told artfully and exquisitely but I found it long-winded and difficult to get through at times. Many people would enjoy a book like this, but it was not for me. I couldn't relate to the British aristocracy system and was utterly appalled at how unbelievably shallow the characters were, although Wilde was probably going for that effect. I was also disappointed with the ending. I thought the point of the novel would be to eliminate the stereotype that bad people are ugly, but it just perpetuated it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that makes them think. It is also recommended to people who like books from this era (late 1800's) and have a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Will someone please tell me why this \\"uplifting classics\\" edition uses an image of Thomas Jefferson on the \\"cover\\"?

But it lacks substance. In my opinion this story is not really a novel because Oscar Wilde just uses it as a medium through which he can profess his views. While his views are not banal in the least, they are forced. He should not have to lower himself and preach to the reader."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"which is a waste of paper. What makes me say that? Could it be that the sins are too vague or too outdated? No, I judged this book based on my enjoyment or lack of enjoyment in reading it. Wit without substance, characters without passion, dialogue without reason. I found myself reading other books just so I had an excuse not to continue reading this one. In the end all I can say to truly show how I feel about this novel is that this book BORED me. 177 pages of art that is 'quite useless'. The only reason I finished was because I hate to start a book then walk away and also I wanted to do review (and to do a review without finishing the book is unfair)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book some time ago for a book club, and we all thought it was a total snooze.

I feel that Oscar Wilde used this as a semi-autobiographical vehicle to transport his radical, eccentric ideas and ideals. He speaks through his characters of Lord Henry and Dorian Gray. They seek to justify debauchery and murder and they kill off anyone who is good, kind, moral or differs in opinion with them. A good read, perhaps, for the likes of the 42nd president of the USA.

The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"- by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would you do if someone or something else took all the falls for your sins?Dorian Gray made a life changing wish, that he might, forever, stay looking young and beautiful, that his portrait should bear all the marks of age and sin that would ever befall him. Under the influence of Lord Henry, whose philosophy rest entirely upon self gratification that looks upon those good in life as those who are too weak and timid to live life, Dorian Gray trades his youthful innocence for a life of self pleasure at what ever cost. As he falls deeper into sin, taking all those around him along, his portrait receives all the marks of sin while he remains looking as young as he was the day his portrait was finished. Even though he has been able to live his life the way he thinks is the best, doing whatever he wants and not paying any price for it, he winds up feeling loathsome as he is haunted at night by the deeds of his sins and Lord Henry's theory of \`relieving the soul through the senses' no longer works for Dorian. His portrait also haunts him as it tells of all sins. He tries to reverse the process of contamination by behaving in a way he thinks is good, but being good for selfish means is almost as bad as a sin, and though we may repent of our sins we still bear some scars from our past sins, so seeing no instant change he tries to destroy the painting, but the painting is a link to his soul.~And the moral of the story is don't live for self"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book for all time.

This story is about a young man who grows to be a sinful and terribly vain man driven by love, beauty and art.The Main character, Dorian Gray, at the beginning of the book is a beautiful and youthful man. Dorian was a man everyone wanted to be around just because he had innocence and he was different. \\"He has a simple and beautiful nature.\\" Says Basil Hallward. This innocence and beauty changes as he becomes friends with Lord Henry and his values of life change him. Because Dorian was so nave, Lord Henry lured Dorian into a whole new life and new philosophies about love, beauty and selfishness. This is not the only deep friendship that is developed in this book. Dorian also becomes friends with Basil Hallward and Basil paints a portrait of Dorian and Basil puts his whole heart into this painting for it to ultimately destroy himself and Dorian. Anyway, Dorian wishes that he could stay young all his life and always be beautiful. As he grows older Dorian does many terrible and shocking things but he still remains beautiful and untouched while his painting of himself shows the real nasty, terrible, and corrupted Dorian.One part of the book that really captivated me is when Dorian murder's one of his good friends. I think this is one of the turning points in the book because I believe Dorian realizes that life shouldn't be based on the appearance of things but more about quality and spirit. Dorian understands that his lifestyle of upscale parties with London's elite, and his friendship with Lord Henry is not all that it seems to be. You can see that after Dorian murders someone he questions himself and the painting because he realizes what the painting has done to him. During the last pages of the book we can see how Dorian self-destructs and finds away to restore the painting of exquisite and youth.This book was very different from anything I read and I loved it. I like how Oscar Wilde wrapped me into this book with many compelling and interesting thoughts. The main lessons I learned from this book is question your role models and to value your life. Another lesson I learned is to not worry about beauty because if we only pick things that are beautiful we miss the wonderful and mysterious things that don't look pretty but deep inside they are."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel is one of the best books I have ever read. The story is fascinating, and one that most people have heard of--that Dorian Gray, a young, beautiful man, makes a fervent wish that he would never grow old, and that the portrait just painted by his artist friend would age instead. This occurs, leading Dorian down a path of debauchery and cruelty, most of which must have been too horrific for Oscar Wilde to go into detail without violating obscenity laws.The book is a masterpiece in examining manipulation. The artist introduces Dorian to a friend, Lord Henry, who calls Dorian's attention to his beauty, and Dorian, formerly innocent and sweet, becomes vain. It is amazing to see just how potent the power of suggestion is, and this novel demonstrates it perfectly.The writing is less than perfect. One chapter goes on and on about artifacts that Dorian has collected around the world, leaving the reader saying, &quot;Okay, and who cares?&quot; Wilde's prose is far from flawless, but the story is so engaging that the reader will be willing to overlook the imperfections and will be intrigued in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This fascinating story of extreme narcissism and moral dilemna provides food for thought on the author's strange and sometimes twisted views on society as played out by the characters.

His intellectual prowess not only perceives him as a mystical thriller but between the lines you can see the seductive yet fanatical characters he enlists. Before Stephen King his writing is considered fascinating and is still to this day one of the premier writers of history.

I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film). I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world. I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting. Now that was terrible. And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda. So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde. Allow me to stress that. I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde. My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty. While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins. He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery. As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting. Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour. The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about. He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil. The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins. Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue. Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul. And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing that in acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better. This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments). This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen). This is NOT Twilight. This story actually has substance.This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness. It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall. Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme. Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray. It is a true classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was born in Dublin in 1854. He was a poet, playwright and author, though is perhaps a little more widely known for his wit. He studied at both Trinity College Dublin and at Oxford's Magdalen College - where he became a part of the Aesthetic Movement. At Trinity, he won the Berkeley Gold Medal while at Magdalene, he won the Newdigate Prize in 1878. He subsequently graduated from Magdalene with a double first - however, he failed to be elected to the Oxford Union, which is something I'd imagine they're very embarrassed about now. After a very colourful - though, at times, difficult - life, he died in 1900 and is buried in Pere Lachaise in Paris. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Wilde's only novel, and was first published in 1891.Basil Hallward is a highly-regarded and well-known artist. As the book opens, he has just completed his latest portrait - one of his latest muse, a young gentleman called Dorian Gray. Hallward's friend, Lord Henry Wotton, thinks it's the finest work completed by Hallward and suggests it should be exhibited in the Grosvenor - Hallward, however, disagrees. He feels he has put too much of himself into the portrait, insisting it would reveal more of the painter than the subject. Basil has become obsessed with Gray : he sees him daily, and describes his presence as \\"absolutely necessary\\". Wotton naturally becomes intrigued, and is keen to meet Gray. Basil, on the other hand, wants to keep them apart - knowing Henry would be the worst possible influence. Unfortunately, Gray calls round unexpectedly and he has to introduce them...Basil's fears were well founded. By the end of their first conversation, Dorian is completely in Henry's thrall and is convinced that his youth and beauty will only gradually fail - leaving him with nothing of value. He offers his soul, if his looks remain as they are, while his portrait ages in his place. Under Henry's guidance, Dorian dedicates to the \\"new Hedonism\\" - and, in time, he notices the portarit not only ages but becomes more hideous with each sin.I found it difficult to see exactly how Basil and Henry came to be friends. Apart from a little pretentiousness and plenty of flouncing - especially in the book's early pages - they appeared to have nothing in common. I did find it a little difficult to take Henry seriously, though - luckily, for the book - Dorian proves to be as impressionable as he is vain. He is dominated by Henry's malign influence and - despite occasionally considering returning to the straight and narrow via Basil - generally remains happy to follow the path Henry set out for him. A book that gets better as it goes along, as it starts to deal with Dorian's internal struggles - and is certainly much better than some other classics I've read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have never read this book before getting it for my Kindle. I love it, the book makes you tink about how you conduct your life and how it shows on you.This book also gives the reader a window into the life of a the rich of England at the time. I find the book to be well writen, a great add (or like me a great beginning) to your classic collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oh what sinister fun! A morality tale wrapped up in a story dripping with homoeroticism and hedonism. I can't imagine how much pleasure Wilde had when he wrote this story and how much went on his head that never actually made it onto the page as a result of the laws of the time. This luscious, lusty Faustian tale is so dark and delicious; discreet when it has to be, suggestive when it wants to be. And the picture I have of Dorian Gray in my mind is that of the most beautiful man on earth--yes, we're all suckers for a bad boy, aren't we!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm really not sure why a lot of people have not read this. It truly is a work that can only be appreciated when read and reread. This is my second time reading through the pages that Wilde weaves with this epigrams and curious cascading delight for words. Each sentence is as interesting and beautiful as the last as he speaks of sin conveyed in the most interesting of manners.Truly, Dorian is a fall from grace. A Lucifer that could have looked upon what he would become if he had the choice. Perhaps the concept of the Devil hanging over Dorian's shoulder is what makes this story so interesting. Sin never weathers Dorian's face, he remains as beautiful as he was when he was in the prime of the human age. Only the tell-tale signs of age and sin and hate and cruelty are etched upon the portrait that Basil so intricately painted. It is an ugly thing that portrays every crime Dorian ever committed. Even, towards the end of the novel, when he wished to become 'good' the old sin cannot be washed away. Even so, Dorian cannot conform to the 'good life' and instead forces himself to an unknowing demise because he cannot cope with the prospect of living a wholesome life. He would have to give up the sweet taste of sin, that which he had known without reprimand for years."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is an exceptionally handsome young man, but when he sees his portrait and realizes his own beauty he wishes that the painting would grow old while he could remain young. At first he is mortified when he finds changes in his painted image, but influenced by a friend Dorian begins to seek the pleasures in life. No matter what depths he sinks to his handsome face remains unchanged, while the portrait grows uglier and more hideous, burdened not only by age but by his debauched lifestyle.I don't know if this work of literature is as widely read as it maybe once was but I was quite taken in by the story. It's interesting that Dorian, instead of using the portrait as a type of conscience to correct his actions, instead takes strange delight in observing the change. He revels in his freedom from outward consequences and digs deeper, delving into every pleasure. In some ways the separate manifestations of the individual reminded me ofDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, while his recognition of his outward appeal and how it would fade seemed to have shades of Bradbury'sDandelion Wine. And the character of Lord Henry is interesting, always in the background congratulating him and encouraging Dorian's sensual hedonism. But it's also a critique of society, both Victorian and today: we spend our time and money trying to reverse the effects of age (the gym, cosmetics and cosmetic surgery, etc.); companies spend billions idealizing (or idolizing) \\"youth\\"; and some even even seek to excuse away weakness and place blame elsewhere. In all, it may not be a perfect story but it's very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written. Wilde has taken an old story and transformed it into a tale of Victorian excess and corruption. He has created a main character (Dorian) with whom a little part of all of us can identify with--he lives his life to the fullest extent, but doesn't age, while his portrait bears the burden of his fast living. I highly reccemmend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature at it's best. Wilde was primarily known as a playwright, but with Dorian Gray, he has proved that he was a great novelist also."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A true work of art that anyone can hold in their hand and return to again and again. I found myself constantly reaching for a pen to underline all those Wilde words thast only Oscar could have penned. He saw the world in such a unique way that will never be replicated. And if you ever need a quick comeback, quoting Dorian Gray will throw off most anyone. And if it doesn't, perhaps you will have a new friend!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is going to have to be one of the best books I read this whole year. I so would love to have this book be a movie. It takes such interesting turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the whole era has always been pleasing to me. What a fun read!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard about the ending in this book by a popular speaker who I've enjoyed over the years, and the ending intrigued me enough that I wanted to read the book as well.The story centers on the life of Dorian Gray, who's wish to have his painted portrait age and show signs of moral decay instead of his body comes true. Throughout his life he becomes more and more heinous morally, while retaining his innocent look until his death, which is the suprise ending...Also included in this book are the short stories 'Lord Aurthur Savile's Crime,' 'The Canterville Ghost,' 'The Sphinx Without a Secret,' and 'The Model Millionare.'"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After hearing about Oscar Wilde and how his novel The Picture of Dorian Grey was renounced because it contained hints of homosexuality I was very eager to read the novel. However, I was utterly disappointed. The disappointment had nothing to do with the novel's themes but rather its characters and delivery.As a literature major, I am one who enjoys long novels full of detail and old romantic language such as that of Jane Austen. While The Picture of Dorian Grey was written with glorious detail and all the flowery language that I love I found myself very bored. There were many places where I found that the story dragged and though I am sure they were meant to be brilliant social commentary I could not stand the countless scenes where Lord Henry or Dorian sat about with their friends and chatted.I may have still been able to give this book at least a three star rating if the boring scenes scattered throughout the book were the only fault but unfortunately what truly put me off was the characters. I cannot enjoy a book whose characters I do not come to love or at least care for in some small way. By the end of the novel I did not care one bit what happened to Dorian Grey; he was a spineless boy and a cruel man. Lord Henry was always a wicked man and a tiresome preacher of what he considered to be cleverness. Basil Hallward was the only character that I enjoyed and somewhat identified with but he was not enough apart of the story to redeem it and nothing could make up for Dorian himself.I was extremely disappointed in this book and I cannot say that I would recommend it to anyone other than a literature fanatic looking too read as many classics as possible."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Ugh, what to say about this book. I wanted so badly to love it, but I didn't. I didn't even like it a little bit. That's terrible when you don't really enjoy the very first classic you read. This isn't setting a good stage for the future and planning on reading one classic a month. Good thing Alice in Wonderland is next month. That will definitely make up for the suck of this one. Don't you hate it when you hear such good things about a book and you go in expecting to love it only to be completely disappointed? Yeah, that's what happened here.The book follows Dorian Gray (the original Mr. Gray, if you will) who is apparently a very beautiful man who is envied by many only he doesn't quite understand why. I liked Dorian but I didn't feel like his character had much depth. I liked that he wasn't all look how sexy I am you know you want this, but at the same time he was kind of a sissy. He follows this Lord Henry guy around like he's a lost little puppy dog and puts up with him bashing him on numerous occasions. I don't know who this guy thinks he is but I had to force myself not to skip over his parts. The only rational person in this book (minus his psycho obsession over Dorian) is Basil but he isn't in enough of the book to really care too much about.I think I know why I couldn't get into this book as much as the rest of the people who told me about it. Have you seen the movie The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Okay, I see Dorian Gray in that movie when I think about him. I see Stuart Townsend in all his \\"I'm the bomb get over it\\" glory. I cannot and will not picture him as the pushover that he was in this book. That movie ruined the book for me. I remember watching the actual Dorian Gray movie but it was boring too. I may have to watch it again just to see how terrible it was in comparison to the book, but I vaguely remember falling asleep at some point.The only reason I didn't give it one butterfly is because I was able to finish it. It was hard and it seemed like forever, but I did it. And the only reason I did it was to get to the end. I read on and off for like five days just to read about the scene I could have watched in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen after only an hour and a half. Stuart Townsend will always be my Dorian Gray. This book just didn't do it for me. However... Dorian is a VERY cool name. Props to Mr. Wilde for that."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel perplexed about The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. On one hand, the story is well written about a young man being moulded and shaped. On the other hand, this book was incredibly flowery and doesn't really start for 100 pages. Dorian doesn't really know about life and meets an artist and an aristocrat that help him though his journey into manhood. The artist paints his portrait, subsequently making him keep his youth. The aristocrat had the biggest influence on Dorian Gray, though Lord Harry Wotton is very annoying. He talks and talks the whole way through this book, thinking he's so witty.Dorian Gray starts off in this novel as a blank slate, an easily influenced young man. Thoughout the rest of the story he gets moulded and pushed into shape. After Basil paints his portrait Dorian starts to unravel, afraid to show the picture, he locks it way in a room and never lets anyone see it, protecting it at all costs. The whole thing symbolising the way we hide our real selves from the rest of the world, scared of what they may think.The Picture of Dorian Gray would have been controversial in its day, with strong homosexual themes. Though the book itself is more about the life and morality, Oscar Wilde did a brilliant of capturing this element of the book. For me the biggest downfall of this book was that Lord Wotton was too loud and dominates throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an incredibly well written, wonderfully illustrated, and very interesting book to read. I have read and already own The Picture of Dorian Gray, but this book adds so much to my understanding of the story, the characters, and the time in which Wilde wrote the book. Plus it has fascinating references to Oscar Wilde's friends, enemies, his views on woman, art, life, and his other stories. I am reading every annotation, every footnote, and the story all at the same time. This book is a must have if you enjoy Oscar Wilde, and wish to understand him better. Buy It!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First off, for the audience looking to read this book after viewing the character from the movie LXG, know that the characteristics of Dorian are no as they were in the movie. Dorian does not die when he looks at his portrait; in fact his observation of the changes in his picture is one of the main elements of the story. Basil, an artist that is obsessed with the beauty of one man, Dorian, paints a portrait so beautiful that the subject is pained by the fact that the portrait's beauty will outlast that of his mortal body, and he wishes that this formula could be reversed, with the portrait aging in his place. He gets his wish, but at what price? Dorian, now free from the bounds of mortality, is no longer afraid to sin, since there he thinks that nothing can happen to him. But his behavior was not all due to his immortality; it was also due to the fact that the negative influence from Lord Henry corrupted his pure soul. The fact that he was able to keep his beauty but not able to keep his soul shows that judgment based on appearance is not only wrong, but inaccurate. This book is recommended, but not to the highest extent. The story picks up quickly, as it must with such a limited amount of pages. One of the only flaws in this book is chapter 11, the long, unwanted pause. A classic nonetheless, one that should no be overlooked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Four stars because it's a bit slow at times. The imagery in the book is quite good and the moral is well taken.

Dorian Gray does represent the reality of the British Aristocracy of old and how useless their lives really were for many."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I saw many variances of movies but never read the book. It was a true page turner. It left me wondering about Oscar Wilde's state of mind...LOL!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in \`The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in \`The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.Memorable Quotes:-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can makemodern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing isdelightful if one only hides it.\\"-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed thatthe portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep theunsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due tothat. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sureswift penalty along with it. There was purification in punishment.Not \\"Forgive us our sins\\" but \\"Smite us for our iniquities\\" should bethe prayer of man to a most just God.\\"Specific CriticismsI don't believe I have any real criticisms or complaints about this book. I do have to say that I greatly disliked the character of Lord Henry, and the book can be read much more quickly if you skip all his dialogue after his first few rants. If you've read one of his conversations you've read them all; the basic model is that he says something absurd or outlandish and then the other characters alternately gasp and fawn over his words.Every now and then this is interrupted by him saying something exceptionally bland, such as remarking that \\"They are both simply forms of imitation\\" when Basil makes the statement that \\"Love is a more wonderful thing than art.\\" Or by making some contradiction in terms, such as \\"I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.\\"Little nuances of character stand out, such as Henry and Dorian constantly remarking about the shallowness of other characters while demonstrating a pointed shallowness throughout the book. Of course this isn't a criticisms of the book or the writing, it is likely in fact a praise of the writing, that he can create such a distasteful character.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Especially considering the time of writing, this book sets out a rare insight into the workings of the human mind.

It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love the classics and somehow this one escaped my attention until now. I wish only that it hadescaped my attention forever. This rambling book of boring, sexually unstable rich people with nothing better to dowith their lives than look at pretty Dorian (because, Dorian is very pretty), and insult the commoners who have no rank or class,is tedious, boring and a complete waste of time.Dorian has his portrait painted while the painter and another man oogle him and tell him how pretty he is.The painter said his life was not complete until pretty Dorian came to sit for him.Dorian is very pretty..Dorian wishes he could stay young and pretty and that the painting would age instead of him.,,.. because he's young and prettyand men and women alike tell him how pretty he is.Dorian gets his wish and then the book ignores all his issues and goes off into the prose land of mushrooms.We next see Dorian decades later, the painting is hideous but Dorian is pretty. All his sins have left him pretty and the painting ugly.What happened in that time span is not told.Dorian is pretty.There is zero character developement and by the end I was just hoping everyone character in the book would die.Even Dorian, who is very pretty.

For its time period, I guessit would be shocking. Dorian, however, is still very pretty and that remains regardless of when this book was written.So, I hear this is only an edited version and somewhere out there is the REAL version, and it is oh so much better, but, nothing could savethis travesty of words.

Lord Henry has deeper moments of speech then Dorian. And as shocking as they said this book would be...I read nothing shocking. I thought maybe the unedited version would actually have a sex scene in it lol but they don't even mention a naughty body part lol. Nothing ever gets remotely sexual. I mean several characters are definitely gay but not in a shocking way. More like Jack McFarlan on Will and Grace. Most of the time I chuckled as I saw \\"Just Jack\\" with Jack doing his jazz hands as I read. The main appeal of this story is when it was written. So here is the thing...horror NO. Sexy No. Interesting ISH. neat insight to the time period of the story YEAH. Worth reading but don't fall for the shock and awe lol. Beautiful cover on this edition too. That alone is worth buying a cheap copy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As I ventured into my next classic fiction book, I remembered the movie League of Extraordinary Gentleman. When I watched that movie I had no idea who the character of Dorian Gray was. The movie wasn't that good, but I was still interested in that character. When I saw The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, I decided I wanted to learn more about that character.This book was not easy to read at all. It wasn't because of the language that it was written in, which did add to its difficulty. The part that bothered me the most about this book, other than its length, was the horrible lack of flow. I got the main idea of the book, I understood most of why certain parts of the book were there, but there were so many parts that did not add to the plot that for many pages at a time you would read about things like a jewel collection, book collection or whatever else fancied Dorian Gray at the time. It was so hard to finish this book because there were so many times that I couldn't grasp why I was reading what I was reading. There were so many times that Dorian or his friend Harry would go into these monologues for absolutely no reason at all.There were a few redeeming qualities to this book, but unfortunately they did nothing to help me enjoy it at all. The one thing I did like was the basic premise of the book. Dorian Gray could not age and he was beautiful so he could do whatever he wanted to. His lack of need to preserve his soul led him down the path of evil. His friend guided him down that path as well. The whole time I was reading this book I was thinking about Harry as the devil. He would plant thoughts into the brain of Dorian that led him further and further down his path of destruction.The book was a let down and I hope that the next classic fiction book I choose is a good one.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle. I would love your suggestions and comments.

I began reading this book upon the premise that it would contain fascinating worldviews, as well as a gripping plot. Rather, the book fell flat on its face. Wilde reflected his views of the importance of art, the pitfalls of beauty, and the horror of aging in this novel, and though it wasn't the views that were a problem, it was how they all contradicted one another. The author claimed, \\"all art is useless\\" in the preface of the novel, yet eventually it is art itself that becomes the bane of Dorian Gray's existence.The novel follows a young, beautiful young man, Dorian Gray, along with two of his friends, Basil, who paints a stunning picture of Dorian, and Harry, who leads Dorian into a world of lies, sin and betrayal. Though it starts off interestingly enough, the novel drags after the 50th page, and it only gets worse and worse until the very end. It is meant to shock its readers, with tales of murder and drugs, yet the writing isn't sophisticated enough to support these statements. The downward spiral of Dorian Gray's life is deserved, and the novel fails to leave the reader with a strong residual message. To its credit, however, the original premise was interesting, and the decay of Dorian Gray's existence and how he views himself makes for a decent plot.I will not bother to go into the details of the novel, for example the sexism and the portrayal of women in the book, and how it is questionable whether the characters are more in love with women, the idea of women, each other (yes, they are all male), or themselves. The homosexuality in the novel did not bother me, though the inaccurate portrayal of women did.If you are interested in reading about art, corruption or murder in the late 19th century in England, please, spare yourself the torture of reading Dorian Gray, though it is only a little over 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian wasn't that great of a novel. The subjects in this moral fable are very dramatic but go exceedingly too far. Tragedy stalks every crack and turn of it. It ends in a tragedy. In the beginning, it is rather happy, but right after the actress and lover commits suicide it goes completely. I do not doubt Wilde's famed wit but, he could have written something more happy than this depressing novel. The descriptions are very well done(especially in the beginning.) Thus, he should used his wit and humor for a more enjoyable and felicatous novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book was really really twisted, our sophmore class had to read it for school, and almost everyone hated it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde seems to have written a somewhat scathing critique of late nineteenth century English life, or at least that of the upper class. The two main characters, Dorian Gray himself and his mentor Lord Henry Wotton, lead lives of extreme self-indulgence.Lord Henry constantly spews forth his theories and philosophies regarding everything about human nature. Although they are numerous, Henry's ideas can be condensed into one main point. Early in the narrative when he is first exercising his right to influence under the title of mentor, Henry exclaims to Dorian that the only thing worth having is youth. Youth, which is, according to Henry, the only stage where beauty can be found, comes with an ever-present hedonistic lifestyle. This is the template for which the impressionable Dorian bases his life upon.Dorian becomes the ultimate purveyor of self-indulgence and corrupts everything he associates himself with, all the while accompanied on his journeys by a curse of grave implications. To the disappoint of many, I will not give away more of the story; as I'm sure most of you are already salivating over the details I have put forth.The story unfolds at first in a matter of weeks and then jumps several years, yet the focus of the novel does not waiver. This Romantic Period novel is filled with the standard mystery, and a central dealing with human nature. It is well written and comes with excellent detail, as required by this writing period. It also comes with the characteristic whit of Oscar Wilde. The dialogue between characters is excellent and Lord Henry's theories are exquisite often bordering on comical, but always cynical.Wilde seems to warn against the excess of hedonism and uses the story of Dorian Gray as a deterrent. More importantly I believe this is a social critique of high society, which breeds excess and cultivates decadence, while often regarding everything with a selfish eye. The book is filled intellectual quips about human nature and society, yet it is a short book and relatively easy read. This book is required reading for many, so possibly you've already read it, but if not, during commercial breaks of course, give this a try."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The story in itself was great, I loved it! However, Wilde's use of excess pronouns could tend to confuse a reader.

This story kept me entranced the entire time. I, like Basil, was completely infautated with Dorian Gray from the moment his name was annouced. A beautiful boy completely unspoiled by the darkness in the world. A boy immeressed in the decendance of his times. When Dorian realizes he too must face mortality and it's grip on his beauty he makes a wish to never lose his youth and beauty, to instead let his painting age for him. This the painting does... from the curve of his lips to the look in his eyes. Dorian uses this completely to his advantage and commits selfish and horrible acts all the while hidden under a charming smile and innocent face.

It is a beautifully written book and is as much a work of art as an elegantly painted portrait.Centered around the vain and young Dorian Gray, it tells the price one pays for eternal youth and gives a new dimension to the human soul. As Dorian succumbs to the tempting dark underworld of London, and he lives by night in wicked ways, the beautiful portrait painted of him becomes like a journal of his soul, becoming ever more twisted and deformed. It begins to haunt Dorian continuously, day and night, consuming his every thought.

Any lover of a well written book would also fall for this."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What is more important, physical beauty or a beautiful heart?

I have appreciated Oscar for 40 years and I only read this gem four months ago! It is truly one of my \\"classics\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The picture of Dorian Gray may have been shocking for its taboo innuendoes when it was first published late in the 19th century, but to a modern reader, almost seeking out an element of that shameful pleasure a well written novel of vanity and desire might evoke, such a thrill-seeker will be a bit disappointed here. That said, the higher threshold of today's readers for topics that would have made a Victorian-era bookworm blush doesn't take away at all from the bona-fide quality of writing, and depth of thought, manifested within the complex discourses of Oscar Wilde's characters time and again throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\"The storyline itself is interesting -- a young man, driven to trade his soul for lifelong youth and beauty, is left with a brutally accurate reminder that the burdens of the soul are inescapable. Nevertheless, the clever plot is the lesser of the art forms Wilde exhibits in this book.The most impressive feature of Wilde's writing in this novel is the manner in which his characters express and justify devious thoughts. Corrupt and evil notions are so explicitly well-rationalized, with such a seemingly undeniable logic, that the reader is almost forced to pause, mid-paragraph at times, to debate in his own mind whether he agrees with what he just read. As the story unfolds, and the maladies brought about through the gradual corruption of Dorian Gray grow more and more apparent and profound, one almost needs to turn the pages back to the stanzas previously used to justify an ill-fated thought simply to reconsider why such statements at first seemed to be such decent insights about humanity. Perhaps we are all just as corruptible as Dorian Gray? If so, that is the genius of Oscar Wilde in this work.This novel is not simply one to be read; rather it is a novel to be read deeply into. There is a little bit of Dorian Gray in us all."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"reading this for the first time, i remember the movie that was made in the 1980's (vaguely) i'm a fan of oscar wilde and these pocket editions as well!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I love this story.

Many of us our familiar with the basic Dorian Gray fable - a man yearns for immortality and gets it. In Wilde's take, Dorian Gray, a young handsome teenager wishes the deprecating effects of age to strike his portrait and not his flesh. He gets his wish and at the goading of Lord Henry becomes an absolute hedonist. Always within though there seems to be a remorseful conscience, a longing for purity. But the ease of depravity squashes moral sentiments before they take root. In the end though, the ageless man finally confronts his portrait...After learning of the author, Oscar Wilde, I was surprised that the book came from his pen (thinly veiled homoeroticism nonwithstanding). I interpreted the book as a cautionary tale against heedlessness and indulgence - basically against the materialist character of Lord Henry. It is a moral tale that explores themes of beauty and its subsidary: age. One cannot help but see one's own portrait in the depiction of young Dorian Gray.I found the writing of the book to be fantastic. Great dialogue and monologues with the British witticisms that you would expect."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"So you want to remain eternally young? This book will tell you an engrossing moralistic tale that paints the picture of where the deadly sin of vanity can take you. It will take you into a descent into a hell full of shadows where the light will never touch you.This is a classic dark tale of intrigue. It is filled with the depths to which the human condition can sink. It is a page turner, but it may leave you feeling empty at the end. That is what it did for me. Nevertheless, it is a haunting book that is well worth reading. Oscar Wilde will speak from his grave throughout the centuries through this book.As the author of a spiritually-themed book entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I appreciated this book for the most unusual reasons. I am a former addict who knows what it is like to experience hell within life. The hopeful note within this book is that it will wake the reader up to taking responsibility for his or her own life. That is what I have had to do with my own. Thank God for books that can wake us up to that reality so that we do not have to sink into the abyss of nothingness.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Famed for his biting wit and a master of epigrams, Oliver Wilde fails to disappoint in the only novel he has ever published. The Picture of Dorian Gray is both shocking and profound, delving into the daunting choices one man makes after obtaining, through a careless wish, perpetual youth.Dorian Gray begins the book as an innocent, wholly untainted Adonis. He is introduced to the decadent Lord Henry Wotton through his friend Basil Hallward, a renowned painter. After the influence of Lord Henry, Dorian, upon seeing his alluring, youthful self captured in Basil's portrait of him, rashly wishes that he might remain young and beautiful like the portrait while it grew old and ugly. The discovery that his wish was made a reality leads Dorian down a sordid path. He coldly scorns his love, Sibyl Vane, when she loses her acting ability for love of him, resulting in her suicide. After this mar of blood on his conscience, Dorian chooses to lead a life of hedonism, ignoring the pleadings of his old friend Basil. Blaming Basil for his tainted conscience and corrupt way of life, Dorian murders Basil and eventually, stabs his portrait in rage, killing himself. He reverts to his true self, utterly grotesque and unrecognizable.Although the plot alone is enticing, Wilde's incredible skill with language is really the highlight of the book. Many astonishing events occur in the story of Dorian's descent into decadence, but Wilde's consistent, calm narration does not mask the scenes' madness but rather enhances it, making Dorian's evil actions all the more eerie. Tempting in its morbidity, the book drags along its readers as a horror movie would its audience. Through his mastery of syntax, Wilde is often able to convey exactly Dorian's emotion and state of mind. Varying between short, choppy sentences and long, languid descriptions, Wilde skillfully manipulates syntax to reflect upon the state of the characters. Imagery runs rampant throughout the novel. Whole passages devoted to the description of the gardens and the like drug the reader with sensual images, pulling them into the scene itself.The characters are also developed to an amazing extent, especially Lord Henry, the most intriguing in the book. Despite being a bad influence on Dorian, Lord Henry is actually a main contributor to the profundity of this novel. Although he is seen as a decadent, and often times, the intellectual lightweight of the story, Henry is also very philosophical. The man seems to have a philosophy of everything, smothering in his constant philosophical didactics. However, sayings like \\"Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was torn away\\" are very thought-provoking. It seems that Henry is Wilde's spokesperson through whom the author questions society's way of life and any alternatives. Lord Henry's thoughts, thus, not only influences Dorian but also has a tremendous effect on Wilde's readers.However, this amazing novel is not without flaws. Basil is intended to be the most moralistic of the trio, an opposition to Lord Henry's negative influence on Dorian. Although Basil's weakness can be interpreted as Wilde's criticism of Victorian society and its own weakening morals, his reluctance to fully acknowledge Dorian's stray from the noble path and thus, his inability to save his friend is infuriating and almost annoying.Overall, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great read. Its morals are fairly simplistic while its messages are wholly complicated. The masterful use of language in the novel establishes once more the reason for Oscar Wilde's popularity. Provoking and profound, The Picture of Dorian Gray definitely merits a second read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"a classic literary staple of the modern world! a must read for any intellectual. every sentence is brimming with stimulating ideas and paradoxes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The quickest way to sum up this book in one word is \\"wow.\\" I will admit that for awhile I didn't find the book 5-star worthy, but I soon found myself thoroughly engrossed. Wilde has written this story like a symphony in four movements with an overture, ballad, climax, and finale. The prose is absolutely lyrical.Beauty is a dominant theme. Wilde excessively alludes to Greek Gods and the perfection of Adonis. The concept of beauty is also represented in the idea of man vs. himself, or better yet as beauty vs. immortality. Dorian wrestles constantly with his inner self and with the immortality his beauty presents to him. But with his beauty comes sins and pleasure that have no effect on him because their consequences marr his self portrait. Dorian uses his beauty to sin which ultimately leads to violence; his emotions often confuse his sins with pleasure.A secondary theme is the absence of reality. In the Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde echoes a similar line as that from Dorian. He writes that the two most attractive types of people are those who know nothing at all or absolutely everything. Three key characters represent varying degrees of reality, as well as Wilde's description of attractive people. Dorian knows nothing and Lord Henry knows absolutely everything, but Basil is the medium ground between the two that represents reality. Basil is the only one who sees/acknowledges things for what they truly are, but he is shunned by others who don't want to see reality. Characters like Dorian and Lord Henry have the idea that to see reality is to be scared of life. It is bad to be a spectator to one's own life. Dorian even admits that \\"He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realise the situation.\\" If he didn't acknowledge it, it simply did not exist.Lastly is the theme of homosexuality. Wilde does not mention any specifics of homosexual relationships, but what one has to read between the lines jumps off the page with equal magnitude of the written text.All in all, this book is excellent. Read this book, you will be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde is yet another triumph for this talented author. The dark tale of a young man who unknowingly sells his soul in order to stay forever young is wittily brought across through three main characters, each resembling a different part of Wilde himself.Dorian, the main character, represents what Wilde himself said he would like to be, yet Dorian also clearly resembles part of Wilde: the part that was once young and innocent before becoming corrupted by the world he lived in.Henry Wooton, the man responsible for the corruption of Dorian Gray, is the side of Oscar Wilde that the world thought was the true Wilde: carefree and conceited, caring nothing for other people, yet extremely witty. This is also Wilde, as far as the witty and carefree parts go. Only when Henry displays his rare moments of care for other people does this character seem like Wilde.Basil, the man who paints the infamous picture of Dorian, is the character who Wilde found himself to be the most like. Quiet and withdrawn, Basil is a caring man with a good consience who completely adores Dorian. Out of the entire novel, Basil is one of the few truly good people.This novel does, however, have it's shortcomings. Lord Henry Wooton's wife is introduced in a scene and given an extremely interesting description. She is a nervous woman who laughs often and also displays the wit that Wilde was so famous for. This description, however, makes one think that she will be extremely important later, when in truth, she never shows up again (though she is mentioned once by Henry). There is also a chapter that delves a little too deeply into the obsessions that Dorian went through, going into long run-on sentances and too-long descriptions.Overall, this is an extremely well-written novel that portrays what is wrong with society today through the views of the characters and the actions they take. Though it may not be the easiest read for today's society (many of whom are as corrupt as the characters in the book), it is one well worth reading, if only for a new outlook on life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"C.S. Lewis wrote that pride is the greatest sin. It is the doorway to all other kinds of evil. Though this was certainly not what Oscar Wilde was writing about, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a perfect illustration of this. The protagonist's pride causes him to go to horrible lengths. In the end it causes everyone around him (and eventually himself) great pain. I have read Wilde's works only a couple of times since being introduced to them in high school. Each time I do, I remember how much I like him as an author. This time, I was once again reminded how masterful Wilde was as a writer. His keen wit and incisive humor is refreshing. His prose is clean and unlabored. I don't know why I haven't read his stuff more often. I certainly will now."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story is positively a masterpiece. Dorian Gray is a young boy at first, whose beauty is so entirely dazzling that Mr. Basil Hallward, an artist, becomes utterly obsessed with the portrait he is painting of Dorian. Feeling certain he has not only achieved his best artistic work yet, he confesses shamefully that he has put so much of himself into the portrait that were it ever displayed publicly, the world would glimpse his soul. In short, Basil is in love with the image of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry Wotten befriends Dorian, much to the chagrin of Basil, who feels a near homosexual jealousy. When Basil presents the finished portrait to Dorian, Dorian makes a whimsical wish \\" If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that - for that - I would give everything!\\"From that moment on, Dorian's life changes. Lord Henry becomes his mentor of sorts, and a finer fictional character I have yet to meet. Indeed, Lord Henry has a profound influence on young Dorian, and his philosophies will hypnotize you, as they often do Dorian Gray. The portrait takes on sinister and looming proportions, and eventually Dorian must face the consequences of that one whimsical wish, and fight the ultimate battle - for his own soul. An amazingly fabulous book you absolutely MUST read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When Wilde landed in America in 1882 for a lecture tour, he was asked if he had anything to declare. He responded, &quot;Only my genius.&quot; Okay now, an attitude like that didn't exactly make me want to read any of his works for a long time. Finally, I decided to try The Picture of Dorian Grey, and I found that it really was a work of genius.The novel is the story of Dorian Grey who at the beginning of the novel has his portrait painted by Basil Hallward. The picture turns out to be remarkable, and Grey becomes jealous because the picture will remain young and beautiful while he will age. He expresses a wish that the picture would age instead of himself. To his delight, his wish becomes true, and believing himself to be immortal, he embarks on a path of of hedonism. He always searches for pleasure above happiness, and above all things he loves beauty. Along the way, the portrait chronicles the total moral decay of Dorian Grey.The are a lot of interpretations to this novel. My favorite is to read it as a moral tale warning of the consequences of leading a life of hedonism. It could almost be read as &quot;The Picture of Oscar Wilde&quot; as he seems to be criticizing his own lifestyle. This is probably also the most ironic reading of it since Wilde continued after the novel to preach aestheticism. But anyway, taken within itself, the novel is marvelous. The prose is well-polished. The pacing is elegant and the plot is always interesting. The points is makes are important. The Picture of Dorian Grey deserves its classic status, and Oscar Wilde actually was a bit of a genius."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'd heard a lot about Wilde when I started this book, but this was the first of his works that I'd ever read. I was half-way expecting long, incomprehensible philosophical discussions, impossible to decipher passages...my stereotype of 19th century literature. But when I was through the first chapter, I had a wake-up call. &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;this is really GOOD!&quot; I became addicted, and sped through the rest of the book. It is engrossing, absorbing, entertaining, and not the least bit boring. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel provides a fascinating story on a young man's desire to keep his appearance while having his age expressed and progressed in a portrait of himself. The story not only has a good plot, it has a strong philosophical foundation which is characterized through numerous epigrams. Among the characters, Dorian Gray and Lord Henry present various explanations throughout life.

It was an interesting book, and while I cannot say that I liked it as such, it is good to have read it - my curiosity is satisfied.It was very sad that Dorian went so completely \\"off the rails\\", so to speak, under the influence of Henry, and I found the worldview difficult to cope with. At times the irony in the situations was very poignant - such as when Dorian tells Sybil Vane that she is selfish, while he, in fact, is the selfish one. I suppose that justice was met at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First published in 1890, Oscar Wilde's now classic novel is a meditation on decadence, art and morality. At the center is a young man of strikingly good looks who's portrait is painted by a dear friend - a portrait that then absorbs and reflects the young man's soul as he makes decisions that affect others as he slides into a life of debauchery.Highly stylized, the prose contains classic lines such as \\"the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\" Wilde's only novel, the book was viewed as scandalous and immoral when published despite the fact that the immoral - or, more accurately, amoral perpetrator of ill deeds suffers as he chases empty pleasures and eventually comes to reflect upon the impact that his actions have had upon others and himself.The book is not the easiest of reads given the heavy style, the setting, and pervasive use of cultural references from high society in the late 19th century. However, for those who want to fully understand the commonly referenced trope of \\"Dorian Gray's portrait,\\" nothing serves bettern than the source."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book because it was a bookclub read.

I am happy that I read the book and I did find it to be a good story and plot overall. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read the classics."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I really have no idea why \\"Illustrated\\" is included in the title of this work. The only part of this book that is illustrated (besides the cover) is the short biography found at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It must have been around 1870 when very capable artist Basil Hallward brilliantly painted soon to be very rich 20-year old Dorian Gray. Hallward's wordy, witty friend Lord Henry Wotton on their first meeting in the painter's studio persuaded Dorian Gray that youth was any good looking human's greatest attribute. And youth, since it did not long endure, must be lived to the utmost while it did last. This meant Dorian's \\"expressing,\\" externalizing every insight, impulse and passion that most people learn to keep bottled up inside them. An early version of \\"let it all hang out.\\"Oh, how hitherto naive and innocent Dorian wished that he would never have to say farewell to his youth and beauty! If only he might stay young while the young man in his portrait did all the aging? That wish was granted. And THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1890, 1891) unrolls the next 18 or 19 years of Gray's while everyone around him grew older but he did not.It can be argued,that Dorian's wish for eternal youth was morally indifferent, neither good nor bad. It might have remained harmless, like Ponce de Leon's search for the Fountain of Youth. It was conceivably a well-meaning God who granted Dorian Gray's wish. What would matter in the end was what Gray did with his youth.He was given good albeit secular advice by painter Basil Hallward and very bad, cynical, character-ruining advice by Lord Henry. Unfortunately for Hallward (whom Gray would later murder) and for Dorian himself, the young man consistently heeded Lord Henry. In consequence, Dorian Gray learned to separate art from reality, learned to value clever words and eptithets more than unselfish deeds and denied himself nothing that his fertile brain could imagine. This self-indulgence included frequent visits to London opium dens, brawls with foreign sailors on the docks and viciously spurning Sybil Vane, the teenage Shakespearean actress, whom he loved for her acting skills but who renounced them because they seemed unreal compared with Dorian's love for her. Hours after a scathing denunciation by a disappointed Dorian, young Sybil swallows prussic acid and dies.All this dissent into hell is faithfully reproduced in the increasingly cruel, vicious lines of face and body in the portrait of Dorian Gray. The picture becomes the conscience of the novel's hero who often sits spell-bound before it. It sometimes persuades him, very briefly, to make half-hearted efforts at reform. But the portrait allows Dorian to understand that every single one of his half-hearted good deeds is hypocritical, is bad acting. For 18 years, until he destroys himelf with a knife intended to destroy his portrait, Dorian Gray remains a handsome 20-year old while all others move steadily toward the grave.Telling the bare story of Gray's decline takes up perhaps a third of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. The rest is ballast, starting with excursuses into Gray's sometimes year long fads of the moment: tapestries, music, religion (especially Roman Catholicism), mysticism and decadent French literature. Then there are teas, dinners and parties among the swells and aristocrats of London. These are all contrived social stages for Oscar Wilde to let his decadent characters like Lord Henry Wotton and handsome young Dorian Gray skewer institutions like marriage and preen themselves before admiring audiences as they drop several hundred seemingly spontaneous epithets into sparkling conversations. The London ambience of useless Duchesses, members of Parliament and wealthy society widows is lovingly limned by Oscar Wilde.Let one party and its smart talk suffice for many. As brilliant for its repartee as any other social occasion in the novel is Chapter 15's small, hastily puled together dinner at Lady Narborough's. Dorian Gray appears, having mere hours before having stabbed to death his friend painter Basil Hallward and having then blackmailed another onetime friend to dispose of the body. At Lady Narborough's Dorian was wildly excited but outwardly calm and his manner \\"as easy and graceful as ever.\\" The company was rather dull. His hostess's married daughter had \\"one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered.\\" Things became livelier when Lord Henry Wotton arrived, very, very late. The table discusses the amours of Madame de Ferrol. Lord Henry summed her up: \\"Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her third husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.\\" Henry preens himself when accused of wickedness: \\"It is perfectly monstrous ... the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.\\"The question arises at Lady Narborough's: are we such a sorry lot because it is \\"the end of the century\\" (fin de siecle)? or the end of the world (fin de globe)? Certainly none of the players is morally outstanding or even self-content. They are useless and they know it.-OOO-"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This was a English summer project for my daughter in school. She really enjoyed it.

Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" is about youth, corruption, and esthetics. Reflective of Wilde's own life and revolt against Victorian era sentimentality, young Dorian Gray slowly changes after his philosophical discussions with the cynical Lord Henry Wotton, whose cold criticisms and harsh wit are often humorous in an addictively jaded kind of way, and tempting to arm oneself with; however, read on and observe Wilde's destruction of Lord Henry's young protoget. The immediate power of Basil Hallward's portrait of Dorian retains a demonic hold on its confused subject, taunting and torturing his vanity with its strangely metamorphizing characteristics. Who's changing, and what exactly is changing? Wilde creates an unforgettable \\"portrait\\" here of one man's (or is it the whole of Victorian society?) demise. Many critics of Wilde have seen him and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" as pure evil and criticized the undertones of homosexuality, and linked it with a lifestyle of debauchery and degradation. Wilde was thrown in jail for his \\"unlawful activities\\". To them I must concur with Wilde, that \\"Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's Dorian Gray is such a powerful book because it explores the path of one man's sins and their effect on his life and the lives of those around him. Wilde uses Dorian as an example to demonstrate the struggles of humanity coping with its flaws. Wilde's plot is simple enough. Dorian was a man who had everything going for him. He was young, beautiful, wealthy, and unspoiled. Then he met Lord Henry, whose bizzare philosophies that he himself didn't even take seriously had a great impact on the impressionable Dorian. Lord Henry had convinced Dorian that once his youth had passed, he would have nothing enjoyable left in life, which caused Dorian pray aloud that a portrait he had of himself would take on his own physical burdens. As Dorian becomes more and more corrupted by Lord Henry and commits more sins, he notices that the painting (which represents his conscience) is becoming more and more wretched. He occasionally feels remorse and tries to change, but his plans always fail when Lord Henry draws him back under the shadow of his influence. The discouraged Dorian finally resolves to start his life anew by destroying the painting, the only record he has of his sins. When he stabs the picture, however, he kills himself.This is a powerful story that portrays the important lesson that sins are inescapable and everybody's actions catch up to them. This isn't a hard concept, but Wilde's writing is very challenging. He uses very poignant expressions constantly throughout the book that can get the reader off track because they tend to cause him to attempt to frequently stop and process what has just been said. I think that this was a great book, but it wouldn't be good to require it at Mercy High because it takes so long to get through."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life. Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world. Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions. Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\" This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day. The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul. Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation. But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves. Despite the Victorian idea that a person&#65533;s nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors\\" - Oscar Wilde\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is an excellent novel about the degradation of the human soul. The novel focuses around the handsome Dorian Gray and his interactions with the artist Basil Hallward, who paints his portrait and Lord Henry, who becomes the corrupting influence on Dorian's soul and Dorian's iinteractions with the British aristocracy. Dorian is compared to Narcissus, who was so obsessed with his own beauty, that it swallowed him whole. Dorian seals his fate with one wish; upon viewing his portrait, he wonders if it would be possible for his portrait to show the signs of aging, in exchange for his mortal beauty. Throughout the novel, we see Dorian's decent into total self - absorbtion and evil all of which culminates in an ending that is predictable but still entertaining none the less.Just a quick side note, there is some great social commentary running throughout \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" specifically Wilde's commentary on the stiff, British aristocracy of the late 19th century, absurd views regarding women, who are painted by Gray as blubbering idiots (a sign of the times) and last but not least, the underlying homosexual undertones present between Dorian, Basil and Lord Henry are fascinating to deconstruct.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was my first introduction to Oscar Wilde and after reading the novel, I was hooked. I would like to return to the quote above, about art mirroring the soul of the spectator, after reading this novel, you will have a sense of how trully frightening that notion is."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel. This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery. Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The idea of never growing old and having a painting take on all your admoralities is appealing.Dorian reacts as anyone would. He lives life with full adbandonment pays the price.I believe the moral of the story is this. In the end we all pay for our actions.Wilde does a great job building characters and leading the reader into the world of the Englis upper-crust."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Contrary to some opinions I've come across, this book does NOT romanticize or promote a loss of morals. It is the exact opposite. Yes, Dorian becomes corrupted, but does the ending suggest that Wilde was making Dorian a hero for it? By no means. Dorian did not live happily ever after. It is a very moral book in that it clearly reinforces the principle of inevitable consequences of one's actions. Yes, at times it was a little slow (that is when the characters went into long life-philosophies)but all around it was very interesting and provided an insight into the late Victorian world in which Oscar Wilde lived. It addresses some key concepts such as appearance and its relation to virtue and the double-sidedness of one's character. Overall this book was not bad at all. A good read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I am a fan of many writers, but Oscar Wilde holds a special place in my non-existant but nonetheless real Hallway of Marble Busts of Famous Dead Guys. Obviously, Wilde was aware of his already-forming legend status at the height of his popularity, and his arrogance is permeated throughout every one of his works. This does not, however, disqualify him from being rightly honored by his huge and admiring readership. It also doesn't change the fact that he was victim of his own irony, dying young and humiliated in jail. No one illustrates tragicomedy better than Oscar Wilde. This particular book is the Bible of the Infinitely Quotable Strokes of Verbal Genius. My personal fave: &quot;Cigarettes are the perfect form of the perfect pleasure. They are exquisite and they leave one unsatisfied. What more could one want?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Besides the clever fiction and vivid details that draws you in deep, this book brings out the shame of humanity and puts it on display so elegantly.

It was actually why I decided to read it.If you expect exploits as in the movies, where he uses his ability and all that, then you'll regret it.It's a good story about a man who realises what morality is and how to live with it, or not live with it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I heard of the movie first because I'm a Fan of Ben Barnes before I found the book. I read the reviews and saw how people praises the book a lot. I liked the concept so figured I'll read it first before I'll watch the movie. I really thought I'd walk into a grotesque environment but it ended up so intriguing. Its exhilarating and atmospheric. I admire Oscar Wilde's brilliance in creating the characters, specifically Lord Henry. He is Dorian Gray's (the evil one) creator and honestly, Henry is the keystone of the story. His lines are perfectly constructed making them alluring even if he wasn't brave enough to do them himself. If I were like Dorian who grew up seeing only 4 walls and suddenly got freed, then get to talk to a man as eloquent as Henry is, I really believe his influence will be so great too. The characters of the book also show deep interest in art of different forms including Painting of course, literature and fashion which reflects the artist within Oscar himself. The author described Dorian Gray as \\"art\\" himself, I figured it will be challenging to find a person to play the part in the movie so beautiful to be called \\"art\\". Amazingly, Ben Barnes lived up to the role. Being chosen to play that role brings pressure and flattery of course, but the challenge is, if he can bring to life the Dorian Gray Oscar Wilde created. Its a good read! Oscar Wilde is a talented writer as we all know. This book can change your point of view of some aspects in life if you let it!! As what Ben said, \\"there's a great difference between pleasure and real happiness\\". You can try the movie too, its wonderfully made; great acting and the story line is nice. they made a few modifications and additions from the book at it made it more interesting. Colin forth and Ben Barnes were fabulous! The movie is lush, exhilarating and extremely sexy!!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England.

Some of their friends sent their children there long before I was born. Pastor Jones might have had Dorian Gray in mind when he said: \\"Dissipations of youth must be paid for with a draft on old age.\\"Wilde's Dorian Gray is devoted to the fanciful premise that a soul might scar itself with the most horrible of depraved debauchery, which in Victorian London included opium dens, prostitution, and in the case of Mr. Gray, murder, both by proxy and in personal excess of temper. So, if you exercise patience, a murder mystery unfolds. (Lots and lots of patience!)What dark meditations crossed my mind, and how like ice was my countenance while feasting in Wilde's psychological eulogizing of scarlet sins and opulence from dozens of characters famous in classical Western history. As my mother was a history major with emphasis in fine arts, I've seen many of the anecdotal persons from art and mythology named in this book, experienced their art and literature and stories in our own collections and the local library. I've read their sad, sordid sense of moral turpitude, the decay of dynasties possessed of great art, luxury and wealth.Dorian's zeal to experience every pleasure on which he might lay his hands is reminiscent of the Ecclesiastes, though more lengthy and of less lucid outcomes. Accused sometimes of misanthropy, Oscar Wilde is nonetheless a master of florid verbosity. As once observed by author Ursula K. LeGuin, each sentence must dedicate it's reason for being, to an introduction of the next sentence.I might not have read all of this novel, except that I'm awed in admiration of the incredibly artful architecture of Wilde's sentences. One simple sentence might introduce what literature teachers will scold their students about being a \\"run-on-sentence.\\"But Wilde philosophizes elaborate arguments in the heads of his characters. There is nothing wrong analytically, or logically with attaching the cohesive phrases and clauses of two or more sides of an argument all together into a unified thought, even wielding a dozen commas to conjoin these articulated opposites.The style evokes memories of reading St. Paul in the King James English Bible, or the sublime constructions found in the tragedyRamona (Signet Classics), by Helen Hunt Jackson. I would never subject juvenile readers to the philosophy of Dorian Grey. Even as an adult, I'm grateful to have experienced a healthy dose of Shakespeare, prior to microscopically examining the minutia of a deeply troubled mind preoccupied with male beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I started out disliking this book: too much silliness, not enough serious message. However, as time progressed, it turned out that the silliness (often shown in people's favorite quotes) is froth, and the body underneath is substantial: good, evil, innocence, and corruption. Wilde is a sublime genius at meshing the two levels in one work."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this was a well written book but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone who wants a relaxing read. If you like well written novels that have an almost disturbing sense to it then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Appropriately, I read this book while travelling the dark, sombre tube system in London. I already knew the story, but what struck me most was the perfection of the writing. Wilde uses such beautiful, concise and clear language to convey his own version of the Faustian legend.The subject matter is troubling to some but one cannot deny the quality of the art."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book at times appears to be a sequence of Wilde's best one-liners, intersperced with narrative. Once, when I thought that that was all that the book was, I still liked it: after all, the story was a good one, the one-liners were mostly good, and if the two didn't fit well together, well, that was a pity, but it didn't prevent the book from being fun to read.I realise now that the book packs a greater moral punch than I'd thought. Wilde makes evil seem genuinely attractive; and this is not to be done merely by telling us that so-and-so finds evil attractive, and then giving a spurious causal explanation. When Dorian performs his first act of genuine cruelty, not only Henry, but the author as well, tell us to forget about it, that it doesn't really matter. They even give us some genuinely good arguments. (Whereas Basil, the force of good, seems to be able to do little but utter stolid platitudes.) So we forget about it as much as Dorian does, and are hit over the head all the more smartly by the end of the book. It's true, Wilde still gets a bit carried away with himself in places; and the effect of seeing so many of his epigrams together in the one place is to make us wonder if we could write a computer program capable of creating a couple of hundred more; but I was wrong in my initial reaction. The flippancy and the deep seriousness are both necessary. They contrast, but they do not clash."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book as part of a personal quest to read some of the classic authors and was pleasantly surprised. I read some of the other reviews posted for the book and since it was free for Kindle I grabbed it. It was an awesome read that i felt was very relevant even though it was written many years ago.It tells the story of Dorian Gray who is a beautiful young man who has his portrait painted and upon seeing the protrait's beauty, doesn't think that he could ever live up to its beauty. He wishes that the picture could age instead of him and with that, in effect makes a \\"deal with the devil\\". Who actually turns out to be an acquaintance of the painter. Now I must clarify that the use of the term devil isn't literal or traditional in the sense of a scary creature whom Dorian encounters and actually makes a deal. Over time, it becomes apparent that Dorian doesn't age and that the picture does which causes a emotional distress for Dorian and we see him living his life in seclusion and treachery.People who encounter Dorian seem to have harm follow them or they in fact, harm (kill) themselves. All the while, he maintains his boyish looks and draws the ire of the townspeople and becomes the subject of many comments, rumors, and suggestions.In the end Dorian decides that the only way to be free and have a clean slate is to destroy the very thing that he feels has been holding him back...the picture and what happens next...well...I guess you should just read the book ;-)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into.

However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Though it's rather slow to get going in the initial chapters, Oscar Wilde's &quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; builds up into a splendidly effective piece, written in highly polished prose. Dorian Gray, who is suggestively described as &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; ... is painted by his friend and admirer, Basil Hallward. Dorian, a self-centered social luminary whose character is reminiscent of Narcissus, makes a bizarre sub-Faustian wish which tragically comes true: that his beautiful portrait may age, while he retains his youthful looks. The conclusion is disastrous, the culmination of a narrative containing elements of murder, suicide, blackmail, a confrontation in a grimy alley and an episode in an opium den. The characters are very well sketched out, particularly the triad of Dorian, Basil and the intellectual cynic, Lord Henry, Dorian's mentor and the mouthpiece of some of Wilde's most cutting amoral opinions. The style is, typically, marvellous, characterised by brilliant exchanges and aphoristic gaiety. Wilde lacerates English bourgeois culture, the conceptions of sin and virtue and the attitudes towards art of his time with tremendous aplomb. Some of his quips are patently snide, sometimes mysogynistic, as in: &quot;Woman represents the triumph of matter over mind, while man represents the triumph of mind over morals.&quot; Oh, isn't that just despicable?! I love it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you could retain your youth, what would you give up? What would you be willing to barter? Imagine, you're always young, vibrant, desired and the envy of all those who age around you?The Picture of Dorian Gray doesn't set out to answer the question, just to pose it. Oscar Wilde writes like no other I've read. The prose moves along along like a tempestuous sea. It rolls, it sways, it rocks and occasionally calms before the next surge. Amazing penmanship. Verbose conversations stir between the players as they seek to answer each other's questions and address each other's comments.The main character of the book, for me, was Lord Henry Wotton. A dandy gentleman who, for his own sake, is way too educated. It always seems to be Henry who plants the seeds of thought, or challenges the conventional wisdom which, in turn, sets the other players thinking. Henry meets Dorian as his portrait is finished by Basil Hallward. Henry, struck by Dorian's youth and beauty, remarks that, as Dorian ages, the picture will constantly remind him of who he was. Dorian wishes it the other way around and, his wish is granted but, at what cost? The picture always remains at the age when Dorian was painted yet, the face reflects Dorian's soul. The soul that becomes more dark and damaged.Chapter XI of this book describes, at Sir Henry's urging, Dorian's exploration into life. I don't think I've ever read anything like it before. Oscar Wilde seemed to have gone mad with the pen as he describes riches, wealth, decadence and hedonism. The finest details of objects of desire are described so richly you can almost feel them. This outpouring of prose meanders over many pages. At the end of the chapter I let out a \\"phew\\" as I felt Wilde had probably thrown down his pen and gone for a nap. I was exhausted from reading it. How he felt after writing it is anyone's guess.Gray does some horrible things as he develops and eventually, he sees what he's become. The picture, a mirror of his soul, becomes darker and darker as his soul becomes heartless and self-serving.It's great stuff. The book is relatively short yet overflowing with rich text and thought provoking idioms. Enjoy it, digest it, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What a wonderfull book. I Love the classic's. There are plenty of great books written today, but the classic's are from other periods in time that show life in a different light."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up a an audio cd of 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' at the same time I was reading 'A Stranger's Child' by Alan Hollinghurst. Interestingly the respective narratives move through Edwardian England while peeling back the layers of sexual repression and eroticism associated with the era. The author Diana Galbaldon accomplishes this successfully, too, with attendant similar homo-erotic themes in her Lord John (Grey)series.While both listening and reading similar books simultaneously I was trying to keep the characters aligned with each story. In fact, several characters from each book have the same name. 'Dorian Gray' begins with a prologue by the author that addresses in advance the freedom to publish content that Wilde surely felt would be controversial. This proved to be prescient.The main character for whom the book is named in effect sacrifices his soul for the vanity of youth and life's experiences and excess. Up to a point, one could make a contemporary parallel to a life lived by a celebrity (i.e. Mick Jagger, Lindsay Lohan, etc.) at least from a public perception perspective. The song 'You're so Vain' by Carly Simon could easily have been written as homage to the Dorian Gray character.There exists in the story line a protagonist (the painter of the picture) and antagonist - a friend of the painter's who, arguably is a devil incarnate, guides by suggestion Dorian Gray down a path of self-gratification, vanity and excess.For those of us that recall the Twilight Zone TV series from the 1960's, this book - a classic for it's time - would have made a marvelous episode."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has appeared in nearly a dozen forms, some reflecting publishers' objections, some adding new material by Wilde to compensate for cuts, and some simply bowdlerized in pirate editions. For the first time, Wilde's original manuscript submitted for publication has been printed as he wrote and intended it, before other people's prejudices and pressure caused him to alter the text. This is a beautifully produced large format book, beautiful cover with Caravaggio's \\"Narcissus\\" cropped and darkened, detailed introduction, bibliography and analysis of the complete publishing history of this unusually tortured author and book. All variants are included in the notes and annotations. Of particular interest is the fact that it is this text, which has not previously been published, that Sir Edward Carson, Counsel for the brutal and sociopathic Marquis of Queensbury whom Wilde absurdly sued for libel over an open note in a men's club in which Queensbury, father of Wilde's infamous lover Bosie Douglas, wrote \\"Oscar Wilde posing as a somdomite (sic).\\" But for Wilde's utterly mad legal action against Queensbury, he would not have faced the tremendous wealth of testimony and written evidence placed before the civil court by Carson, and would not have been prosecuted for any crimes, as he was after losing his libel action. Many of the passages which appear only in this new edition of \\"The Picture\\" were used by Carson to paint Wilde into a corner of criminality; and it is interesting to see just which sentences and paragraphs were accumulated to impeach Wilde on cross-examination. All in all, this is a wonderful book, almost too grand for its subject matter. But then Oscar, I am sure, would have expected nothing less."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY was first published in 1890, England was still in the last throes of a Victorian morality that still prided itself on all sorts of morality, especially sexual prudery. Into this realm of things which were not dared to be spoken, along came Oscar Wilde to say them. Wilde's gay background formed a subtext both in the novel and in his personal life that both titillated and repelled much of England.THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a reworking of the popular literary motif of the consequences of making a deal with the devil. The average Englishmen well knew of Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who had signed such a pact with Mephistopheles involving the exchange of power and knowledge for Faustus' soul. Every human being has a soul worth bartering; Wilde dared to suggest to a homophobic England that even a gay man's soul was as well.Dorian Gray is a young, handsome man whose portrait is painted by Basil Hallward. Beginning with the very introduction of Gray, Wilde consistently combines two seemingly unrelated themes: the role of the artist in society and the role of the gay man in that same society. In the Preface to his book, Wilde maintains his aesthetic belief that the only purpose of art is to have no purpose: \\"All art is useless.\\" Wilde connects this inutility about the nonpurpose of art with the aging and the dissipation of the painting that grows progressively more unattractive the more that Gray sins. Lord Henry Wotton, who is surprisingly the most interesting character in the book with his witty epigrams and biting cynicisms, is the rou&eacute; who leads--or perhaps seduces--an initially innocent Dorian into a life on nonstop debauchery. Dorian, urged on by Wotton to drop Dorian's newest girlfriend, the actress Sybil Vane, crudely berates what he saw as a second rate theatrical performance, causing her to commit suicide in grief at his cutting remarks. After her death, Wotton leads Dorian into a two decade long life fall into sin. Eventually, Dorian considers it time to clean up his act and this is where many readers have become confused with Dorian's advice about art in the Preface and Wotton's advice about art in the book. When Wilde asserts in the Preface that art is useless, he rejects the current Victorian notion that art ought to be used for the betterment of humanity. He states that the contrary is true. Art must not be used for betterment. He further implies that his belief's corollary must be true too: that art cannot harm human life. In fact, as he finishes his Preface, he notes, \\"All art is useless.\\" Yet, in the novel, Wotton rejects Dorian's claim that his painting has led Dorian's beauty on a straight line road to disaster--for Dorian, for Sybil, and earlier for Basil, whom Dorian has murdered. What is apparent, at least to Wotton if not to Dorian, is that it was not art that was responsible for their deaths, but Dorian, who in his hubris wanted to assume the same mantle of godlike near immortality that damned Faustus centuries earlier. Thus, art had nothing to do with Dorian's descent into evil. It was nothing more prosaic than pride gone berserk.Wilde's not so subtle intent at painting his own portrait of a homoerotic connection between Wotton, Dorian, and debauchery has also been a source of much confusion. Wilde could not afford to state explicitly that Dorian was involved on a gay level with Wotton, Adam Campbell or anyone else, but it is pretty clear that homoeroticism was just one in a long line of events that Wilde knew would point out the ongoing degradation of Dorian. But if Wilde allowed Dorian to escape the consequences of his seduction by Wotton, then he might not have been able to find a publisher. It was hard enough the way it was to do that.Readers today regard THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY as a fascinating if not a dated period piece about trading one's soul for forbidden delights, but no other book warns of the consequences as eloquently as this one."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I picked up this book to read, partly because I am a big fan of Wilde's plays, and partly because the concept behind this novel has become such a part of our collective conscious that I wanted to know what was behind it.It was filled with all the wit and cynicism that I expect from Wilde, but, I found it to be a bit tiresome to read. I suspect that this is partially due to the fact that it is so solidly grounded in the late 1800's that the concerns of the characters are a bit distant.Still, I must say that I feel that it is a book worth reading. Anything that has seared itself into the western world's consciousness is worth investigating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"To my mind, this is one of the best works in all of English literature. Oscar Wilde is a artist who uses the page as his canvas and the written word as his paint. His wit cuts at the human condition like a scalpel with depth and precision. Dorian Gray is his finest work.This is a Faustian tale of a man who utters an oath offering his soul for the youth portrayed in a painting of him, if only it would age instead of he. He discovers that the wish has been granted, only he gets more than he requested, as the painting shows not only the marks of age, but also the marks upon his soul as he slips into a hedonistic and odious life.I have read a lot of criticism of this book by modern and especially young readers as being slow and boring. This is much like the criticism of a beer guzzler describing a fine wine. \\"Forget the bouquet and refined taste, just give me my buzz.\\" This story, and the subtle philosophies contained within, need to be sipped deliberately and relished. There is page after page of astute insight into the paradoxes and ironies of society and the mysteries of being human. To be bored with this is to be insensate to life's depth and meaning.Many have also criticized the book as espousing hedonism and attacking Victorian society especially at the time it was written. Such critics wrongly assume that Lord Henry is Wilde's mouthpiece for a fatalistic and cynical philosophy. Actually, the exact opposite is true. The cynic is the one being satirized, not society.Lord Henry uses paradoxical aphorisms to bolster his sardonic view. However, they are specious and self validating arguments that look at the small truths about the world and draw the wrong conclusion. Rather than assume that these eccentricities and foibles are things that we can and should rise above, he draws the conclusion that we should embrace and accept our instinctive weaknesses. He ignores the higher truths and points out instead how the capitulation to our own desires sets us free. Wilde's refutation of this philosophical connivance comes in the person of Dorian Gray.Dorian was Lord Henry's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. He was living the life that Harry espoused (but ironically didn't live himself). And what was the result of Dorian's decadence? He lived a life of torment and self loathing. He agonized over the hideous marks on his soul as catalogued by the portrait with each dastardly deed. Wilde is telling us that this is what such self indulgence and cynicism about life and society brings. His message is that a civilized society, with all its inconsistencies, paradoxes and ironies, is preferable and superior to living like an animal. By smiting Dorian, he is really smiting Lord Henry and everything he advocates. He is making a case for the soul over the body; intellect over instinct.This is an exquisite and thought provoking treasure that is every bit as relevant now as it was almost a century ago when it was written. I have read it a number of times through the years and I never tire of it. As I have gotten older and more experienced, its truths have become more vivid and resonant. If you've never read it, pick it up and savor it. Don't rush through it for the plot. Ponder it as you read. If you have already read it, put it away and try it again in five or ten years. You may discover new meaning, and much that you missed. That's the beauty of a timeless novel. Its wisdom will wait patiently until you've had time to catch up."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray, a story of morals, psychology and poetic justice, has furnished Oscar Wilde with the status of a classical writer. It takes place in 19th-century England, and tells of a man in the bloom of his youth who will remain forever young.Basil Hallward is a merely average painter until he meets Dorian Gray and becomes his friend. But Dorian, who is blessed with an angelic beauty, inspires Hallward to create his ultimate masterpiece. Awed by the perfection of this rendering, he utters the wish to be able to retain the good looks of his youth while the picture were the one to deteriorate with age. But when Dorian discovers the painting cruelly altered and realizes that his wish has been fulfilled, he ponders changing his hedonistic approach.Dorian Gray's sharp social criticism has provoked audible controversy and protest upon the book's 1890 publication, and only years later was it to rise to classical status. Written in the style of a Greek tragedy, it is popularly interpreted as an analogy to Wilde's own tragic life.

There is a lot of philosophy packed into this short, fictitious account of several (three main characters) rich men who live life in a very nonchalant, yet formal environment. The characters are developed beautifully and invoke strong emotion toward each one. I found myself hating Henry, loving Basil and having strange mixed feelings for Dorian. While there are a lot of different views in regard to the overarching theme of the book, I believe (along with what seems like a majority) that the book is about morality. Man left to his own logic (shown in the character of Henry) is left only with death, and a meaningless existence. Dorian shows (I believe) the struggle of man in choosing a morality outside of human authority and logic. Dorian loses the struggle and of course it ends with his own death, which in reality is the logical conclusion to a life lived for one's own pleasure.It is interesting to note that Oscar Wilde was an accomplished painter himself, and got the idea for this book through an actual experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and the different themes that the book brought out."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First let me say that this is a very good story. I truly did enjoy reading this book and read it in a matter of days. I very much like the modern library version since it had nice print along with some good notes.Second, this is a deep story. The first 100 pages is about the philosophy of Lord Henry. I am not sure but I equate Lord Henry to the devil. It is either that or the devil is working through Lord Henry. Thoughout the book, it appears that Lord Henry knows what is going on with Dorian even though he was not around when certain events took place. One must read and then read again chapter two of this book. This is the chapter that reveals Lord Henry's philosophy. It is deep so I had to read that chapater twice.After the first 100 pages and it is clear what the picture represents, it becomes much more of a fast paced novel. However, chapter XI (11) is a difficult read. At the end of chapter X (10) Dorian is only 19 years old. At the beginning of chapter XII (12) he is now 38 years old. Chapter 11 basically gives you a history of his life in those 19 years. It seems as if it was added later to give this history. It did add a little to the story but not too much.I very much liked how the book ended but it seemed a little quick for me. However, this book did get me thinking and that is the point of the story.Given that this is a short book (only 254 pages) it is well worth the read. I recommend to anyone that has any type of interest in Gothic stories read this book. Even if you don't have an interest in Gothic stories, this is still a very good, quick read. You will not be disappointed that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created! The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a man who is obsessed by appearances. In this particular novel, he follows from the moment Dorian Gray sells his soul to the devil named beauty and youth, pleasure and enjoyment, to his death and he describes how someone who looks perfect, perfectly young, intelligent, brilliant, beautiful, moral and healthy is in fact nothing but a monster decaying in all possible immoral actions, deeds and ways just under the surface. It is a very strong criticism of victorian society that considers appearances as more important than real ethics and morality. He exposes the hypocrisy of such a society where a whole class of people are nothing but perambulating pictures of perfection hiding the mire and mud of crime and evil. We can also feel another dilemma in this book. Oscar Wilde's own dilemma who has to keep up appearances, the appearances of a well behaved, well educated and perfectly integrated man in this aristocratic society of his, and who yet lives a passion and a whole basket of desires and impulses that are absolutely rejected as crimes by victorian society. We know he will not be able to hide this deeper nature forever. But the book shows that no one can evade one's being exposed and rejected, condemned and sentenced to some punishment forever. There always comes a moment when one will be exposed and rejected. This shows how deeply Oscar Wilde must have suffered in his life. The painting is nothing but a mirror of the deeper self of Dorian Gray, but a mirror who will become one day his accuser.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a perfect example of why Speculative Fiction exists. To allow us to see deeper into the human soul than we could otherwise. Although this book was short, it took me a good week to read. I kept having to put it down after a chapter or two so I could read something else. Every word seemed to suck me in while not making me want to read another sentence at the same time. I guess the fact that I was also reading Milton's Paradise Lost at the same time as Dorian Gray doesn't help cut down the long internal debates Dorian Gray forced into my skull. Either way, this novel is a must read for anyone who has even thought that self examination is a part of what it means to be alive. But beware. This book packs a punch."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"As one of the first books I read on my Kindle, this one will always be a little special for me.

Five out of five stars! It's depressing that authors no longer write like this, where there's an amazing revelation or a great quote every couple of pages.

Wilde disadvantages this strength of the novel by exhaustively listing image after image while Dorian immerses himself in sensory experience. These passages read like mildly interesting dictionary entries.Overall, the pithy dialogue, imagery and wonderfully gothic story wins out and Grey entertains."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Initially heavy on witty dialogue and light on plot, but it gets there in the second half and is a clever story. You can't flick between chapters as you can with other Kindle publications."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Those poignant words spoken by the devil (Al Pacino) in The Devil's Advocate come to mind when talking about Dorian Gray. As a young, beautiful and conceited man, Dorian finds comfort in the company of Lord Henry, a morally corrupt aristocrat in Victorian England. Already teetering on the verge of chronic narcissism, Dorian is pushed off the edge into the abyss of eternal damnation by Henry's seductive, imaginative, and in the end, destructive speech.This classic, cautionary tale of the woes of youth has vanity at its core. Dorian, like all of us, is afraid of becoming irrelevant and unloved as a consequence of old age. Only in his case, he let his paranoia coupled with bad influence (Lord Henry) devour him. The story isn't unique in the sense that it happens everyday in the form of inconsequential lives consumed by gyms, beauty salons and drugs, chasing reluctant love and evasive youth.If you haven't read this classic in school, I highly recommend you do now. Lord Henry's lines, though evil, are very entertaining and almost too poetic. No man I know has a wit and sharp tongue like Lord Henry, but again, he is not a man. He is the devil's incarnate."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray. And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray. Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him. Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting? Is he ever! He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside. No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him! So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man. In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\" He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade. Dorian Gray is upset. His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty. If only it were the other way around...That is all I'll share in terms of plot. You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest. The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read. No wonder it is so popular! It is thought provoking from beginning to end. Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence. Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality. The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\" There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco. I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time. This novel could cover long hours of discussion. There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating. He is definitely the most interesting character in the book. This is my first time reading this book. I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago. Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know. Better late than never, I guess. And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do? You won't regret it. This is nineteenth century literature at its finest."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It's a story of Dorian Gray's journey through life. There's a great quote, which really is the theme for the entire book...\\"what does it profit a man if he gain the world and lose his own soul?\\" The pleasures and sins Dorian Gray enjoys in life are conveyed onto his portrait. Ultimately, his portrait ages and warps with each transgression that tarnishes his soul.Wilde has some great narratives and descriptions in the book. His writing style immersed me in the book. Very moving. I can truly see why it's a classic and wish I had read it sooner."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When asked to pick a favorite passage from a book, a lot of people will choose a vivid description. These people like authors to create beautiful scenes for them that they can forever conjure up in their heads. For this kind of reader, The Picture of Dorian Gray is probably a pleasure. Unfortunately, I am not this kind of reader.It is perhaps fitting that a book about beauty is defined by the images it creates rather than by the story or the dialogue. However, Oscar Wilde's mastery of dialogue is what makes his plays such a pleasure. For me, The Picture of Dorian Gray will never live up to Wilde's plays. This is not to say that the book is completely irredeemable; whenever Lord Henry is around, the book becomes better (but only insofar as it becomes more like a play, more focused on dialogue).You will love this book if you like descriptions, if you, unlike me, were able to read the chapters of The Grapes of Wrath that rambled about the land and that did not contribute to the plot. If you are like me, on the other hand, this book will be readable but not particularly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The storyline is very good and the theme is thought provoking. However, the great weakness for me are the characters in this piece. Character driven novels have characters that bring out some form of emotion from the reader. Be it fondness, admiration, sympathy for the hero or hate of the villain. I had no emotional interest in any of the characters in this book. I simply didn't care about any of their fates. Had Wilde developed the characters better this could have been a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If you have never read an Oscar Wilde book, read this one. It is easy to read, entertaining and throughly enjoyable. The language doesn't trip you up. I have enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have watched the old movie of this story and the newer one but had never read the book. This was excellent!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm being made to read this book for the third time (once in high school, twice in college), but I've always rather detested it. I've been told I need to \\"appreciate\\" it, and to that effect I've been reading a number of reviews (both positive and negative) of this book, trying to get a grip on *why* it's so highly regarded. The basic story is this: Dorian (a pretty twentysomething without much personality) makes a tacit (implied, not stated) bargain with a painter: his portrait will grow old and sick while he remains young and beautiful, no matter what he does to himself. And he does *plenty* to himself. 230 pages later, he grows a conscience and tries to destroy the painting, bringing age/sickness on himself and thus dying, unpunished for his \\"sins.\\" The Faust parallels are evident; unfortunately Dorian Gray is no Faust, and lord Henry (his \\"corrupter\\") is no Mephistopheles. The book is told as a series of banal witticisms and jests which sound good the first time you read them but get chewed up and spat out the second they're exposed to intelligent analysis. (Example from the preface: \\"All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex and vital. When critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless.\\")Synthesizing all the reviews, I get the sense that people who *really* like it--the \\"witty\\" verbiage, the Faust-lite storyline, and the moral heavy-handedness--like it because it shields them from the knowledge of their own inner emptiness. That sounds harsh; let me explain further. Since everything is stylized, pre-determined, and \\"fake,\\" there's no danger of self-discovery--no danger of discovering anything true. Oscar Wilde was deeply alienated against his own self (most homosexuals living at that time and in that society were), and so is not capable of feeling honestly, or expressing himself with any sincerity. Human nature (in the wider, not baser, sense) is \\"reduced\\"--that's the only word I can think of to describe it. Words are everything; appearances; everything. But words are empty sounds without the meanings attached to them (anyone who knows more than one language knows *that*), and appearances are superficial and deceiving, to trot out that old cliche. Human beings do not exist merely to think up verbal ripostes to personal attacks, and yet, here, this is all they do. Well, that and \\"sin.\\" But what a \\"sin\\" is is never really defined, and Dorian Gray doesn't really \\"sin\\" much (he seduces a girl, dumps her, and there's some implied homosexuality---*yawn*).\\"Dorian\\" is a morality tale, like the story of Jesus. It is something to tell children with no imagination, to warn them of the dangers of societal rejection--the dangers of being \\"different.\\" In a subtle way, it encourages conformity--and it *definitely* encourages repression. It is false to me in so many ways that I can hardly stomach it."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"nicely bound, beautifully embossed, priced especially well considering the binding and compared to other retailers such as Anthropologie; contains a sewn in ribbon bookmark which I love. Overall a good value and, of course this whole series make a book shelf look great."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A book that defies time! Yes, just a Dorian's body defied time, this book is equally as powerful a metaphor today as it was when it was first written. And with our plastic narcissistic society, perhaps its more powerful today then ever! Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel. Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so. You wont regret it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was lucky enough one day to be browsing in my local bookstore when I came across a copy of Dorian Gray for only a dollar brand new. I bought it and shelfed it for awhile until one day I picked it up and was subjected to its enchanting content. When reading about such characters such as Lord Henry for instance, you can only admit that you are being worked by the words and charms of a great novelist. It is sad that this is the only full novel Oscar Wilde ever did.(he did do a fair amount of plays, short stories, and essays however). After reading it, you will find yourself quoting it for a good while. And the plot device used is one of the better one's in all of fiction. I must say I plan on re-reading this one, the language, the wit, and the overall story that Wilde creates is very alluring and worthy of all the praise you might hear about it.Pick it up, read it, love it, and then recommend it to all of your friends."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After a few months of cajoling, my parents finally convinced me to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" by Oscar Wilde. Actually, part of what motivated me was not my parents' persistant pestering (and occasionally threatening), but the fact that Oscar Wilde is the favorite author of the lead singer from my favorite out-of-date band, The Smiths (Morrissey, yes).But anyway, to the book. When I started to read, I was in some kind of rapturous awe of Wilde's writing. It was so utterly beautiful, shaped and molded as finely as the face of the man Wilde so eloquently describes, Mr. Dorian Gray himself. It has the operatic and tragic occurence of an opera, or at least a play, but had The Picture of Dorain Gray been written as a play, it would have shirked the story of the wonderous use of the English language that so holds this novel up.Admittedly, it was a bit thick to wade through at times, but other than that, it's a ripping good ride, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about the evils and attraction of physical beauty."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The description of the condition of the book was spot on, I would even go as far as to say that it might have been overstated. the book was in great shape, basically new except for some highlighting, but seeing as im in college notes are very helpfull.

The book was overly descriptive in some instances that lead to me envisioning the story exactly as the author had seen it instead of leaving a lot of it up to my imagination. This is not a problem when reading a non-fiction book but when it comes to fiction, I feel it is a hindrance to my ability to enjoy the book.

It centers on a young dandy who is rather shallow and self-absorbed. He makes an off-handed statement about how he wishes he would never grow old and that a picture painted of him would suffer the ravages of age instead. This wish is granted and the story follows the events that unfold up to Dorian's realization that he has received everything he \\"wanted\\" and is now miserable. Two main acquaintances Basil and Lord Henry abound. Basil in some ways is a God figure in that he represents the good path and encourages Dorian to better himself and be an upright person. Lord Henry on the other hand is more of a Beelzebub. He encourages Dorian to debase himself, follow his whims and not concern himself with the wreckage he leaves in his wake. One of the two advisors wins out as the story proceeds and it ends in the only way it could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I listened to the audio version, which was a delight. This classic impresses upon the reader the importance of Christ's rhetorical question: what does it profit a man to gain the whole word but lose his soul?

Whats missing is an attitude of living life god-like, but there's much more than meets the eye and this book is a great read on the decay of royal India playing out in a relatively minor kingdom somewhere in Eastern India.The book is narrated beautifully , Harper Lee style through the eyes of a 13 year old who along with her mother is visiting her maternal grandparents in the eastern kingdom of Sirikot. The murder of a \\"Patidar\\" (a person with royal blood, but living the life of a commoner) reveals layers of court intrigue- A son plotting for his powerful father's demise , a daughter-in-law in league with communists , another secretly harboring intentions of becoming queen. Its a great commentary on how practices which we would abhor now were readily acceptable - concubinage, Sati, untouchability. Its a sad commentary on how so many royals - a lot of whom actually were fair minded found themselves lost in an Independent India.The backdrop of the murder lends an excellent aura to the story. The 13 year old plays detective and there are innumerable seemingly shocking hypotheses that she purports, each seemingly possible in those troubled times. The final denouement has a sense of justice being done, but you just can't help feeling sad for what befalls the kingdom in the years of Indian Independence.The story is extremely rich in detail and the author does a remarkable job of diving into the skin of each of the characters. While I read the final pages , I couldn't help but feel that some of this may have actually occurred. A great read .."},{"Title":"Ideas","review":"I am surprised that there have been no reviews for this splendid book.

It is not my intention to write a Cliff's notes review regarding the content of this book, but the modern reader will find that Husserl's ideas makes points that expand on Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON. Ideas refers to transcendental phenomenonlgy, a school of thought that placeshuman experience into a realm of personal understanding attained through a series of conceptual reductions. A trained phenomenologist (sic.) should be able to reduce objects of experience to their fundamental concepts, then remove these concepts to understand the essential features of human experience. This &quot;PHENOMENOLOGICAL REDUCTION&quot; is applicable to all phenomena, and when applied properly this technique isolates human experience to certain core concepts that are universal to all phenomena irregardless of space and time. I believe that Husserl's Ideas is an invaluble contribution to modern psychology, and should be required reading for all students in a liberal arts program."},{"Title":"How to Get Over that Bitch and Grow Balls They Can't Resist","review":"I was shocked at the directness of this book.

Her bravery as a teenager is the powerful foundation of her ability to survive, endure and thrive. I have been touched by her words and in her memoir Life Inside I learned a great deal about this courageous young woman. I am certain that by bearing her soul to me and to everyone who read this book, I was able to feel her strength and power.Certainly there are many who have either been misdiagnosed or who have been mistreated while being wards of a state or as an inpatient on a psyche ward. But those stories are not always told or known. Mindy's is the voice for all of these souls. Her goals are pure and her intentions honorable by telling her story and showing me and her fans and readers of Life Inside how her strength and endurance and understanding can have a profound impact on so many lives.Mindy is an alum of SUNY Empire State College where I am a matriculated student, and her kindness has been extended to me when her response to a letter from me has continued to encourage me to complete my own memoir Good Self/Bad Self: The Individuation of My Selves. I hope that my project is soon available on Amazon and elsewhere and I invite readers of Mindy's book to let me share my story with them, as well.I am confident that Mindy Lewis would not see herself or her work as being heroic but to me and I know to many, her story illustrates her hero-like status and it is my strongest recommendation that her memoir be shared with as many readers as possible.F.

The vivid, intimate writing transported me completely.Mindy Lewis' memoir paints a clear picture of everyday life on the fifth-floor ward of the NY State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. Life Inside also dramatizes a sensitive teenage girl's coming of age during the turbulent 1960s. The second half of the memoir, \\"Life After,\\" discusses the particular challenges of adjusting to life outside, after twenty-eight months of hospitalization.Throughout Life Inside, Mindy Lewis faces painful memories openly and honestly, and I admire her courage. She is a strong, hopeful and determined individual, and her memoir offers much inspiration. It also raises important questions about the nature of human emotions and the dangers of unchecked institutional authority. Ultimately, Life Inside celebrates the healing powers of art, music and literature, of self-reflection and friendship."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"This is a fascinating, beautifully written memoir about a grave personal injustice, but it also sheds light on societal attitudes toward non-conformity, and is a window into the sixties and the struggles which were prevalent at that time."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"It was the 60's. Political and social upheaval uprooted even the most grounded of families. Mindy Lewis had just transferred to a prestigious art school but due to her difficulty and impaired ability to cope with her parents' separation, she skips class, experiments with drugs, and tries to substitute the love she felt was absent at home with flirtation with other boys. Her mother could no longer tolerate this behavior and had her court remanded to New York State Psychiatric Institute.In the 60's, prior to deinstitutionalization, State hospitals were at their highest populations. The length of stay 40 years ago is not the same as it is today. Now in private hospitals insurance closely monitors expenses, aiming for quick stabilization and medication management, but in the 60's if you were placed in a state hospital involuntarily you gave them a continuous source of income without the worry of insurance companies. If you didn't show great improvements, they had every reason to throw out the key.During her stay at NYSPI she was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic, as schizophrenia was a very common diagnosis. She was a guinea pig for the latest neuroleptics and the latest resident psychiatrists. Inside she lashes out and becomes defiant, manages to escalate to promiscuity with the other male patients, and made suicide gestures because she is faced with the choice of complying with the rules and she might eventually go home to the mother who is suffocating her or stay inside but maintain some semblance of freedom until she is 18.Mindy Lewis writes the way we process, as if our internal dialogue was being documented on paper. She shares what it's like to become institutionalized, then to recover. Life Inside chronicles Mindy Lewis' friendships and tragedies and the consequences of 28 months in a state hospital."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"Mindy Lewis cuts to the quick with chillingly direct no-nonsense descriptions of an adolescent finely tuned to the chaos of her day.A must-read."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"mindy lewis is absolutely amazing. i was particular hooked on the first part of the book (there are 2 parts) which tells of her 'life inside' mental hospitals. completely spine chilling and a definite must read."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"Mindy Lewis was hospitalized in a teaching hospital for mentally ill adolescents and young adults, from the time she was 15 3/4 until she was a little past 18. This \\"memoir\\" describes her family situation, her friends and the staff in the hospital, and her nutty behavior at times (drinks silicone grout on the spur of the moment). Ms. Lewis blames everyone but herself for being put in the hospital. Prior to being admitted, she refused to go to school, took drugs, was promiscuous, and her mother could not control her. Her parents were divorced. Her mom worked and wanted a clean house. Her stepfather walked around in his undershorts. All of this is pretty \\"normal\\", she finds out, for teens in the 60's. Once Ms. Lewis is finally released, she goes through years and years of anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, refusing to take any prescribed drugs for these sometimes debilitating conditions. Years later, she seems to have finished going through her phases. She tries to call a few psychiatrists on the carpet about wasting two years of her life in the hospital. But they don't seem to have too much remorse.Ms. Lewis has a way with prose, but the book is extremely disorganized and confusing. She goes back and forth without letting the reader know that's what she's doing (in the end she justifies this by saying it was necessary for the book to \\"flow\\"). Her best friend Marjee, somehow goes from age 13 to 17 (but most of the time she's age 13), while Ms Lewis goes from almost 16 to 18 in the same exact time period. She also somehow manages to graduate from high school by only taking an English class - and that only when she feels like it. I also don't buy the case notes of the staff as being genuine. Another difficult story to believe was when she was in her twenties and had taken two jobs which started the same day, thinking she would considerately decide which one she wanted, on the morning she was to begin. She has an anxiety attack in the subway, and when she gets off the police immediately cuff her, saying they have received \\"several calls\\" about her (this would be in the 1970's). The cops take her to Bellevue, but she talks her way out of that. And where did she get the photo of her topless self on the cover? Did staff or another patient take it?I'm sorry this happened to Ms. Lewis, but I guess I've just read about adolescents who've had it a lot worse. I've even known people who been through much worse. So Ms. Lewis's constant whining and feeling sorry for herself doesn't grab me and make me go \\"Wow - this is amazing, what this woman has gone through.\\" It probably would have helped the book if she had included some of her much talked-about artwork, as well as photographs of her family."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"For some reason I am very curious about the care of the metally ill in the 1960's. If Mindy was sent away in the 1970's up unitl today she would have been in a group home and not treated so much as a mental patient. I can relate to how she felt the need to hide her illness from others. I love the line \\"...sitting on an egg waiting for it to hacth\\" and how it relates to my life and dealing with my illness. It does bounce back and forth alot but if you concentrate enough it all fits. I didn't like the beginning of the book because it seemed too slow but it moves along afterwards."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"The story of Mindy Lewis' experience in a mental ward. Rugged: She did not have an easy time of it, and her story made me wonder how she survived.Nonetheless, she did a good job of bringing this to life. Very well written, and with a mature, factual point of view. I felt this was well worth reading simply to learn about the subject, one I've experienced onlyfrom the outside (with a family member on the inside).I learned much from Life Inside. [The Quiet Room was another book, along similar lines, that was also excellent. And, certainly, The Bell Jar.]"},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"The 60's are gone, long gone..... We have all moved on, hopefully... Apparently some of us have not.... I was sorry to have wasted all that time reading what turned out to be a very typical, and not particularly entertaining, story of teenage angst."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"This is the rare book that sends chills up the spine, tears down your face, and on multiple occasions make you laugh aloud. More importantly, this book made me pause and think deeply about the issues Lewis raises regarding the lines between sanity and insanity, the uses and misuses of various therapies and medications by the psychiatric community, and the long-term implications of a scarred adolescence. The author is not only an excellent writer, she is an incredibly brave person to have written such a book. Blows away Susanna Kaysen's &quot;Girl, Interrrupted&quot; with its vivid portrayal of daily life inside a mental institution and its equally important depiction of what happens once you escape such a place (something Kaysen's book did not cover). Lewis's self-portayal is honest and full, her characters are vividly drawn, and you really get a sense of what drove her mother, her doctors, her attendents, her feloow inmates, and herself to behave the way they did -- creating a difficult situation and then enduring it. I'm giving this book to all my friends -- even those who don't normally read memoirs -- because Lewis' book is so much more than that."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"I'm a memoir junkie, and this is one of the most rewarding, carefully written memoirs I have ever read. Lewis insightfully describes each stage of her rich transition from searingly painful adolescence to self-actualized adulthood. I marvel at her narrative's double-voice: she accurately conveys both adolescent self-doubt and emotionally-attuned adult wisdom.Readers who will particularly appreciate this book include lovers of well-wrought prose, and people who feel impaired by something in their past, and cautiously optimistic about their chances of getting over it and/or growing from it."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"This remarkable work describes the harrowing, yet in some ways winsome experience of a remarkable child of the 60s raised in the home of divorced parents and forever rebelling against her 'perfect mother.' At the outset, Mindy is on her way to the institution that is to be her home for 2 1/2 years and most of this memoir is devoted to those times - a life inside with the others inside, those that are patients, those that are employees, and those that are the professionals. Mindy has gone through her medical records of those days and peppered herhistorical descriptions with the views of her psychiatrists as outlined in those records. The life inside is intimately and thoroughly described and one feels not only the horror, the bondings, and the feeling of abandonment, but the eventual resignation. Mindy will come to terms with her issues, her parents and herself as described in the life outside that is the book's second portion. She comes to see 'the other side'. The memoir is written with remarkable sensitivity and emotional candor."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"I think there is a place in literature for a story like Ms. Lewis tells. I thank goodness that for all the mysteries that surround mental illness still, we have come very far from where we were in the '60s.Ms. Lewis does not really address the 'why' - why she was hospitalized in the first place. To hear her tell it, she was just a little rambunctious (and so were all her hospitalized peers). I have to believe that it was much worse than she lets on. Even so, I have a bit of a hard time feeling bad for her when she is hospitalized, because as badly as she wanted out, she refused to toe the line and do what it took to be released. She was constantly causing trouble and getting herself restricted, and she wasn't a stupid, innocent girl by any stretch of the imagination, and undoubtedly this obstinate behavior caused her very lengthy stay.Ms. Lewis critiques her adult behavior with a fine-toothed comb, and speculates how her adult choices are affected by her hospitalization, and by her upbringing.I really felt for her mother, who had the weight of the world on her single-parent shoulders. Ms. Lewis characterizes her as extremely dysfunctional, and blames most of her problems on her.Certainly she was not schizophrenic as she was diagnosed in the hospital, but from her many lengthy descriptions, I saw evidence of possible bi-polar disorder. Unfortunately it seems like she never explored an alternative diagnosis that might have been treated successfully."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"In this insightful and beautifully-written memoir, Mindy Lewis lets us in on her innermost feelings and thoughts while an adolescent inpatient in a psychiatric hospital in the 1960's--and afterward. She candidly recounts her experiences regarding her family, her problems, and what life was like inside a ward at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. A panorama of patients is displayed in a crisp, no-nonsense style, with beautiful imagery and insights delicately woven throughout. The book is extremely well-constructed. Surely anyone under mental or emotional duress will find \\"Life Inside\\" enlightening--let alone encouraging and helpful. And for those somewhat more balanced, it offers much drama and insight too. Mindy Lewis opens her heart and mind as rarely shown and this book surely fills a gap in accounts of those who were \\"there\\" and back. All in all, this warm and poignant recollection is a testament to Mindy Lewis' unwavering search for meaning, truth and understanding, and her coming to terms; it is a bulwark of hope and perhaps redemption. Read it: you'll be touched for today and many tomorrows."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"In this heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking account, Mindy Lewis describes her life journey, framed by her experiences as a teenage patient in a mental ward. Her story is honest and open. As a reader, I could identify with her pain and her experience, even though it is quite different from my own. Many of the feelings she describes are universal, which leads me to question society and its definition of insanity. Throughout her account, Mindy feels \\"different\\" and \\"individualistic\\", most likely as a result of her creativity and ability to visualize and approach life in a less constrained manner. As someone who does not have a similar life experience, I can still relate to those feelings.The book is extremely well-written and vivid, with great attention to physical and emotional detail. The story moves quickly (over 30 years in 350 pages), with its main focus how the 27-months in the institution affected Mindy's life. However, the book also details Mindy's journey to understand her life, the world around her, her family, and how to create meaning from experience, going beyond &quot;life inside&quot;.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"Life Inside has become one of my favorite books.The story of Mindy Lewis, an almost typical teenager of the late sixties in a culture that much of society didn't know how to deal with. (Many \\"normal\\" teenagers found themselves in psych wards then as they do now.) Experimenting with drugs and boys and throwing much caution to the wind forced her mother to make a difficult decision in sending her to P.I.The details used to paint a bleak picture of her two and a half years inside were painful and beautiful at the same time. Mindy is joined by a cast of other teenagers like herself, trapped in a world that they can only escape within themselves. She and the other youths are all in the same boat, \\"Am I sane or insane?\\"The memoir doesn't end there on the inside but also life outside. Mindy's self-doubt about her mother and her family and a lot of reflections on what landed her at a psych hospital in the first place. The luncheon that she has with her mother where they finally have an open dialouge about her mother's decision to send her there is heartwenching. We know Mindy's side. Upon hearing her mother's side you really sympathise and wonder what else could she have done?A loving package of memoir, storytelling, and period piece."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"The story is about a young girl committed to a mental institution in the late 1960's for truancy, using drugs and being mean tempered toward her mother. She spends months in the institution which would never happen now. She writes honestly about her feelings, which can be hard to take, but keep in mind she is an adolescent female being held against her will in a place few of us could stomach. If you are interested in what life was like in institutions for the mentally ill before de-institutionalization, you would be interested in this book."},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"This memoir is a rare gem. Told with complete honesty, lyrical description, and striking imagery, it grabbed me from the first page and never let go. I was fascinated to learn about the mental health system in the 60s and 70s, and how many (though, tragically, not all) were able to persevere after being released from the mental hospital. Mindy has a unique story to tell, and the family story that preceded her being institutionalized was equally compelling. This author is a true talent, and one that I'll certainly be looking out for!"},{"Title":"Life Inside","review":"I am intrigued by old hospitals and institutions and bought this book based on the author's stay in such a place. About two-thirds through the book, the location shifted to life on the outside. Now yes, this is all in all a good thing for our character, but up my alley. I understand why, but much of the sexual content was a little too graphic for me."},{"Title":"Lectures on Jung's Typology (Seminar Series)","review":"If one has \\"read a little\\" of Jung's typology but has not ventured yet, or has ventured only partially, into Jung's seminal work Psychological Types, this book by von Franz and Hillman is a very good tutorial to get some of the concepts organized in ones head a little better. The book is divided into two sections. Both sections are transcripts of lectures given at the Jungian institute in Zurich. The first section is by von Franz and covers the Inferior Function. Hillman's half covers the Feeling Function. Although von Franz's section is focused on the development of the psychological type that is one's weaker type (ie: \\"inferior\\"), her exposition does cover all of the types. Each of von Franz's lectures is followed by a question and answer section as recorded during the seminars (Hillman's are not). One can say only that von Franz is masterful in her explanations. If one has read any of Jung's own seminars from the 1920's and 30's, von Franz's echo these here. Without overstating it, von Franz truly was closest to Jung in depth of understanding and ability at expression, perhaps better in the latter regard. She was primarilty a \\"thinking\\" type and it shows in her thoroughly thought out and well presented arguments. Hillman is another matter. Perhaps it is his disadvantage that his text follows von Franz's, but he does not rise to the same level, at least not for me. He must be a feeling-type as his arguments undulate choppily, taking a sideroad here, a back alley there, a forward lob somewhere else. He uses almost no examples, preferring to \\"define\\" as he goes along and seems to expect the reader to nod in agreement. Too much patience is expected of one, I'm afraid, and I didn't finish reading his part. Sorry. Von Franz' section is certainly worth the price alone, however. But feeling-types may prefer Hillman."},{"Title":"Lectures on Jung's Typology (Seminar Series)","review":"Marie-Louise von Franz describes very clearly and with her usual sense of humour the different psyhcological types according to C.

Short of reading Jung himself, it is the best book I have come across on the subject."},{"Title":"Lectures on Jung's Typology (Seminar Series)","review":"I have read much over the years of Jung's typology and the Myers-Briggs typology. Yet, this set of lectures kept me spellbound in almost every paragraph, particularly Hillman's lectures on the feeling function. When I consider that these lectures were given relatively early in his career and before 1971 I am all the more impressed. I have not read anything that describes the feeling function in such depth and clarity. My perseptive is quite adjusted. This is a consciousness raising book and not a self help book."},{"Title":"Lectures on Jung's Typology (Seminar Series)","review":"P.111 statement was why this book was recommended for my gaining more empathy with my 100 year old mother.Finishing,celebrated watching ILM movie \\"Pirates of Caribean: into darker waters\\" had the symbology of devouring mermaids whose identity was ignored. Maybe providence was telling me I was on right path with ILM imprimatur.I felt there was much beyond what Hillman understood of the ignored anima having taken excruciating notes on Jung's writing on the anima while Jung was still scared of it. Something Hillman wrote about anima complex had really disturbed me within about ten pages before finishing and I dug up that the Jung community found himdifficient in fearing the anima. Anima, as I understand is woman in shadow of a man and spirit guide into darker waters and the integration healing of fulfilled romance.Maybe I understand what I have yet to understand with this introduction."},{"Title":"Life on Another Planet","review":"This story is not really about life on another planet, but on how the idea of life (Once it's confirmed and not just a vague idea) on another planet will affect our global society. Specifically it seems to focus on those elements which will attempt to exploit the news. From the third world dictator who secedes from the planet, to the Heaven's Gate style cultist who sees a quick buck to be made. This books gives some all too human reactions to what might happen if/when such news breaks on the world. Remember this is all happening before an alien is actually seen. It is about the psychological impact of the news, not lasers and spaceships."},{"Title":"Life on Another Planet","review":"From the genius mind of Will Eisner comes what could/will actually happen when another life-form contacts Earth.

A must for all sci-fi lovers, as well as comic lovers."},{"Title":"Life on Another Planet","review":"A signal comes in from space. Are we alone?

There are spelling mistakes (Bernard, Barnard) and basic terminology mistakes (year, light-year) BUT his human interactions are amazing, and his panel breakdowns are the best (at least most complex) out of any his stuff that I've seen. (I haven't had the opportunity to read many of his later Spirit stories.) His best work is to be found elsewhere (check out his brand-new full-length hardcover book from DC for a trip), but this book is certainly good.

I didn't like the style and structure of this book. I got the sense that this book was just another rush publication with a group of programmers getting together, assigning chapters with desired content and then got down to pulling and writing code.WROX needs to do a better job of controlling quality and up front planning for their books. Sorry, but this book shows none of that. The design of the existing site was mostly crammed into a single chapter. A decent database diagram was not included and no UML or other diagrams were presented so we could easily understand the Object architecture. Instead, the documentation was simply a straight lift from sql server table descriptions. I found myself drawing my own diagrams as I went through the book. An architect's perspective was desparately needed in this first chapter.I won't be buying any more WROX books if things don't improve by enforcing good technical writing standards for their publications."},{"Title":"Building an ASP.NET Intranet","review":"Having installed and made a few (trivial) changes to the IBuySpy portal application, I decided to get this book in order to make sure that I didn't 'miss any tricks'.The book doesn't disappoint. It's a good overview of the application with detailed instructions on the installation process and operational level usage of the product.A useful discussion of the portal architecture is followed by detailed discussions of the underlying concepts of security, specific modules, content and document management.Finally, there is an analysis of a new module - Human resources management, in which all the issues that you would normally have to deal with in a real-world development are met.The only real disappointment was that the download code listed in the book was not yet available from Wrox.com - no doubt that will be resolved in short order.There are more than a thousand instances of the IBuySpy portal already on the web, with many hundreds more in the making. This book is an ideal introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Building an ASP.NET Intranet","review":"This is the book I have been waiting for! Since last summer, when ASP.NET was (somewhat) introduced and the best practices app IBuySpy was released, I and others have awaited a tome that would walk us through the process of building an ASP.NET intranet step-by-step and this book is it.It starts off by highlighting what is important to have in an intranet but it quickly gets down to the nitty-gritty of (1) dissecting IBuySpy and (2) showing how to customize and extend the IBS application to a full fledged intranet portal. Their explanations are well written and concise and there were a number of topics that I was able to finally understand.This book is not exactly for newbies, but for the person that has gotten their feet wet with ASP.NET and wants to get his or her hands dirty with a serious project.I only have one negative point about this book and it is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. No CD and No online code.I do not know about the rest of you, but I would have prefered to spend an extra 5-10 dollars not to have to type all of this code over again. Additionally, the authors use an abstracted database class in all of their code that is supposed to be downloadable from the WROX website, but, at this time, is not available, which was very frustrating. The upside is, I ended up re-writing it myself, so I actually ended up learning more!All in all, a good book and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Building an ASP.NET Intranet","review":"I bought this book in hopes of using it to design a good intranet portal for our company. The book is written poorly and doesn't really help you implement the modules discussed in the book. I have tried countless times to implement what was discussed in the book but the code never works, I am using the code which was downloaded from the publisher's website so it should work according to their instructions. Another downside is the author no longer supports the code in the book so if problems happens you are on your own, I would think a publisher would support their own code and be able to answer questions about it. Needless to say I am extremely disappointed with the book, I had high hopes for it but it just didn't work the way it should have."},{"Title":"Building an ASP.NET Intranet","review":"I bought this book because I have been thrust into the Intranet development world, and I really don't have a lot of experience building multi-functional web pages. I bought this book to really help me understand the IBuySpy portal, and I have used it to customize that package for a couple of different web sites now.The Good:The book is very good at explaining the various components of the IBuySpy Portal. It's a lot like a tourist map; highlighting certain pieces (while complete overlooking other aspects).The Bad:As others have noted, this book doesn't go deep into explaining ASP.NET, or how to use classes in the .NET architecture. It merely allows you to copy a lot of code, cross your fingers, and see something work.The Ugly:As with most &quot;best-of-breed&quot; solutions from Microsoft, stuff breaks. While this particular manual does point out why some stuff doesn't work as well as intended, it doesn't go into a lot of detail (and don't expect it to catch everything).In Sum: Buy this book if you have a need to get an intranet up and running quickly, and want to impress your non-developer friends.

I guess the authors sorted it out since those previous reviews."},{"Title":"Building an ASP.NET Intranet","review":"[...]I picked this book up about three years to late, as it is entirely written about the original IBuySpy Portal framework, and I am an avid DotNetNuke module developer. The author presents numerous great examples of custom module development for IBuySpy, including a simple library application, extended discussions module, a complex Human Resources module, and a great Document Management System. Keep in mind IBuySpy is the forerunner to DotNetNuke, and all of the modules outlined in the book port nicely to the newer architecture, as they leverage many of the features moved forward into DotNetNuke, like user account integration, portal security, and more.As I worked through configuring the various samples provided with the book, I got to set up & play with the original IBuySpy Portal framework after nearly three years of playing with it for the for the first time. When it was first released, it very intimidating in some of it's implementation details, although it didn't appear as sophisticated in it's business architecture, unlike the original Reports, Time Tracking, & Issue Tracking kits.The book provides one of the best guides I have read to everything IBuySpy. The second time looking at IBuySpy portal, I was more able to appreciate the great concepts introduced in it, and I was at times amazed at how simple the IBuySpy Portal is when compared to the latest version of DotNetNuke. With the Introduction of the DotNetNuke Data Access Layer (DAL) in version 2.x, DotNetNuke was able to encapsulate all of the sophistication, and more, of the business layer found in the Time Tracking/Reports starter kits, at which point I was hooked.I found the Document Management System described in Chapter 9 sophisticated enough that I believed it was worth the effort to convert it to a modern DotNetNuke module. The module is very well designed and documented in the book, so I decided on an uneventful Sunday afternoon to start converting it. Approximately 40 hours of development later, I have completed converting the module to DotNetNuke 2.1.2 (DotNetNuke 3.0.9 was released two days before the writing of this review)."},{"Title":"Building an ASP.NET Intranet","review":"In order to use this book effectively, you really need a good understanding of SQL and SQL stored procedures. The book isn't for SQL Beginners. The tables come from WROX without the identities being set, so you will need to know how to do that. The book also requires a good understanding of stored procedures, you will need to know how to fix the stored procedure if it isn't working correctly. The easy way to work with the stored procedures and all of the changes the WROX programmers made to IBUYSPY is to load their backup database onto your server using a different database name, then import the tables and stored procedures you need into your Portal database. There are some problems with the code that requires revising the name spaces and assembly references to get them to work with the ASPNET Portal, but once modified the code does work well for the most part. I really wish the WROX programmers had spent more time on the RTF piece. I eventually replaced the RTF functionality with someone else's software, but I have to admit that I learned alot about ASP.NET controls by examining the WROX RTF code. The document management piece is worth the price of the book. The documentation really is not very good but if you study the code, you'll learn alot.

US air crews which were forced to land on Soviet territory were supposed to be interned for the duration of the war, but the Soviets helped to secretly get the US crews back into the war effort against Japan. Otis Hays shows how the US, through diplomatic negotiations which played on Stalin's fear of war with Japan, convinced him to assist the interned aircrews in making their \\"escape\\" from Soviet territory.Stalin was terrified of being drawn into the war with Japan, which would have necessitated opening a second front in the Soviet Far East. US diplomats were able to convince him that the interned crews, which comprised 291 men, were absolutely essential to the war effort. There was no time to adequately train new crews, and a growing shortage of suitable candidates made this an untenable option.If Stalin was to help, the mission had to be kept secret from Japanese intelligence services, or the USSR could be drawn into the war with Japan. Stalin directed the NKVD (predecessor to the KGB) to arrange four different \\"escapes.\\" The escapes were arranged and conducted in the utmost secrecy, and many key players never knew the complete truth.US diplomatic message traffic made formal complaints about the conditions in which the airmen were being held in Siberia, and demanded that changes be made for health reasons. The USSR agreed to move the men to camps in Central Asia, where the warmer climate would be more comfortable. The men were moved through a series of gulag camps until they reached Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan, and were helped by the NKVD in their escape across the border into Iran, where they were met by US personnel.While other authors have examined the US/Soviet cooperation in World War II, most have focused on the Lend/Lease program and the transfer of US materiel and food through ports in the Far East. Home From Siberia is unique in that it traces the fates of air crews through their ordeals in the gulag to their eventual release. Hays' research gives a view of what life was like in the Soviet Union, and illustrates the kindness and generosity shown to the internees by many Soviet citizens, despite the harsh living conditions. It also shows that the gulag camp system was well-established, and that the Soviets were able to shuttle the captured Americans around in complete secrecy, which is of particular interest to researchers investigating the presence of Americans in the camps following World War II. A precedent was set, and the Soviets saw that they could conduct such operations with relative ease.The alleged presence of American soldiers from Korea, Vietnam and the Cold War in the gulag is a subject that is being actively investigated by many agencies, both government and private. Hays' research serves as an important base document in the analysis, and shows that the Soviets were quite capable of conducting such operations.Home From Siberia's strength is the thoroughness in which the American fliers are chronicled. Hays shows the fates of each crew member, using maps, pictures and interviews with the survivors to paint a picture in a clear and fascinating manner. His work fills in a historical gap, and covers previously uncharted ground. The book's weakness is the lack of foreign sources. Hays uses mostly US sources, and should consider writing an updated edition now that many Soviet documents have been declassified and access to archives is more open. An analysis of Japanese diplomatic and intelligence documents would be an important addition as well, because they may indicate how successful the Soviets were in maintaining the secrecy of the operation. Home From Siberia is an important work, and a welcome addition to the history of World War II."},{"Title":"Home From Siberia: The Secret Odysseys of Interned American Airmen in World War II (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"This might not be a review, 'persay', but my thoughts, which are biased, because my brother was one of the internees.

My only improvement would be to reorganize a bit - for example, the attractions and restaurants are grouped by area of the city, but hotel descriptions are grouped by price.

Riddle of the Bones was such a book for me. With &quot;Bones,&quot; author Roger Downey has given us a significant piece of work. And like one of the archeological treasures he describes in his book, it is a real find. This is a book that will withstand the test of time--maybe not geologic time, but regular time.What's remarkable about this book is that it takes on the challenge of telling the story of humankind's long and controversial search for its origins while at the same time chronicling the tangled story of Kennewick Man, with all of its legal maneuvering, back-stabbing, mumbo-jumbo science, and media saturation.This book is good enough to launch a few careers, because it provides a valuable lesson in the scientific disciplines seeking to answer the multitude of questions regarding human origin. To read this book is to gain an understanding of how &quot;what came before&quot; links with the modern-day Kennewick case. You will also learn about hard science from reading this book--about the latest advances in radiocarbon-dating, blood group typing, statistical analysis, molecular biology, genetic drift, and the like. In an easy style, the author explains the latest scientific breakthroughs in studies of early humans, and keeps this information in context with the Kennewick Man case.Throughout the book, interspersed with the K-Man story, the author relates &quot;case histories&quot; of previous significant archeological finds in the Americas--from the finds of the Folsom and Clovis peoples in New Mexico to the flooded-out Marmes remains along the Palouse River in Washington state. In another case, he explains how the Monte Verde dig in Chile, South America, is revolutionizing much of today's thinking on the arrival of the first peoples on this continent. The author's first-hand descriptions of his visits to several of these sites not only make for fascinating reading, they help us understand why Kennewick Man has become such a sensational story in relation to the other finds. For example, had the Kennewick Man remains been handled in the same manner as those from the Buhl site in Idaho--that is, returned to the indigenous Indian tribes in accordance with federal law, then, in all likelihood, the sensational story of Kennewick Man would have never happened.And, oh, what a cast of characters, living and dead, the author parades before us in this book-Indians, reporters, rogue scientists, mainstream scientists, politicians, lawyers, judges, feds, Asatrus warriors (Viking wannabes), civilians-on and on they have been drawn into the K-Man case. From the very beginning they've been stonewalling, bickering, sensationalizing, breaking the law, and otherwise turning the case upside down. Don't look too hard for hero figures in this book, for they are hard to find.Most certainly, the best things to come out of the Kennewick Man case to this point is this book. The author tackles the tough issues and makes his arguments in convincing fashion, backing his contentions with sound, well-substantiated facts, not dogma. He's helped convince me that Kennewick Man deserves to be back in the earth, not stuck away in some moldy museum in Seattle. White Man's law may have prevailed over Indian law to this point. But the story of Kennewick Man is a long way from over--and many people believe, myself included, that &quot;The Ancient One&quot; will have the last laugh in the end.As a great fan of this book, I highly recommend it. It is top-notch reading. I hope that Roger Downey writes the final chapter of the Kennewick Man story, when it finally unfolds. I will be among the first to read it."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"I read this book because I knew Mr. Downey's writing through his work as a critic, journalist and playwright, not because of any special interest in or knowledge of archeology. What a delight to find a book about a totally alien subject that is such a fine and informative read! The same strengths that inform Downey's arts journalism bring what could be an arcane subject to vibrant life. In THE RIDDLE OF THE BONES, he tells a compelling story complete with rich characters, an eye for the offbeat detail, provocative ideas and a plot that is constructed like a thriller. I have no idea what feathers he's ruffled in the apparently insular world of archeology (and the comic opera world of &quot;Asutru&quot;!), but he's written a concise book that is a satisfying and compelling look at &quot;the bones&quot; for the person with little previous knowledge of the subject. If you've wondered about all the fuss over Kennewick Man, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"Downey's review of the Kennewick Man mess is a refreshingly balanced treatment of the difficult issues involved. Properly, it surveys not just the sins of the past, but the promise of present and future archaeological methods and paradigms. The definitive Kennewick book has not yet been written, but this is a good start."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"After years of reading misinformation and misleading statements in the press accounts regarding Kennewick Man, finally someone has written the true account. The author interviewed Dr. Chatters, Mr. Van Pelt, as well as other characters in the story and professionals in the field. He read the court transcripts. He pursued the truth when conflicting statements were made. What I like best is his style of writing, like a mystery novel. He also does well developing the characters. And, he does more than tell the Kennewick Man story, he puts it in context with Clovis, Folsom, and physical anthropology. This is a real winner."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"I generally reserve one stars for books I can't finish, but it was tempting to give this only one. This book is poorly documented and the author is so obviously biased that I am unwilling to accept his unsupported word, and most of his words are unsupported. I would recommend this only to people who want to read absolutely everything written on the Kennewick controversy. Otherwise, there are plenty of better books. David Hurst Thomas' superb and profoundSkull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, and the Battle for Native American Identityis much better than this, especially for the social/historical/political aspects that are its main focus. It has at least as much information about theories of populating the Americas as well. One might also read Elaine Dewar'sBones: Discovering the First Americans, which is seriously flawed, but still much better than this. She focuses more on various theories and archaeological evidence.I have read Chatters' book,Ancient Encounters: Kennewick Man and the First Americansand Jeff Benedict's admiring account of Douglas Owsley,No Bone Unturned: The Adventures of a Top Smithsonian Forensic Scientist and the Legal Battle for America's Oldest Skeletons, and I specifically wanted a book to present the other side. Although Downey opposes both men, he utterly fails to articulate a coherent case for the opposite position. His rather random snipings at the plaintiffs' case don't qualify as a meaningful rebuttal. He relies on innuendo, broad generalizations and the implication that any right thinking person will agree with him, presumably even before opening the book. He doesn't appear to want to waste time convincing wrong-thinking people. He seems to regard it as a shocking abuse of the system that people who disagree with him use the usual venues of the courts, the press and the legislature to present their case. This reminds me of the many people I know of, from arch conservative to knee-jerk liberal who are loud in their praise of freedom of speech, until someone says something that they don't like.Consider his contrasting treatment of Jeff Van Pelt of the Umatilla and James Chatters (the first anthropologist to examine the bones). Van Pelt presents his triumph over adversity mostly in the first person (I presume that the occasional third person insertions are paraphrases, although Downey doesn't tell us). There are no questions, factchecking or comments from Downey. Fine, as far as it goes, but Chatters' life is recounted in the third person, carefully written to present him as a loser, with no source for most of the facts. Maybe Chatters is a loser, but I wouldn't take Downey's very biased word for it.Downey presents disingenuous arguments that the Kennewick bones are insignificant or that all conflict is the result of Chatters' bungling. First he argues that there are at least a half dozen other sets of very old bones, as if this was a large number. As I understand it, there would be ten or twelve sets of bones, but others has been buried. Presumably if the Kennewick bones should be given to the Native Americans for reburial, so should the rest. He presents the case of a partial skeleton known as \\"Beulah\\" - Native Americans in Idaho gave permission for the remains to be studied before reburial. This, he argues shows that there is no problem finding an amicable solution. The \\"Beulah\\" case actually ended in a certain amount of acrimony, making it a dubious example for future cooperation. Whether or not Chatters handled the situation badly, it is also true that the 5 tribes made little effort to defuse the situation, perhaps by offering cooperation for concessions of their authority that might have created useful precedents in the future. A zero-sum game is always hazardous. If their religion absolutely forbids such compromises, then there is no basis at all for cooperation with their antagonists. Actually, Thomas' Skull Wars offers numerous hopeful examples Native Americans and scientists, some of them Native Americans, working together.Still, these have-our-cake and eat-it-too solutions probably won't eliminate all conflict. Downey ought to know from his studies of the subject that new tests and new questions cause remains to be re-examined. If we rebury the bones, even after intensive study, we will lose some of what we might have known. BUT MAYBE THAT'S O.K. After all, we don't allow researchers to go to any extreme in the search of knowledge. (We wouldn't allow neurosurgeons to cut off people's hands just to let them practice reattachment.) Fascinating though all this is, do we really need to know it - would human culture crumble if Kennewick had never been found? The problem is, since Downey doesn't acknowledge the situation, he can't defend restraints on research.Downey's inadequate considerations of the issues make me all the more impatient with his \\"novelistic\\" touches. In a book of 189 pages, do we really need four and a half to describe the events leading up to the teenagers wading in the river where they found the bones? I don't really care if they meant to get up early but slept in after a night of drinking. A paragraph or two would have sufficed.The index is the best part of the book. With the exception of very famous entries, such as the FBI, most references to people places and things and followed by a brief annotation that is often enough to refresh one's memory, and in some cases supplies information that is not in the text.Other than that, since this is short, if you insist on reading it, you won't waste much time."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"He makes no attempt to be impartial and obviously has a bone to pick with Dr. Chatters. Mr. Downey seems quite suspect of all scientists and scientific institutions, to the point of coming off as bitter. I also must second those who have said that questioned Mr. Downey's research. He briefly discussed the Smithsonian Institution's interest in NAGPRA, but he failed to mention (maybe because he was unaware of it) the National Museum of the American Indian Act. SI is governed by the NMAI Act (1989), not NAGPRA (1990). This is just one of a number of omissions and misrepresentations. I would recommend Dr. Chatters' book Ancient Encounters instead of or to balance out this bookd. At least you know Dr. Chatters' stake in the Kennewick case."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"Roger Downey is an excellent reporter -- we get a clear idea of the people involved in the case, and the story moves along. Much of the material is clearly (assuming it's true!) the result of interviewing and ferreting, for example he seems to have found out that a principal researcher wasn't completely open about the methodology of Kennewick Man's first analysis. Note, however, that this praise is for the political story -- not the science.The main scientific question, I thought, is whether Kennewick Man really has features that are present among &quot;caucasoids&quot; or perhaps Asian groups but rare among North American Indians. Downey almost ignores this. He mentions that some researchers see significance in the sockets, the tooth roots, the cheek bones, the lack of an inca bone, etc.; however, he doesn't go on to discuss whether the researchers are right or wrong. In fact, I have the impression that Downey simply doesn't care.More important, to him, is the process of science (so he covers anthropological meetings and looks for signs of personal conflict), or the right way to interact with affected parties (so he devotes a chapter to an unrelated dig in Buhl Idaho). The history of other finds (Folsom, Clovis, Monte Verde) rates a large amount of space. The included layman's guide to carbon-14 dating is one of the best I've seen. But these are not part of the specific problem of Kennewick Man, they are part of the more general paroblem of North American anthropology.Roger Downey mentions (p.146) that &quot;the European Mesolithic [was] the period of greatest flourishing of our relatives and perhaps ancestors the Neanderthals&quot; (actually the Neanderthals died out before the European Mesolithic began). He says that some migration theories involved &quot;Homeric Atlantis&quot; (actually Homer never mentioned Atlantis). Nobody should carp at a book's minor errors, but I note them to show that some cautious reading is needed.The competion to &quot;Riddle Of the Bones&quot; appears to be Thomas's &quot;Skull Wars&quot; -- which is even more concerned about the politics and contemporary issues. People interested solely in Kennewick Man and what we might glean about history from this or similar finds, will have to wait for a book by someone who cares."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"Sloppy writing and sloppy research make this an embarrassingly bad book. The issues raised by the discovery of Kennewick Man are better described in other current books, and complete copies of the most recent studies relating to Kennewick Man as well as many of the legal briefs filed in the continuing legal dispute over the remains may be read on the web site maintained by the National Parks Service Archaeology and Ethnography Program.Author Downey seems more interested in making sarcastic remarks about everyone involved in the history of the legal dispute than in providing insight into the historical and cultural issues underlying their positions. His ignorance of science is appalling. When Downey doesn't understand something - statistics, for example - he dismisses it with phrases such as &quot;statistical prestidigitations,&quot; implying that it's a slick trick instead of a sophisticated and useful method of analysis. His generalizations are silly: &quot;Archaeologists are not, on the whole, highly sociable human beings.&quot; I can vouch for the hundred or so archaeologists that I know: they have families, friends, strong community ties and good table manners. Downey consistently uses the phrase &quot;scientific myth&quot; when he means &quot;scientific hypothesis,&quot; betraying the fact that he doesn't understand that science progresses by developing, testing and often discarding hypotheses. His lack of interest and insight about widespread Native American beliefs and feelings about repatriation and reburial of human remains are disrespectful, to say the least. Typographical and grammatical errors begin on page one and continue throughout the book. I suspect the proofreader couldn't stay awake through this useless volume."},{"Title":"Riddle of the Bones: Politics, Science, Race, and the Story of Kennewick Man","review":"I was a bit surprised to see the Amazon review section littered with one star reviews of this book. Not all, but most of them were well written and seemed to be reviews from learned men and women.Well I certainly am not qualified to say they are right or wrong. My initial interest in the book was more of a continuing quest to learn about the divides between religion and science. And for this specific purpose, Riddle of the Bones satisfied my needs. Some of the forced hand-holding between the scientific and spiritual viewpoints that is being championed by some writers is a bit too...well, pretentious. In fact the whole exercise to mean seems hollow. I also got a good chuckle out of the arm-wrestling regarding if this was a white skeleton or Indian. How absolutely silly and absurd. That is the reason I enjoyed this book. I like to see a good ole fashioned fight. I don't really care who is right or wrong in this matter. I don't have a dog in the hunt. But I do like to see people battle over race, politics, religion, science, etc. It proves that Darwin was not right in his theory.Since the book's publication in 2000, I have been keen to pick up on any new developments in this case. With the federal matter fairly settled in 2004, all of the developments have been in the state's arena.

Auhor Downey relates on p. 40 that Van Pelt's group were to \\"..pray over the remains and ask their owner's troubled spirit for patience and good will while his DESCENDANTS did their best for him.\\" (the entire litigation over the remains was to determine if the living NA's were in any way related to the remains of KM)Page 41 relates that Van Pelt's helper, an antropology student named Longenecker had enough training to identify and describe all the bones of KM during the visit when they were supposedly praying over the remains. Author Downey says that Longenecker had a 3 page listing of the bone remains including \\"...skull, jaw, vertebrae pelvis, limbs, digits...\\" (Exactly what bone is the \\"vertebrae pelvis\\"?)To illustrate the highly unscientific angle of this book, the author states on pages 58-59 that the plaintiffs sought to establish \\"Given the conditions under which the Kennewick remains were found, water-scattered and deprived of context, and given the limitations of the radiocarbon technique itself, a single date, while intriguing has little or no scientific significance.\\" (This will come as a surprise to many scientists around the world, much less the 9,600 year old almost complete skeleton of KM)All in all, I would say run away from this book, do not walk ...run!

The author, like most of us, was duped into believing in the \\"stability\\" of the mortgage investment market. He even sings the praises of Freddie Mac and Sallie Mae's financial sturdiness.

More general texts about the limbic system are competent in conveying the facts, but Dr. Lautin adds another dimension by placing these facts in historic (and scientific) context, through copious footnoting and elucidating sidebars.

So ignoring the advice of her older brother Tom, she falls for the charm of Lord Randall Hawley and elopes with him. On the trek north, she finds he turns ugly when things go wrong culminating with his raping her. Tom catches up to them, but Randall forces a dual and in the ensuing fight, he dishonorably murders his opponent. Before dying Tom kills Randall. A stunned Thea vows never again to trust a male.A decade later American Patrick Blackburne visits his English mother. She informs him that someone is blackmailing her. She does not want any scandal caused by her to ruin the image of her fianc&eacute;. Patrick promises to see what he can do to fix her problem, but soon has one of his own when he meets and falls in love with Thea, a person he believes is a nasty pleasure seeker. Though she returns his feelings, Thea still feels guilt over her brother's death and rejects all men.SWEAR BY THE MOON is an exciting Regency romance with an engaging, solid story line. Still readers will wonder why a teenage Thea failed to see the true colors of Randall as a bad-tempered soul even if he oozes charm to disguise his nature. His pivotal role is short so that the audience can enjoy the principal battle between Thea and Patrick. Shirlee Busbee has written a stirring historical romance starring two individuals whom the audience will like and want to see together.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Swear by the Moon","review":"I stopped reading Shirlee Busbee's books years ago...I recall reading a book of hers that didn't appeal to me. Since I'm a Regency addict, I decided to try this book and I'm glad I did. The prose and pacing are powerful and you can see the hand of a masterful, experienced author.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Swear by the Moon","review":"In 1798 England, eccentric Thea Garrett lives with her cousin, Modesty, in a town house in London. Having been the victim of scandal some ten years prior, Thea is content to relish her independence and has vowed never to trust a man again.But in a private meeting with her brother-in-law, Alfred Hirst, events spiral out of control, and Thea is afraid that she might have accidentally killed Hirst. Hours later, Patrick Blackburne visits Thea at her residence, and she recognizes him as the man that saw her fleeing the scene of her ominous encounter with Hirst. Against her better judgment, Thea is forced to trust Patrick, as the two begin their search for Hirst's true killer.Though the attraction between Thea and Patrick is very real and electric, their relationship develops very precipitously. Because their attraction lacks depth, they seem to be merely characters on paper rather than real people. Nevertheless, the mystery is fast-paced and intriguing, as Thea and Patrick face danger in their quest to uncover plots to commit murder and blackmail.Though this work seems to fall short of Ms. Busbee's usual standards, the suspenseful element helps overcome deficiencies of the characters thereby rendering it an averagely entertaining read."},{"Title":"Swear by the Moon","review":"I have been a Shirlee Busbee fan for many years and I have to say this book was an unpleasant surprise.

SMART . . . to gather your entire family around to form a committee or a focus group on the subject of what your next child's name will be; such decisions shouldn't be made by a group. Similarly, you should give your product a name that YOU find pleasing, as it is highly unlikely that the resulting name will be worse than a name resulting from thousands of dollars spent on focus groups and committees.No one can tell you how to come up with a good name that will immediately convey to the masses how great your product is. However, one CAN tell you how to come up with a name similar to thousands of others. No one wants that kind of a trademark. Mr. Javed tries to alert the reader to the common actions that lead to common and similar sounding names.The ottom line is, NAMING FOR POWER gives you some insight to the naming process and the fact that luck and personal satisfaction with your choice, more than money, will lead to a stellar trademark.It was fun book."},{"Title":"Naming for Power: Creating Successful Names for the Business World","review":"The sidebars and the historical context of existing brand names is fantastic.

Caputo was with the first marine battalion to deploy to Danang, and what surprised me was that the problems began right from the start: constant patrols which lead to loss of life without any clear purpose; a strategy which never got past body counts; a gulf between the fighters and the rear echelons, even at the beginning when they were co-located; the infliction of unnecessary civilian casualties out of frustration and fear and rage.Rumor of War is a simply written narrative account of Caputo's experiences. One almost wishes for more evidence of the novelist he later became. There are relatively few conversations, and the only personality which really emerges is that of Caputo. At the same time, Caputo is honest in his self-reflections, is never verbose, and was there. Possibly, the book would not be as powerful if it were told some other way. I gave the book 5 stars because its material is so important, and certainly bears on our experiences in Iraq, whatever your views on that war are."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"People have compared this to \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" and \\"All Quiet on the Western Front.\\" I never liked the first and the second is fiction while this of course is a true story. To me this is THE story of infantryman in combat. I have read and reread it a half dozen times and it never fails to move me. The preface alone is wonderfully profound. After this book movies like \\"Platoon\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now\\" will seem silly and shallow. Anyone who beleives in a strong interventionist foreign policy should read this."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"My military history class used this book as one of our main text books. It was and still is the only text book that I have ever enjoyed reading.Caputo uses great writing skills to take the reader through his tour as a Marine Corp's officer in Vietnam. I have read many other books on Vietnam, but this book is exciting while keeping a respectful tone for the war. This is an excellent book for educating civilians about the atrocities that the soldiers experienced. This book will be eye opening for everyone!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Truth makes free--that was the odd thought flitting in the background when I read this book. I could have chosen a history book to try and understand the Vietnam war; I'm glad someone recommended 'A Rumor of War' because it is not often truth we encounter in history books, only facts. Understanding brings about a curious freedom and that was my sense upon finishing this book. I felt like I had faced and understood a grim untouchable, and in the understanding have been made free--though I don't understand how or why. Perhaps it's because this book is Testimony and I am a fool for any man's Testimony. Philip Caputo told the truth of his Vietnam, and in that alone is something heroic and beautiful. Never before have I been made to understand the Vietnam war; and if I still do not understand it, exactly, at least I have been there through Philip Caputo and have an empathy I never did for the veterans of this war..."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Being an avid Vietnam War reader, I must say having read many other books that, A Rumor of War, let's you know what Vietnam was really about. The horror of losing friends, the terror of being in the bush knowing and anticipating that fateful step that might trip and enemy mine. Philip Caputo expresses with honor how the Vietnam War robbed all soldiers of innocence, and turned young men old. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This book has been the most thought provoking that I have read in a long time. Not only does it tell the story of the soldier's day to day life, but also the thoughts of a young boy who grew up too fast.

Anyone who wants to know what goes through a soldier's mind during the horror of war has to read this book."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I read it 10 or 15 years ago, and just finished it again. I was graduating from high school when the war was just starting to end. I was waiting for my greetings from the President, and a Senior Trip. I was glad it didn't come. But I think everyone should read this book. I brings back the memories of the 6:00 news, and tells a far more detailed story of the daily lives of our soldiers in Nam. Some quite frightening, all enlightening, and everyone should read this before they ever think of sending our youth to a land far away to fight on other soil.

The common fact that comes through is that the american soldier and the Vietnamese were really unsure fof what they were fighting for.I served in Vietnam in 1969 and was sure that we were fighting to stop the communist from world domination.Since then I have come to the conclusion that war was good business and the profits were spectacular in Vietnam I think Mr caputo was truly aware of the futility of this conflict. T o be sure the Vietnam Veterans fought for each other and as in any other war the smae can be said of other veterans, but in Vietnam the american public , the vietnamese and the south vietnamese pesants just wanted us to go away thus for the longest time we only had each other.

Bravo Zulu -- Job well done!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"A Rumor of War is a good book. It's well written and easy to read. It's visceral, but not necessarily educational. It was probably much more significant when it was first published. The book provides a very clear look at Marines during the early days of the Vietnam War. It's autobiographical, written from Caputo's own experiences. The author's military training, life in Danang, and actions in the field are described in detail. His attitudes and opinions take a decided turn for the worse as the war drags on, wears him out, and wastes his brothers in arms. (Caputo comments on the appropriate usage of the term \\"waste\\" in his book.) The foot soldier, slogging through the paddy fields with sniper fire whining overhead, is put front and center. Historical development and the political situations in Washington and Vietnam are hardly mentioned. The environment is given a starring role: heat, humidity, monsoon rain, mud, insects, jungle trails, water-filled fox holes, cold wet nights, darkness, and nearly impenetrable elephant grass. Death is also given center stage... sudden, brutal, undesirable death... and its cousin, serious injury. Caputo dedicates his book to two of his fallen comrades. That's where his heart is. Good men, gone too soon, with loved ones left behind."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"It's been a few years since I read this book, but I still remember it vividly. This autobiographical rememberance of one man's service in Vietnam is quite memorable. Anyone who thinks the U.S. should be sending soldiers to fight in the Middle East and Asia should definitely read this book for perspective. One of the main things I got out of this book was that there are just some wars that not are winnable. When your enemy has so much more to lose, you can never defeat them. The North Vietnamese were fighting to unite a country. The Americans were fighting to divide a country. The war in Vietnam is one of the first modern wars where we learned as a country that our powerful military has limitations. Usually the goal in war is take territory and secure it. But when you are fighting an enemy who employs guerrila tactics, they don't care about taking territory. They care about only breaking your spirit and your willingness to fight. There's so many realizations that I came to reading this book and others on the Vietnam War. I could go on for days, but I would rather you spend your time reading this book instead of my thoughts!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I read a lot of US military history books. It's a passion of mine. Every once in a while though I'll take a break from the history of a particular war and read a war memoir. This book was perhaps one of the best books I have read in a while - a real page turner. What A rumor of War does for me is brings me back to reality - takes away all the glory, the honor etc that military history is loaded with and shows me what it's truly like being the ordinary solider.This book written by a marine lieutenant the beginning stages of the Vietnam war tells the reader how war changes the soldier from their glory hunting idealist soldier to a walking killing machine driven to he brink of madness. I will say the first two chapter which Caputo talks about joining the marines and basic training were a little slow but a necessary beginning. I would rank this book as almost as good as Sledge's \\"With The Old Breed\\"."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I've never been a big fan of war stories, but this book won me over wholeheartedly. Caputo tells his own personal account of Vietnam, from being an innocent midwest boy hungry for adventure, to an aged, broken man torn apart by war. He goes into the military, ambitious for glory and battle. He goes through a long journey of disappointments, setbacks and helplessness. He manages to climb his way up the military ladder, but the more successful he becomes, the more the events spiral out of control. Caputo's story is honest and personal, not sparing himself anything, but taking you deep into the mind of a soldier."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Beside me, my buddy, Philip Caputo, was burning a leech from his stomach. I was focused on the tree line 100 yards east. There was a sniper in the waving palms and Caputo was next on watch so I could use my zippo on one of the slimey bastards. The air was as heavy as wet burlap and the sweat caused my vision to blur. Caputo brings us this close to what it felt like to be in 'Nam fighting a mindless battle against the little people who ruled the night.

I, as a 21 year old enlisted man, was also was part of that initial troop operation with the 1st Infantry Division just north of Saigon.We arrived full of excitement not knowing what we were about to encounter. I still find it hard to explain the experience of unanticipated paralyzing fear, an environment of massive infrastructure development in the middle of a rubber plantations and mountain jungle, new deadly weapons design to counter our initial losses, the anything goes in Saigon, snakes and tigers, indiscriminate death and the general behavior of kids that had been raised with upper middle class values that simply didn't hold up when exposed the emotional sensationalism of this conflict.Caputo does the best job describing that environment and the relatedevolving behavior that became part of the daily experience. As you approach the end of the novel with stimulated enlightenment he drops the bomb.Along side of \\"Making of a Quagmire\\" by another Pulitzer Prize winner, David Halberstan and \\"We were Soldiers Once ....And Young\\", Harold G.

I had not read it before, but had done research and study on the subject. I found Caputo's book to be insightful, controversial and thought provoking. He doesn't glamorize the war but explains how it effected soldiers and one of the many reasons it was such a mess. Throughout the book, Caputo shows how the conditions changed the average American teenager into a robotic killer and how their experiences stayed with them. In the end, he speaks against the war, but not in the normal Jane Fonda version of bashing the military and labeling them rapists and baby killer. Caputo talks about how the government was at fault and created the situations that lead to PTSD and other issues for returning soldiers.A must read to understand the war and its effects on our soldiers."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Wow.

It is a classic read that will give the reader a flavor of the bureaucracy and cynicism of military life. Caputo makes no apologies for his very human feelings. He does do an excellent job of painting our human frailties in the context of the horror of war.The irony of Caputo's experience is he is trained to kill and lead men in aggressive military ops. He does his job and follows his governments mantra of, \\"If it's Vietnamese and its dead then its VC\\" and as a result he is charged with murder by the Army.Caputo's journey is as relevant in today's world, with the War in Iraq, as it was in the 1960's. It's the story of a soldier who believed in a cause and went to serve not of a doubletalk government or an idealistic do nothing who merely complains that \\"war is bad\\". Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"For anyone who has ever asked, \\"What was Vietnam really like,\\" Marine Lieutenant Philip Caputo's book, \\"A Rumor of War,\\" is a must read. In this autobiographical account of his time as an infantry officer in, \\"the \`Nam,\\" he describes the experience in authoritative terms enhanced by collegiate English studies and time spent as a combat journalist. The result is the most well written account of life in an infantry platoon in Vietnam that I have ever read.Phil Caputo could have been virtually anyone in America in the early \`60's. A young, idealistic, all-American boy who joined the Marines in search of adventure, and out of a patriotic desire to answer John Kennedy's challenge to, \\"Ask not what your country can do for you. . .\\" He and his platoon marched off to war to find glory and honor. What they found was, \\"death, death, death.\\"Caputo takes you into the muddy foxhole with him, making you feel the heat and annoyance of the ever-present insects, and the sniper shots that all united to deprive you of the precious commodity of sleep. He takes you on patrol with them down, \\"Purple Heart Trail,\\" where the main enemies were the heat, the insects, and endless mines and booby traps. The reader can feel the rage of the infantrymen who fought endless battles with an enemy that was everywhere, yet nowhere. Gradually enthusiasm turned to pessimism; pessimism to despair; and despair to rage; rage that ultimately vented itself in mindless violence against anything Vietnamese. They were then left with the heat, the insects, and guilt borne of actions taken that they would never have dreamed of a few short months before.Caputo and his enthusiastic, young, Marines could have been anyone who has ever fought: the patriots at Lexington and Concord, who later found themselves half starved and freezing at Valley Forge; or any number of Union or Confederate soldiers from Bull Run to Appomattox. They could have been \\"Doughboys\\" who went, \\"Over There,\\" to \\"Make the World Safe for Democracy,\\" only to find themselves \\"fighting\\" immersion foot and mustard gas in the trenches of France; or perhaps even soldiers serving under, \\"Ol' Blood and Guts\\" himself, George S. Patton; \\"Our blood, his guts,\\" as the GI's said. Their stories all verify Gen. Robert E. Lee's famous quote: \\"War seldom avails anything to those unfortunate enough to have to fight it.\\"A Rumor of War ranks up there with Gen. Harold Moore's, \\"We Were Soldiers Once and Young,\\" and Col. David Hackworth's, \\"About Face.\\" All three show how debates that raged in Washington, Paris, Saigon, and Hanoi were ultimately scored. Whether you were a \\"hawk or a dove,\\" a liberal or a conservative, a professor or student, you will benefit from reading this book that answers the question authoritatively: \\"Hey! What was Vietnam really like?\\""},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo describes &quot;the splendid little war&quot; as his road from an enthusiastic idealist poisoned by the romanticized view of war as a chivalrous and noble enterprise to the dehumanized and desensitized wreck that he becomes during his tour in Vietnam. The book is an amazing testimony about the true nature of war with all its atrocities and horrors. Caputo brilliantly captures the endless despair of being strained in the jungle with no clear reason for being there, the hopeless madness of chasing the guerillas and the agony of loosing friends. But the most important aspect of this book is that it shows how a normal mentally healthy person can be turned into a thoughtless killing machine in the course of a few months, fast on the trigger, without any remorse for his victims. Caputo uses very strong and vivid images such as &quot;pigs eating napalm-charred human corpses&quot; to force the reader into his story and feel what Caputo has felt. Very realistic book that cannot leave you indifferent, definitely up there with Remarque's &quot;All quiet on the Western front.&quot; If you want to know what fighting the Vietnam War was really like, I can't imagine how any book can possibly be better than Rumor of War."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"To anyone who thinks of war as a glorious enterprise or some kind of Nintendo game, they should read Caputo's book. THe author himself was once an idealistic, glory seeking young man eager to participate in &quot;a splendid little war,' but by book's end he has become an unfeeling, unremorseful and scared shell of a human being. THis may have been what kept him alive, but Caputo is angry over the deep emotional damage done to many men like himself who were thrust into a civil war and cultural revolution in a country and place we had little understanding of. Caputo manges to show us how this transformation took place. Its not a pleasant read or ride, but in the process we discover why the war was unwinnable at a price America was willing or should have paid, and what damage we inflicted on men like Caputo in putting them in such a difficult position. BUt don't read the book for any lengthy history or diatribe on Vietnam or America's policies toward it. First and foremost its a memoir of war and preparing for war. From boot camp thru training, to Vietnam and back home, Caputo keeps you riveted with descriptions of crawling through leech filled swamps, nights in the sticky jungle being consumed by insects, and witnessing the irony of pigs eating charred human corpses. When not focusing on battles, we are privy to the insanity of body counts and body bags and the tense downtime between jungle patrols, as well as the dynamics of a Marine platoon. Caputo's insights and ability to reflect back upon the events and physical and emotional carnage he inflicted upon himself and others is what makes this memoir special. There is also no small irony that Caputo was part of the first marine unit to go to Nam, and that as a journalist some 10 years later, he was one of the last to leave. Anytime I think of war as a glorious enterprise, I need only pick up this book and read a few sections. Should be required reading in war history courses! If you liked Dispatches by Michael Herr, this book is even better."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"&quot;A Rumor of War&quot; is a darkly disturbing book. It is set in what was the early, &quot;optimistic&quot; Vietnam in the spring of '65 when we thought we were fighting for &quot;freedom&quot; and before the reality of the place hit home. Vietnam hits Lieutenant Caputo very quickly, as it must have for all Marine Corps platoon leaders. It's all right there-booby traps, mines, trip wires, leeches, foot blisters, jungle rot, constant shelling, dysentery, pigs eating corpses and cold C Rations. As a Vietnam vet, I was surprised the author never mentions RATS!, but we both know they were there too. (THEY were everywhere). Lt.

I must admit that I constantly found myself curious as to how I would have handled many situations in &quot;RW&quot;. How would I have measured up? What would I have done? How would the men have judged me? While the story of &quot;RW&quot; tends to stray at times, I found no fault since the author is relating a painful part of his past.

Here tells the story of Phillip Caputo, a baby boomer who grew up in the golden years of John F. Kennedy and the sweet success of World War II. Caputo joined the Marines like many others from a sense of patriotism and a desire to prove his toughness. Training instills in him the tradition of the Corps, but as his tour in Vietnam progresses his disillusionment grows.For those who are searching for a glimpse of combat, here it is in all its brutality. Then more than now, Rumor of War provides a unique non-John Wayne view of warfare. This is the real-life 'Heart of Darkness'. Caputo goes from an idealistic American kid to a jaded war vet, all in a few years. As death piles up around him, he descends into the realm of numbness and hate. I firmly believe that what happened to him can and does happen regularly to those under war's grim watch.World War II taught that war can be necessary, 'moral' and profitable as well. Vietnam showed us the other edge of the blade. So, where do we go from here? I imagine many will put down this book with one word on their lips: Iraq. Is that parallel correct? Maybe, maybe not. There are two lessons I hope Rumor of War provides (though the second goes beyond the book's scope). The first lesson is that war is no romantic diversion. Abandon that instinct, for modern war deals death in a horribly random manner. For every hero's death there are twenty ignoble ones. It's a waste. The other - not covered by the book - is that sometimes in history, this savagery of war is an unfortunate necessity."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I picked up Philip Caputo's book,&quot; A Rumor of War&quot;, several years ago. I started reading and was quickly engrossed in the detail and knowledge that was describe by Mr. Caputo. I could picture in my mind everything he was saying. Suddenly, as I was reading, I knew what was going to happen next. I said to myself that I must have read this book before. But to my delight as I read on, I realized that I had been right beside Mr. Caputo, and that he had been my Platoon Commander. I had forgot many details that came flooding back as I read on. His telling of his story, and mine, was masterful. When you read of a firefight, everyword he describes happened. The feelings of a Combat Marine Grunt lives in his words. &quot;Rumor of War&quot;, is a must read for all Americans , young or old, If you want to know the true feel of war. A heartfelt salute to a True Marine and Platoon Commander, Semper Fi !"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo's A Rumor of War is a highly readable, albeit chilling, narrative of ground combat. It is a story of Marines - their pain, their fear, and the hardships they endured in Vietnam. Caputo wrote this book with a clear purpose: to convey the destructive effects of war on man's morality.Unlike so many war stories, this book contains few heroes; only men who, in Caputo's mind, died senselessly still clutching their naive idealism. It is to this youthful idealism that Caputo devotes the first section of A Rumor of War. Portraying his innocence and that of his fellow Marines before and during their initial insertion into Danang in 1965, Caputo writes of men who craved danger and combat, with idealistic visions of gallantry and heroism. Countless Marines who were heady with anticipation would, a short time later, lie dead or maimed in the jungles of Vietnam. Despite the ominous warnings of the few veterans among them, the young Marines failed to grasp beforehand the horrors that awaited them in Vietnam.Throughout this book, Caputo protrays Marines (himself included) who completely lost their idealism, and whose morality the war corrupted. They had long forgotten why they were in Vietnam. Constant exposure to death raped them psychologically. Countless Marines &quot;lost it.&quot; Patrols down &quot;Purple Heart trail,&quot; anticipating booby traps with every step, and tense probes into VC enclaves like Hui-Voc and Giao-Tri took their toll on the Marines mentally and physically. Caputo describes his own fear intensifying to a breaking point where he ceased to be afraid of dying - a final revalation that his own psyche and morality were casualties of war.The Vietnam War, however controversial, is over. Caputo and his fellow veterans grow fewer in number every day. But A Rumor of War is more relevant now than ever. As America slowly forgets the Vietnam War's legacy, so too does it forget the realities of combat. Since Vietnam, a new generation of military servicemen - of which I am a member - has risen in this country, fresh with idealism and dreams of glory. We, like young Phil Caputo, are ignorant of the chaos, horror, and immorality of real war."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"\\"A Rumor of War\\" is a darkly disturbing book.

A Rumor of War is about the things men do in war and the things war does to them. Caputo had one of the most one of a kind perspectives on the Vietnam War possible from his first hand experiences in Vietnam. A Rumor of War is about the dangers in Vietnam, the casualties, the frame of mind, and the endless monotony to moments of sheer terror of the American soldier in Vietnam. Throughout A Rumor of War, one can sense the soldier's enormous desire to go home and to abandon the foolishness of a war that soon after arriving in Vietnam most soldiers did not believe in. Caputo's character was the factor that moved the Marine's in his platoon and their desire to survive. Caputo is one of the first Marines ashore in Danang Vietnam on March 8th, 1965 convinced that American forces will win a quick victory in Vietnam. \\"I guess we believed in our own publicity, Asian guerrillas did not stand a chance against United States Marines\\". Caputo and his platoon are part of the initial process of escalation under the Johnson administration that led to our massive commitment to fight the war in Vietnam. Caputo's platoon in Vietnam first guards an airbase, and then makes limited patrols into the surrounding Vietnamese countryside to route out snipers. Eventually Caputo is part of the first massive search and destroy operations of the war trying to find an enemy that cannot usually be found for large-scale \\"American\\" style engagements. The Vietnamese are the \\"phantom\\" enemy as Caputo describes them because the Vietcong had a division of troops around the airbase his platoon was helping to protect yet the Americans had yet to see one enemy soldier.Eventually Caputo is transferred to a staff position as \\"Officer in Charge of the Dead\\" and as one of his duties posts every day the number of American's lost and Vietcong killed on the regimental headquarters blackboard so his colonel could keep track of the battalions and companies under his command and rattle off impressive Vietcong kills to visiting dignitaries. Sometimes Caputo had to verify Vietcong body counts at headquarters, which was not pleasant since at the climate of Vietnam the bodies were already decomposing. This shows the United States emphasis on body counts.Caputo is then voluntary transferred back to an infantry company to serve once again as a platoon leader. Caputo serves in this capacity until stress and lack of judgment lead him to order his men on an anti-insurgent mission that results in the death of two South Vietnamese civilians that were incorrectly identified as members of the Vietcong. Caputo's men tell him one of them men had to be killed because the \\"Cong\\" sat up with his forty-five and ran outside yelling \\"Oh God\\" and the other \\"Cong\\" flung a tree branch at the Marines and tried to escape. Caputo is found not guilty on all counts, all charges were dropped against him and a letter of reprimand was put in his military jacket. Caputo was again a free man and he is sent home from Vietnam less then ten days after his acquittal. Ten years later, Caputo was one of the reporters that reported on the fall of Saigon to Communist North Vietnamese forces for the Chicago Tribune.I personally do not feel that this memoir enhanced my understanding of the conflict in Vietnam. I do not feel that I learned too much by reading this particular book. Since my dad was in Vietnam, I already knew most of the bloody details about the war from his first-hand experiences there as an F-4 Phantom pilot. Moreover, with my personal passions having to do with modern military history in general I already knew that most of the troops did not want to be in Vietnam and did not believe in the cause that they were sent to Vietnam to fight for. However, Rumor of War shows the transformation of the American military into the dejected organization that had come to symbolize American forces in Vietnam. It became popular after the war to suggest what America should have done differently to win the war. From Caputo's book, it becomes clear that America could not have won the war in South Vietnam. America just pursued an ever-rising body count. \\"Since the landing, we had acquired the conviction that we could win this brushfire war, and win it quickly, if only we were turned loose to fight.\\" In fact we never even knew what \\"winning\\" would entail Caputo says.Caputo's perspective about the Vietnam War is very important for people who know little about the bloody, gory, and discouraging details regarding the Vietnam War. Caputo's book is very informative and an entertaining read for people who have trouble reading an entire book. The reader in a sense can connect with Caputo's first hand story telling in this book, which is brutally honest I must say. Caputo describes his youthful, naive longing for adventure, his subsequent suffering and that of his fellow soldiers, and what he believes is his ultimate betrayal by his own country regarding his court-martial.I personally thought it was a very good book. Rumor of War is definitely the book students should read if they like action packed books with blood and gore to keep them entertained though the entire book."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"It is hard to imagine that such a gifted writer is also capable of being an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.

Caputo shares with readers a perspective that begins to bridge the gap that exists between those who were there and those of us who weren't. This memoir is self-aware of the necessity to attend to the dissonance that naturally occurs as time passes. Even readers who are completely tuned out to topics relating to war will find themselves capable of relating to Caputo's struggle to find the meaning of personal identity.Caputo structures A Rumor of War with excellently chosen titles. Part 1: The Splendid Little War begins by introducing readers to the honesty and integrity Caputo allows us throughout the memoir. Young Caputo is moved by President Kennedy's inaugural address referring to his message as a \\"seductive\\" and \\"challenging\\" call for Americans to become active citizens. A counter-message begins to emerge in the writing as Caputo recounts his disillusionment in the death of a collective dream for \\"a splendid little war.\\"Against his will, Caputo is reassigned to a desk job in Part 2: The Officer In Charge of the Dead. In this position, where the work rarely required more than four hours of attention, Caputo is left ample time to ponder his new closer relationship to death. At times it seems Caputo is doing a disservice to some readers, especially readers without military knowledge, by describing his experiences ad nauseum. In the same respect, it is this attention to detail that serves to highlight Caputo's authenticity.The pace of writing in Part 3: In Death's Grey Land changes to reflect Caputo's impression is that the war has changed and become \\"a different war\\" entirely where \\"death and maiming seem commonplace.\\" Just as readers are swept up in Part 1, then dragged through Part 2, Caputo pulls Part 3 into a descending pace that mirrors his own psychological descent.It is no surprise that A Rumor of War is considered must read war literature. Even what seem to be faults in Caputo's writing are revealed in the end as evidence of Caputo's mastery of the art of memoir."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This is a really fantastic book.

In 1965, he was a lieutenant in the US Marine Corps, and a platoon leader in one of the first Marine Corps battalions to deploy to Da Nang in South Vietnam. More importantly to readers of his outstanding 1977 memoire, \\"A Rumor of War\\", Caputo was a thoughtful, articulate, and brutally honest writer.Caputo was still quite new to the Marine Corps when he arrived in Vietnam. The experience of combat grew up him quick. \\"A Rumor of War\\" captures that experience in often graphic and tragic detail, as the Marines at Da Nang patrolled, moved inland, and sought to close with a maddeningly elusive enemy in the jungles. Caputo found learning the trade of a lieutenant to be doubly tough under fire. He would also discover that wars generate their own bizarre logic. Caputo freely shares a series of vignettes that illustrate that of Vietnam, as a highly traditional Marine Corps attempted to apply a hammer to every situation.Caputo would endure a harrowing brush with military justice over an ambiguous combat situation at the end of his tour, and arrive back in the world as a highly trained warrior without a civilian occupation. His ironic closing chapter is his return to Vietnam as a journalist in 1975, in time to see Saigon fall to the North Vietnamese Army.\\"A Rumor of War\\" holds up extraordinarily well as a combat memoire, and is highly recommended to students of the genre."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"A Rumor of War may be nonfiction, but that doesn't mean it can't read like a novel.The story is told from Phil Caputo's point of view. He's a regular guy from a regular, even boring, town in Illinois. The first section of the book details his life before the war, and his reasons for joining the Marine Corps, as well as his first experiences. The second part tells of his desk job documenting casualties. In the third part, he is reassigned to his rifle company where he gets involved in some more action.I've always been interested in the Vietnam War, and I wanted a realistic account of what it was like for an everyday guy. This is exactly that. We are introduced to what it was really like in Vietnam. Caputo tells it from his own perspective, exactly what he went through. It may not be textbook perfect, but that doesn't matter. All that matters is that this is what really happened to Philip Caputo.I started out, thinking that the first part of the book would be rather dry, slow going, with lots of pre-war musings and contemplations. There was a bit of the above mentioned, but I was delighted to find that Caputo really knows how to write. It's almost a conversational tone, which makes it feel much more personal. There wasn't a dry moment. I was also surprised that Caputo failed to stumble often into the many writer faults and quirks.I cared about what happened and what the characters went through. I felt their pain, and laughed when they did. And this wasn't just because these are all real people. It's not easy to make characters likeable, and Caputo succeeded.The dialogue was good, and pleasantly frequent. Often times with personal accounts, the dialogue is painfully absent. Not so here. There were many humorous parts that relieved some tension, and also intense moments involving firefights, waking through the jungle with snipers taking potshots at unsuspecting Marines. All of it brilliantly detailed.Caputo achieved his purpose in writing an informative, interesting, detailed, realistic, and even entertaining account of Vietnam. I was very impressed. The tone isn't dark and broody. It is actually light hearted in parts, despite the fact that close friends died and the horrors of war were detailed.That's not to say the book was a jolly read. I wouldn't use \\"jolly\\" to describe it. It was definitely light hearted in parts, but Caputo didn't fail to document the stuff that a lot of people don't want to hear about. The violence particularly. Don't go into this book expecting Caputo to tone down the real violence. He tells it how it is.In the end, I found A Rumor of War to be a book I'm glad I read. The writing style was impressive for nonfiction, he made me care about happened, and we get an insight into what it was really like and the psychology a soldier."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I had bought this book to aid in an assignment for English Class and I must say, it was real simple to interpret and was amazing beyond measure.

Nothing!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Just noticed this was on the NYT list for 2012 and am elated. I read this book first in 1979 as a high school student considering my options. This book shook me to the core as any book that details a war should.

A must read, not just for the historical account of a war but for the timeless story of a man coming to terms with himself and his choices."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo delivers an account of the Vietnam war seldom heard; that is, he speaks of the emotional impact of the war as opposed to the usual details of day to day life and missions frequently recounted in such works. He helps you to understand the mental highs and lows and the harsh realities of combat as it impacts the psyche of the soldiers involved."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"As Vietnam war memoirs goes, A Rumor of War is certainly the most fascinating in its ability to accurately portray, through combination of words alone, every little bit that the U.S. Marine soldier could feel, smell, touch, ear and see in Vietnam. His own story shows Philip Caputo as somehow an average Marine lieutenant, no better but no worse that other NCOs with his weaknesses, his strengths, his moments of courage, fear, and madness. That being said, average lieutenant he may have been, he is nevertheless a top writer, able to convey feelings and all details of a scene that makes it feel you are in his shoes or more appropriately, in his boots.For anyone not that familiar with Vietnam, and even for those who know a thing or two about this war, A Rumor of War makes it clear that a U.S. soldier's tour of duty in this country was basically made of 98% of total quietness and boredom, and 2% of ferocious and savage jungle action. That may seem a comfortable ratio, but the trouble is that the you were living through the 98% in a constant state of tension, fear, and paranoia that the 2% was about to jump on you. All this was compounded by the fact that contrary to \\"classic\\" war conflicts, there was no front line. Soldiers could not have any sense of progress made by capturing city after city, moving up towards new zones and slowly conquering territory. In Vietnam, you had all and no territory at once. The same damn villages could be captured and re-captured multiple times. It was pure madness. As no front lines could be identified with the enemy being everywhere and no where at the same time, the military brass resorted to the notorious and controversial concept of \\"body count\\" as a measure of success, with all the catastrophic impact it had on the men in the field. It's no wonder that the mental stress made so many men broke down and behave so erratically at times.Some scenes in A Rumor of War are profoundly disturbing and reveal the utter savagery and inhumanity of this ugly war, with the civilians always caught straight in the line of fire. Some reviewers have criticized Caputo for his anti-war stance, disparaging his patriotism. That's not how I read it. Of course, his harrowing experiences and observations had made him at the conclusion of his tour of duty resolutely against what he believed was an unwinnable war. But never in this book does he actually show scorn to his fellow buddies, or contempt towards their initial values and beliefs they had going into Vietnam. A great war memoir of a man torn by a traumatic conflict."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I read this book when it was first published.

I no longer felt like I was reading it just to do my paper, I was reading it to learn of the past. It captured my attention to the point where I could almost swear that I was there, could see the dark rice paddies at night on watch. I could almost smell the decay as he IDed the bodies of his fallen friends. This is a book to learn from and one to remember.

Caputo uses vivid details to put you there among the mosquitos, monsoons, and madness.At first he is a gungho Marine, happy to kill and die for his noble country. Gradually, as his buddies die in humbling, horrible ways, he begins to doubt the war--and himself.Caputo is candid about the attractions of battle, and the wrongs of killing. It is a deft, enthralling mix of journalism and personal anguish.What makes his story sadder is how his experience resonates with that other war our nation is now happily engaged in.

Received the book quickly and in great condition. Brand new and wrapped nicely."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"While reading A Rumor of War, you can get a pretty good description of what occurred during the Vietnam War. I thought it was a very believable fiction story. I thought that the overall mood of the book was very believable. As the story begins, the main character almost feels knightly going into war. He sees it as a glory event, in which he wants to take part of. But realistically, his mindset changes as the war goes on. I thought the human emotion showed was right on. The main character gets steadily more depressed, and eventually leads his men into slaughtering an entire village. I thought that was pretty depressing, especially his outlook on life.Were I to be in the soldier's position, I would have similar outlooks on life, but he just seems so gloomy all the time. He started out vibrant, and ended up being calloused and tough. This isn't a very surprising change in a person during war, but it was a change nonetheless. The main character as a whole I liked though. He was young, in his 20's, and shared a few of the same viewpoints as me on life.Most of the book was pretty exciting, as it had plenty of action and bad language, but it also had some drab conversations. It felt like reading a war movie, so either Hollywood or the authors, Caputo, do pretty good work in describing war. I haven't read any other war books, so I don't know how this one would compare to another. Worth reading if you enjoy war material."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo wasn't much of a marine. He started complaining about Vietnam before he arrived. Every page is filled with criticism, cynicism, griping, complaining, and self-serving tripe. He wanted to be a hero, but he didn't have what it took to be anything but a whining wimp. Certainly he writes well. But writing well and living well are entirely different. He doesn't understand honor or duty. Sure the war was politicized, but so is every war. Sure the rules of engagement were stupid, but a soldier serves. Caputo did not serve; rather he whined. Many of us who served in Vietnam believed there were many things that made no sense. But we didn't turn tail and run. We served. For those who want to understand what is was like to be a soldier in Vietnam, read \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\" or \\"Steel My Soldiers' Hearts\\". If you want to know what is was like to be useless in Vietnam, read this book."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This is a good example of a group of men with poor leadership.

Enjoyed it from start to finish.The book game me a renewed perspective and understanding of the Vietnam conflict."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo delivers exactly what he promised in the prologue. He briefly strayed, in my opinion, for two pages when he embelished the nightmares he had about the KIA's in his platoon but otherwise the book is an upfront, unbiased account of his Vietnam experience. It is an experience worth reading. I especially enjoyed the aniversary edition because it includes some timely hindsight about Vietnam that really brings the story full circle. I'm a military veteran and had some reservations early in the book but I stuck with it and understood (in principle) what Caputo had to offer in the end. FYI, this book is also a reflection of our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan so don't think of it as ancient history only but as current events also. Excellent!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Written at a time when the country was still hurting, the book is a raw, beautifully written memoir.

Philip Caputo puts the life of an everyday solider during the Vietnam War into a light that I believe does justice to every veteran of the war. He very articulately describes the horrors, and utter impossibilities of fighting a guerilla war in unfamiliar territory, and does so with a writing style that will make you feel as though you are crouched in a foxhole right next to him in the dense jungles of Vietnam.

As a teacher preparing a class on the 60s and Vietnam, I found myself emotionally attached to Caputo and his trials, choices, and despair. Indeed, as others have said, this would make an excellent text for those who really want to know what the war was like. I will certainly be recommending it to students that I think are mature enough to handle the material, and will have its content in my mind as I teach about this conflict and its impact on the men who served there."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo's \\"A Rumor of War\\" is a fantastic look into the day-to-day occurances of the common \\"grunts\\" who served in Viet Nam. His ability to \\"put the reader there\\" as well as his amazing ability to make a powerful political point is apparent in this masterpiece.Many would call this book an \\"anti-war\\" book. I think Caputo's work is not nearly that simplistic. Rather than blaming the act of war as the root of all evil, he implicitly fingers the military structure and complex as the cause of so much pain and suffering among the American troops who served. He causes the reader to feel sympathy for those soldiers (including Caputo himself) who committed horrible crimes of war. In doing so, he makes the powerful political point that you can't blame the individuals who served in the war; the problem was at the top, with the people who organized the war and sent our boys over there. \\"A Rumor of War\\" vividly shows the extent to which the people who planned the war were completely disconnected from the people who had to do the dirty work.What makes Caputo's ideas so powerful is his ability to write powerfully and vividly. He does an amazing job of making the reader feel like he is really there, standing next to Caputo during all of the fire-fights and ambushes. This is book is certainly among the best writing I've read on the Viet Nam War.Additionally, I recommend Herr's \\"Dispatches\\" if you like \\"A Rumor of War.\\""},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I am unable to compare this book to others, it was my first reading purchased in the bookstore about Vietnam War. 'A Rumor of War' is probably not the best on this subject; it is neither historical book nor packed with action thriller. It is rather a cut taken from the early stage of this long lasting conflict, describing US military actions against Viet Cong guerilla fighters around Danang (South Vietnam) in 1965 and 1966.There are no big battles and huge maneuverings of opposing armies. Do not misunderstand me though. Lieutenant Caputo and his platoon had a good chance of learning what the jungle fight is, and his work describes quite vividly ambushes, snipers, booby traps and other perils waiting for Marines outside their Military Last Resistance zone. And they were dying, many of them.It is not intense book, not the one that would not allow a reader to put it aside and continue next day. Some parts are fast paced and intense and some are even slightly boring. The same was life then, in those military camps, days full of fighting and days 'all secure, situation remains the same'.What makes 'A Rumor of War' special is, that it is as much about events as it is about human mind's reaction to brutality of war. Philip Caputo created very personal, honest and confession like masterpiece, filled with deep thoughts and brooding about life and injustice, especially when it comes to war and death.In his postscript to this edition, author explains what he wanted to achieve by writing ' A Rumor of War'. I will say - he has met a target.Finally, reading would be a lot more interesting should map depicting area of military operations (around Danang) was better...."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I must say this book really opened my eyes. I never quite understood why many people have troble whith thier lives after coming back from war. Well this book totaly opened my eyes. It showed my the horrors of war. It showed me what people go through. It contains a little bit of everything action, hummor, and most of all honesty. If you want a book that will give you the absoulutly brutally honest truth of Vietnam this is the book."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo's book doesn't need another review. I will offer mine anyway, if nothing else to contrast it with Wolff's \\"In Pharoah's Army,\\" an inferior book. First, I wish I could have written \\"A Rumor of War.\\" I wasn't ready to write about the war soon after I returned from Vietnam, in 1967. Not even after a couple years of college in 1971, when I camped on the mall with 1,200 other Vietnam Vets Against the War (including John Kerry). Caputo had the advantage of education on me. Not just that, I needed a lot more time to experience other things and gain a broader perspective. But he made it all perfectly clear when he had a dialogue in the officer's mess with the chaplain and the doctor, \\"The chaplain's morally superior attitude had rankled me, but his sermon had managed to plant doubt in my mind, doubt about the war. Much of what he had said made sense: our tactical operations did seem futile and directed toward no apparent end. . . . Twelve wrecked homes. The chaplain's words echoed. That's twelve wrecked homes. The doctor and I think in terms of human suffering, not statistics.\\" AND THIS WAS IN 1965, before things really got going in Vietnam. If you want to know what the BS about body counts was--that ended up in a lawsuit by General Westmoreland against Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, if you want to know what Vietnam was like because you are too young to have learned about it during that time in America and the world's history, read this book. If you want to know how it relates to more recent events, try my own memoir,Waiting for Westmoreland, that finally came out so many years later."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"A Conflict Can Change Any Child into an AdultThe Vietnam War is the only war in American history ever to be lost.Thousands of millions of lives were taken in those eight terrible years.Some say these soldiers had died for no reason because America eventuallywould lose, but any Vietnam Vet would tell one that they fought for theircountry to preserve freedom, end communism, and for the idea to spreaddemocracy. Philip Caputo felt he wanted to accomplish his thirst foradventure, avoiding all these things a soldier should stand for. Soon this youthfulidealism would change over time.Bored of sitting around in Japan, Caputo had finally received the messagethat would change his life. A message that he had been waiting for ever since hejoined the Marines, and it was the reason why he joined the Marines. It was hischance to quench his thirst for the adventure he had been longing for. The messagehad claimed the United States was going to enter a war. This wouldmark the beginning of his story to the end of a conflict, knownas the Vietnam War.The Marine Corps, including himself, expected quick and totalvictory over this Third World opponent. What they didn't expect was a ruthless,determined foe who confronted them without remorse in that tropical hell,mysterious enemies who were basically phantoms. He started out in charge of aplatoon in which he really couldn't lead and put on a mission to protect an airbase.Later Caputo was ordered to switch from his platoon to keeping track of peoplewounded and killed in war.Over the next year or more, Caputo yet again reclaimed his leadershipposition and had changed from an ordinary average Joe whose only desire was toreturn home and be greeted to parades celebration to an all-out commando whosharply barked the precise orders necessary to eliminate a communist foe. His pointof view of life was now completely changed. It was now that of a soldier who onlyknew to annihilate his opponent. At this moment, he now only wanted to be backhome with his family, a family which he once hated for its repetitive boringness. Heno longer cared to return home as a hero or not but just to simply return. Thus hewould become an adult over a period of 16 months.Caputo was court-martialed and was sent back home to suburban Illinois,like he wanted. He returned with a forever shattered self, which was his youthfulidealism of action, adventure and romance of war. He was physically whole, butemotionally wasted. In general, the men of Vietnam returned home knowing thatthey did not accomplish their mission of preserving freedom. Their onlyaccomplishment would be that they survived the chaotic blood fest of a war, andthat was all."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Does the title of my review call for an explanation? All right, then, it is this. Caputo created an account of his service experiences in the early part of America's military involvement in Vietnam, that is so crystal clear, I couldn't stand it. It was too close to being an eye-witness to events I did not want to witness or know about. Oh, I finished the book and even did a paper on it in college, but God alive, this was a read that wrenched emotion out of me on every page.Leaving behind life as a slightly privileged suburban kid in 1960's America, Caputo enlisted in the Marines Corps and became an officer. He was then sent straight off to Vietnam in about 1965, the height of US confidence for quick and total victory over this Third World opponent. What Caputo and his men encountered was a ruthless, determined foe who confronted them remorselessly in this tropical hell. Over the next year, Caputo is changed by his time in this \\"low-intensity\\" war until he is transformed into someone capable of ordering the execution of apparent Communist terrorists, who may have been nothing more than civilians in the wrong place at the wrong time. Caputo and several of his men are tried for this deed and had the sentiment regarding Vietnam been as volatile as it later became, he would perhaps have been convicted and jailed, but as it was, he escaped punishment and returned home a disillusioned cynic with \\"an above average service record.\\"A Rumor Of War is everything a memoir of a soldier ought to be.

His desire to lead front line troops gives way to descriptions of nights on the front lines and the hours of monotony and boredom.The honesty in this book is compelling. It is as though you are forced to experience and feel the emotions of a young man who is realizing for the first time that things in this world are not quite as rosy as they may appear from a distance.

Maurice"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"In keeping with the theme of this Memorial Day weekend, I would like to offer my thoughts on \\"A Rumor of War,\\" a classic tale of Vietnam. Philip Caputo has crafted one of the most moving and disturbing testaments to the men who fought and died in that far away land. When the book was first published in 1977, the New York Times called it \\"The troubled conscience of America speaking passionately, truthfully, finally.\\" I became aware of this classic memoir when my friend, Capt. Kyle Kalkwarf, West Point Class of 2002, told me that it was one of the best books about war he had ever read. He recommended that I add it to my reading list. He was right in doing so.Caputo's recollections of his time as a Marine in Vietnam are filled with anger and sorrow at the misbegotten policies promulgated in Washington and carried out with disastrous results by General Westmorland and his subordinates. The author makes it clear in his introductory remarks how he felt and feels about that war and the impact that it had upon him and his comrades in arms:\\"Beyond adding a few more corpses to the weekly body count, none of these encounters achieved anything; none will ever appear in military histories or be studied by cadets at West Point. Still, they changed us and taught us, the men who fought in them; in those obscure skirmishes we learned the old lessons about fear, cowardice, courage, suffering, cruelty and comradeship. Most of all, we learned about death at an age when it is common to think of oneself as immortal. Everyone loses that illusion eventually, but in civilian life it is lost in installments over the years. We lost it all at once, and in the span of months, passed from boyhood through manhood to a premature middle age. The knowledge of death, of the implacable limits placed on a man's existence, severed us from our youth as irrevocably as a surgeon's scissors had once severed us from the womb. And yet, few of us were past twenty-five. We left Vietnam peculiar creatures, with young shoulders that bore rather old heads. . .This book is partly an attempt to capture something of its [the war's] ambivalent realities. Anyone who fought in Vietnam, if he is honest about himself, will have to admit he enjoyed the compelling attractiveness of combat. It was a peculiar enjoyment because it was mixed with a commensurate pain. Under fire, a man's powers of life heightened in proportion to the proximity of death, so that he felt an elation as extreme as his dread. His senses quickened, and he attained an acuity of consciousness at once pleasurable and excruciating. It was something like the elevated state of awareness induced by drugs. And it could be just as addictive, for it made whatever else life offered in the way of delights or torments see pedestrian.\\" (Pages xv-xvii)Caputo's last comments in the section just quoted seem to be eerily in keeping with the themes of the stunning films, \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"In one of the most gripping passages in the book, Caputo recaptures the spectrum of emotions he felt during a helicopter assault - running the gamut from fear to courage:\\"A helicopter assault on a hot landing zone creates emotional pressures far more intense than a conventional ground assault. It is the enclosed space, the noise, the speed, and, above all, the sense of total helplessness. There is a certain excitement to it the first time, but after that it is one of the more unpleasant experiences offered by modern war. On the ground, an infantryman has some control over his destiny, or at least the illusion of it. In a helicopter under fire, he hasn't even the illusion. Confronted by the indifferent forces of gravity, ballistics and machinery, he is himself pulled in several directions at once by a range of extreme, conflicting emotions. Claustrophobia plagues him in the small space: the sense of being trapped and powerless in a machine in unbearable, and yet he has to bear it. Bearing it, he begins to feel a blind fury toward the forces that made him powerless, but has to control his fury until he is out of the helicopter and on the ground again. He yearns to be on the ground, but the desire is countered by the danger he knows is there. Yet, he is also attracted by the danger, for he knows he can only overcome his fear by facing it. His blind rage then begins to focus on the men who are the source of the danger - and of his fear. It concentrates inside him, and through some chemistry is transformed into a fierce resolve to fight until the danger ceases to exist. But this resolve, which is sometimes called courage, cannot be separated from the fear that has aroused it. Its very measure is the measure of that fear. It is, in fact, a powerful urge not to be afraid anymore, to rid himself of fear by eliminating the source of it. This inner, emotional war produces tension almost sexual in its intensity. It is too painful to endure for long. All a soldier can think about is the moment when he can escape his impotent confinement and release this tension. All other considerations, the rights and wrongs of what he is doing, the chances for victory or defeat in the battle, the battle's purpose or lack of it, become so absurd as to be less than irrelevant. Nothing matters except the final, critical instant when he leaps out into the violent catharsis he both seeks and dreads.\\" (Pages 277-8)Caputo's thoughtful and passionate recounting of the growing up that he did in the cauldron of Vietnam added to my understanding of what many of my generation experienced as they fought in Southeast Asia and returned to a country that had grown sick of the fighting. As our nation once again wrestles with combat fatigue and the questions of when to withdraw and how to withdraw from Iraq, I am grateful that this time around - unlike the situation that existed in the late \`60's and 70's - even those who oppose the war have not showered those returning from the Gulf with opprobrium. They desire our admiration and our gratitude.Thanks Kyle, for recommending this book, and for your continuing service to our nation.Al"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I have been reading a lot of books on the subject of the Vietnam War and Philip Caputo's is one of the most honest albeit graphic account of what it was really like. But the highlight for me was Mr.Caputo's moving tribute to a fallen conrade, Lt. Levy. I had to stop and put the book down to compose myself for I was near tears. It has to be one of the most eloquent elegys written for someone who in Mr.Caputo's belief died &quot;pro patria&quot;."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This was on the required reading list for a writing class I took last spring, and I wasn't exactly looking forward to hundreds of pages on the Vietnam War.

It begins with clear, concise prose, as the young man is clear in his goals and what his country &quot;stands for&quot; , and rises to poetry of a kind as the narrator descends into a confused hell, where his goal becomes simple survival and he is uncertain about his country and its values. The narrator's journey in his early twenties, is from a sobriety to a delirium and back again but on that return, the open, trusting individual, is transformed into a cold, hardened, and cynical Nam Vet. There is some especially good analysis of &quot;courage&quot; (p.294) and the nature of a patrol by a platoon (p.252). The passage on 240 has a music and power which I could imagine being quoted as a classic piece of war prose/poetry in which the phrase &quot;All secure. Situation remains the same&quot; is echoed five times throughout the piece in a kind of fugue. Great writing which summarises the misery and the exhaustion men suffered on patrol, especially the power of the landscape and climate to overpower."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I was born near the end of the Vietnam War and was raised in a strict military family. As I grew up I fantasized about becoming a war hero like my Uncle who was awarded the Silver Star in Vietnam and who suffered in the jungle along with Lt. Caputo and others. After reading A Rumor of War, that image that I had was quickly shattered as I was brought out of the movies and into the reality of what Indochina was really like in the Sixties and Seventies. The author uses language that captures your five senses and immerses you into the realm of darkness and hell that the men dealt with while in the &quot;bush&quot;. Now that I have been &quot;enlightened&quot; I can understand and am more compassionate for our veterans who have suffered through such a terrible ordeal. This book should be a mandatory read for anyone and especially for those who have idealized conceptions for the romance of war.

Lt Caputo is sent to Vietnam in the early days of conflict. His book is a successful attempt to describe battle and life as a soldier. His words let you \\"see\\" what happens. The physical descriptions of weather, terrain, insects, leeches, immersion foot and the hundred ways to sickness, disease and exhaustion are rich and vivid in appropriate detail.He succeeds in capturing the pain and stress of soldiering. The terrorizing night patrols are fraught with land mines, booby traps, ambushes and snipers. There are no holidays, no R&R;, troops are undermanned. The enemy is like a ghost. Innocent civilians suffer brutally from all sides. There are great uncertainties and ambiguities that make victory or progress impossible to define. All the time men die or are horribly injured or sick. The losses endlessly mount. Exhaustion is permanent. The potential for bad things to happen is at every turn.He is equally honest when reflecting on his own emotions and actions. He struggles with the contradictions of loving and hating war. Of both fighting and wondering what the h--- are we doing here?. He does not shirk from describing his own highly base actions. He tries to explain but I did not feel he was looking to justify himself.This is a valuable contribution to understanding war and valuing our soldiers. It's history, civics, ethics and empathy. Despite all the hurdles our soldiers did well. They obeyed orders, they fought hard and with discipline under conditions that they were never trained for physically, mentally or strategically.I highly recommend the book. \\"Matterhorn\\" by Karl Marlantes is a wonderful \\"near memoir\\" bookend as these 2 together cover the front and backend of the war."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I would not claim to have in depth knowledhge of this genre, but, notwithstanding, I blieve that Phillip Caputo's book is a \\"must read\\" on two counts - 1.the depiction of men at war and 2. the dwepiction of men at war in Vietnam.

General Harold G. Moore's &quot;We Were Soldiers Once...and Young&quot; as one of the best first person accounts to come from the Vietnam War. Caputo was not grievously wounded like Downs or Ron Kovic of &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; fame. His scars were more of the psychological variety. He served his country faithfully and for his efforts he was nearly court-martialed. Caputo is an excellent writer (he became a journalist after the war) and his descriptions are among the war's most vivid. Not a heroic tale, unless you consider that every man who went to Vietnam and did his duty rather than following the example of our current commander-in-chief is in his own way heroic."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Rumor Of War is about the 1st Battalion Third Marine Regiment in Vietnam.

Philip Caputo felt he wanted to accomplish his thirst foradventure, avoiding all these things a soldier should stand for. Soon this youthfulidealism would change over time.Bored of sitting around in Japan, Caputo had finally received the messagethat would change his life. A message that he had been waiting for ever since hejoined the Marines, and it was the reason why he joined the Marines. It was hischance to quench his thirst for the adventure he had been longing for. The messagehad claimed the United States was going to enter a war. This wouldmark the beginning of his story to the end of a conflict, knownas the Vietnam War.The Marine Corps, including himself, expected quick and totalvictory over this Third World opponent. What they didn't expect was a ruthless,determined foe who confronted them without remorse in that tropical hell,mysterious enemies who were basically phantoms. He started out in charge of aplatoon in which he really couldn't lead and put on a mission to protect an airbase.Later Caputo was ordered to switch from his platoon to keeping track of peoplewounded and killed in war.Over the next year or more, Caputo yet again reclaimed his leadershipposition and had changed from an ordinary average Joe whose only desire was toreturn home and be greeted to parades celebration to an all-out commando whosharply barked the precise orders necessary to eliminate a communist foe. His pointof view of life was now completely changed. It was now that of a soldier who onlyknew to annihilate his opponent. At this moment, he now only wanted to be backhome with his family, a family which he once hated for its repetitive boringness. Heno longer cared to return home as a hero or not but just to simply return. Thus hewould become an adult over a period of 16 months.Caputo was court-martialed and was sent back home to suburban Illinois,like he wanted. He returned with a forever shattered self, which was his youthfulidealism of action, adventure and romance of war. He was physically whole, butemotionally wasted. In general, the men of Vietnam returned home knowing thatthey did not accomplish their mission of preserving freedom. Their onlyaccomplishment would be that they survived the chaotic blood fest of a war, andthat was all."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Reading this you feel like you are right alongside the patrol. It's hard to get the images out of your head and its only reading material. Imagine being there! As the author of &quot;The Patriot's Way&quot; I recommend this book very much!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo's digestion of the Vietnam War is a merit not only to the degraded soldiers involved, but a glorification of a pushy parent. In this case, the pushy parent is the United States government. Phil Caputo, a young, daring, idealistic man who joined the Marines in search of adventure and unexpectedly come across his own meaning. Taking you into the trenches head first, Caputo exemplifies the tragic events of the war as the soldiers, who believed they living their fathers World War II legacy only found death. The journeys through the Vietnamese jungles slowly transform Caputo and in a way harden him. Being shot at, never knowing exactly why he's out there and ultimately the death of his friend blow his preconceived notions out of the blood drenched jungle waters. The thematic which rears its ugly head from time to time is \`natural human inclination versus duty.' In this case, the natural inclination was the why behind the war. Many soldiers did not know why they were fighting and were never given proper answers. However, the pressure from the US government is satiable. They want the soldiers to simply kill, and much like a baseball score, would deliver the winning numbers to the American public over the nightly news. Caputo's insight gives us a window view into how in reality; the soldiers were not at fault for the loss of the Vietnam War. In fact, the blame is placed upon the US government. With all of their secrets, special interests and bizarre motivations, they push American citizens to support the war and draft as many of them as they can. Through propaganda, patriotism takes a whole different meaning.In many ways, the fight that was waged in Vietnam was one that was doomed from the very beginning. The rooted purpose as to why the Americans landed on Vietnam was uncertain. Fighting the Viet Cong or the Viet Ming was much like trying to stop a water leak. Fighting through the jungle, the Americans faced a war unlike any other. The enemy was everywhere without a land marked base for the Americans to attack. Trying to stop this leak in one area, only meant that the leak would apply its pressure in another unexpected area. And throughout all of this, the American Citizens blamed the soldiers for everything. They blamed them for going to war, for loosing the war and even blamed those who had enough foresight to not fight in the war.Caputo's in the knee deep approach is a liberating view of the world. For so many years, the war had a lot of question marks written all over it. Many, simply believed that the war was lost because American soldiers were weak hippies. Caputo brings a different machine to the table as he gives us his through the eyes experience. His testimony gives us the fall of the romanticized idea of war, with its true horror, running around the jungle with no idea why your there, the loss of dear friends, the mechanistic view of death and numbers, endless despair and the overall frustration of fighting an enemy that in many ways was much like a ghost.Caputo describes the war much like an exercise in dehumanization, and I completely agree with him. I enjoyed the read simply because it gave me an insight I did not have before. The soldiers of this war were confused and were riding the wave of World War II. In reality, it was a sham. These soldiers were used simply as killing machines. Forced into combat with ideas of glory and honor. Ultimately, they found death and questions."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I thought this book was the best book on Vietnam that I have ever read. Its a facinating look into life as a line officer in a front line Marine Infantry batallion during the early part of the war.

What made the book especially valuable to me was Caputo's emotional narration of the horrors of war. Basically I agree with most of the other reviews praising this book, the only thing I would like to share are my own reflections of this era. His story brought back unhappy memories of a war based upon body counts. Which, as the author points out, were routinely falsified. The devastation of war on the youth during the Vietnam years has marked our views of war and has changed us forever. No longer will we accept a governmental decree of war without first thinking to ourselves the cost of such a conflict.This is very good book and one worth reading."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"An excellent read, one that should be required reading in the senior year of high school history class. Caputo details in fine prose the patriotism fueled idealism of his college years which lead, in part, to his enlisting in the USMC. The subsequent disillusionment with the futility of the war, coupled with the the first person choices between good and evil, are narrated in descriptive,knowledgeable prose. The author's deliniation between good people being placed in an evil hell, as opposed to intinsically evil people, give the coercive choice of wheather to retain basic goodness and one's humaness.I shudder when I think of how so many of us protested that war for all the wrong reasons.This work inadvertently exemplifies how we can be opposed to the current fiasco in Iraq and still be completely supportive of the USMC troops there.If I knew for fact that George W. was literate, I would mail him a copy of A Rumor of War."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"'A Rumor of War', along with James Webb's 'Fields of Fire', are the two best personal accounts of the Vietnam war.

It tells us how stupid it was, how pathetic the reasons were, how high the prices our own people paid were. This isn't one of my favorite books, but it is one of the best books on war I have ever read. For its genre, it definitely deserves five stars.Philip Caputo describes his experience in the war of Vietnam. He tells us what he saw, what he lived, how those things changed him and his life. He speaks with a sad tone, and the book is very sad, at times even depressing, but it is also very refreshing because it is so true and so heartfelt. Caputo expresses what he feels almost as if he were the only person in the world, not caring or saying what he says for anybody but for his own peace of mind. That is what makes this book so honest. There is nothing to dislike about his writing or the way he tells the story. Plainly, if anyone tells you they don't like it, it is because they don't agree with what it says. And how sad we won't admit it, because deep down we know, all of us, that Vietnam, just like Iraq, was a mistake."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This was the first war novel I have ever read, and I was amazed by the realness of the words. I have never been in war or close to war, but this book made me feel like I was next to Caputo during the hard times in Vietnam. I didn't understand war before reading his book, but now I definately have a clearer reason of why people result to war and what makes them so evil when they fight one another. This is an essential book for every person because it is real, and it is important in understanding the mind of a soldier.

I picked it up as bedtime reading to help me sleep, and it did anything BUT help me sleep! Caputo presents a rare glimpse into the idiocy that governed the 10+ year conflict that we call the Vietnam War. He exposes the fallacy of the casualty reports that those of us who lived throught that piece of history remember so well from the reports on the evening news as well as the oxymoron known as \\"army intelligence\\".

Caputo tells the story very well, and creates in the reader a vivid mental image of the conflict was like from the point of view of the American soldier in this foreign land.Caputo not only tells his story, but the story of thousands of other G.I.'s many whom never made it home or who came home in a box or with permanent disabilities. This valuable account of the early stages of the war is historically significant on many levels. Even after all these years, this book is as valuable and relevant as ever.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I read this in two sittings. This book consumes you. If you harbor any romanticized notions of combat, A Rumor of War will shatter them. Caputo joins the military for the same reason so many other young men do: to validate his masculinity through acts of valor. It is Caputo's story, but it could be the story of so many others. He &quot;escapes&quot; his banal suburban town and becomes a Marine officer. Soon the monotony of Marine training is replaced by the stark realities of combat. The reader can sense a gradual transformation of Caputo's pysche. At the onset of the conflict Caputo is transfixed and mesmerized by the carnage(he describes in lucid detail what brains look like as they spill from a man's skull). By the end of the book Caputo is savage and even bloodthirsty, completely callous and almost indifferent to the brutalities that surround him. I honestly think this book hits harder than any film can (saving private ryan, platoon, etc.) about how hellish combat is. Film can only utilize imagery, but literature, through words, more vividly captures the tattered consciousness of the participant. I thought the most disturbing part of the book was when Caputo recalls the euphoria that he felt when he finally accepted the inevitability of his own death. at that point i think he ceased to be human in the sense that most people know. the only thing that detracted from the book was the somewhat mundane descriptions of military logistics."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo describes the Vietnam War, or the &quot;the splendid little war&quot; as he ironically calls it, as his journey from being an enthusiastic idealist poisoned by the romanticized view of war as a chivalrous and noble enterprise to the dehumanized and desensitized wreck that he becomes during his tour in Vietnam. The book is an amazing testimony about the true nature of war with all its atrocities and horrors. Caputo brilliantly captures the endless despair of being strained in the jungle with no clear reason for being there, the hopeless madness of chasing the guerillas and the agony of loosing friends. But the most important aspect of this book is that it shows how a normal mentally healthy person can be turned in the course of a few months into a thoughtless killing machine, fast on the trigger, without any remorse for his victims. Caputo exploits very strong and vivid images such as &quot;pigs eating napalm-charred human corpses&quot; to force the reader into his story and make the reader feel what Caputo has felt. Every single high school student, every single gung-ho young kid in boot camp must read this book -it is about real war, real corruption, real deaths, and real emotional scars left for life.Very realistic book that cannot leave you indifferent, definitely up there with Remarque's &quot;All quiet on the Western front.&quot; If you want to know what fighting the Vietnam War was really like, I can't imagine how any book can possibly be better than Rumor of War."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"I think this book comes closest to achieving in literature what Platoon did for the movies, putting you in the war in Vietnam. Im not suggesting after reading this you will have a full grasp of the daily life in the Marine Corps outside Danang in 1965 but, hopefully, its as close as many of us will get. It is a horrible account of the disintegration of the human spirit and the humane sensibility that we all have. It takes us to very dark places and provides no easy answers, only tough questions evoked through powerful and beautiful writing. I have to stress the writing because it is exceptional.As the author states, it is a memoir of his experiences and not meant to be read as an overview of the war itself, but in many ways it is better than that, for instead of mere numbers, we are given the true nature of the war, one we were slowly pulled into and one we seemed to be unable to get out of. For me, I barely remember the Vietnam War and we barely discussed it in History class, but I think a book such as this would be an important addition to our history classes, especially in high school. Its not a long book. It is very intense and can be quite graphic at times but I was impressed that the author didnt dwell so much on the blood and guts but on the men themselves, who they were at the start and who they became later on. That is the fascinating and disturbing part of the book for me. It is philosophical without forcing it, dramatic in the best sense and one I know I will want to read again. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Caputo's first and most famous work \\"A Rumor of War\\" is a testimonial of his experiences as a 2nd lieutenant Marine serving in Vietnam in 1965.On the surface, this book will remind you of so many other testimonials. War is hell, war is bad. Caputo's version of events are so descriptively described, you can taste the dirt of Vietnam in your mouth, feel the grime on your skin and see the fog of what was one of America's worst mistakes.To get a good picture of what war is like and what it does to the human psyche, there is no better portrayal than what Caputo writes. You watch him turn from a gung-ho Marine being sent to protect a base from the VC, and maybe kill a few in the process, to a person so cynical, he orders his men to kill Vietnamese civilians and burn villages indiscriminately. The atrocities he and others committed were so great, you would expect him still serving a sentence in prison for his crimes. This is until you are reminded that this is a war, and that the hand of the US interests pushed him to insanity.I thought this book was an incredible read for anyone who wants a discriptive, hands-on look on the effects of war. Captuo is not a hero in this book, and even more so, I can't help but think that he profits off the innocent he killed. It affects me so much, I don't feel that a perfect score on this novel does those who were characters any justice for their deaths. That is the underlying irony in a book about a \\"splendid little war\\" that was only considered an authorized use of force by an executive order.This book plays so well into modern day politics and current events, there isn't any reason why \\"Rumor of War\\" should be tossed aside as irrelevant. So many similiarities in his tale sing to the tune of Americans serving in Iraq today. Anyone who is willing to delve into this novel will clearly see the picture, and taste the bitterness of it all."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This an excellent description of the beginning of the American ground involvement in Viet Nam. I especially like the way Caputo describes his and his fellow Marines' attitudes before they shipped out, and how they soon changed as they started to fight the war. It took me several reads to fully comprehend how much he and his fellows changed in less than a year. His account of the fall of Saigon is a real snapper too, when it's compared to the beginning of the book. A fine companion to the Best and The Brightest, and A Bright and Shining Lie."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"As a Marine veteran with 42 months (that's 3 1/2 years for you progressives)in Vietnam and having received three Purple Hearts during that time (less that one a year, not bad) I found that Philip Caputo really hit it right on with this book. One of the very best Vietnam novels that I have read, which are legion. Right yp there with Phaseline Green. You can tell he was out in Charlie country and not some REMF. Maybe I shouldn't have read it as it has brought back some memories that were best left buried.

He wanted readers to, \\"...feel the heat, the monsoons, and mosquitoes, to experience snipers, booby traps, and ambushes. Above all, I wanted to communicate the moral ambiguities of a conflict in which demons and angels traded places too often to tell one from the other, even within yourself. In a way, the book was designed to be a vicarious tour of duty...\\"He more than succeeded his objectives. Although the book was riveting, I had to force myself to keep reading about the deplorable conditions he and his Marines suffered day in and day out.

Just not interested.So when \\"Rumor\\" popped up on Amazon's suggested-read list, I about passed it by until I read some reviews. My interest was piqued on how a VN vet could be both anti-war and yet attracted to combat. I downloaded the Kindle version based solely on the reviews I read and I wasn't disappointed.If I'd experienced what Caputo and his men did, I'm sure my attitude/philosophy would be the same. I can't believe the insanity of trudging out day after day after day only to be blown to pieces by mines and booby traps. It's amazing the troops didn't revolt and frag the idiots who kept forcing them to walk the Purple Heart Trail!Fortunately for me, my tours were in the southern part of II Corps where the climate was more pleasant and the only dead I saw were VC. I never saw a dead American. The fact that I served with USSF also probably made a drastic difference.

This book has provided me with all the realism and horrifying detail of the war of my generation and the reasons those men wore the expressions in their eyes and displayed a numbness in their personalities. More than any films or other books of the Viet Nam war that I have since seen or read, \\"A Rumor of War\\" has presented and captured the pure folly, waste, and bravery of our ground forces of that time - and this has been presented in a beautiful, engrossing, literary style that gave me two sleepless nights when I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"There are a few books which I believe should be mandatory reading for everyone, regardless of age, social position, political leaning, etc. &quot;A Rumor of War&quot; by Philip Caputo is one of those books. I would put it at the top of the list of most important books of the 20th century. What Caputo does with remarkable skill and power is strip away all the myths that have ever been perpetuated about the act of war, whether those myths came from sanctimonious politicians, overly vocal patriotic robots, or bleeding hearts subject to knee-jerk bouts of insecere moral condescention.Caputo's approach is simple. He tells it like it was, without embellishment or concealment. He says early on in his forward that every word contained in the book is ture and thanks to his clear and lucid memory, the plausibility of his stories, and the attention paid to detail. He doesn't try to shock us with overwrought language or uptight narratives, he simply lets the truth present itself. He tells us what he did and why he did it; what he felt and why he felt it. The beauty of this approach is the empathy it inspires. It is not at all hard for the reader to imagine himself as Caputo in the jungle, waiting for the VC to show himself.&quot;A Rumor of War&quot; thrusts us into the heart of the Vietnam War, one of the most important and forgotten chapters of 20th century history. Through this book we bear witness to the essence of warfare, without the moralizations and distortions of those who make the wars, those who justify them, or those who condemn them. I think anyone in a position of power should be required to read this book, as should everyone else. It's not easy for the conscience to rest once we realize that this is the kind of world we live in."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"This is an autobiography of the author's Marine Corps experience in the early days of the Vietnam War. It was 1965 and the young officer didn't know what he was getting into. At first he was anxious to get into action, but all too soon he was disillusioned. It became apparent that this was a war that could not be won. This was the homeland of the Vietnamese and there was no way that American military intervention could change that.The writing is excellent. I really identified with him, especially the discomfort of living and fighting in a hot, moist country that with insects and skin diseases that just wouldn't go away. There was also the fatigue of long patrols, the filth and, especially, the constant fear of death. He saw too many of his fellow soldiers die and learned to live with the horror of it all. It was so bad that he eventually made a bad decision and was brought up on court martial charges.All of this is told in a way that kept my eyes glued to the page as I winced at his descriptions and couldn't help thinking about the waste of it all. This is a fine book full of historical significance. It tells it like it was. And it was awful."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"Phillip Caputo's \\"A Rumor of War\\" is one of the classic Vietnam War memoirs. Caputo served as lieutenant in the Marine Corps in Vietnam during the early days of the war (1965-1966). His battalion landed at Danang in March 1965, so his was one of the first combat units to serve in Vieetnam. He served two stints as a platoon leader with a brief interlude on the battalion staff.Caputo's memoir is brutal and honest. His brilliant writing captures his own fears, frustrations, and sadness with the war, the elusive enemy, and the loss of his men, while also recounting the occasional thrill he sometimes experienced leading men in combat. He even briefly faced court-martial charges for murder for the actions of his men. Inspired by Kennedy to serve his country, Caputo left Vietnam embittered and antiwar. Revealing in this book is the frustration felt by Caputo and his men, and their reaction to it (burning villages, tormenting suspected VC-sympathizers) during the early years in the Vietnam War.This memoir is a must-read for anyone interested in the Vietnam War or personal combat narratives."},{"Title":"A rumor of war: With a twentieth anniversary postscript by the author","review":"My father had an original hardcopy which I just read certain parts at random growing up. Several years later while browsing through a bookstore I came across it and decided to buy it and read it cover to cover.It is truly a great book that gives you insight into the mind of a soldier on from a brief coverage about life in boot camp until finally going in country.He honestly admits he arrived with dreams of having his name splashed over the news with accounts of his exploits and heroism until the end of his tour of duty where he finally leaves, disillusioned with the war, and his return as a reporter to cover the fall of Saigon.Many of the things Phillip Caputo covers in this book show that no matter how much bravado they show on the outside they still have many of the same fears of dying, of losing close friends, and how their experiences changed their idealism at the beginning of the war to truly try to help the South Vietnamese to one of just surviving their tour.He recounts his feelings when hearing the news a friends being killed in battle, the fear he felt when on patrol but a much greater fear of being branded a coward. Some memories are pretty funny as well, but there were also the accounts of how some soldiers broke under the pressure, or even going as far as making you feel outright indignation wit officers ordering soldiers to perform tasks that brought no benefit to conflict around them.Anyone who is interested is an honest account that does not paint a pro-American portrait of valor, heroism, and superiority in the face of overwhelming odds should read this book.

You can't put it down because you just have to keep reading to try and absorb what it is you're actually reading.As I was reading this I was reminded of the young Tom Cruise in \\"Born on the 4th\\". You could feel from the book that overwhelming Marine patriotism. After a few false starts the Marines get to Vietnam and start to do what they do best which is \\"dig in\\". Then they start to patrol. You can feel through the words the overwhelming sense of confusion but it's still subservient to the overwhelming sense of patriotism.The battalion starts to get picked apart by constant sniper fire and booby traps. Dead Guy here, blown up leg there and there's usually no one to shoot back at. Through all this the guys patrol for hours, sit in half submerged fox holes all night, endure a hellish environment of heat and bugs the likes of which we have no comprehension and they don't complain (too loudly) as they're doing what they've been told is right.The writer has a marvelous way of implicitly conveying his feelings through his choice of words as he describes life in Vietnam. You can feel his patriotism and belief in the war fray at the edges until that youthful patriotism and shiny, wide eyed outlook is basically full of holes and diminished. He reaches conclusions that are both horrible and terrifying when you are up to your eyeballs in a mess you can't get out of.Too many men have died, lost one or two limbs, or gone crazy, and it all seems for nothing as there isn't and never was a measure of success for the Marines. They'd take a hill one day and have to take the same hill a week later. Very very frustrating for men on the ground who's sole purpose as infantry is to gain ground.Excellent book.

Philip Caputo has crafted one of the most moving and disturbing testaments to the men who fought and died in that far away land. When the book was first published in 1977, the New York Times called it \\"The troubled conscience of America speaking passionately, truthfully, finally.\\" I became aware of this classic memoir when my friend, Capt. Kyle Kalkwarf, West Point Class of 2002, told me that it was one of the best books about war he had ever read. He recommended that I add it to my reading list. He was right in doing so.Caputo's recollections of his time as a Marine in Vietnam are filled with anger and sorrow at the misbegotten policies promulgated in Washington and carried out with disastrous results by General Westmorland and his subordinates. The author makes it clear in his introductory remarks how he felt and feels about that war and the impact that it had upon him and his comrades in arms:\\"Beyond adding a few more corpses to the weekly body count, none of these encounters achieved anything; none will ever appear in military histories or be studied by cadets at West Point. Still, they changed us and taught us, the men who fought in them; in those obscure skirmishes we learned the old lessons about fear, cowardice, courage, suffering, cruelty and comradeship. Most of all, we learned about death at an age when it is common to think of oneself as immortal. Everyone loses that illusion eventually, but in civilian life it is lost in installments over the years. We lost it all at once, and in the span of months, passed from boyhood through manhood to a premature middle age. The knowledge of death, of the implacable limits placed on a man's existence, severed us from our youth as irrevocably as a surgeon's scissors had once severed us from the womb. And yet, few of us were past twenty-five. We left Vietnam peculiar creatures, with young shoulders that bore rather old heads. . .This book is partly an attempt to capture something of its [the war's] ambivalent realities. Anyone who fought in Vietnam, if he is honest about himself, will have to admit he enjoyed the compelling attractiveness of combat. It was a peculiar enjoyment because it was mixed with a commensurate pain. Under fire, a man's powers of life heightened in proportion to the proximity of death, so that he felt an elation as extreme as his dread. His senses quickened, and he attained an acuity of consciousness at once pleasurable and excruciating. It was something like the elevated state of awareness induced by drugs. And it could be just as addictive, for it made whatever else life offered in the way of delights or torments see pedestrian.\\" (Pages xv-xvii)Caputo's last comments in the section just quoted seem to be eerily in keeping with the themes of the stunning films, \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"In one of the most gripping passages in the book, Caputo recaptures the spectrum of emotions he felt during a helicopter assault - running the gamut from fear to courage:\\"A helicopter assault on a hot landing zone creates emotional pressures far more intense than a conventional ground assault. It is the enclosed space, the noise, the speed, and, above all, the sense of total helplessness. There is a certain excitement to it the first time, but after that it is one of the more unpleasant experiences offered by modern war. On the ground, an infantryman has some control over his destiny, or at least the illusion of it. In a helicopter under fire, he hasn't even the illusion. Confronted by the indifferent forces of gravity, ballistics and machinery, he is himself pulled in several directions at once by a range of extreme, conflicting emotions. Claustrophobia plagues him in the small space: the sense of being trapped and powerless in a machine in unbearable, and yet he has to bear it. Bearing it, he begins to feel a blind fury toward the forces that made him powerless, but has to control his fury until he is out of the helicopter and on the ground again. He yearns to be on the ground, but the desire is countered by the danger he knows is there. Yet, he is also attracted by the danger, for he knows he can only overcome his fear by facing it. His blind rage then begins to focus on the men who are the source of the danger - and of his fear. It concentrates inside him, and through some chemistry is transformed into a fierce resolve to fight until the danger ceases to exist. But this resolve, which is sometimes called courage, cannot be separated from the fear that has aroused it. Its very measure is the measure of that fear. It is, in fact, a powerful urge not to be afraid anymore, to rid himself of fear by eliminating the source of it. This inner, emotional war produces tension almost sexual in its intensity. It is too painful to endure for long. All a soldier can think about is the moment when he can escape his impotent confinement and release this tension. All other considerations, the rights and wrongs of what he is doing, the chances for victory or defeat in the battle, the battle's purpose or lack of it, become so absurd as to be less than irrelevant. Nothing matters except the final, critical instant when he leaps out into the violent catharsis he both seeks and dreads.\\" (Pages 277-8)Caputo's thoughtful and passionate recounting of the growing up that he did in the cauldron of Vietnam added to my understanding of what many of my generation experienced as they fought in Southeast Asia and returned to a country that had grown sick of the fighting. As our nation once again wrestles with combat fatigue and the questions of when to withdraw and how to withdraw from Iraq, I am grateful that this time around - unlike the situation that existed in the late \`60's and 70's - even those who oppose the war have not showered those returning from the Gulf with opprobrium. They deserve our admiration and our gratitude.Thanks Kyle, for recommending this book, and for your continuing service to our nation.Al"},{"Title":"RMS Queen Mary: The World's Favorite Liner","review":"This is a must have for Queen Mary fans.

You see, in the effort to restore a vintage BMW, most of the little details that you need can be found online in the many user forums devoted to the subject.

Walker's treatment of these subjects is inadequate, compared to Zimmerman and Hackett's. Also, the bulk of Walker's book is a discussion of various technical systems of the bike.

XI)","review":"The destruction of the Shenandoah was among the most tragic events of the war. It was rich in beef and grain, and from its exit at Harper's Ferry a Confederate force could attempt to capture Washington from the rear. This happened time and again. When Grant began his great drive on Richmond to end the war in 1864, he needed to assure that a rebel force did not slip around him through the valley to again threaten Washington. Sheridan was ultimately assigned the task of assuring an army could find no sustenance there. \\"If a crow tried to fly across the valley it would starve to death, \\" he boasted to Grant.This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G. Nicolay(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth - M.F. Force(3) The Peninsula - Francis Winthrope Palfrey(4) The Army under Pope - John Goodman Ropes(5) The Antietam & Fredericksburg(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Abner Doubleday(7) The Army of the Cumberland - Henry M.

Mahan (yes, the Mahan)I suggest reading the land volumes as follows:I. The Outbreak of Rebellion.From here you can follow either East or West Theatre first:IIA - Eastern Theatre(3) The Peninsula - after the failure of Bull Run, and attempt is made to capture Richmond by a naval landing.(4) The Army under Pope; while Union troops are evacuating from the failed peninsula effort, Lee turns on Pope and inflicts another defeat at 2nd Bull Run. Lee then attempts to cross the Potomac and invade the north.(5) The Antietam & Fredericksburg; McClellen having returned from the peninsula stops Lee's invasion at Antietam but fails to destroy his army. Burnside takes over and pursues Lee to Fredericksburg, where the Union army self-destructs in an assault on its fortified heights.(6) Chancellorsville & Gettysburg - Hooker replaces Burnside and tries to take the Union army around Fredericksburg, but is bluffed from the dense forests around Chancellorsville. Lee again breaks free and this time invades Pennsylvania but is stopped at Gettysburg.(11) The Shenandoah Valley in 1864; this valley is a thorn in the Union's flank, and is ultimately razed so Union forces can operate more freely in the east.(12) Virginia Campaign of '64 & '65; Lincoln is desperate to end the war. Grant promises to do so at a price. It will be bloody, but he wants all losses immediately replaced to his army remains at full strength during the long bloody grind to Richmond.IIB- Western Theatre(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth; The Confederacy hoped to fortify the upper Mississippi in Missouri and Kentucky as a jumping off point to invade the north. Grant wrests the initiative, and with the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson. After Grant's decisive victory at Shiloh, the Union never loses the initiative in the west.(8) The Mississippi; the struggle for Vicksburg, which puts the entire Mississippi in Union hands.(7) The Army of the Cumberland; the struggle for Chattanooga; Union defeat at Chickamauga, besieged at Chattanooga, final breakout of the siege.(9) Atlanta; Union drive down the critical rail line through hard country from Chattanooga to Atlanta.(10) March to the Sea & Franklin/Nashville; after Atlanta, Sherman's famed march to the sea, after which he very nearly links up with Grant driving down on Petersburg.CAUTION:This series is public domain. Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work. Here is the DSI edition:&lt;...>The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such. This is merely a reader who has derived great personal pleasure from this series. I've tried to convey a sense of what was so enjoyable to me."},{"Title":"More Classic Knits for Baby Dolls","review":"This Australian lady is a wonderful knitter and a longtime lover of dolls. She clarifies and otherwise translates vintage doll knitting from various sources so that modern doll lovers can make suitable clothing. I have all Ms. Fainges other books and can't wait to dip into this one. The neat thing about this author is her precision and the way she gives knitting instructions by number of stitches and number of rows. In this way, a sweater knitted with fine yarn for a tiny doll can be made by the same instructions with fatter yarn for a much larger doll and remain in proportion. She gives needle size equivalents, figures for gauge, and detailed garment measurements, i.e., waist to &quot;crutch.&quot; I love this author! Her other books are thoughtfully arranged, the model dolls identified, discussion of types of yarn and sources. The book is a bargain, too. Thank you, Marjorie!

Dr. Droleskey uses his extensive knowledge of Catholic political and social teaching to expose the flaws in the system, both theoretical and practical; and to map out a strategy for Catholics who wish to use the system to combat the terrible social consequences of those flaws, and at the same time not allow their principles to be compromised through subservience to the flawed system itself. A must read!"},{"Title":"Christ in the Voting Booth","review":"\\"Christ in the Voting Booth\\" is outstanding. A concise, very well written compendium of the Catholic Faith. Dr. Droleskey explains the Church founded by Jesus Christ, what it believes and what it teaches. The author has grasped very simply but very powerfully the problem of modern day society. For reasons explained, there will never be any lasting resolution until the basic truths enunciated are accepted and practiced.The author's position is fully documented, juxtaposing Scripture and the prophetic wisdom of well known papal encyclicals with historic facts. In the process, the reader is enriched by the many historical, political, philosophical, and theological insights.This book is not only a surprise find, it is a major accomplishment. It is a profoundly spiritual book, while at the same time of major practical importance. It focuses and explains the life-giving and essential relationship between Jesus Christ, His Church, and society. Read it.

The thing that I enjoy most about books of this type, is the ability to look at large pictures of the rooms and then have a breakdown of them so that you can figure out how to create the look for yourself.

The author recounts trips through an older Pennsylvania where farming and mining were the economic base. There is reat color and emotion in his descriptions of the history of places and people who depended on the SchuYlkill for their livelihood. We are still drinking the sweet, soft Schuylkill water to this day in Philadelphia, which draws the supply from very far upriver.For those readers not familiar with the Central and Eastern Pennsylvania countryside and its towns, this book provides good insight into what made the region tick. The narrative takes you from the upper coal regions, through the splendid Berkshire Range, the great Revolutionary battlefields, and down through Philadelphia to its estuary on the lower Delaware river.The author's style is succinct yet poetic - here is a fine historic depiction of the river as it passes southeast out of the deep countryside and down into Philadelphia: \\"When the Schuylkill River Valley was first navigated by Europeans in the 17th century, its inhabitants were the Lenape Indians, a relatively peaceful race of fishermen and trappers. The Indians called the river Manayunk, meaning \\"while we drink.\\" It was, however, a Dutchman who gave the river its current name, which means the Hidden Creek. \\"For tradition has it that the mouth of the stream on that summer day, three centuries ago when the Dutch explorer first saw it, was partially hidden by tall bulrushes. I was struck by the fact that the Schuylkill River, for which the Center is named, is invisible from its grounds. After spending an afternoon in search of the river, I realized that it lies hidden behind a very large embankment at the base of Smith's Run, which flows through a small manmade tunnel to join with the river. I was interested in the fact that this network of tributaries physically connects the grounds of the Center to the city of Philadelphia.\\"Each chapter opens with a beautiful etched frontispiece depicting characteristics of the region visited, and the board liners fly leaves are a map of the entire Schuylkill watershed region. We have posted as many photos of the book as Amazon would allow us to upload - please have a look.This book provides good insight into the importance of the river in the development of Pennsylvania. If you are planning a trip through the most historic and scenic towns and countryside of Pennsylvania, this book is a good place to start planning an itinerary. Being PA natives ourselves, we cannot recommend a tour of the old Coal Regions as part of a vacation trip, unless you are a fossil and crystal hunter. However, keep in mind that the great breweries of Pennsylvania took their water from the Schuylkill river, the oldest in the country being the Yuengling Brewery of Pottsville. If you're getting off the Interstate (I-78) at Route 61 for sporting goods shopping below Pottsville, you can pick up a detail map of the good fishing locations along the upper Schuylkill. And don't miss the Indian Head rock on the way north through the gorge to Pottsville - It's on your left as you enter the gorge. Every couple of years someone gets up there and paints in the red face and white feathers...that's Pennsylvania for shoor, once't-now-anyhow!But we digress - The book's main importance for us is the historical perspective applied to each place the author visited, and his descriptive precision of a much older, more powerful lifeline for the folk of Pennsylvania."},{"Title":"Tte Tte (Tete a Tete)","review":"C-B's portraits challenge his journalistic work with their grace and power. I almost find them to be more historically important than his other work for two reasons- 1) his style photojournalism is artful but perhaps less documentative than it could be. 2) The significant style with which he captures his often famous portaitees encapsulates their entire being- they are often the first image to come to mind when one thinks of the sitter, they are simply extremely telling and powerful pictures."},{"Title":"Tte Tte (Tete a Tete)","review":"This is a very nice collection of portraits by HCB, showing the master's uncanny touch at framing and capturing the moment. This book is a cumulative experience - look at all the photos in the book - they look deceptively simple, but you'll end up wondering how he did it. The reproduction is very nice, but I found the sepia-like tone slightly annoying, but easy to ignore."},{"Title":"Tte Tte (Tete a Tete)","review":"I purchased the hardcover version of this book about 8 years ago, when i was younger. I was quite impressed with the work of HCB, but now many years later whenever i open the book, i always find something i didnt really see before.

I just wanted to comment, for anyone like me who doesn't particularly enjoy football or well-known football players, that I enjoyed this book in spite of that. Besides being interesting, it's also entertaining and funny. When I decided to read it I thought I'd probably give up on it before I finished it. I was wrong. If you're undecided about reading it, I strongly recommend that you do. I don't think you'll be sorry."},{"Title":"Keep It Simple","review":"This book has Terry Bradshaw's Public Trademark self-depreciating humor. It tells the reader Basic Stuff and platitudes to live by - focus on the positive, etc. etc. No deep Zen here. I enjoyed it for awhile - but something became more and more amiss. To mix football metaphors, he kept piling on the dead ball fouls until my patience clock ran out. Terry whines about his 3/3 marriages and divorces. Hey! Game over! Get on with it! An especially long and vitriolic rant is rained upon Divorce Lawyers. It becomes evident that what we have here is a misogynist attempting to hide under pseudo-humor. The guy whines for a June Cleaver Stepford Wife who just happens to be SI Swimsuit Issue cover-girl material. Pass this one."},{"Title":"Keep It Simple","review":"If you like Terry Bradshaw, you'll love this book.

I bought about every book in the store that existed, so I had to settle for this one. I hate Terry Bradshaw.Well, I used to hate him. :) This book opened up my eyes. It was the only book I ever really loved, in the 6 months I had that job. I've read it twice now, and I'm sure number 3 is on its way! Read this book!! You don't need to be a football fan, as there is very little about football in here. It's educational and motivational. Definately worth the money!"},{"Title":"Keep It Simple","review":"Wow! This is an amazing book! As soon as I finished it, I started it again. Every human being needs to read this. It doesn't matter if you are a football fan or not, there is valuable information here that will make you a better person for having read. The man has an awesome sense of humor, and has lead a very exciting life. There is so much to him! His book the year before, &quot;It's Only A Game&quot; is also excellent reading. I can not think of any type of person who would not benefit from the words of wisdom contained within this book. Furthermore, this will do away with any misguided notions relating to his lack of intelligence. You are reading it here people - the man is brilliant.

It incorporates what he says when giving his motivational speeches at business functions. I enjoyed it for light recreational reading, but probably would not have purchased it if it hadn't been discounted."},{"Title":"Keep It Simple","review":"\\"We are all searching for the same thing: a hand to hold and heart to understand...Keep it simple. Smile a lot. Be nice to other people.... Life is a joy. (8)\\" This quote pretty much sums up the attitude of Terry Bradshaw's Keep it Real.The tone in which he gives the theme is just amazing. It got me attached right off the bat. I might have been attached to this book because I love the game of football. Well, first off, that's why I got the book. I went to the public library, saw that ugly, bald guy who I have to tolerate when he broadcasts the Saint's games, and I got it. I got it simply because I like football, not Terry Bradshaw, and I wanted another sports book to read, hoping it would fuel me in the sports I play. This book brought a lot more out of me besides the motivation I was looking for to help me with baseball. It made me realize that I can connect to Terry Bradshaw in many ways. He is not afraid to tell the readers what he is bad at and isn't scared to state the mistakes he made. Many people today, especially when writing a book about themselves, talk about their triumphs and maybe a few of their failures, hiding the ones they are embarrassed about. Terry simply lays it all out for the reader. He did not belong on TV because he was terrible at broadcasting and making commercials. He was not the smartest man alive. He talks too much. He is tremendously struck with attention deficit disorder. He failed three marriages. He is ugly. Last but definitely not least is that he paid for two ostrich eggs that costed him 7,000 bucks. I would not do my homework with Terry nor would I want to watch him broadcasting the NFL games on Sundays.There is more I learned about Terry than who to auction a pair of ostrich eggs to. I learned that he is a tremendous motivational speaker. His insight on many aspects of life had me thinking. He used his failures and turned them into life changing experiences. Terry knew what he was good at and stuck to it. He was a hell of a football player and now is a tremendous motivational speaker. That is how he shines. Well, he also shines because he is balding in the front, but most people can see him shine through his insights. His ideas on being a genuine person flourish. When he begins the book by asking to hug the closest person to you and smile the best you ever smiled, you know that you are in for a treat. He was asking for a smile at the beginning of the book and once you got into the book, he didn't even have to ask anymore. His humorous stories, such as the ostrich eggs I mentioned earlier, just kept me smiling. In many of his chapters that covered surviving love, financial problems, the value of teamwork, and overcoming failures Terry offers the simple lessons he has learned through his friends, family, and faith.In conclusion, I believe that Bradshaw's insight on life is a must read for those who have the same problems as him. Terry Bradshaw is now the man and I have everybody thinks the same. Keep it real."},{"Title":"Keep It Simple","review":"I laughed so hard at the chapter on golfing that the people around me thought I was loosing control! A great book, with heart and honesty.

Made me want to spend time with him in person (instead of just on Sundays before the football games,) and encourage his many endeavors."},{"Title":"Keep It Simple","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, lots of laughs and an easy read!

It had me on the edge of my seat not knowing what was going to happen next! It is a story about tragedy, lost love, the unexplained, and is just a wonderful read for people who love psychic crime, and the thrill of justice being served."},{"Title":"Red Eye of Justice","review":"Alternates between uninformed and dull. What starts out as a mystery in a granite quarry quickly degenerates into a soap opera peopled with names rather than characters. The basic story of a wishy-washy musician's affair with a married woman, producing twin daughters who are separated as children, is obscured by far too much extraneous material, including the quarry. I was particularly annoyed by the absence of a reunion of the twins, in spite of hereditary psychic gifts.The novel is full of hooks and teasers that never seem to develop into resolutions. It feels like a background workbook for 4 or 5 or 6 different stories, most of them trite. The only item genuinely new to me was the average Catholic's view of marriage and child bearing, a theme I've never seen treated in a novel. I wish this theme had been expanded in more informative ways to explain the guilt and escapism exhibited by the characters.The so-called granite quarry was a complete mystery to me. Why the heroes used ropes and planks to lower themselves into a chasm instead of modern climbing equipment and why they slept on a ledge and how they got moved to another part of the quarry by a ghost... well, I don't know. As an avid reader of the likes of Archer Mayor, who writes convincing detective fiction set in Vermont (including one at a quarry), my advice to Ms Kelley is please do some homework as simple as a visit to a real granite quarry in Barre. Also, call your locale by its real name -- Vermont not \\"Vernon\\". If you love and live in a place, you should describe it like a travel brochure.Any first-time writer should be careful to distinguish between what you write from the scraps of your life and what you publish to entertain the world with. Consider a scribble book intended only to vent your spleen and practice your craft. Concentrate with a reader's eye on the story you intend to tell someone else. There's a lot of competition for eyes out here in Readerland!"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"Not up to Barbara Tuchman's usual standard, but still worth reading. I found the section on Mexico very interesting and full of new information, more than the telegram itself. I thought the buildup to the telegram's release went on too long and was hyped, and lost interest in it by that time."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I have read all of Barbara Tuchman's books and learned so much of world history. She is so thorough and at the same time entertaining. I first read this book by a swimming pool in Manila, Philippines. I came to a part where it read that Pancho Villa rode through Hermosillo, Mexico, shooting out all the shop windows, except one; the local shop of Krakauer, Zork, and Moye, the leading hardware wholesaler in El Paso and the leading supplier of guns and ammunition to both sides in the Mexican Revolution. That is what this book is all about; the little known attempt by Germany to help keep the US out of World War I by keeping America too busy on our southern border to worry about Europe. The ludicrous offer to the Mexican government was the promised return of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Fortunately, the British intercepted the telegram and that was the trick that brought America into the war which won it.I was born and raised in El Paso, Texas and my grandfather, for whom I am named, worked for Krakauer, Zork, and Moye, and I learned later he would disappear into Mexico on his horse for weeks at a time. But it wasn't until I read this book did I know why. Through family photos and records, I confirmed it was my grandfather who sold the guns. The Zimmerman Telegram tells all about this little known episode. It plays a sub-story in my upcoming book, Dos Gringos, about my immigrant father's escapades in Mexico at that time, dodging bullets sold to both sides, unknown to him, by his future father-in-law.All of Tuchman's books are wonderfully informative and well worth all the plaudits she has received.Frederick R. Andresen, author of Walking on Ice, An American Businessman in Russia."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"What I like best about Barbara Tuchman as a history writer is the sense of humor and amazement that you can hear in her writing as she talks about the foibles of history and its dramatis personae. I do not like The Zimmerman Telegram as much as I like its big brother,The Guns of August. It is a dense treatment of a pivotal incident relating to the Great War, rather than a larger treatment of the conflict itself. This doesn't make it bad, but I was glad that I read The Zimmermann Telegram after having read Guns of August.The Zimmerman telegram was one of the instruments that contributed to bringing the US into the Great War. Tuchman focuses on the events that led up to the fateful telegram and touches on relevant issues such as Mexican politics, code-breaking, and US neutrality.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"World War I has receded into the fog of history for most Americans - recent surveys show that the average American knows as much about The Great War as they do the War of 1812 or the Spanish-American War. In other words, not much.Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" is a perfect remedy to this embarrassment. One of St. Tuchman's earlier works, \\"TZT\\" is short - barely clocking in at over 200 pages, plus footnotes. But the book gains strength from its lean stature - this is not a bloated history filled with peripheries, tangents, or fantasies by the writer.Instead, Tuchman stays focused on the personalities and national interests involved. America was desperate to stay out of World War I, as was President Woodrow Wilson (driving Teddy Roosevelt to distraction as he suffers outside the halls of power). England and France were desperate for America to join the Allies, but if the million-man casualty figures wouldn't make Wilson budge, what could they do? And Germany was desperate to keep America out of the war - its economic might and vast resources would wrap up the affair pretty quickly.And so Germany got clever - too clever by half. The Zimmerman Telegram contained an offer to open up a new front to keep America busy - by having Japan and Mexico form an alliance and attack the soft underbelly of the U.S. This plot, the Germans promised, would yield much of the Southwest back to Mexico, restoring national pride and shifting the global balance of power.And yet, thanks to German arrogance and British code-breakers, the Brits found themselves with the ultimate smoking gun - the Zimmerman Telegram.Tuchman tells this riveting tale with insight, detail, and verve. The pages fly by in this highly readable history, and any reader will have his or her interest in the WWI era raised several notches.This is a must-read for fans of American history."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"you might think it too contrived. This is an intriguing story, incredibly well written, by one of the best authors of the period. The story concerns the German government's double-dealing during WWI and their efforts to keep the U.S. out of the European theater by any means possible. To tell more would be unfair to the reader of this review, but suffice it to say that this roughly 200 page paperback is a one day read that will leave you well informed and most entertained."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"\\"We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the USA neutral. In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on the following terms: Make war together. Make peace together. Generous financial support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the President [of Mexico] of the above most secretly, as soon as the outbreak of war with the USA is certain and add the suggestion that he should on his own initiative invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace.\\"Zimmermann Telegram So reads the so-called \\"Zimmermann Telegram,\\" in which Germany tried to keep the United States out of the Great War in Europe by fomenting trouble on the already-tense southern border and to the west from Japan. Barbara Tuchman's The Zimmermann Telegram chronicles Germany's entrance into the War and her efforts to keep the U.S. neutral, even as England attempted to persuade the U.S. to join the Allies.Woodrow Wilson worked furiously to negotiate a \\"peace without victory\\" in Europe even while trying to keep southern tensions at bay.Problems south of the border were an immediate concern for Wilson, who was inaugurated just as a coup in 1913 brought most of Mexico under the control of General Victoriano Huerta, \\"a pure-blooded Indian with a flat nose, a bullet head, a sphinx's eyes behind incongruous spectacles, and a brandy bottle never far from his hand\\" and considered \\"everything abhorrent\\" by Wilson.Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II had for years been plotting to manage all of the affairs of Europe, imagining himself alone sufficiently competent to carry the terrible burden. As he was able to influence his \\"cousin Nicky\\" (the Tsar of Russia) to carry out his plans, Wilhelm started looking further, to Venezuela and finally to Mexico-ultimately joining the U.S. in meddling in her affairs. He had an elaborate scheme involving Japan would ultimately lead the U.S. actually to invade (even to annex) Mexico and the rest of Latin America to respond favorably to an offer from Germany to beat back American expansion.Unfortunately for Wilhelm, the Germans were not as smart as he had imagined, nor were the British so clueless. Some excellent intelligence work by a small group known simply as \\"Room 40\\" managed to produce definite evidence of Germany's aggression and to convince President Wilson to lead the U.S. into war against Germany, bringing in money, supplies, and a much needed boost of morale in the Allies' darkest moments.The story is masterfully told: several themes are weaved together to carry the reader effortlessly through the intrigues of international politics at the dawn of the twentieth century. Writing in the text is a pleasure to read, engaging and elegant. Tuchman is best known for her later works including The Guns of August (which influenced President Kennedy greatly during the Cuban Missile Crisis), but even this early work stands out as excellent presentation of history. I managed to acquire a copy of an edition produced by The Folio Society, bound in cloth, complete with a case. The book is typeset nicely and includes photographs of critical characters such as Wilson, Wilhelm, Admiral Sir William Reginald Hall, Huerta, General Venustiano Carranza, and General Pancho Villa.Any student of history is sure to find The Zimmermann Telegram an enlightening work on a critical moment in history and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;-Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I also like to read history's books.And this book is good to read.The subject of this book is the relation, between USA, Mexico, Germany and Japan, in two firsts decades of XX Century.If this is history's book, the historical facts showed in this book are sometimes, comics or similar to absurds.Even so, this is a correct book.The failures of this book are small.To example, Woodrow Wilson went to be against Huerta, by racial prejudices or by economic reazons?"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"If we remember anything at all from our high school history class about why the United States got into World War I, it might have something to do with unrestricted submarine warfare. But the Zimmermann Telegram, if it was even mentioned, has long disappeared from memory, along with most of the other \\"facts\\" we learned in school. Barbara Tuchman, in this superb little book, makes a strong case for the argument that it was the revealing of the contents of this one message that convinced the American public that war with Germany was necessary.The account reads like a spy thriller, which in fact it is. But there is not one statement which cannot be documented. Tuchman had access to American, British and German records which clearly illustrate the process of decision-making for each of the governments involved. The author has a knack for encapsulating her view of the often unimpressive character of the major players.By 1916 World War I had degenerated into a horrible bloody stalemate from which there was no escape. Each side was desperate for fighting to end, but could accept nothing less than defeat of the enemy. None of the belligerents were prepared to consider Wilson's efforts toward \\"peace without victory.\\" The only solution for the Allies was to bring the United States into the war, and for the Central Powers, to keep her out. Germany was convinced that, through unrestricted submarine warfare, against neutral as well as belligerent shipping, she could force Britain to capitulate in a few months. The Allies were hoping for a German blunder that would finally drag the U.S. into the war, and Britain did have a secret weapon of which the Germans knew nothing; she had broken the German diplomatic code and was reading all German international messages, both cable and radio. How this all played out is the theme of this little volume. It is illuminating, with respect to this important turning point in world history, and to the processes by which nations are governed."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I approached this as a general reader in search of a good read, not as a historian. It was a good read, and I learned much more about a piece of our history that I last studied nearly 30 years ago. Tuchman writes with urgency and though her work is well documented, her narrative is never bogged down by wavering, stuttering scholarspeak or footnotes that lie like logs and potholes on the way to the next sentence. Some may argue her premise, that the revelation of the Zimmerman telegraph was the one motivator that would compel Wilson to finally send American troops into World War I combat, but Tuchman makes a persuasive case. Her strengths beyond a capable writing style lie in character development of the players on two sides of the Atlantic and an ability to track all of their movements with clarity as they converge on the fateful entrance of the US into the conflict. In reading this, I was reminded that our contemporary Congress is not unique in its image-conscious, bull-headed, snappish judgment. I was especially taken by what is obviously a legacy of the Civil War, the deep-rooted American fear of conflict on its own soil."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I have read several of Tuchman's books and like her style.

I recommend the book but feel that I must tell all, that at times it can be boring, but stick with it, because it does get better."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"The tendency over time (and even while it's happening) is to strip history down to a series of simplistic events and convenient anecdotes. I've never been able to understand why this happens as most people seem to make the heaving and ho-ing of forces and stresses within their own heavily rationalized lives far more complicated than, say, the bewildering complexities that lead up to the start of the Second World War. Listen to any Leftist spout the minimalist canon about Viet Nam or Iraq and then listen to them go on for hours about all the reasons--social, psychological, neurochemical, personal historical--why they can't, for instance, quit smoking. It's loads of fun.[Author's note: for funsies go on to any Left-winger you know about how Rome and Carthage went to war years ago over oil. They'll grapple for a while with a word they've never heard before (Carthage) but nod eagerly over the oil explanation. Then, to be extra wicked, explain that it was baby oil they fought over and the evil Carthaginians (they treated women and minorities terribly, that's what made them evil) made it from REAL BABIES. Important: make it clear that the Carthaginians were white and patriarchal so you aren't accused of hate speech! If this is done with a straight face and with serious tone it'll be swallowed in one gulp. I know, I've done it]What the author does here is pull back the curtain a bit on all the machinations and plots surging to and fro in the world prior to WWI. Did you know the Japanese--generally fairly friendly to us--were very interested in establishing a naval base in Mexico? You see we were always their only rivals in the Pacific--that's why the Great White Fleet stopped in by for a visit and a muscle flex. Then there's Kaiser Bill, a guy who idolized our Teddy Roosevelt, plotting away to trip us up and maybe even carve us up. Things like that. After a read of this type one gets a better sense of why the US was so hot-to-trot over an American canal in Panama, why we wanted a base in the Phillipines, and so on. You see, back then, like now, the world was a den of wolves and backstabbers. Between 1900 and 1920 the US could have easily, and without doin' nuthin' much, gone to war with any major or minor power. We nearly went to war with Germany over Venezuela. Gee, I wish it was all as uncomplicated as so many make it out to be."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"This book should be MANDATORY reading in every history class in this nation at least ONCE. This is especially topical NOW given current events since 9/11/01.America has been played for the sap in past history and this is just one grisly example. A few more weeks and WW1 would have NOT involved the US except for the sneaky exploits of Admiral Sir William Reginald Hall, plus Germany's Zimmerman.

That did not happen until 1966-7. At the time it was distrusted by American opinion, as just that, a British fake. However the sinking of the Lusitannia removed any remaining American doubts as to entry in the Great War. Subsequent to the revelation that the Zimmermann Telegram was a fake, (50 years after the fact) followed the item that the Lusitannia was carrying arms and munitions in her hold. The Germans knew this and announced, via ads in New York papers, their intention to sink her, which they did. Undersea exploration has since borne this out. Both incidents drew the US into the war, both were based on falsehoods. In war, the first casualty is truth. Now, what makes us think 9ll is anything different??"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"&quot;Pacifist Woodrow Wilson?&quot; Please refer to Walter Karp's exhaustively researched, &quot;The Politics of War&quot; regarding Wilson's machinations toward war.

An incredible accomplishment, but no surprise since it's a Barbara Tuchman book."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"Barbara Tuchman is one of the leading historians of the 20th century ; she proves it here once more. In this book she manages to use an anecdote - the telegram - to explain in a thrilling and convincing way the reasons for the US to enter the war. It is a brilliant book thanks to her remarkable style which blends suspense and clarity and yet no compromise with historical truth.Many historians are experts and have a vast knowledge of their subject. Very few like Barbara Tuchman make their knowledge accessible in an enticing way to the \\"man in the street\\"."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"The best historians are also storytellers. So it is with Barbara Tuchman, displaying both capabilities by crafting The Zimmerman Telegram as a mystery while it describes what caused America to abandon neutrality and enter World War I in 1917.Author Tuchman starts off with a tease - the decoding of the intercepted telegram. Then she abandons the thing in the safe of Admiral William Hall while she tells her story of Mexican politics and internecine war, German perfidy and deceit, American naivety and blindness, and the killing of a generation on the battlefields of France.It's an important story - of how Woodrow Wilson (and America) was convinced to abandon his aversion to war (and our desire for isolationism) when the telegram by German Foreign Minister Zimmerman was shown to him and he was convinced of its authenticity.A key player in Tuchman's story is Admiral Hall, and he is mostly silent. His staff intercepted the telegram and decoded it. Hall has to figure out how to put the telegram in view of American leaders without Germany deducing its origin. When author Tuchman interviewed Hall in 1958 just prior to publication, Admiral Hall was still silent on some details of his story.A great read here - a better mystery than those from Stuart Woods or some from Ken Follett."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"This book, by an eminent historian, greatly enlightened me as to the primary events that caused our entry into WW I. I heretofore had thought that the Lusitania sinking and the resumption of untrestricted submarine warfare were PRIME, while the Zimmermann Telegram was realtively minor and/or a British hoax. However, the revelation of the Zimmermann Telegram \\"galvanized\\" U.S. citizens like nothing else could have and the credibility of it was, strangely, even admitted to by Arthur Zimmermann himself. Had always been curious as to just what part the \\"Telegram\\" had played and/or the above-mentioned potential for it being a British hoax?Also, I was appalled at German stupidity and arrogance in thinking their code could NOT be broken. Incredibly, they AGAIN did the same thing in WW II and \\"The Ultra Secret\\" thing. People, even of the vaunted intelligence of the Teuton, are still prone to studpidity. For more of this latter, see Mrs. Tuchman's work: \\"The March of Folly\\". The Japanese too, were not immune, reference \\"Magic\\" intercepts in WW II."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"This is the second book by Barbara Tuchman that I've read and once again, her writing skills are manifest. She has taken a seemingly minor document (maybe not all that minor), showing the conception behind it, its transmission to German agents in Mexico, its decoding by British Naval Intelligence agents, and its release to American government officials, and hence we have this captivating and dramatic story. In Tuchman's view, this document was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, which in this case was America and its leaders (most especially Wilson's) reluctance to enter into the First World War.A cast of scores come to the surface in this book, many of whom I knew little about, from British intelligence figures, German and Mexican agents trying to formulate a plan for alliance, along with Japan, and others from various diplomatic and political spheres of influence from the Allied and Central Powers. As in the Guns of August, I sense her abilities in capturing the drama of the moment and the human elements of the stories. This is a relatively small book, but is choke full of information.For me, the power of her words and description really started pouring forth from the chapter entitled Trap. Her portrayals of various German diplomatic figures like Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg, Ambassador Bernstorff, President Wilson, Walter Hines Page, Balfour and others symbolize her talents in portraying the human elements of the story. The depiction of American naivete on foreign affairs and the dangers posed by the Central Powers came across in this book. For example, how the Americans warmly greeted incoming German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann and how Wilson refused to believe that Germany's declaration of unrestricted U-Boat warfare would deter the Americans efforts to remain neutral; Wilson still wanted to bring the belligerent powers to a settlement, or as Wilson called it, a peace without victory.Once again, a marvelous work by a wonderful historian."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"Historian Barbara Tuchman tells the full story of the Zimmerman Telegram in gripping detail. As many know, this note was sent by the German foreign minister to Mexico at the height of World War I. Germany hoped to spur increased conflict between the USA and Mexico, and thus keep America's industrial might from joining the Allies. But Zimmerman's note was intercepted by British intelligence, which quickly decoded it. Then as the author shows, Britain held on to it and waited to release their discovery at the right moment. That moment came in early 1917 as Germany announced it was resuming unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic. The effect in the USA was electric, and it spurred President Woodrow Wilson, a near-pacifist, to ask Congress to declare war on Germany.Historian Barbara Tuchman (1912-1989) was a talented popular historian with a nicely readable style. This 1958 book is not that long in pages, but it's great for information, tension, and history."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"Barbara Tuchman's style is so refreshing -- she brings a perspective to history that I never thought existed.The story of intrigue during the first world war and the efforts of the Germans to keep the US out of it so that Germany could launch what it thought would be the final death blow to Britain.

Easy read. Besides info.on the telegram itself, Tuchman does a superlative job explaining the Mexican-Japanese connection which is often overlooked, but is exceedingly important in understanding the telegram's significance."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Barbara Tuchman's style that turns this account of events leading up to America's involvement in World War I into a fascinating page-turner - or at least to a history buff like myself. It begins shamelessly generic, in what must be book-writing 101, at a point of highest tension in relation to the story (the interception of the telegram itself and the realization of its implication). From that opening salvo, it bounces backwards nearly twenty years to fill in the details, starting with Kaiser Wilhelm's obsession with the threat of Asian encroachment on the bastion of white Europe (The Yellow Peril), as well as his more local concern with encirclement by hostile neighbors.Then, no less scholarly for its dramatic method, the author moves through the intervening years, tracing the thread of personalities and events that in 1917 led the German Foreign Minister, Arthur Zimmerman, to propose an alliance between Germany, Mexico and Japan, one which would hand over the American Southwest to Mexico should the partnership succeed. Ms. Tuchman is able to muster up enough suspense with her narrative that one nearly wants to shout, \`Gosh, will Wilson ever get off the fence?! Is America going to get in on this war or not?'I don't know if Ms. Tuchman pioneered the blueprint for the popular history genre, but she certainly made excellent use of its conventions, and I think it's a shadowy awareness of the author's use of these conventions that make me feel as though I'm enjoying the story despite my better judgment. But the truth is that before I was mid-way through, I was hooked, and I zipped through this short account in about a day-and-a-half, all the while sort of mentally shaking my head, wondering how she did it. In the end, I don't have anything but positive things to say about THE ZIMMERMAN TELEGRAM, regardless of my snobbish tendency to dismiss it as \`popular history'. Perhaps not a life-changing event, but extremely entertaining. Four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"Readers who are familiar with Barbara Tuchman's writings will need little encouragement to read this book. Winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, she has written seven histories, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences presented her with the gold medal for history. She believed the historian should not only research the topic thoroughly but should present the result as a skilled storyteller. The New York Times praised this book as a true and lucid thriller told with \`a creative writer's sense of drama and a scholar's obeisance to the evidence.'It tells of the events leading to America's entry into World War One, during which time Tuchman's grandfather Henry Morgenthau was Woodrow Wilson's Ambassador to Turkey. Wilson was determined to mediate peace, but the British navy had blockaded German shipping and the German Supreme High Command planned to break the blockade with unrestricted submarine warfare which would almost certainly bring America into the war. Arthur Zimmermann, the German foreign secretary, sent to the German ambassador in Washington a coded telegram with details of the German government's planned strategy. British intelligence intercepted the telegram, was able to decipher it, and it was reported in the American press. On 6 April the United States entered World War I on the Allied side. In Tuchman's hands the episode makes excellent reading."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I especially enjoyed the Zimmerman Telegram because as a former cryptanalyst I appreciate Ms. Tuchman showing an excerpt from the original telegram.

Tuchman is not only a fine historian, but the kind of writer who makes history read like a political thriller. And the period before the US entry into WWI was certainly a thriller. With Europe hanging in the balance, the Germans offered Mexico an alliance. If they'd attack the US in the event of war, Germany would help her with the reconquista of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona--the dream that has never died. The Germans in their arrogance never suspected that the British had broken their codes--and amazingly didn't suspect it in WWII either! The political, military and diplomatic maneuvering between Germany, Britain, the US, Mexico and, yes, Japan made for a fascinating period. Tuchman gives the key details.

When hostilities started British ship Teleconia cut Imperial Germany's undersea cables.As a result Germans had to use wireless station in Nauen near Berlin for communicating with her overseas commands. So probabilities of intercepting Germany's confidential communications increased substantially.Further British Admiralty was extraordinarily lucky in laying their hands upon German navy's code book, thanks to Russian generosity. Code book was extracted from bosom of a dead signal man from the ship Magdeburg which sank.It helped British naval intelligence to quickly break into German navy's signal traffic.Circumstances which prompted German foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann seeking Mexican alliance against United States are familiar to all of us and need not be recalled here. However what was interesting were details surrounding German intrigue in Mexico. What appeared galling was Japan too was brought into the plot.Kaiser skulduggery looked amazing.German monarch while invoking threat posed by Japan[Yellow Peril] wooed latter whom he hoped to detach from the constellation of powers arrayed against Germany.What defies belief Japanese navy storming its way thousands of miles across Pacific Ocean to land troops along the Mexican coast!!! Japanese threat was grossly exaggerated.Authoress has described the workings of Room no.40 ,the nerve centre of British naval intelligence war.Here there are two things that need to be remembered. How London used intelligence without compromising its source.Then how it convinced Americans the message intercepted was genuine and not a plant designed to push latter into a war against Germany.What I find difficult to digest was Madame Tuchman's claim United States remained neutral to war in Europe.President Wilson's actions do not bear this out. He allowed British ships to dock at American ports while denying similar facility to Germans. President granted loans to Britain for buying war materials.Many neutral ships carried military equipment for allies.Wilson was uneven,partial,selective in the application of neutral laws , an opinion recorded by historian Charles C. Tansill in his book \`Backdoor to War which I share. President's actions served to fan the flames of conflict. It resembled pouring oil into the fire. I am also amazed by German boldness in abusing American hospitality by using State Department cable for exchanging hostile messagesThe above difference in opinion does not detract the value of this book. Prose is simply magnificent which grip readers' attention.This was Tuchman's first book. First published in the late 1950's and still in print which attests to its popularity.Highly recommended for history buffs."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I like books like these because they take a single subject and explore it thoroughly while also putting the events into a larger context.

I disagree; I think it her best. It is also the most absorbing treatment of the subject for the general reader.I agree with another reader who finds an anti-German prejudice; but I interpret that prejudice, if it can be called that, as really against German militarism, which gave us two world wars. I do not understand it as against all things German.One reader thought that the story shows how nonfiction can be stranger, at least more interesting, than fiction. I agree; yes, the book does show this extremely well."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"\\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" (1958) is another excellently written history by the author of the Pulitzer Prize winning \\"The Guns Of August\\" (1962). Writing with the same style and skill, Tuchman provides an important look at the crucial events that dragged the United States, kicking and screaming, into the First World War, even against the strong pacifism of the majority of Americans and the anti-war convictions of her president, Woodrow Wilson. \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" captures the flavor and atmosphere of a world facing its own worst fears. While many historians attempt to present the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 as the precipitate cause of U.S. entry, Tuchman correctly shows that only a specific and direct threat against the U.S. \\"forcing the nation to believe that Germany had hostile intentions toward America\\" would have turned the nation from anti- to pro-war. That threat came in the form of a telegram from Arthur Zimmerman, the German Foreign Secretary, sent to the German ambassador in Mexico suggesting a conspiracy to provoke an attack by Mexico on the United States, with the help of Japan. The goal was to involve the U.S. in a local war and prevent them from becoming involved in the European conflict. The \\"bait\\" for Mexico was the recovery of Texas and parts of New Mexico and Arizona taken by the United States in 1848. In her own inimitable style, Tuchman provides a strong understanding of the deep levels of conspiracy that had been going on in American-Mexican relations for years prior to the start of the war in 1914 and which continued even after U.S. entry into the war. She also shows the difficulties involved in revealing knowledge of the threat without jeopardizing cryptographer's ability to continue intercepting and decoding German secret messages. If read together, \\"The Guns of August\\" and \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" present a strong foundation for understanding history during the first half of the 20th Century.

In what sounds like something from a James Bond novel, Tuchman describes Germany's attempts to nudge Mexico and Japan into a war with the United States, as well as heightening America's own insecurities about her territory. It is amazing that even in the 20th century, Americans still felt that a foreign invasion was a very real threat.

I first read The Zimmerman Telegram in the mid seventies. It seemed highly improbable at the time and I thought it must have been a British plot to involve the US into World War I. Reading it now, I found it a very interesting and compelling work. Much research obviously went into her book, and since the German authors of the Telegram admitted to the plot, it must be true. Ms Tuchman's style of writing made the history come alive and is well worth reading. She does however take a distinctly Anglophile point of view of history and although this makes the book more exciting for the reader, it does distort the historical perspective.We are living in a time when much of US history is being rewritten to include other points of view. The United States is truly a nation of immigrants and the immigrant point of view is now being considered in history where as before it was completely ignored. First, no one can deny that the United States was definitely pro-ally and not neutral, by sending goods and weapons to the allies, without which they could not have continued the war (the US did not insist on being able to send goods and weapons to Germany). Second, there was never any threat of an invasion of the United States by Mexico, despite the pathetic Columbus Raid by Pancho Villa. Mexico was in the middle of a long drawn out Civil War and the United States had supported various Mexican leaders throughout the conflict. The only invasion threat was by the United States into Mexico which it seemed to do at will by Pershing in the North and the US Navy in the South at Vera Cruz. The United States had a very large and modern Navy and had already blockaded much of Mexico. The US did not stop the large British Oil exports from Mexico to Britain but did blockade any exports from Mexico to Germany.Finally, the United States did have a large Irish and German immigrant population who were definitely anti-British. President Wilson took the extra step of threatening these immigrants to not interfere with his brand of neutrality."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"While the Zimmerman Telegram is one of the most important documents in history, and is perhaps the greatest result of code breaking in history, it is nonetheless frequently overlooked. Most people have at least heard \\"Remember the Lusitania\\" which had essentially nothing to do with the U.S. entering WWI. Few, however, are familiar with this short telegram that is truly a hinge on which history turned.One cannot blame Barbara Tuchman for this, however, as this work brings alive the intrigue of the time like no other. Reading like a spy novel, and yet all the more chilling because it's true, Tuchman navigates the reader through the murky waters of WWI intrigue. We learn how, in a misguided effort to distract the U.S. from Europe, Germany sought to foment trouble on the U.S./Mexican border. We learn how the British scrambled to inform the Americans of this, without comprimising their sources. And we learn how a tortured President Wilson was forced to take the steps towards war.\\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" is history as it should be written; loaded with primary sources, and with the breathless pace that events really unfolded. While better known for \\"The Guns of August\\", it is this work that makes me rank Barabara Tuchman as one of the best historians of the 20th Century.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"This is one of my favorite Barbara Tuchman works. It is the story of the Zimmermann Telegram, a message sent by the German Foreign Minister to the Mexican Government in early 1917. In essence the Telegram was an attempt to make Mexico a German ally in the event of the US entering World War I on the Allied side, with the bait being the possibility of Mexico reclaiming the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. When British Intelligence intercepted and decoded the Telegram they made certain that the US government and public heard about it quickly in the hopes of bringing the US into the war.The book is more than just the story of the Telegram itself. It includes a run through of the various German espionage efforts in the US before and during World War I and a good description of the unease felt by the US at the mysterious German machinations, including possibly collusion with Japan and an attempt to take control of the Panama Canal.Like all of Tuchman's works, The Zimmermann Telegram is scholarly without being dull, and a real delight."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"The story that Barbara Tuchman tells in The Zimmermann Telegram is one of international diplomacy in the period just before World War One. Tuchman centers her story on the apex of a single article of communication (the telegram) and expands from there. The story begins in the North Sea just before the British declaration of war on Germany. The British cable ship Telconia dredges the sea searching for five cables at the bottom connecting Germany's communication with the of the European and North American continents. All five cables are cut. Furthermore, Britain coaxed Eastern Telegraph, the American owner of the only other cable to North America (running from North Africa to Brazil), to pull the cables that would allow German communication with the world. Germany was now bound to wireless communication for the duration of the war. This is significant because it allowed the British to secretly intercept all German communications, and begin to decode them in the British Naval Intelligence office referred to as &quot;Room 40&quot;. Inside Room 40, Britain learned to crack the German code. This is how the British, and consequently the Americans, were able to learn about the Zimmermann Telegram. The Telegram put the British in a precarious position. They desperately needed the United States to become a belligerent and enter the war against Germany if Britain hoped to win the war. At the same time if the British gave the Americans the Telegram and it was released, the Germans might deduce the existence of Room 40 and discover that their code had been unraveled, thereby compromising all British ability to &quot;listen in&quot; on the Germans for the rest of the war. Additionally, the Telegram was no guarantee that the United States would declare war against Germany or that the Americans would even believe the authenticity of the Telegram. It is the analysis of U.S., German, and British players and the revelation of how The Zimmermann Telegram was eventually delivered to the U.S. Government (without compromising Room 40, and at the same time successfully brought the U.S. into war against Germany) that Tuchman wrote about. Tuchman's style was objective in construction by use of factual evidence from many sources. She wrote the book fairly, comparing both the British and German sides. She illustrated that there were supporters on both sides in the United States. Through all of the descriptions she portrayed Woodrow Wilson as neutral until the end, and discussed the external forces on Wilson that tried to persuade him in all directions. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and former President Theodore Roosevelt supported the side of Britain and war; Robert LaFollette and other isolationist senators on the side of non-intervention. Tuchman centered all events on the final outcome-would the Americans be persuaded to believe the authenticity of the Zimmermann Telegram? Would they declare war on Germany because of it? Tuchman was persuasive in her argument that it was ultimately the Zimmermann Telegram that caused Wilson to ask Congress for belligerency. Her sources were mostly first-hand accounts taken from the journals and diaries of major participants in the events that surrounded the Zimmermann Telegram. Important to her research were notes supplied by British Admiral Hall's (Director of British Naval Intelligence) private secretary, as well as personal papers of Joseph Grew (U.S. Ambassador) and those papers of Ambassador Walter Hines Page. Further research by Tuchman was accredited to help from the Foreign Office Archives Office in London and the historical manuscripts of both President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing. Because The Zimmermann Telegram was well researched and convincing in its points, Tuchman revealed to the reader a deeper level of understanding surrounding the events that led up to the American declaration of war against Germany. Tuchman shrugged off the commonly held elementary notions that it was the sinking of the Lusitania, or the declaration of German unrestricted submarine warfare that caused the U.S. to declare its belligerency. She argued that while these events were certainly considerations in the decision for war, they were not enough to cause the U.S. to break its policy of neutrality. She was successful in persuading the reader that it was the secret German proposal of a pact with Mexico and Japan that became the proverbial straw. Tuchman's thesis that the Zimmermann Telegram was the single most important reason that America declared war against Germany was a believable one. It clearly showed evidence for the German government's theory that a secret pact with Mexico and Japan would be her only chance of defeating The United States in a war. Tuchman pointed out that Germany made only two significant blunders that forced America into the war declaration. First, Germany's mistaken ignorance that German intelligence was so superior to that of the Allies that the Allies could have never cracked the German code. Secondly, Zimmermann's puzzling admission of the authenticity of the telegram when much of the American public and Congress believed it to be a British hoax (Britain could not reveal the authenticity without compromising Room 40). In conclusion, Tuchman gave an exciting dimension of suspense to the events surrounding America's entry into World War One by revealing first person accounts and minor personalities that played a role in the events leading to this crux. She made the valid argument that it was the Zimmermann Telegram that ultimately brought Wilson and the American Congress (and people) to this decision after a long period of neutrality toward Germany."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"Ms. Tuchman wrote &quot;The Guns of August&quot; which I believe is the best book ever written about WWI. Unfortunately, she also wrote the book, &quot;The Proud Tower&quot; about the times just before WWI. The Proud Tower was a bore. As such, I wasn't sure what to think before I bought this one. I was hopeful that it might be good and, I was right. The Zimmerman Telegraph is a very good book which, if you like history and mystery, you should enjoy. The Zimmerman Telegraph was especially interesting to me because, while I was in school, I had a professor who taught his belief that the Zimmerman Telegraph was a fraud. It was not. The Zimmerman telegaph was very real and with it the British may have changed the tides of history. .But first, what is the Zimmerman telegraph? Mr. Zimmerman was a German ambassador during WWI. As the war progressed, both sides looked for allies which would tip the scales in the war in Europe. Mr. Zimmerman, and his cohorts, were instructed to induce Mexico into fighting on the German side, if American declared for the allies.Because General Pershing, who was to lead the Amercian troops in Europe, had invaded Mexico during this time (to attack a bandit revolutionary Pancho Villa); Because America had taken about 1/3 of Mexico eighty years earlier; And because America's army was one of the smallest in the world - Mexico's entry into the war seem possible to German leaders 5000 miles away.Mr. Zimmerman, in secret code, wired back and forth to Germany to learn what he should do, and what he should offer. Worse, at times, the Germanys borrowed American supplies, while negotiating about declaring war on America. The British learned about these messages and wanted to share them with the Americans. But how could they do it, without arrising their suspicions and those of later American professors?The truth is an exciting mystery story filled with real people whom we love and hate, because Ms. Tuchman makes them so real. She has a talent, when applied, which makes the past - present. I could picture these events as they happened, understand the people, and even sympathize with the ones I didn't like before I read this book.The other thing Ms. Tuchman does so well is to explain motivations. In Europe, for example, there was disputed land between Germany and France. This land was take in 1870. In 1914, the shame of this action still was present throughout France. Indeed, in many units, it was a battlecry. Surely some Mexicans felt the same about California? Ms. Tuchman shows us why some people felt that a Germany-Mexican alliance was a good thing. And a thing which the Mexicans would want.There is much more that this book discusses. But, as referenced above, this book is mainly about how the British broke the German codes and how they &quot;leaked&quot; this information to the Americans. War is never fought for one reason. But the main reason America fought in WWI may have been this telegram - and the Germany-Mexican alliance it proposed. A masterful job by Ms. Tuchman."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"This book is history at its very best. Tuchman has brought to life an amazing story of espionage and deceit that reads like an Ian Fleming novel. Her fluid writing style keeps you turning the pages. Although the outcome is known, the reader still finds themselves asking what will happen.The book covers Germany's pre-war intrigues in Mexico, and then once the war starts, follows the agents sent to America to keep us out of the war. She discusses how German spies plotted to take over munitions factories and stop the flow of war goods to the Allies...and how they nearly succeeded. The story also discusses how Wilson was tormented by the decision to bring America into the war, and how he really did wish peace for the world. Yet, when confronted with the Zimmerman Telegram, which offered Mexico the reacquisition of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, Wilson was left with no choice but war.It is incredible at how a blunder by one German official was able to bring the world's most powerful nation into the fold against them. Yet that stays with the theme of WW I, and the Zimmerman Telegram may have been the biggest blunder of the war. Thanks to Barbara Tuchman, we know how it all came to pass."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"The story of the Zimmermann Telegram is a gem of history that literally is a ripping good yarn.The nutshell: In the middle of WWI, German foreign minister Zimmermann -- worried about how to keep America occupied on our side of the Atlantic and out of the Allied camp -- sent a telegram instructing his Mexican envoy to propose an alliance between Mexico, Japan and Germany. The payoff for our southern neighbor: the restoration of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico to the country of Mexico.This very fine book is many facets tightly woven in 200 pages: British code breakers. German diplomatic efforts. President Wilson's unshakable will for neutrality. Mexican and Japanese intrigue. Submarine warfare. Mexican revolution and America's chase for Pancho Villa.The story has drama (the fight to persuade Wilson that US interests lay with the Allies and not in being a neutral broker of peace), excitement (British code breaking efforts and the intrigue to get the telegram published / into American hands), and near comedy (German bungling with codes, diplomatic missions and high strategy)written by the masterful Barbara Tuchman.The author takes all these elements -- which are almost Shakespearean in their complexity and interplay -- and crafts a terrifically exciting history. A very fine read."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"History wasn't supposed to be this readable in 1958, but when Barbara Tuchman published \\"The Zimmermann Telegram\\" it was not only an advancement of scholarship about the roots of World War I but a terrific example of how real life could work better than fiction when in the right hands.The book covers what is still often wrongly described as a minor episode. As Tuchman explains, this served as the World War I equivalent of Pearl Harbor, an overture by Imperial Germany intercepted by England inviting Mexico to join the Axis and attack the United States as a means of keeping U.S. troops from refreshing the Allied cause in Europe. When a copy of the telegram was delivered to President Woodrow Wilson, it shook him from his studied neutrality and brought about the American entry into the war, essentially turning a European struggle into a global one.I once worked with a guy at a newspaper who told me Tuchman couldn't be trusted because she was anti-German. Frankly, it's hard to write a fair history of either World War that doesn't come down hard on Germany in some way, though Tuchman pulls no punches. According to her book, not only did Zimmermann (the German foreign minister whose appointment was ironically welcomed by Washington because he was seen as a liberal) offer Mexico three of its former territories, New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona, in exchange for a sudden attack on the United States, he didn't even wait for the United States to declare war on Germany first in response to the unrestricted submarine offensive Germany planned to launch. Then, when the press got hold of the telegram, Zimmermann didn't deny it was his because he still held out hope the Mexicans might launch an offensive across the Rio Grande.Well, of course, I can hear that guy back in my old office saying, we were giving England and France the supplies with which to fight Germany. Why shouldn't Germany do what it could to stop that? However in keeping with the nation that coined the term \\"realpolitik,\\" it amounted to a fatal miscalculation, marked by the German hubris of sending its fatal telegram on a special line the U.S. let them use for the purpose of helping negotiate a European peace. Like the Japanese ambassadors a war later, the Germans kept up the pretence of peace talks while planning their sucker punch, though the Japanese stopped short of actually using the diplomacy itself to sow the seed for U.S. destruction.Tuchman's thesis in short puts a different construct on the popular historic view of World War I as a war we didn't need to get involved in. Yet she isn't a conservative, instead taking all parties to task in a critical, engaging way many historians to come would emulate with far less success. About Wilson, she writes: \\"He held political office and would not acknowledge that politics is the art of the possible. He obeyed the injunction that a man's reach should exceed his grasp; it was his tragedy that he reached too high.\\"Tuchman on the other hand reaches just high enough, giving you all the period detail and flavor of the time in a lean 200-page package that will likely leave you curious to read her later masterpiece on World War I's origins, \\"The Guns Of August.\\""},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"From the techniques involved in decoding and deciphering German diplomatic messages (in layman's terms) to the sacrifices and lives spent acquiring the knowledge of Room 40 (i.e. code books) to the tenacious efforts of Germany to spark U.S involvement in Mexico as well as against the Japanese(!), Tuchman provides a thorough account on the Zimmermann Telegram and its crucial role in pulling a reluctant American nation into the First World War. As a History grad student, I never knew about Germany's aims regarding Japan (&quot;the Yellow Peril&quot;) during this period until I read this book. In addition, Tuchman's excellent and often witty writing style makes Zimmermann Telegram (and her many other works) gripping and entertaining, as well as informative."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"In forceful, confident prose Ms. Tuchman describes an incident in U.S. history which, if not forgotten, is probably not sufficiently appreciated for its current relevance. President Wilson labored hard to avoid U.S. entry into the Great War; his aim, even on the eve of U.S. involvement, was to win the peace by making himself available to both sides as the honest broker. His efforts to remain neutral had its critics, notably Theodore Roosevelt, but by and large his position mirrored that of the public at large. One critical factor that helped move Wilson from neutrality to belligerence was the uncovering, by British intelligence, of the Zimmerman telegram. That telegram revealed Germany's attempts to forge an alliance with Mexico and thus distract the U.S. from the European theatre. In return, and upon a \\"certain\\" German victory, Mexico was promised the restoration of its former holdings -- Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. While the telegram was a factor in Wilson's volte face, it was by far the most important factor in the creation of a popular, pre-war sentiment in the U.S. electorate.Why relevant? Wilson's decision to enter the war was delayed until that point in time when empirical data compelled him to abandon neutrality. In contrast, President Bush invaded Iraq on the presumption, based on intelligence, that WMD would be uncovered. Was Wilson right? Perhaps not. He may well have waited too long. Was Bush wrong? Perhaps not, given the behavior of Saddam Hussein with respect to inspections prior to the war. The Zimmerman telegram is not a \\"morality tale,\\" but it constitutes a fascinating case study on the interplay between data and decision-making at the highest levels of government."},{"Title":"The Zimmermann telegram","review":"I've first learned of the Zimmermann Telegram from \\"The Code Book\\" by Simon Singh (highly recommended itself), and looked for more information on the story; Barbara Tuchman's \\"The Zimmerman Telegram\\" filled in the details splendidly. The buildup is suspenseful, the characters are colorfully drawn, and the settings are well detailed. Tuchman skillfully puts the reader in the minds of those involved, allowing you to understand their mindset and identify with their emotions. This is indeed much closer to a mystery novel than to a regular history book, and it is a better read for it.There are a few small things I felt that marred full enjoyment. These are minor issues indeed, but worth noting. The first is that while most of the book reads as a Novel, as I've mentioned above, in a few occasions it feels as though you can feel Tuchman's voice herself giving her personal opinion (as an historian) on characters in the story. This is not a problem in and of itself, but it doesn't fit with the general mood of the book, so it seems out of place. Another point is that a few important issues were not sufficiently detailed (at least in my view): For instance, the agreement between the US and Germany about the surfacing of submarines is only hinted at, but it itself is never mentioned, which seems important, because the book skips between the conditions that existed before and after the agreement, and this can cause confusion at times. Or, as another example, one of the biggest questions (again, to me) that is hardly touched is why Zimmerman confirmed he sent the telegram after it was made public - surely this was the action that made war impossible to avoid.All in all, however, these small issues do not diminish the book in any great manner, and it still remains a superb account of one of the most pivotal, yet little known events of the 20th century. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"One would have to be a fool to discount the eyewitness account of defense attorney Matt Dalton, whose investigative work clearly laid the foundation--not followed through by Mark Geragos-- for a legitimate, fact-based and witness-supported argument that Scott Peterson could not have killed his wife. Laci Peterson was seen by a number of people in her neighborhood, walking her dog, the morning of December 24th, 2002--at the same time that Scott was driving to the Berkeley Marina to try out his recently-purchased used boat.Dalton has six credible witnesses, and we meet them in the pages of this book----not in any other book. Six people contacted police to tell them what they saw. Most of did not even receive a return phone call. One was very certain it was Laci she had seen, because she had noticed her on other occasions and recognized her from her walks. Another was a neighbor, a woman who went to the same doctor as Laci, who knew Laci. She was willing to testify that she saw her walking that morning. Why didn't she?Dalton's book is a huge question mark on the face of this case. Surely a woman who knew Laci personally is a qualified witness. Also, two separate witnesses said they had seen Laci having trouble controlling the dog, McKenzie. And McKenzie, as Laci's mother testified at trial, was that kind of dog. \\"The dog walked you,\\" was how Mrs. Rocha put it. If two separate witnesses described different difficulties Laci was having with the dog, that increases the chances that it was, in fact, Laci they saw that day.Dalton describes the witnesses and what they told him at length. As to Dalton's credibility as a defense investigator, he actually came from the other side of the bar--he was a prosecutor in Los Angeles and Long Beach for over a decade. That's plenty of experience in judging whether a witness is credible in my view.Also, in the pages of this book, as opposed to any other, you will find context as to what was going on in that neighborhood. Matt Dalton reproduces in complete unaltered detail a number of police reports about what was going on on Covena December 23rd and 24th. The police reports are about disturbances and criminal activity that neighbors and nearby businesses reported in this generally quiet residential area. You can read these reports as they were rendered and make up your own mind about them. You don't get them anywhere else. Nowhere.Dalton, who was representing Scott Peterson early on, by himself (Geragos, being a busy man, did not spend the bulk of the time investigating--Dalton was the one who was there, in Modesto, on the ground, from the beginning). Dalton is the only person who knows what he observed and discovered during those months after Laci's disappearance in Modesto, when the media circus was running the town and emotions were running hot. Dalton was the one who was there, physically, on the scene, doing the work.After Peterson was convicted and sentenced to death, Dalton clearly had a choice. Publish a book, against the wishes of his former employer, Geragos---and tell what he knew--or shut up and let Peterson go guietly to his death one day. Geragos was going to sue Dalton over this book, I do remember reading that---however, he didn't. I believe Matt Dalton wrote from his conscience. His style of writing is rather dry and matter-of-fact, and yet, he describes in vivid detail the events that he observed in Modesto, the track his investigation took, and what he turned up. He also brings you behind the scenes so that you can see for yourself the prosecutorial shenanigans you might not otherwise know about. These include covering up evidence and putting the word out around town that defense investigators are not to be helped.This is a fascinating book. It documents clearly how a death penalty trial can be hijacked by a combination of small-town politics, big-town media attention, and family vindictiveness. I personally could not put it down. It changed my view of this case---that is, it filled in all the many questions I had about why Peterson was convicted upon so little physical evidence, with no eyewitness testimony to anything that could be conceived as murderous.This book was a little pricier than some of the others about this case. It was worth every single penny. You won't find hype---just an assault on your brain, and your ideas about justice and publicity."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I've read most books about Scott Peterson, and they were all pretty interesting and informative......This book was loaned to me, I did not spend a dime on it, nor would I.Dalton makes many claims (occult, etc) with nothing to back it up.

A partial license plate number should be enough....many \\"supposed\\" witnesses don't have names...the ones that do never testified....what's that about??

In my mind, after reading this well written journal of the events surrounding the case, I do not think I could have found Scott Peterson guilty! From what was happening in the immediate area of the residence of Scott & Laci Peterson on the very day she disappeared without a trace to the unusual number of pregnant women who had been missing in an 80 mile radius over three years to other witnesses that never testified and additional autopsy details that were never brought to light and cast doubt on the prosecutions case, this book is fascinating in its detail and evidence which will surely be the basis of the appeal that awaits Scott Peterson."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I don't think Scott Peterson got a fair trial nor do I believe he should be on death row especially when child killer Curtis Anderson pleaded and got 50 years for killing Xiana Fairchild. He should be on death row. But this book really sucks. The information is all over the place like the writer suddenly remembers something and throws it out there. His scenarios are ridiculous--now I really believe Scott did it. I feel that buying this book was a mistake on my part. Don't buy it. Throw it out. It sucks. Whoever is giving it 5 stars is obviously associated with the publisher, the writer or has interest in getting it sold. This book is worth nothing and gave me no insight. It's my first book I've read on the Scott Peterson case but I picked the wrong book."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"In reading this book, the insider look at both Modesto and the Modesto investigation is so telling. For me, it reveals unsettling evidence of an unprofessional investigation: Scott being threatened by Detective Brocchini on his guilt on the night of Laci's disappearance; the improbableness of indentations left by 4 anchors on Scott's boat, by Dalton's and Geragos' reactions to the police photo of the boat; the inappropriate setting of Scott's private talks with Dalton: clear invasion of privacy by the Modesto Police; and finally, the tampering of the autopsy evidence over a 3-month period. Americans should be nervous about how our justice system is working, based on these 4 incidences alone. A stronger piece of research from Dalton, on the Satanic Cult, with its clear presence in Modesto, is even more chilling, and revealing. With a Satanic Cult unit in the Police Dept there, why wasn't Laci's body compared to that of Evelyn Hernandez, also a pregant woman, both disappearing that same year on the two most highly significant days of the cult's sadistic rituals on pregnant women: May 1 and Dec 24. Their bodies were both similarly abused, and both found in the SF Bay. This is the strongest evidence for me, on Scott's innocence, including the condition of the pallet bag that Dalton suggests carried the baby's body to shore. More evidence. Dalton's scenario of Laci's walk on the 24th, potentially ending in the outdoor bathroom where the reported scream was heard, suggesting the site of her abduction by the cult, is much more believable than any scenario I have heard from the prosecution. In my opinion, Scott deserves his appeal. I believe he will, and should be exonerated."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I don't know where this guy was when the trial was going on but he must have his head stuck somewhere very dark! I truly believe that this book was written just to get his name in print since he did not make it on the defense team! There is not one thing new in this book only the author looks at everything differently than most of the world! This one is not worth reading."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"If you followed the case and all the nonsense and stunts that Geragos and team pulled you have read it all."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I was an avid follower of Laci's story from the beginning when she dissapeared. I, feuled by the media reports was right on the band wagon screaming, \\"He's Guilty!!!\\" I said to myself and many others that even Stevie Wonder could see that this man was guilty and that he fully deserved whatever fate awaited him after the arrest. I cheered at the guilty verdict and kind of winced at the death penalty reccomendation and sentencing. I wanted him to have to live with what he had done. Then when the hoopla died down and I got to actually read court transcripts and realized the lack of foundation for the state's claim, I re-thought my position and the research began. Then came this book written by a former defense team investigator, I was riveted with every new revelation. I don't feel that what he is writing is conjecture. He has more inside knowledge than any other individual to produce a book yet. It completely turned my head around. Now, more than ever, I am protesting that he should not have been found guilty in a court of law. There was reasonable doubt. Tons of it. I feel that Geragos didn't defend Scott as well as he could and should have. This book will make you re-think your position on Scott Peterson. Even if you still think he is actually guilty, you will at least agree that there was sufficient evidence had it been presented and heard by the jury, that it would have cast enough reasonable doubt to exhonnerate Scott and maybe put a little more pressure on the police to go back and follow up on hidden leads that were never checked out. It was just appalling to me how much information the law let fall underneath their noses, only to blind themselves to one theory and one suspect: Scott Peterson. The man never had a chance. Hopefully, his appellate lawyers will get this all out and get Scott an aquittal. Yet, sadly, I feel he is there in San Quentin to stay. What is past is prologue. Soon, no-one will care. No-one except Scott's friends and family that love him."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I think if you read this book with an open mind you might realize that our justice system is in big, big trouble.A man is sitting on death row yet there really wasn't any evidence that proved the crime of murder. Is this what our justice system has become? Having no cameras in the court also hampers one's ability to make a proper judgment since you have to listen to \\"biased\\" reporters night after night spinning their own opinions.I strongly urge those with an open mind to read this book. You may come away with a different take on what is really happening in our justice system. It also make make you rethink what you thought you knew about this case.Thanks Mr. Dalton for writing this book."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I read Presumed Guilty and found it facinating. I have followed the case since day one. My initial theory was that Scott did it. Then, when he said he was fishing, and their bodies were found in close proximity, I felt that the killer or killers had a perfect opportunity to dump their bodies in the bay and frame him. His actions led the masses to believe he was guilty, including me. But what is revealed in the book leaves a lot of doubt. Was Geragos doing his job, or was he playing in Modesto? Why didn't he did deeper and reveal what Matt Dalton did in the book? If Scott is guilty, he should be executed. If not, then let's get to the truth. Bottom line. Presumed Guilty makes the reader think instead of reacting to media blitz."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Dalton may be an attorney, (albeit a defense attorney) but he misses the most fundamental, basic formula in homicide: M.O.M.; Means, Opportunity and Motive.Means; his bare hands, boat and tide charts; Opportunity; He was alone with her earlier that day and had plenty of time to kill her and transport the body to the bay where he ultimately dumped her; Motive; he did not want children and he had a new girlfriend.An innocent man does not behave the way Scott did; running for the border with four cell phones, 15 thousand dollars in cash and camping equipment plus a newly blond beard and hair. He did not look for her when she first went missing, he showed zero emotions before during and after the trial and he told Amber Frey he \\"lost his wife\\" on December 6, some weeks before he actually killed her.I also thought the hypocrisy of his mother was disgusting; she always carefully appeared in public wearing her oxygen equipment, yet was seen moving heavy furniture out of Laci's house wtih alacrity.His weak statements about witnesses claiming to have seen Laci simply don't hold up; these witnesses illustrate the fable of the 3 Blind men and the Elephant as far as credibility goes; a burglary across the street and another story about a pregnant woman being harassed are two more rather contrived and pathetic attempts to shore up this non-case; the disappearance of six pregnant women within an 80 miles radius in the years leading up to this crime and questions about the autopsy report all add up to: One defense attorney's trying to make money off of a legitimate tragedy by cobbling together the weakest of possibilities and by doing so, only compounds the already tawdry reputation shared by the less honorable of his profession.One only has to listen to the conversations betwen Amber and Scott, most notably the embarrassingly bad lie about being in Paris when he was standing in the middle of crowd of people searching for Laci...his voice irritatingly hoarse and raspy; This, ladies and gentlemen, is the sound of a true sociopath; the only true aspect of Scott's persona.I cannot even begin to imagine the horror and agony of Sharon Rocha; this sort of loss is bad enough on its own, but the know your child was murdered...and your grandson...is beyond the pale.I was watching the news when the verdict was announced and how the crowd outside the courtroom cheered and how some were offended by this; I say to them, it is far more \\"offensive\\" to have your child and grandchild murdered. So save your self-righteous indignation and cheer that Scott finally received his just reward."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"If you've followed the Scott Peterson case and are looking for new information, don't look here. Apparently it was all a big gimmick...\\"what the jury never knew about Laci Peterson's murder and why Scott should not be on death row.\\" There is nothing in this book I haven't heard somewhere else. The Laci sightings were reported and investigated and nothing concrete came of that information. The Satanic cults, the van, the robbery, all investigated and this when no where. Tidbits here and there of stories we have heard over and over and over. Same old, same old, nothing new. This book...ugh...why did I buy it at full price the day it came out. All that talk about Scott suing the writer so the book wouldn't come out. What a marketing strategy and I fell for it hook, line and sinker. Does Matt Dalton really believe the public (the reading public) is that ignorant about our judicial system? I didn't think there was any viable information. I know there is no smoking gun, no direct forensic evidence against Scott, no crime scene, this case is based on his behavior. His bad behavior did convince me he is guilty. I mean who would rent a car and drive all the way to the Berkeley Marina from Modesto (about 90 miles) to stare at the water and then leave. That to me indicates guilt. I do however have concerns that a man can be put on death row with no direct evidence. This book is lacking in information. Save yourself all the trouble. The book is a lightweight too, not much material, not much at all -- 192 pages and that includes even the appendix. Never mind this book and look elsewhere. Save your money and save your time. After this book, I read Deadly Game by Catherine Crier. It was an excellent read. update* After reading Sharon Rocha's book I wonder how the publishing houses allow a bozo like M.

He has no information."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I have read every book about this topic........... and no matter what the reviews say, I buy the book if it's about Laci Peterson.

Ittalks about the different witnesess who saw Laci that morning. The only real \\"new\\" information in this book is about him stating that the robbery which occurred across the street actually occured during the EXACT hours Laci went missing, whereas the other books, police reports, trial transcripts, etc, claim it was either unrelated or happened another day.However, this books lost ALL credibility with me when he claims that:\\"Scott invited Laci's sister, Amy, over to his house for pizza on the night of the 23rd\\" Matt claims, \\"Amy DID go to Laci and Scott's house and ate pizza with them and watched 2 movies with them.\\"We ALL know this is NOT TRUE, Amy was invited, but did not go. After I read that, I was skeptical of anything he said. Which to be honest, was not very much. This book could be condensed to a two page article it repeats itself sooooooo much. But to those of you who are obsessed, like me, you will want to read it for yourself and make your own opinions. Others who are not obsessed, I would say the best book written about this topic is Catherine Crier's book, \\"A Deadly Game\\" and one of the more interesting is by Keith Ablow, \\"Inside the Mind of Scott Peterson.\\" I can't wait to read \\"For Laci\\" by Sharon Rocha.

If I were on the jury and I heard 6 credible witnesses claim to have seen Laci after the time that Scott was known to be gone, I don't believe I could have voted to convict. What was Geragos thinking? No wonder he wanted to block this books' publication, it makes him look like a very incompetent(or too busy to care) attorney.The Satanic cult stuff seems a bit unbelievable and although I believe that Brochini and Grogan were convinced of Scott's guilt from the beginning, it's hard to believe that the whole Modesto Police Department would knowingly ignore evidence.What I didn't care for was the way that Mr. Dalton left things hanging. For example, the elderly witness that saw Laci on the 24th, should have been questioned on the record in case she couldn't make the trial(and didn't, she died) He admits it should have been done, but it wasn't. No explanation was given for this HUGE oversight. Was it his fault? Geragos'?He wasn't able to view the Cronus watch at the Pawn shop, he said he tried, but if the watch was Laci's, then there is no way Scott could have pawned it, as he was under survellance at the time it was pawned. How could Geragos allow that to go un-addressed at trial? Again, if I am on the jury and I hear that Laci's watch was pawned and it wasn't pawned by Scott, I think I would have had some real doubt about how the mystery woman ended up with that watch, and why it was not followed up.Overall, the book made me feel very strongly that Scott did not get a fair trial. If the jury heard half of what is in this book, I don't see how they could have been unanimous on a guilty verdict. I am not saying he is definitely innocent, as I said before, I don't know. But this book certainly brings up some issues that should have been addressed and Geragos doesn't look very good."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I work in a large chain book store and I have read all the books on this case, because I was sincerely interested and wanted to know more than the headlines and tabloid TV, etc. I highly recommend everyone reading a book by Martha Stout -- The Sociopath Next Door and after reading this book, you can see or begin to see how and why Scott Peterson seems to fit the Sociopathic profile to a T, as does also, his mother. When you read Amber's book, you see he puts on a show of being everything she ever wanted in a boyfriend and he lies almost nonstop to be all that she wants him to be, etc. When you read Anne's book, you see how manipulative both he and his mother are-- to her and just how far he was willing to go-- to abuse his relationship with his new found sister and her adoptive family, etc. When you read Crier's book, you can see how the police zero'd in on him as the number one suspect from the start-- and \\"played him\\" every which way they legally could with the burden on him to be able to rule himself out as their number one suspect and how he failed again and again from the start-- even before they learned of the existance of Amber. When you read Laci's mother's heart wrenching book-- every mother's worst nightmare-- you learn from her recollections how -- when she had known him over 8 years, how from the get go--everything about his behavior was \\"off\\"-- inappropriate-- just not making sense--or \\"ringing true\\"-- I read Dalton's book and I wanted to have an open mind-- I can understand for example why the pawnshop owner might be able to refuse to cooperate with Dalton as an investigator to show him the pawned watch, but the Modesto Police would have had access to check out that watch-- who pawned it, etc. I can understand for example how Dalton could have turned up possible Laci sightings from people living in and around Laci's neighborhood, but why were none of these people called by the defense to testify? Yes, one Sr. Citizen died but what about the rest of them and why did they decide not to come forward, nor were they compelled to by the defense? Since the verdict and sentencing, but for Dalton's book, none of these folks have been willing to come forward either-- the other women -- supposedly six missing pregnant women-- would not their relatives want justice to be done for their loved ones too? Would not the relatives of these other missing women have come forward now demanding that Dalton's story and contentions be checked out?We've all heard-- Actions speak louder than words-- everything Scott Peterson did-- prior to Laci's disappearance, and afterward -- speak volumes about his guilt-- he acted like a guilty person, an evasive person, a person who had something to hide, and kept making himself into a bigger and bigger suspect as time went on--- he just never acted the way a normal, innocent person would have-- the police can key in on this kind of behavior-- body language, conduct, etc. and he was so without any embodiment of grieving, of loss, of being the \\"victim\\" of a terrible crime done to him personally from the get go-- complete strangers gave up their holidays to search for Laci-- to donate their time and money and energy to the search for Laci-- and complete strangers showed more emotion and sadness and empathy toward the family and friends of Laci, than did Scott Peterson.Normal people --- even normal adulterers-- show emotions that Scott Peterson has seemed totally incapable of showing. It's like he is souless-- I can not understand Matt Dalton's motivation in presenting this book of his-- Every person is entitled to a defense in our legal system and Matt Dalton has been working on the prosecution's side most of his legal career-- and it was his job to try to find another plausible theory for what happened to Laci Peterson. If not Scott Peterson, then who and why?Most people are not kidnapped in broad daylight. People with a fairly large and protective dog are not going to be targeted in broad daylight. Laci did not have on her person a purse-- to be targeted for robbery. People who saw the shoes/sandals in the street, who heard the scream, who saw the coat in the van's door, who had the bad feeling, who are positive they saw Laci Peterson that day walking her dog-- at a time AFTER Scott Peterson had left Modesto for his fishing trip-- WHY have none of these people come forward demanding to be heard, demanding that what they saw and heard be put in the record?If the dog had to be walked daily? And if Laci had not been walking the dog for the last month --- then who had been performing this task? It seems unlikely that on a \\"bad weather\\" day, when Laci had baking to do, had a full next 24 hours planned,--dinner with her folks on the Eve and Brunch at her home the next day-- that she would have been doing physical activities such as dog walking and/or mopping the floor in her pregnant condition --- or curing her hair so early in the morning of a bad weather day -- Nothing Scott claimed she was doing that morning or had to do that day rings true, based on what other family members knew she would do, etc.While Dalton's book presents another view, most readers will be quite skeptical and demand more hard evidence that Laci was kidnapped, that other pregnant women were stalked and kidnapped and used in satanic rituals, etc. None of this has been established --- if this cult has been habitating in Modesto--where is this cult now? The woman who was also pregnant, who had a dog with the same name, who had the retail store and who felt she was being stalked that day-- where is she now? Why has Matt Dalton not been able to produce one witness to come forward to dispute the Modesto police, the prosecution, and now that a man has been sentenced to death-- why has no one come forward to try to set the record straight? Everyone else -- except Matt Dalton-- has accepted that this is truly a CASE CLOSED."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"The first sentence of a book often sets the tone of the author's work. In Matt Dalton's exercise in futility, Presumed Guilty, his first sentence reveals (perhaps unintentionally) the reason his book fails as a treatise for Peterson's \\"factual innocence\\":The jury moved into the jury box.Yes: the jury.The jury at Peterson's trial decided his guilt. Not the viewers, not Matt Dalton, not the press, not the Modesto police, not the crowd outside the Stanislaus County jail when Peterson was arrested, and not the media. The jury heard all the testimony, was privy to the voluminous exhibits and documentation, and given instructions on the law and its obligation to it.Dalton should have read his first sentence and realized, as an officer of the court, what his role was in this case. He was merely an investigator hired by the defense team, and a temporary one at that. His duty to his former client, to the California Bar, and in the service of justice was to protect confidentiality and adhere to the judge's orders. By releasing this book, he violated any number of rules of ethics and insulted readers' intelligence in the process.Peterson's trial was the most important aspect of this case and closed or negated all the holes that Dalton accounts in his book. For Geragos to overtly ignore any exculpatory evidence would have been the height of incompetence. While I may think Geragos is a pretty bad lawyer (and a fountain of comedy fodder), I don't believe he would intentionally omit anything relevant that would have helped Peterson; real proof of that would have meant disbarment.As a former prosecutor, Dalton is keenly aware of the laws of evidence. He knows that none of his allusions of a third-party defense have any merit. Otherwise, there would have been a showing at the trial. His book is, at best, glorified tabloid fodder with no nexus established between the behavior of local thugs and dubious statistics on satanic cult activity in the Modesto area and Laci Peterson's murder. Over a third of the repetitive and irrelevant material is devoted to discussing disparate criminal activities and anecdotes about cults; yet, with all the investigation techniques at his disposal, Dalton never finds a single probative issue that would have withstood the scrutiny of a court of law.The book is filled with misinformation and inaccuracies, far too many to enumerate in a review. This book is riddled with disinformation, out-of-context exerpts from police reports, anonymous witnesses who are never directly quoted, and impotent defense spin. For those with even a passing acquaintance with the case, it is a farce."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I have followed the Peterson case very closely. I have truly tried to weigh all facts, evidence, theories, etc. fairly and logically. However, Dalton's witnessess, his theories, etc. just do not add up. He states that he himself interviewed the six witnessess that \\"saw\\" Laci the morning of Dec. 24. Yet he gives very sketchy information about these sightings. For one witness (Diane Campos) he does not even give the time she saw Laci. The time he claims the councilman's wife saw Laci walking the dog was actually AFTER the dog was found! And he gives no information as to what these witnesses saw Laci wearing - white coat, black, hat?, etc. Logic dictates that when Geragos reviewed Dalton's findings there were too many inconsistencies with these witnesses for them to be taken seriously on the stand. They probably could not withstand a vigorous cross and could possibly be more detrimental to the defense. Further, with regard to the homeless, satanic activites, burgularies, etc. I wanted to really review this information carefully. However, there were too many disparate ideas....too many vauge theories that do not connect together. And not enough hard information. Dalton states there were several other missing pregnant women - yet gives no information about any of those cases (except for Evelyn Hernandez). How can a reader weigh this information when it is so sketchy and vauge? Come on! You were the one culling this information, Dalton - so give it to us more thoroughly!I tried to give Dalton's book a true go....but many of his \\"facts\\" were flat out wrong. He stated that Scott himself called the police, that the baby was cremated, that Amy (Laci's sister) came over for pizza & movie the night of the 23rd (she was only invited). And he often states \\"I have no idea why this was never followed up\\". Dude - Geragos would've followed up on anything! I'd imagine his info. was followed up on and dismissed for a variety of logical reasons. Can anyone really imagine Geragos being presented with valuable information that could save his client (and give him a win on a huge case) and not using it?By the time Dalton was off the case - very early on - he was not privy to what was going on....and it shows!For the true Peterson followers this book is a waste. If you're really interested - flip through it in a book store and put it back down. It is filled with errors, and very insubstantial, very thin information that doesn't even connect. I cannot believe a lawyer would write such an immature book - it feels like my 13 yr. old brother wrote this .....like, \\"why aren't all these people listening to me\\"? Because they're intelligent."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"As it turns out, this is just page after page of whining. \\"Woe is me, I have it so hard, nobody will talk to me, nobody likes me, my boss doesn't appreciate me, everybody picks on me, I have no funds or resources, I wish I hadn't quit my day job.\\"Mr. Dalton collects reams of what he calls \\"evidence\\" that is never used in court, and he repeats the phrase several times: \\"I don't know why this never made it to court.\\" Well, considering Geragos fired Mr. Dalton a few months in, it was probably because the \\"evidence\\" he was collecting was useless and stupid. He makes misleading statements and false assumptions. \\"The presence of duct tape suggests abduction.\\" It most certainly does not; what a ridiculous thing to say, unless you want to consider that Scott, in a way, \\"abducted\\" his own wife and used duct tape to bind her dead body. He also assumes that EVERY sighting of a dark-haired pregnant woman walking her dog is Laci, regardless of when or where she's seen, no matter how far off Laci's usual route it is or what kind of dog the woman is walking. He assumes that because the police aren't telling him about every, single piece of information they gather or every, single lead or tip they pursue, that they aren't doing any investigating anywhere else except on Scott Peterson. The police were exhaustive in their investigations of numerous leads and piles of information, they simply weren't obligated to tell him anything about it. So he decided that, of course, they must not be following up on anything else.This is also as much a dig at Geragos as it is anything else; he finally admits toward the end that there was tension between him and Geragos and he resents being fired. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was interesting and I did finish it. But don't expect much in the way of \\"new\\" evidence that exonerates Scott Peterson, because there isn't any."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Anyone giving this book a bad review already had their mind made up before reading it... if they actually read it... which I doubt. The details from the police records and the independent research and interviews of witnesses by this author were outstanding.Originally, I was fervently of the same opinion as the jury in this case. I was positive he was guilty. I had thought the idea of a bunch of fanatics in Modesto as ludicrous...I was wrong. After reading this book and Crier's book \\"A Deadly Game\\" which give us tons of info from police records that none of us ever heard about... nor were presented in court... I found that there was a lot more to the story than we had been told. After reading about these police reports and credible witnesses and details none of us ever knew... nor were these presented in court. These official reports and details and witness reports contain crucial details which really change the basis of what we thought we knew.You really need to read this book and Crier's book to get the full story. I also recommend the book by the Jury as well. There was a lot of improper behavior on their part and one juror having 3 others kicked off because he did not want to waste time deliberating. He wanted to return to work and not lose income so he kept reporting jurors with letters to the judge. He was not interested in justice. He just wanted to get out of there.The tampering the Modesto police did with the evidence and covering up crimes occurring across the street from Laci and crimes committed in clear view of the police is an atrocity. The Modesto police should be investigated and sentenced for the crimes they committed. They committed Federal crimes by denying Scott's rights by tampering with evidence and hiding details from his attorneys. These are on record in the police files as to how they buried evidence, changed dates, ignored witnesses, gave criminals deals, listened in on attorney-client privileged conversations, destroyed evidence, buried crimes and even hid a jailhouse phone recording of a criminal talking to his cohort about the pregnant woman they killed on Christmas Eve. I saw quite a bit more police file information in the book \\"A Deadly Game\\" as well. All of this is in the police files and records and verified by witnesses.We have been lied to about a lot of things. Our beliefs were based on those lies. You need to read these two books... and read them with an open mind. I had been 100% certain of Peterson's guilt. I was wrong because the information I got from the media was wrong and they were given false info by the police.Did you now that the tan pants Laci wore on the 23rd were hanging in her closet and identified by her sister Amy? We were told these were on her body. They were not. It was a falsehood told to the media.Another falsehood was about Scott getting a huge insurance policy on her just before her death. That was not true. The police admitted they had told the Rocha's that to get them to turn against Scott. The only insurance they had was a family package which included retirement planning and Scott was insured for twice as much as Laci. Laci had been the one to get the insurance several years prior. So, this was not done as a prelude to her demise as had been floated by the police... and they admitted it was a ploy to create hatred against him.The hair in the pliers could have gotten in there from anywhere. She could have used those same pliers in the house to fix her jewelry. I got my hair caught in pliers many times.As for the concrete anchor, Scott showed the receipt where he had only bought a small bag for one and only had one bucket to mix it in. It was having problems setting up because it was below 50 degrees, so it was crumbling and didn't mix well. The photos do not show rings for multiple anchors. No one ever mentioned he had a receipt which showed the amount of concrete he had purchased.A witness who had an office near Scott's warehouse told police that she saw Laci there on Dec 20th and since Scott had stuff piled in front of the bathroom in his warehouse... Laci had gone over to her office there to use her restroom that day. No one ever mentioned this witness. The boat was there that day where Laci could see it.Laci's missing watch was pawned at a shop near her home but police prevented the defense from obtaining info about it and about who sold it to the pawn shop.As for Scott having asked about selling his house and car... the police had taken his vehicles, computers, paperwork, mail and even the checks he needed to pay his employee and do his job. If you can't work, you can't pay your bills... so you either have to work or sell your house and vehicles or lose them. He could not file bankruptcy because he and Laci had previously done so. What would you do if you couldn't work or pay your bills? The comments in the police files in Crier's book showed that the police were deliberately abusing the warrants to take everything to make it impossible for him to work and pay bills to stress him out until he cracked. The police were quite amused about it according to their own comments Crier included in the other book.Did you know that Scott had told a previous girlfriend, Katy Hansen (The one he was seeing when he graduated Cal Poly) that he had \\"lost\\" his wife? That was years before. It was a line he used for sympathy. Not an intent... but dumb on his part as was his lying. My own son, same age as Scott who also lives in the bay area, tells women whoppers like that... things like being born in Ireland and owning property in Mexico, etc. My son tells all kind of lies about traveling in Europe and SE Asia when he is juggling more than one girlfriend. He's a cad as well. It is an example of things immature cads say in their 20's & 30's when they are cheating on girlfriends and wives... I don't approve of it, but these are stupid things they say.Did you know that Ron Grantski, Sharon Rocha's companion, was also Fishing on that same morning Dec 24, 2002 at the very SAME time... yet the Modesto police detective admitted in court on the witness stand that the Modesto police did not find out that Grantski was fishing until after Scott's trial had started. Did the police bother to interview anyone? How could they not interview someone who also had motive, opportunity and access? Especially her mother's companion... someone with the same alibi which Scott was prosecuted on. Read the court transcripts of Grantski's cross examination. He sounds like a bully.Did you know that the robbery directly across the street from Laci occurred that morning of Dec 24, 2002. The neighbor who witnessed the robbery is on record having called it in that morning and was adamant about the date. The thieves only agreed to plead guilty if the date was changed to the 27th. The neighbors who owned the house returned home on Christmas and reported the theft to the police at the Peterson home. Other neighbors also reported the robbers on the 24th. All of this was buried by the police including Laci's getting involved.Three other sets of witnesses saw Laci at the same location with her dog being accosted by 2 men. Another saw her shoes and reported them. Another person reported a scream. All at the same location. One of them knew her personally. The police were not interested in any of this. There are multiple reports of incidents and assaults by this group of fanatics on the 24th which were reported to police that day and after. Relatives of these fanatics also swore about this group as did a woman who was assaulted by them a couple weeks earlier. The fanatics also have paintings at the bay where her body was found which showed a pregnant woman without head, arms or feet. These huge paintings were there before Laci disappeared. Laci was not the first pregnant woman found there at the same bay location missing the very head, arms and feet like Laci. The paintings denote a location where these lunatic Satanists worship. Professional divers say any bodies dumped in the bay near those paintings would be pulled by currents to the locations where the two women were found. I think there were 6 reports of missing pregnant women near Modesto.Although I originally thought this was something contrived. I thought this story about fanatic killers as ridiculous... I was wrong. There are several nut groups like this in CA. I used to live in California and there were a lot of kooks living in these areas... Jim Jones Guyana group; Rev Moon's group; Remember Manson's group terrorizing the home of Sharon Tate to make it look like devil worshipers? Apparently, there were more than one report of human body parts found and turned over to Modesto police but they didn't want to spent the money on DNA testing. This group lives in vans out by the reservoir and get away with their crimes as does the group of thieves in Laci's neighborhood who are tied to this other violent bunch. The information from the police files in this book and the investigation done by this former LA Prosecutor is exceptional. You really should read about it. His investigation and dedication he described in this book was quite compelling.Some of these eye witnesses were police officers. Another was a former city councilman. Another witness who saw Laci was a neighbor and yet another knew her from the doctor's office. Many witnesses are people who actually knew Laci and could verify their identification of her... not strangers wanting publicity. But the police were hell-bent on one theory and did everything they could to bury the other reports.This attorney who wrote this book was a Deputy county Prosecutor in LA for 13 years. Highly respected and an honest man who did his best to share the details of what he found. He spent months hunting down the witnesses and police reports for the crimes which traced back to Laci. The amount of crime reports that week within a block of Laci's home were shocking. Even worse was this group living out of their van who were also connected to the thieves who robbed Laci's neighbor directly across the street that same day she disappeared and how it tied together with the violent lunatic fanatics. You really need to read this book and the information from the police files and the interviews of witnesses, relatives and neighbors who knew these criminals.This author, the attorney who did the research for Peterson, was appalled that Geragos never used any of the info in court. The jury never got to hear it. Even the jurors stated in their own book how they were stunned that Geragos dropped the ball and did not present much of a defense. It seems that Geragos was in a huge hurry to rush down to LA to snatch up his new client Michael Jackson at the time. Fortunately for MJ, he selected another lawyer... but Scott paid the price. Geragos didn't even show up for the verdict. He just took the Peterson's million dollars they had mortgaged 2 of their homes to pay and left Scott hanging without a defense. We could all see the way he dropped the ball. Even the jury talked about it.Even though I was not a fan of Scotts and had believed in his guilt, after reading this book, Crier's book and the Jury's book... which had the details from police records and witnesses which were never released to the media or the court... I believe we were all wrong. You really need to read this book and make up your own mind based on the facts. I never thought he could be innocent, especially after hearing his phone calls with Amber... but after finding out about the details and research this former prosecutor did in regard to the thieves and fanatics and witness reports... there is a completely different story than what we believed. Yes, he was a womanizing cad who told huge lies... but something else terrible happened that day and likely would have happened even if he had stayed home and she had left to walk the dog.Those fanatics were hell bent on grabbing a pregnant woman that day. They had gone after another pregnant woman that same day... but she had run to the back of her store and gotten one of her male employees to come help her call the police... and she avoided being assaulted. But she reported a description of the van and men who were coming after her that day... ones seen later by witnesses who were yelling at Laci. These fanatics did not get the first pregnant woman so they went after a second one for their vile needs... Laci. They did find caffeine in Laci's system. She never drank caffeine... but that means poor Laci was still alive for some time after. When they found the bodies of Laci and Connor, they had duct tape and other things on them and a plastic bag with the odor of decay where they believe Conner had been placed... but the police removed all of these objects and tampered with the bodies before the coroner saw them. This was verified by the photos taken before the bodies had been tampered with. The marks of the tape was still on the bodies. Once you read about this in this book, you will know how horrible it was for Laci at the end. The lunatics who did it are still on the loose without any retribution for their crimes. Read it for yourself. Don't let anyone tell you how to think. I almost didn't read this book because I thought it was BS. It was not.The author was quite credible and provided extensive information on his investigation, interviews, police reports, etc."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"It is with deep regret that I am unable to give this book zero stars.

I still wish someone would write a book providing insight on why the public latched onto the case, and so vehemently believe in Peterson's guilt and hate him with such venom, as if they were 'attached' to the victims in some way.The thoughts and ideas Dalton brings out, are some of the same ones I had during the investigation and trial. There are still many things the defense did, or didn't do, that baffles me. Chief among this is why they didn't attack the timeframe of the robbery? Dalton seems perplexed as well.I didn't particularily believe the 'devil worshiper' theory, but after reading the book, I wonder why, if it's that prevelant in the Modesto area, it wasn't looked in to further.As for the negative reveiws here....I think it's more of the emotion I mentioned above.

I am looking forward to reading Sharon Rocha's book!"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"For a true crime book written by an attorney I was severely disappointed with this book.That's because the author failed to provide all the facts when discussing the case.As an easy case in point the author started his discussion about the seeming rush to judgment made when police originally arrested Scott Peterson for the death of his wife. He recounted what he said were all the items discovered on Peterson and tried to minimize their significance. Yet and this is very important NOT ALL THE ITEMS FOUND ON PETERSON WERE MENTIONED OR EVEN EXPLAINED.One of those items was the mapquest map to Amber Frey that Peterson had downloaded the day before. While I can certainly understand why a defense attorney for Peterson wouldn't want to focus attention on this I don't understand why he didn't even mention it in his treatment of this issue. When I saw the omission it made me question the honesty and completeness with which the author was treating his discussion of other issues. For example he also didn't mention the shovel Peterson had or the camping equipment. As with the Frey map it left me wondering just what else he was leaving out.Having incompletely covered the Peterson arrest the author continued to recount the rest of the \\"facts\\" of the case. Irrelevantly he focused on some half a dozen witnesses who supposedly said they saw Laci Peterson walking the couple's dog. At trial, none of these \\"witnesses\\" was actually called. Yet even if they were called it still wouldn't mean that the jury couldn't have found that Peterson comitted the murder of his wife AFTER she got back from walking the dog. Indeed, the evidence of the day walking might actually have supported a murder theory because the witnesses might show that Peterson let his wife take the walk in order to set up possible alternative suspects. \\"Hey I couldn't have done, maybe it was the guy who saw her walking the dog.\\")Oddly, the author then coupled this dog walking evidence with a discussion of how Laci Peterson may have been killed in a home invasion. Had her home been invaded, one might think that evidence of the invasion -- a broken window or door -- might be present but significantly none of this was even argued by the defense. More fatally to the defense's theory though was the idea that if Laci had been out walking the dog then she wouldn't have been home to be the victim of the home invasion in the first place.In a truly bizaar turn the author also discussed the occult and how Laci Peterson may have been the victim of local Satanists. Her hands and feet were removed from her body, the author noted. What he failed to recount however was the simple fact that in marine burials the body often loses appendages because of its exposure to marine life.With all its discussion of missing witnesses and other possible suspects, the only theory of the crime the defense seemed to fail to discuss was the most obvious one: that Laci Peterson was killed by her husband Scott Peterson. Whereas he'd said he was the grieving husband, he'd actually been seeing another woman. Whereas he'd said he'd been telling the truth, he habitually lied to Amber Frey about his marital status and to the Rocha family about his involvement with Amber Frey. Whereas he'd said had nothing to do with the murder, \\"surprisingly\\" the bodies of his wife and child had been discovered to have been a marine burial. And even more amazingly -- considering he'd just purchased the boat -- a strand of hair consistent his wife's was found in pliers left on that same boat.As a practicing lawyer my advice to starting attorneys always starts with this simple maxim: at the very least DO NOT do anything to make your client's situation worse.By writing a stupid book which failed to fully discuss the case, I came away more convinced of Scott Peterson's guilt than I'd been prior to picking it up."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Years ago I read Fatal Vision about the Jeffery MacDonald case written by Joe McGinnis. After reading that book, I vacilated between whether or not MacDonald did the crime and I'm still not sure.I was hoping for the same type of reaction this time. Dalton does provide some compelling evidence that perhaps there could have been reasonable doubt. But there was a lot of detail left out that other reviewers here have already pointed out. I recently served on jury duty for a criminal case and it is true that the truth is more than what the lead attorney chooses to let the jury hear. I stayed for the sentencing by the Judge and found out additional information about the defendant that was not presented at the trial.In addition, I know for a fact that there are many investigations whereby the police dig their heels in so far that they cannot see the forest for the trees. In this case, Dalton does point out Scott was their primary suspect and remained their primary suspect in lieu of other potential evidence.The bodies were found in the vicinity where Scott went fishing. How come the pallet bag was not part of the evidence? I think this is a big clue that maybe someone other than Scott put those bodies there.This book seemed rushed in its writing; therefore, appears amaturish. A lot more detail should or even could have been added to the evidence put forth in this book. Too bad Dalton didn't take the time."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Unbelievable that a publisher would agree to print this nonsense.Don't waste your time"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"This is one I wish I could send back to the author and say, I don't want this on my shelf.

That said, it was worth the price.The author is certainly biased in his account about the defense's evidence that was suppressed in the Peterson trial. What about the suppression of evidence from the prosecution? There are ALOT of defense leads (satanic cult, screaming from the bathroom, witnesses that saw Laci) that were not followed up on. WHY? Did the Modesto police really want a repeat of the Chandra Levy case on their hands? If these leads were so good, why didn't the Modesto police follow up? Or did they? Since they didn't/couldn't convict Condit in the Levi case, you expect me to believe they wanted to prosecute Peterson in the worst way?It seems to me that this attorney wasn't tenacious enough with his leads. The book insinuates that the Modesto police didn't follow leads, and the author didn't get along with Gerogos. BFD. The author was cut off from the case after 6 months. Why is that? If he was any good, they would have kept him on.Very very one sided look at this trial."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Because Matt Dalton was on the defense legal team, I was curious if he was so willing to destroy his career by breaking client confidentialities, in writing a \\"tell all book.\\"As it turns out, he didn't violate attorney/client confidentialities. And what this book seems to be about is Dalton's effort to influence the public into accepting an appeal.Dalton claims to have written this book to tell the public how so much evidence was not presented to the jury, evidence that according to Matt Dalton would have caused reasonable doubt.While his book is a much better read than Amber Frey's book , Dalton's \\"Presumed Guilty,\\" lacks substance.Dalton uses examples such as, \\"Six pregnant women in addition to Laci Peterson were reported missing and presumed dead within eighty miles of Modesto between 1999 and 2002.\\"He never sights who those women were. And with that time frame, is this relevant to Scott Peterson's case?He also never says why the evidence that he claims would have created reasonable doubt was not presented. Was the \\"evidence\\" not deemed relevant by the court? Dalton never tells readers the answer.While \\"Presumed Guilty\\" is a quick read, it lacks facts that could hold up in a court of appeals."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Read this book with an open mind and be amazed. I don't know if Scott Peterson is guilty or not, but I feel in such an important case ALL angles must be considered. So many are so quick to jump on Scott Peterson's moral choices, and ignore the this new angle of information regarding the murder case. Dalton was there and found some interesting and valid possibilities that should have been brought up in court.No wonder Geragos wanted the book stopped.OJ's lawyers would have had Scott on a golf course right now!"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"My hat is off to Matt Dalton for writing one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read! I believe that I am only one of a small number of people who believe that Scott Peterson is innocent and therefore an innocent man sits on death row for murders he did not commit. I don't give a rats behind about what the media and the public think about Scott. He is a hated adulterer, not a murderer. He was convicted by the media and the public because he lied about having an affair. How many of us have lied about the same thing? I fear only what this world has come to that we would allow this miscarriage of justice to happen at all. For those who read this book you will have no choice but to come to the conclusion that there was \\"AT LEAST\\" reasonable doubt that Mr. Peterson is guilty. On October 29th, 2004, Judge Delucchi states the following: \\"With all the issues that have been raised in this case, if there is a conviction in this case, this will be an appelllate lawyers petri dish\\". Even the judge has predicted that this is NOT the end of this case and certainly NOT the end for Scott Peterson.This book reveals some very interesting facts that cannot be ignored. To do so places all of us in danger and I believe it will happen again because we are allowing it too. We focused on just one person. Instead of tryng to find out what really happened, most people just got angry and saw Scott as the bad guy. I know I did, then I started questioning things that I saw wrong with this case as Mr. Dalton did. People chose to line the pockets of the media personalities that sought only to get rich off of the families that lost their beloved Laci and Conner by writing books with information that was exaggerated and false. If it's the truth you're after, read this book! If you just want to be part of the popular vote, then choose to ignore the facts and stay stupid. I for one hope that justice will someday be served and the real killer/s be brought forth. Until then, just remember that there is a killer/s out there and no one is safe.Congratulations Matt Dalton! Your book is FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Thank you for this book.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"After reading this book, I have more questions than answers rearding defense counsel, Modesto D.A.'s office and detectives. In fact, questions about everyone handling this case. I believe Scott Peteresen is quilty, but I find it incredulous that Modesto, despite their ineptness, would slap themselves on the back for a job well done. This should be text book for law school students."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"I'm not sure I like the writing style of the author, but overall it's a good book. I gave it 4 stars because I'm so grateful that Matt Dalton wrote it. Our justice system is frightening when someone is tried and convicted in the media long before he was even arrested. It's frightening how credible leads were ignored. It's frightening that Scott was convicted and put on death row with no evidence. This book goes into all of that.In my personal opinion, the trial was a joke.. Amber Fry and her mistress press conference as the \\"motive\\" who offered nothing as far Scott being guilty of murder.. the Rocha family and their news conferences implicating Scott long before he was arrested. I think it all contributed to Scott being convicted in the media long before his arrest, and I think it contributed to ignoring the credible leads and evidence discussed in Matt Dalton's book.5 stars to Matt Dalton for writing this book."},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Presumed Guilty seeks true justice. We want the real person to be punished for these dispicable acts. If it's Scott, then let him pay. If not, let's find the real killer or killers. Matt Dalton's book makes me question the handling of the Petersen case. Where was his defense team? At some point, I'd like to see a face off between Geragos and Dalton on a CNN or Court TV show. An unbiased moderator (unlike Nancy Grace) asking questions as in presidential campaign debates could prove beneficial. Let's do it quickly so Laci's family can enjoy whatever peace they can. Finally, can we put Amber back in the closet? She's received far too much press for her importance in this case. We know Scott cheated, said things men do when trying to coerce a female to have sex with them.

I received the book this morning and I finished it four hours later. I couldn't put it down. What Dalton has discovered in this case will amaze you. Dalton, exposes the incompetence of both the Modesto Police Department and Mark Geregos. Dalton provides uncountable evidence to prove reasonable doubt. Dalton offers facts upon facts that will have you shaking your head in disbelief. This book will leave several doubts regarding our justice system, our belief in human intent, the intent of the media and most of all the belief in local Police officials.

If the allegations here ARE true-then of course, it is horrifying and scary, as any one of us could be convicted if we have the misfortune of losing a spouse to murder...Also, if true, I have to trust the Supreme Court will ultimately grant a new trial.

This is NOT true, as Amy testified in court.Also, I think he had too many possible \\"theories\\" as to who killed Laci. Anyone could do that with any murder.

In reality it's less than zero!"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Matt Dalton spent 13 years as a prosecutor in Long Beach and Los Angeles County. He joined the Geragos & Geragos law firm in 2003 and worked to defend Scott Peterson. This book tells about the defense and reports that were not allowed into evidence. This 192 page book lacks an index or any photographs. The 'Introduction' tells how Dalton worked to investigate public corruption only to have the D.A. cancel the investigation (p.5). Dalton then quit to work for Mark Geragos, who he knew previously (p.4). Dalton worked exclusively on the Peterson case for six months. He said legal commentators who opined on Peterson's guilt relied on erroneous information, false premises, and guesswork (p.6). Existing crucial information was never presented at the trial. This book is aimed at an educated audience rather than a television audience (p.7).Chapter 1 has the case against Scott Peterson. There wasn't much physical evidence against Peterson except for one strand of hair found in his boat. Peterson had no significant injuries himself (p.14). Peterson's affair with Frey was publicized by the police to vilify Peterson (this makes it easier to convict). There was the strange coincidence of a deputy district attorney who lived nearby; she had also had a golden retriever and had been threatened by gang members. Dalton wonders about mistaken identification (p.22). Scott's fishing trip in the same area where the bodies were found was a suspicious circumstance. The police wiretapped Scott's phone calls to his lawyer (p.32) and watched meetings (p.33). Laci's gold Croton watch was pawned 12/31/2002 by a woman(p.47); this was suspicious (p.50). There was an \\"unusual amount of crime\\" in Laci's neighborhood on the day she disappeared (p.53). The home across the street was burglarized that morning (p.57).Six eyewitnesses said they saw Laci alive after she supposedly disappeared; this was not allowed at the trial (p.71)! Their stories are on pages 72-78. The relentless media coverage made Scott a hated figure (p.83); some examples are given (pp.84-85). Laci's broken ribs argue against a \\"soft kill\\" (p.88). Dalton's attempts to gather evidence was stymied (pp.90-93). Chapter 6 tells about the satanic cults around Modesto; was something going on (p.110)? Chapter 7 tells of satanic killings and mutilations. Dalton explains why Amber could not have been a motive for murder (p.124). Scott may have been convicted for murder when he was only guilty of adultery (p.125). Amber did the proper thing by revealing her relationship. Differences in the condition of the bodies suggested the baby had been protected against sea life (Chapter 9).In Chapter 10 Dalton joined a larger law firm. Peterson chose to stay with Geragos. In Chapter 11 \\"The Trial\\" Dalton explains the evidence for Laci's use of the computer around 8:45 am on 12-24-2002 (pp.148-149). Peterson was an eager fisherman (p.151). [Would the family want fresh fish for Christmas Eve?] Was Peterson convicted because the jury had no other suspect (p.157)? Dalton provides the reports that suggest Laci was abducted (pp.157-163). Dumping a body in San Francisco Bay occurred before (p.164). The jury never heard from these witnesses (p.165). Geragos argued it was impossible to push a 150 pound body overboard from Peterson's 14-foot aluminum boat. The exclusion of demonstrable evidence could win a new trial for Peterson (pp.167-170). Dalton concludes by saying the jury would not have convicted Peterson if they had the relevant information that was withheld. Chapter 12 ends this boo; you should read at least this part. Peterson was found guilty without factual evidence; compare this to Robert Blake and OJ Simpson (pp.181-183). Is Peterson the current version of Dr. Sam Sheppard (pp.176-177)?"},{"Title":"Presumed Guilty: What the Jury Never Knew About Laci Peterson's Murder and Why Scott Peterson Should Not Be on Death Row","review":"Only one question remained in my mind following the reading of this jejune and self-promoting tome.

William Seabrook wrote a thick paperback entitled \\"Witchcraft\\", which was copyrighted in '42 and published (by Pinnacle?) in '71.

Anyhow, \\"Witchcraft\\" by Seabrook was one of the best investigative (rather than technical or instructive) books on the subject ever written, by anyone. Unbiased and very informative -- perhaps TOO informative, as apparently he was the recipient of a powerful curse which compelled him to commit suicide shortly after this book went into print. The title is a bit misleading, as it focuses primarilly on voodoo and various forms of aboriginal shamanism, with some folklore about shapeshifting and vampirism thrown in.

Still, it was a surprise to find so many General officers drawn from the fighting arm who were inadequate. One completes the book with a healthy respect for Lincoln, whose abilities were amazing, particularly given his background.The book focuses on command and control, and in 1952 when it was first published, the world of war was not yet as sharply defined for us as it is today.

Lincoln was not just a great politician, but he was an excellent war strategist. If he had been a general, he would of held his own with the greats such as Lee, Jackson, Sherman, and Grant. In this book, Williams details the interactions of Lincoln, Stanton, Halleck, and such generals as Pope, McClellan, Grant, Sheridan, and Sherman. Lincoln kept an eye on all orders going to these generals and contributed positively to the strategy of the union. When a general screwed up (McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker), Lincoln was there to make suggestions and work with these leaders. It is amazing the patience Lincoln displayed with these huge ego leaders. Some even thought they had more sense than their leader. Lincoln's brillance shins through on all these interactions. He displayed a fatherly attitude toward these individuals.This is great history by a well known historian. This should be one of the books read by all Civil War historians.

Poring over the orders that passed back and forth between Lincoln and his top commanders, Williams paints a highly opinionated portrait of Lincoln's efforts to find the commander who will at last win the war. Williams' portrait of McClellan is extensive - and unforgiving. How this classic study could have been allowed to pass exclusively into the realm of the used book seller is a mystery to this reviewer."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"In Lincoln and His Generals, T. Harry Williams concentrated on telling the story of Lincoln as commander in chief during America's greatest and most devastating war. In the preface he states his goals clearly; \\"my theme is Lincoln as a director of war and his place in the high command and his influence in developing a modern command system for his nation.\\" Williams expertly develops this theme throughout this fascinating book. Though many may disagree with some of his conclusions about how effective Lincoln was in this role, few, after reading this book, would dispute the fact that it is a well written and reasoned account of the topic, and that it is an important contribution both to Civil War and Lincoln studies.William's views Lincoln as a genius - a man, who came into office with no military knowledge, yet had the flexibility of mind to adapt and learn from his mistakes to guide his country to victory through its greatest wartime crisis. He states that, \\"Lincoln, by the power of his mind, became a fine strategist...a better natural strategist than were most of the trained soldiers.\\" He claims that Lincoln grasped the war's big picture from the very beginning, and even claims that Grant's final end-game strategy from 1864 on was fundamentally Lincoln's plan, though the details and execution were Grant's. I believe that he overreaches with some of these claims, yet he still makes a great case for Lincoln's genius, and his role as the indispensable man behind Union victory.Williams also writes of the generals who were Lincoln's tools for winning the war. McClellan and Grant get the most ink, the former because, despite his great talent, he was ultimately a failure and Lincoln's greatest disappointment and the latter because, in William's estimation, he was the greatest general on either side of the war. Of Lincoln's other generals, Williams writes more about the ineffective, incompetent ones such as Fremont and Banks than he does of effective and even great generals like Sherman and Thomas. He explains in his preface that the reason for this is that the incompetent generals were headaches to Lincoln, forcing him to have intimate command relationships with them, while he had to interfere very little with the moves of the effective Sherman and Thomas.Whether or not you agree with all or even any of the author's conclusions, he has written what still stands as the definitive work on this topic - the launching point for discussion and debate on Lincoln's role as commander in chief. Not only that, he has done it in fine style, creating a clear, interesting, and well-written book that stands as a masterpiece in its field. I give it my highest recommendation.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"An absolutely engrossing explanation of how Lincoln and his top generals fought the Civil War and how the war forced the adoption of a modern command structure.If you've seen pictures of Lincoln when elected in 1861 and compared them to pictures from 1865 and wondered why he looked so worn, here's the answer: he had generals (and oh what generals they were!).The fault I find is that it gives too much emphasis to Mclellan and most of the remaining attention to Grant. While these were the major Generals in Chief, I would have liked to have seen more on the other generals who served under them."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"T. Harry Williams spent a lifetime seeking to understand the role of leadership and power in American history. This book is an elegant analysis of how a wartime president with little military service led a nation during its most desperate era, and rose to the occasion not only to get by but to excel. Williams agrees that Lincoln is the United States' most impressive leader, holding together the nation while desperate centrifugal tendencies tore it asunder. He asserts that Lincoln understood that the Civil War was the first \\"total war,\\" in which all elements of the population, economy, and every other aspect of society must be mobilized. \\"Lincoln and his Generals\\" is an elegant narrative of the evolution of the Civil War from the standpoint of Lincoln and his high command.Williams argues most eloquently the thesis that Lincoln was a brilliant military strategist. His generals did not understand this, wedded as they were to older Napoleonic battlefield tactics that were outmoded with the weaponry available during the Civil War. The drama in this book, and it is considerable, revolves around the controversies between Lincoln and the Union Army's leadership. The central foil for Lincoln's brilliance was Gen. William B. McClellan, the first commander of the Army of the Potomac and overall a superb general, at least as measured against the standards of Napoleonic warfare. He brought together an army, trained it well, organized its logistics, and failed to use it effectively during his time in command. Lincoln was not pleased at his reticence to fight, complaining that \\"He has got the slows\\" in his willingness to take the field.Conversely, Williams describes the effectiveness of Gen. U.S. Grant, who started the war as a minor commander in the Midwest but who demonstrated quickly and effectively that he understood the nature of modern, total war. His concepts of war, and his sense of military strategy matched well with Lincoln's. t. Harry Williams gets into the debate over who was the better general, Grant or Robert E. Lee, and sides resolutely with Grant's place in the pantheon of great military commanders. But he goes a step further, arguing that Lincoln was an even more effective \\"general\\" than both Grant and Lee. Both Lee and Grant admirers may dislike that assessment, and there are reasons to question it.Williams establishes that Lincoln had a superb grasp of strategy and some sense of how to accomplish it. Grant appreciated and accepted that strategy, according to Williams, and designed effective tactical plans to accomplish it. This made them an exceptionally successful team that played to each others strengths and minimized their individual faults. The author also criticizes Lee by questioning his grasp of a strategy for victory in the war. This may be a valid criticism, but as Avery O. Craven pointed out in his review of this book, Lee \\"served under a West Point graduate as the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, took over the \`global' side of things; Lee, of necessity, commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. How well he did his job compared with how well Grant did his is a matter of opinion and bias and little else\\" (Avery O. Craven review in \\"Mississippi Valley Historical Review,\\" 39 (September 1952): 338).This is first and foremost a magnificent narrative of this titanic struggle between great armies. Almost as important, it is an eloquent statement on behalf of Lincoln as a superb commander-in-chief. It is still a significant book more than fifty years after its publication."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"This book is a wonderful look at Lincoln and his relationship with his generals and why he went through so many prior to finally appointing Grant, he just couldn't find one that would not when under pressure find all the reason they could not to attack.The book also does an excellent job of detailing Lincoln's involvement in strategic policy for the Union armies. Surprisingly for a man who'd never held a high military rank, Lincoln displayed an incredible grasp of strategy and frequently understood things generals such as Meade did not. Williams also expands into how upon the appointment of Grant to general in chief, the Union high command evolved into a modern military command, the first of its kind in the world, even more advanced than anything seen in Europe until Moltke the Elder, with the Union army high command consisiting of Commander in Cheif, General in Chief, and a new office designed for Halleck and to keep Grant from having to be in Washington, Chief of Staff. Williams also makes clear the different military culture of the 19th century, in stark contrast to most instances today, a general who disagreed with Lincoln or thought his plan to have dissatisfied the president or simply disliked somone they were told to collaborate with in a battle, instead of trying to work out differences, asked to be relieved of command.The one major drawback to this book is its lack of maps. There are no maps to follow the action along, so its advisable to have a Civil War atlas at hand in order to be able to place some of the places the battles take place. Also, if you're looking for a detailed &quot;what happend&quot; in the many battles, in most cases you won't get it with this book. This book is purely about the command and control structure of the Union army and how the players interacted with each other. My one final and biggest grip with Williams is that he at many points assumes too much in my opinion. There are many instances where the documentary record when he wrote the book did not state what happend, so Williams assumes that things &quot;must have&quot; or &quot;certainly happend&quot; a certain way without in some cases anything approaching a clear reason why he draws this conclusion.Other than these few gripes, this is a wonderful book and should be read by anyone wishing to understand why Lincoln went through so many generals."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"While I enjoyed this book, I felt the title was deceptive. The author, T. Harry Williams, trys to convince us, that Lincoln was a master strategist, and it basically was his strategy that helped win the war. ( I HAD thought this book would be about Union Generals, as Douglass Freemans- Lee's Lt's was about his. That may have been my fault, for misunderstanding)I read this book with an open mind, yet with a good knowledge of the Civil War, and of McClellen, Meade, Grant, Hooker, Burnside, Pope and McDowell. McClellen stated many times, that Lincoln could not hold on to a secret, and that was his reason for not keeping him informed. Also, many of the plans McClellen devised, were later used by Grant. Hooker built the Union Military up, and did a fantastic job of organization, from the bottom ranks up. Meade, did much of the work, that we give Grant credit for, ( though Meade did make the newspapers mad at him, and refused to name him)Lincoln is a very interesting man, but I feel it is a stretch to call him a master military strategist.If you enjoy reading someone elses view, or opinion of the Civil War, this is a really nice book. But, that is why I can only give it three stars, it is good, but too much of the authors opinion."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"Williams notes in the preface of my 1952 edition that it is not about the Generals of the Union, but rather about Lincoln and his problems with the Union military commanders. While much of the text is dry details about this letter or that between Lincoln and his generals, the Williams does interject some bits of interesting facts and educated theories on why Lincoln often acted as he did. This is a well researched book, with most pages having between about 3 footnotes, and it is very helpful in understanding the political climate of the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"There are so many people that dance across the stage of the Civil War.

IT'S A MUST READ FOR YOU CIVIL WAR BUFFS.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"Although published some 50 years ago, Williams' book is a fascinating read of the relationships President Lincoln had with his various generals. While some were quite strained (McClellan, Butler, Pope), others worked quite well (Grant, Sherman, Thomas). Williams takes each relationship to show how Lincoln was truly a brilliant strategist who had a much firmer grasp of the North's true strategy of defeating and destroying Southern armies instead of the strategy of many Northern generals - just controlling territory.The narrative is smooth and flows freely and the writing style is simple without being simplistic. While other more learned students of the Civil War may have issues with some of the author's conclusions, I thought Williams was resonably sound in his analysis.The only problem I had with the book was the lack of maps. Granted, this book is a study of the relationship between Lincoln and his generals and the Northern command structure during the Civil War. However, in my humble opinion, having a few maps would have enhanced the reader's grasp of the strategy Lincoln was trying to implement during the war.Complaint aside, I heartily recommend this book as an excellent study. Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lincoln and His Generals","review":"This is not a history of the war or a detailed description of the battles (see Foote's trilogy for that). It's just what it says it is -- a history of Lincoln's dealings with his generals.At the onset of the war, the US had almost no army, few weapons, no officers trained in large strategic warfare and an outmoded system of command. Lincoln himself had no real military experience. It took time and many blunders before Grant marched south in 1864 with a clear strategy for ending the war behind the most powerful, well equipped army in the world.Lincoln was highly intelligent and had an innate strategic vision that outclassed all of his generals (the prime objective was to destroy Lee's army, not capture Richmond). Lincoln took his commander in chief role seriously and often took an active part in the campaigns, at least before he finally found Grant. The strengths and (mostly) weaknesses of McClellan, Hallack, Buell, Fremont, Banks, Burnside, Hooker, Rosecrans, and others are explored in just the right amount of detail.While Williams concludes that Lincoln was our greatest war president, there is no hero worship in this book. He relies on facts, as shown by telegrams (Lincoln lived at the telegraph office during battles), letters, journals and memoirs. Lincoln wrote some wonderfully pithy telegrams, like the one to Grant as he was flanking Lee's army down to Petersburg (\\"Hold on with a bulldog grip, and chew and choke as much as possible\\").This book is very well written and moves along at a smart pace. It's certainly one of the best Lincoln books.

Only by having a husband could she keep her family fortune out of the grasping hands of her cousin, Hugh Darryl.my review-the story was good in some places, frustrating in others. The hero, Giles was actually a more sympathatic character than the heroine Merry. In modern day-Merry's plight would have been considered \\"disfunctional\\" because of witnessing her parents infidelity and physical abuse. She in turn is mostly unemotional with her husband-except in the bedroom-which, for a traditional regency-this book has quite a few fairly explicit sex scenes-which may disturb most regency readers.This author's writing style is honestly odd. For instance she had a weird habit of writing when the husband was desirous of his wife-he was \\"leering\\" at her? I've normally seen that used with villains.

The book is beautiful and the artwork lives up to the expectations of the author. The content was disappointing in its simplicity. It is too juvenile for my almost 4 year old, but will serve as a fancy counting book for my littlest when he gets bigger. Very little attention is given to the animals themselves, and some sort of descriptive language in this regard would have enhanced this book considerably. Just Look Inside before you purchase to make sure you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Ladies and gentlebugs, this beautiful and intricately illustrated story is a fantastic read for children and adults of all ages. Base leads us on a journey around the world and puts us in touch in nature as we read through the cycle of drought and plenty. A rare find, this book strikes a careful a balance of imagination and conservation on a level that young children can comprehend. We love this book, though its pages are a bit delicate."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This book is one of the most exquisitely illustrated children's books I have ever seen. Each page features a number of beautifully painted animals, a different kind per page, gathered at a watering hole that is shrinking in size as time goes on. The settings are in a variety of natural environments. Colorful frogs adorn each illustration and upon closer look a variety of other animals can be found blended into the woods and grasses. Toward the end, the watering hole completely dries up, but then the rains return and so does the water. The final page features a wondrously colorful menagerie of all the animals returning to the pond. My three year old daughter asks for this book every night and loves counting the animals hidden throughout the beautiful scenes."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Beautiful pictures, a great idea for a story and cleverly delivered. My 3 year old loves looking at the animals almost as much as my husband and I enjoy reading and hunting for the hidden animals. This is my favorite children's book of all time!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I'm gonna go out on a limb here and state for one and all that \\"The Water Hole\\" is Graeme Base's masterpiece. Certainly \\"Animalia\\" has it's followers, and there's the occasional \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" groupie, but by and large \\"The Water Hole\\" trumps them all. Here, author and illustrator Base has combined the gimmick book (a water hole is cut out of each page, growing smaller as each animal drinks from it), with the counting book (each page displays a larger number of animals), with the informative travelogue (each page appears somewhere new in the world with animals from that region), with the hidden surprise book (you can see tons of different animals hidden in each scene). It's as if Base sat down one day to draw the impossible and did so with a mere flick of the pen. The book is amazing.If you're unfamiliar with Graeme Base, allow me to sum him up. Here we have an illustrator able to draw animals that are undoubtedly not photo-realistic, but remarkably real looking. These creatures are both cartoony and lifelike. Colors imbue every scene to the point of wonder. Base also is adept at the tiny details that make up much of his work. Because a lot of the fun from this story comes from finding animals hidden within the trees, weeds, bamboo, etc. that surround the water hole, Base must be especially cunning to make them both obvious and yet a part of the landscape. And I haven't even mentioned the pictures that run along the frame of each water hole scene. For each two-page spread, the artist has provided black silhouettes around the border that display the animals you can find hidden in the pictures, as well as their names. Don't know what a gharial or a tapir is? You will.At the end of the book, Base provides each number and the part of the world it belongs to. These range from India and Africa to Europe and the Galapagos Islands. The book is, quite frankly, exhausting. I've summed it up, but there is always more to tell. I haven't mentioned the tree frogs that dot every scene or the sub-committee of ladybugs. You will simply have to read it yourself. The book deserves to be remembered as one of the most beautiful (and clever) counting books ever devised. My advice is to snap it up, post haste."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Visit the water hole where animals from all over the world and many different habitats come for a drink and a splash. First there's the rhino, then two tigers, three toucans and four snow leopards. Is it my imagination, or is the pool growing smaller? Next come five moose, six catfish, seven pandas, eight ladybugs, nine tortoises and finally ten kangaroos. &quot;There was nothing to say. The water was all gone. And the animals went away.&quot; The earth is now dry and cracked, waiting for rain. The sky grows dark, the clouds appear and splat; one big drop hits the ground..... Graeme Base has outdone himself with this deceptively simple counting book. His text, complete with humorous asides and wonderful animal sound effects is easy and fun to read. But it's Mr Base's amazing, innovative and creative arwork that really makes this book stand out. By using a die-cut hole, youngsters can actually watch the water hole get smaller and smaller with each page turn, until it all but disappears. His detailed, lush scenes are a veritable feast for the eyes and beg to be explored. Each bold, bright and busy page is bordered with the silhouettes of animal filled landscapes and if you look closely and very carefully, you'll be able to find these additional animals hidden in the pictures. Perfect for children 4-8, The Water Hole is a counting book, science book, geography book and marvelous interactive book all rolled into one and a must for all home libraries."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"My son is 4 1/2 and absolutely loves animals. We bought this book and have not put it down. The book is much more than a counting book. It is a geography lesson as well. Each page is built around a different region of the world and has animals from that region hidden in the scenery. The illustrations are remarkable. One word of caution: do not read this book before bedtime unless you plan ahead, it is so much fun to search for the animals that you may be up all night!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"My Great Aunt gave this book to my family for Christmas. My wife and I sat down while the kids were napping and started to work through the book. About 90 minutes of working together we finally found all 10 frogs on the last page. It was a fun time for both of us. Sometimes we would have to put the book at arms length just to get a different perspective. Anyone who has kids will love this book. My 11 year old niece was enthralled with it and could hardly put it down.Make sure that you look at the scenes in the background and try and guess what they represent. The page of all the extinct animals was amazingly well done.The only hint that I will give is that the frog with the funny hat is the hardest to find and I can almost guarantee that he will be the last one that you find."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I just discovered this book today and I was so excited about it. The intricate illustrations that fill the pages, the borders, and the dust jacket are wonderful. Base takes animals from all over the globe and places them at the same water hole, which disappears rapidly and then illustrates how the water will come back. A young child can actually feel the hole getting smaller because of a cut-out pond on every page that shrinks. The book is excellent for learning numbers as well. This book is destined to be a classic like &quot;Animalia.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This was a gift to my 2-year old from a girlfriend/kinder teacher. My son is now almost 5, his brother is 2.5, and this book is dog-eared! We read this at least 3x/week. The illustrations are breathtaking. Their animal vocabulary is amazing. Their attention to detail has definitely improved in many areas - they look for hidden images in all their books now. Animalia, also by Graeme Base, is spectacular too - another favorite in our home."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I picked this book up at a school book fair - then went back for more copies for gifts! The artwork is out of this world - witty, mysterious - a true adventure. My 4 and 6 year old both enjoy it. The number part is young for them - but they enjoy relating the animals to the different continents - they enjoy the \\"I spy\\" aspect of the hidden animals, they enjoy naming the continent shaped water puddles at the end, they enjoyed learning the concept of renewal and migration. One of the reviewers was disappointed that the story was simple - I think the words are simple - but the story is voluminous. A must get."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I bought two other books by this author (Sign of the Seahorse and the Worst Band in the Universe) for my two year olds library even though she is too young for them. I thought that I would have to wait until she was older to share this amazing author/artist with her. That is why I was particularly pleased to find this book. It is perfect for her. She just learned to count to ten and she enjoys counting all of the animals in this simple to follow story. The illustrations are breathtaking. In addition to teaching counting there is an environmental lesson learned as the animals drink all of the water up and the rain replaces it. I can't wait to pair this book with the see and say geography toy my daughter is getting for Christmas. I am going to show her the animals in the book and then demonstrate where they are found on the sea and say. I think it will make for an excellent geography lesson. This is a beautiful book, you will not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I just added this to our collection of Graeme Base Books. We now have three. Anamalia helps teach the ABC's in a fun way -- The Water Hole teaches counting -- and The Eleventh Hour is a thinking book (try to solve the mystery!) All of his books are wonderfully illustrated. All of them have an underlying puzzle/theme to keep the children's interest. My 3 1/2 year old grandson is crazy about the Water Hole. Actually, all three of them are on the top of his list. He can look at the pages for a long time. That is something amazing since he is hyperactive and sitting doesn't happen for long. He's learning and can find many different things on each page. Since my children were young, these books have been cherished."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"MY SON LOVES THIS BOOK. HE RECEIVED IT AS A GIFT WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT. NOW HE'S THREE YEARS OLD WE READ IT TOGETHER AND LOVE TO PICK OUT ALL THE OTHER ANIMALS HIDING IN THE PICTURES. IT'S ONE OF OUR FAVORITES."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"As an Elementary School Teacher, I LOVE anything written by Graeme Base, and this book is no exception. The pictures are wonderful and keep students' attention."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Graeme's books are all written in poem form and he's just awesome. Whether you are 10 or 100, you will enjoy all of his books. I've read every one of his books and am always in awe with how he comes up with such art and vocabulary!!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"In my review of \\"Animalia\\", I noted that I'm not keen on ABC books. I'm also not keen on counting books. Like ABC books, they are necessary for youngsters to develope their skills, but they tend to be inordinately boring for the grown-ups who have to read the darn things to them.Except this book, that is. Only Graeme Base could pull off a counting book like this. Each of the first ten full pages of this book depicts a growing number of animals drinking at an ever-shrinking water hole (visually accomplished through the use of ever decreasing concentric ovals cut into the pages. Finally, ten kangaroos are standing around looking at a dried up water hole. All the animals go away. And then it rains again and the animals come back.The original idea for the book was inspired by Base's travels in Africa, but he realized that the concept of the life cycle of the water hole is more universal, so his pictures capture wildlife scenes from all over the globe - six of the seven continents as well as a general \\"rivers and streams\\" picture. The format is ideal for teaching not only counting, but also ecology and the life cycle.And, in true Graeme Base style, there's always the hidden pictures, which is perhaps what I love most about his work. Most of the pictures contain animals depicted in the borders of the picture that are hidden within the picture itself. So in addition to the animals named in each picture, kids (and adults) will have hours of fun finding the hidden animals. The hidden pictures blend so seamlessly into the picture itself that it can be hard to distinguish them, but once you see them, they are unmistakable. The hidden animals also give the book a balance, as the first picture shows ten visible frogs, and in the last picture those ten frogs are hidden. Graeme Base's artwork is a revelation to behold and well worth the price of the book alone.Like most of Graeme Base's work, I highly recommend this book for both kids and their parents."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"We were given our first copy of this book by a neighbor. When I asked my 5 year old son what his favorite book was so we could purchase it from Amazon to give to his cousin, he selected this book. It has beautiful pictures. You have to look close at each page to find hidden animals in the wood and water. My kids ages 4, 5, and 8 love to look at the pages to see what they will find.I read other reviews of books that did not have the photos, this one does.The story is a good one to teach conservation and the end of the book details a little on the origin of the animals and habitats on each page."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"All of Graeme Base's books are absolutely stunning from the story to the illustrations. The story is wonderful and only exceeded by the gorgeous illustrations. This book can be read cover to cover but then it is also fun to go back and solve on the hidden puzzles."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Originally we bought this book because on first glance, the illustrations were amazingly vivid. Later we were thrilled to discover that there were very cleverly hidden pictures in each page of animals from around the world, with a built in theme of water=life.If you only read the book, it only takes about 5 minutes, and that includes taking the time to count the animals. However, if you spend the time to find each of the animals listed across the top and bottom of each page, then expect to spend about 15 minutes on ONE illustration alone!This book has outlasted every other book we have picked for our kids, bar none. So good, in fact, that I will NOT pass it along to relatives, because it will be saved for my children's children. I will simply have to buy more copies to share!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I ordered 2 copies of Graeme Base's \\"The Water Hole\\" and received them in perfect condition. Packaging was excellent. The books are wonderful and very entertaining for my grand-daughters!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I purchased this beautiful book for the grandson of a friend. He's a cool little guy. When he saw the book, he started giggling and smiling so wide I thought his face would break. This is a gorgeous book to be enjoyed over and over."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This is one awesome book. Buy it and read it to your kids. They'll love it. It kept the school kids engrossed from start to finish.Wow GREAT book"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Just awesome! The illustrations are so amazing that every time my husband and I read the book to our children we find something new to look at. And what a neat way to tell a story about conservation. AWESOME!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"The artwork and intrigue of \\"Animalia\\" and \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" is at least equalled if not surpassed in this splendid book. Base provides families and readers of all ages with a magnificent work: an ecological view of geography; an early science primer; a counting book (coming close to \\"One Dragon's Dream\\" by Peter Pavey); exercises for left and right brain... Very definitely I add this to my wishlist: One Thousand Books I Would Give To Any Child. It transcends political correctness or cultural miopia. It invites readers of all genders, creeds, and races to engage in an exploration of physical and temporal plains. Some books should never go out of print and Base's family, for seven generations (at least!) should benefit from the royalties of a remarkable treasure. I can only effuse and if I must criticise it is that I would like further notes in fine print at the rear so that I can pronounce \\"Prezwalski Horse\\" and \\"Quagga\\" correctly and to have some assistance in recalling \\"Mt. Rushmore\\" but the absence of such notes in no way impends a pleasurable reading. We've had the book in our possession for less than 24 hours and eleven children aged 2 to 13 have clamoured for \\"another go\\", reading as individuals and groups, and demanding more conversations inspired by the rich illustrations. Graeme, if you're out there, please come to our place for dinner."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"The illustrations are so vivid and gorgeous in this book. Having such high expectations of Graeme Base (I'm a big fan of his work) I was a little bit disappointed with the actual content of the book. There really isn't much of a story told here, and no fabulously rythmic poetry as in a couple of his others. There are as always, hidden details that you will have to look at the book several times to find. Hidden animals in the pictures, and the illustrations around the edge of the borders, etc. Plus just the attention to detail that is his trademark. It looks great, but not much content. (Yes I realize it's supposed to be a children's book, but I have been entertained by almost all his other ones). Not one of my favorites... but pretty."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Fantastic way to teach about geography, wild animals, habitats, migration. The illusrations hidden within pictures are beautiful. Just love this book!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"We used this book to assist in earning a silver star in cub scouts. It did help a whole lot."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"What an incredible visual journey -- you can spend many many minutes on each page. Hidden animals and much to explore! On the surface this is a simple book, but it's anything but!

Highly recommend this for any age."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"After receiving it as a gift, this quickly became my one year old's favourite book. At almost three, he still loves it. I think his favourite parts are making the animal sounds and counting backwards (don't ask me why) while pointing to the numbers in the back of the book."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"My son is just 18 months old. He recieved this book as a gift when he was born. He now loves it and we must read it every night. He doesn't care much about counting yet and I've yet to find all the animals in the pictures but he loves the bright pictures, the story, and most of the all the tigers. We love it so much I bought others by this author-all equally as good. My 12 year old nephew who is an excellent reader even enjoys some of this authors books. A must have for any young reader or older reader too!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Our 2.5 year old son has loved this beautifully illustrated book for about a year. He learned to look for animals in nature with this book because there are \\"hidden\\" illustrations embedded in some of the images and once he found these (more quickly than mom) he never looked at a forest in the same way. Max originally discovered the book at our library in California and when we moved we missed it but our library in Texas just bought the book over the holidays and we were thrilled to see it again. We will purchase it now to have and treasure and to keep working on those numbers!!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The illustrations were just gorgeous. Detail is everywhere and I loved the way the author hid the animals in every background. This book was very unique and enjoyable!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This is the most beautifully illistrated and interesting numbers book available! All of Grame's books are the best. Don't miss Animailia for the alphabet."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"My two year old son LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this beautiful book. Although he is very \\"academic,\\" and letters and numbers are his favorites, I think any child would enjoy this book. There are sooooo many things to learn - not just counting to ten, but all about different and unique animals and their habitats. My child has the book absolutely memorized, including the dedication \\"For Bob,\\" as I discovered when listening to him on the monitor read the book cover to cover during naptime. In fact, that is why we are ordering another . . . ours has had a very hard life from overuse!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I am a great fan of Graeme Base and have all of his books and have bought many more as presents for friends. The Watering Hole is a great story for kids to learn about animals - maybe strange animals that aren't in their country! Learn their sounds. I read it with my friends kids and we tried to imagine what the different animal sounds were in different lanaguages. You can always find a new way to enjoy the book. It also has an environmental theme, which many kids understand and like to talk about. A MUST buy!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"In short, _The_Water_Hole_ is a must-have for your library!We originally purchased the book because it was the latest Graeme Base book. Our three-year old autstic son, however, has proclaimed this book to be \\"his.\\" From it, we heard him speak some of his first words. We also discovered that he knew how to count to ten.The book is incredibly rich in detail and is engaging for pre-readers as a counting book. It remains engaging for early readers in the simplicity of the language. It continues to engage more advanced readers in the amazing detail of the drawings, and the challenge to \\"find the hidden animals.\\" _The_Water_Hole_ is politically correct and environmentally friendly without bashing the reader over the head with its message."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This is one of the most beautifully illustrated books I have ever seen. It is a simple story that talks about animals from all over the world. We received this as a gift from Australia 2 years ago for my sons third birthday and it still remains one of his favorites. Don't pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I was wowed by the cover art on this one and bought it for my young daughter not knowing that it's less a cute look at the common feeding habits of different creatures than an odd vehicle for ecological preservation. The message seems to be that if too many species drink the water, the water will go away and everyone will die. That's okay, of course, because in the end--everyone miraculously comes back!I'm a little bothered by the implication that simply *drinking* the water will dry up the planet, but I'm really peaved at the promotion of the notion that death is somehow an impermanant or fixable condition.Still, the paintings are great!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I am a second grade teacher with a class that loses its ability to focus each day after lunch and unfortunately this is the only time that I can fit in Math and Science. One day we were learning about habitats and how animals have to adapt in order to survive if something changes in their habitat. Well by minute 20 of the lesson my children could no longer sit still and I wasn't quite sure that some of them were \\"getting it\\". So I brought out \\"The Water Hole\\". All of my children sat on the floor in front of me while I showed them the cover of the book and discussed the author. (By the way, my students now think that Australia is the coolest place in the world because of Graeme Base)Anyway - when I began to read the first page of this book, my students were unable to keep their mouths closed. And for a change - there weren't any sounds coming out. My children were AMAZED. The illustrations are so brilliant and detailed. The only time my students said anything through the entire story was when they wanted me to wait and let them look at the pictures more. Luckily I have two copies of this book! :-)I'm not going to spoil the end of the book, but I'll just say that the students finally understood the concept of animals needing to adapt or move when their habitats change. For two weeks my students would read this book. Everytime they'd look for more and more secrets. \\"The Water Hole\\" is a fabulous book that EVERY teacher needs in her library."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"In Oliver's words... (age 5, England)I like this book because there are numbers as well as words to read and not too many reading words on each page so I get to see all the pictures quickly.I enjoy looking for the animals hidden in each picture. Some of them are really hard to see but Mummy helps me. It's great to see the hole of water getting smaller because I know the huge raindrop will soon come.It's funny to hear Mummy and Daddy make the noises that the animals make and I like doing that as well. The moose are funny when they put their hooves in each others ears--how CAN they do that???I LOVE the big raindrop and when it rains a lot because this means theanimals can come back.The last page is the best because I can see all the animals on there that I love so much.Armchair Interviews says: Obviously a book loved by a child! A good sign."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This is one of my 3.5 yo's favorite books. It is one of the most beautifully illustrated books that I have ever seen. I can't get over how gorgeous it is. It needs to be read many many times to soak up all there is to see 1) counting book 2)Counting backwards book (the frogs go from ten to one as the story goes on 3) A Geography book 4) an \\"I spy\\" book for all the hidden animals 5) An animal habitat book 6) humor book with the \\"translated\\" sayings and the silly frogs. 7) a science book on the importance of rain to the environment So bam - you have reading/literature, math, geography, visual discrimination, science (biology and geology), and art too all in one gorgeous package. This is my first encounter with this writer/illustrator but I am definitely going to search out other books."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"What a wonderful work this is! It is one of the more unique counting books to come out over the past twenty years; certainly one of the best illustrated and if the schools in which I work are any indication, one of the most popular and most used.But this is so much more than just a counting book. I personally feel that this is Graeme Base's best work by far, and he has turned out some great ones. The author takes the concept of a water hole and tracks in natural ebb and flow throughout the seasons. It starts full and as the season progress it becomes smaller and smaller and all of the wildlife which use it disappear. Of course in the natural flow of things, the rains do return and all is well again.What Base has done though is take this one water hole and with the turning of each page; with the increasing of the numbers from one to ten, he switches countries and indeed, entire ecosystems.The book progresses from Africa to India, South American, Himalayas, North American, Rivers and Streams, China, Europe, Galapagos Islands and finally Australia. This may sound strange but trust me...it works.The illustrations are extremely detailed and the young reader can spend literally hours (and believe me, many of them do) searching each picture for more animals, plants and strange little details (As an example...in the plate featuring India, the two tigers are drinking but if the reader looks closely they will see two beautifully painted frogs with strings of pearls around their neck. This is a nice bit of fantasy thrown in that the kids love).The wildlife featured is done in very vivid and natural tones and extremely accurate, but as I said, the author has thrown in a bit of whimsy here and there to make it even more interesting. As with most of Base's work there is a strong ecological message here and this book goes quite well with a class studying such matters.The text is quite simple and reflects perfectly what is going on in the illustrations.This is most certainly one you want on your child's reading shelf.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"What a wonderful children's book this creation by Graeme Base is! The author has been able, trough word and art; really inseparable in this case, to offer so many learning tools, such good lessons, and such visual delights. All is stunning here.\\"Down to the secret water hole the animals all come.As seasons bring fourth drought and flood, they gather there as one.United in their common need, their numbers swell to ten -But hidden deep among the trees lie ten times that again!\\"To start with, this is a counting book which goes to the number 10. This is merely a vehicle to hang a much more important message or messages on. First, each page has a circular ring cut into it in the middle of the water hole. As the reader turns the pages, the ring gets smaller and smaller, reflecting the natural cycle of any non-spring fed pond. This is a rather unique and effective visual effect which enhances the work greatly as the child can actually physically see the results the seasons have upon this small water source.With the turning of each page the author has taken us around the world; different ecological environments are represented on each plate; Africa, India, South America, Himalayas, North America, Rivers and Streams, China, Europe, Galapagos Islands and Australia...they are all skillfully blending together. Each area blends into the next as the pages turn. The author has used the wildlife, plant life and terrain of each of these areas and well represented their physical surroundings and each one blends with the next almost as if my magic...different geographical areas, different animals...same pond.As the seasons progress the water hole or pond becomes smaller and smaller until the pond is empty. The animals all go away, the plant life dies back and there is nothing but barren waste...how depressing! But wait! A single drop of rain falls, then more drops fall, the rains come! As if my magic the forest, desert, plains renew themselves, the plants return, the animals return...and the cycle begins again.It should be noted that this is an extremely accurate description of how it really is. I have been watching, quite closely I may say, such a pond deep in the woods behind our home for around 25 years now, and each year I watch this phenomenal example of nature at work. Even the small catfish and frogs that happen to make this place their homes return after the water returns...seemingly a resurrection, miracle if you will.The art work in this book is absolutely stunning in its color and detail. A child, indeed an adult, can be lost for hours examining each picture as the pages are turned. While each animal and plant are very accurately depicted, the author has thrown in a bit of whimsy here and there such as placing a hat, vest or robe of a hidden frog here and there. Sounds strange, I know, but it works in this case...trust me!People Magazine, a publication that I truly detest, got it right for once when they stated that Base's art as the elements of \\"the eye of a Renaissance painter and the ear of Dr. Seuss,\\" when they described this author's work.This entire work is a class act and you should give your child, and yourself, a treat and read this one together.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"One of my favorite children's book, \\"The Water Hole\\" is loaded with goodies of all sorts. Masterfully painted animals and creatures of all sorts from around the globe. As an artist I am truly inspired by the gifts and talents that Graeme Base so seemingly effortlessly portrays in his works of art. This book is truly clever and is garanteed to capture the attention of any child or adult for that matter.I was first introduced to Graeme's work in about 2003 at the San Diego Zoo, I could not put the book down. Amazed and wishing I had his skills. I can't imagine the time it takes for just one single page, the patience, the energy and the creativity. The book is chock full of stunning and clever imagery, not to mention one can learn and count from this book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This beautiful counting book is wonderfully illustrated and ingeniously thought out. The book works on many different levels (hidden animals, a range of themes) and has provided hours of fun and discussion for our two year old."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I loved it! The art is spectacular and even adults will enjoy finding the hidden animals. Good for many age levels BUT I bought one for my grandaughter, but gave it to a good friend. When I went to buy another one, it had no hole in the pages! It is still a beautiful book but for younger readers, I would recomend the book with the actual hole in the pages."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This book is just wonderful, not only for children - my 3,5-years-old son just loves it - but also for grown-ups. The drawings are excellent, a fine mixture of realistic and cartoon with lots of subtle information in the frames. The texts are funny. The message is gripping: without water (we) all will go away.From this book one can learn about the animals, the various continents and environments they live in, numbers one till ten. It is an experience for father and son to learn about the marvel of the waterhole."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I love this book. The illustrations are magnificent. My children and I have spent much time finding the animals hidden in the pictures. This book also provides a nice discussion point for the importance of water to sustain life. The reviewer that found this book simple is simply missing the mark! The text is simple but the illustrations provide so much information about significant changes to the environment. For example, in the early pages, there is an abundance of frogs. By the last pages, the frogs are gone.Three years ago my husband and I had a pond dug on our farm. We did this to create a better habitat for animals. Reading this book and discussing the changes around our pond over the last three years, have helped my daughter to understand the significance of water for all forms of life. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"The artwork is beautiful. My daughter really enjoys Graeme Base books.

He is a great author and illustrator - we have other books by him."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"This is such a great book, teaching about numbers and exposing you to all wildlife. The illustrations are phenomenal. There is very little text, but as you seek and find and look for the hidden animals, it becomes quite challenging. My boys started reading this book in kindergarten and they still enjoy reading it today in 2nd and 3rd grade. I actually look forward to reading it with them together also."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"The Water Hole is an amazing book. The illustrations are pieces of art and the message is one of great importance. If you love wildlife and animals, this is a book for you. My daughters love looking for the hidden animals in each picture. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughters, but I think I purchased it more for myself."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Another beautiful and entertaining book by Graeme Base! I enjoyed every page and bought more to share with my favorite young readers."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"enjoyed by children learning to count and by kids that love to find the hidden animals. What I like is how my 3 and 7 year olds both love it and I can make story time long or short depending on if I just read it or if we search out all the animals. also has a great message."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a really great book. This book was just not what I expected. Illustrations were great and words in this book were minimal - very appropriate for preschool kids. I had intended this for my school-age kids and it was too simplistic for them. Also, this book make it sound like the earth will restore itself on its own (raining solving drought problem) when in fact, the earth needs our help to restore it by not wrecking havoc Mother Nature."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"I give this book to children all the time and the joy is given ten fold back"},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"The person who received this book used it to promote water savings tips to her elementary school students who greatly enjoyed finding the hidden surprises in the beautiful illustrations."},{"Title":"The Water Hole","review":"Beautiful pictures, educational short story that babies remember and enjoy hearing over and over again."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I have found this book to be very helpful.

Photography skills are only part of what you need. This book describes the other part."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I gave this book two stars because some reader might want to open a studio for children's photography. Anyone else looking to get into the photography business or improve photography business skills should probably look elsewhere.The author's approach is to offer a topic related to the business of photography and to raise issues, but she seldom provides answers, and when she does, they are seldom of use to most photographers. For example, the author has a chapter on lawyers. In it she indicates the legal problems that a photographer might face, from copyright to leases. Instead of telling the reader anything about these subjects, she says to hire a good lawyer. As my kids say, duhh...! Similarly she says there are several different forms of ownership that a photographer can use. Therefore... consult a lawyer.And when she does give advice, it is often wrong and dangerous. For example, she says that in determining whether a person is a contractor or an employee, one should look at whether a person does the same job for several different people. Actually, the government regulations provide 14 separate points that have to be considered with no one-point controlling. Several judicial nominees have learned how important this issue can be.But where the author really misses the boat is on the issue of marketing. For any businessperson, including a photographer, marketing is perhaps the most important function. If you don't have income, you don't stay in business. But the tips the author gives only apply to studio photographers. Marketing is different for a stock photographer and an editorial photographer, and for all the specialties in between, but Orenstein seems to ignore this.I don't understand why this book needed photographs, unless it was to meet the requirement for 320 pages. But if one is going to include pictures in a book aimed at photographers, they'd better be good. The pictures in this book are muddy black and white pictures on paper with a low reproduction quality.Perhaps it's impossible to write a book about the photography business that applies to all the specialties in the game. I know that it is possible to write a useful book aimed at a specialist, because I have the example of John Shaw's \\"Business of Nature Photography\\". Even though a little dated, it is probably more helpful generally to someone getting into the photography business than Orenstein's book is."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I'm going to have to concur with the comments of Conrad. I think the author did a great disservice to her audience by giving such a marginal advice as to how to start and run a photo business. Further, time and again she is simply stating the obvious (i.e. if you don't know how to file your taxes, hire an accountant).What really threw me off, though, is that she seems to be giving advice as to how to start a business under the assumption that the person has unlimited resources at his or her disposal. This is her approach (hyper-abridged): Buy all the equipment/rent studio space, hire a CPA, hire a lawyer, promote yourself, mass advertising, get line of credit, expand.The author's overly simplistic model seems to be out of touch with the realities facing most, if not all, start-up businesses which is funding, funding, funding, funding and more funding. No matter how good a plan or how good idea you might have without proper funding you won't make it--period! Furthermore, it's unbelievably hard to get decently-priced business loans for a start-up (assuming you can get one at all).This book simply put is mediocre and needs work. I gave three stars because I thought some of the advice she gives is definitely good advice; that said, I don't think this primer in and of itself is very good for photo start-ups or people considering becoming one."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"This is an excelent book if you are thinking about OPENING A PHOTO STUDIO. Person that wrote the review before mine obviously missed the point of this book and expected something more for less than $20.So, this book gives a lot more than these kind of books usually do, particularly in the essence of the studio photography business. In addition, it is written very nicely with real life ups and downs of the business.List of just a few out of many things I have found useful:1. Interviews with other professional photographers in different fields and from different backgrounds. Many examples on how to get into the business.2. A whole chapter on business plan - covers the core of figuring out what your business is going to be about (target, competition, pricing, cost, your name, etc.) It also includes copyright issues.3. Venue ideas - home, studio, sharing space, partnering, franchise...4. Startup marketing techniques and ideas through author's own experience: message, goals, target market, direct mail, websites,auctions, mall kiosks, client gifts, etc...5. In terms of different business entites, she explained the basics on partnership and corporation. Since she is a photographer and not a business advisor, she suggested to consult a professional advisor/attorney/accountant.There are many more things that I could write about this book. Since I don't have time, my suggestion: Buy the book. And don't expect miracules. The author obviously dedicated this book to studio photographers, so DON'T EXPECT to see marketing for stock or editorial photographers. Although, if you are smart enough you will be able to relate to the problems and ideas author is talking about. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"This book took a long time to read, since it was exceptionally boring. Not to mention the constant typos and spelling errors all over the place (was this book even proof-read before press?? Sheesh! I eventually lost count.). The book doesn't really tell you how to start a business. All it really is a book full of the author's own photos along with countless interviews with other established photogs (mostly if not all Minneapolis-based) and some of their own photos. I read it all the way thru, hoping to find some insight on how to start my own business, but it never came. Just general things about the business itself and how people got in the photog business, and the authors own stories about hers. It seems to be more geared toward owning a studio since the author has 2 studios herself."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I'm in the process of starting my own business but I didn't know where to start. This book has given me direction. I recommend it to anyone starting a photography business that simply needs to know \\"How do I do this?\\" The interviews are great because you see how others started but also how opinions differ between photographers/business owners."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"Apparently, and according to this author, the only business you should open as a photographer is a studio. Everything else is pointless.That being the case, she should have made that clear in the title.The money I spent on this book was absolutely wasted, and I won't buy anything else without reading the reviews first.Totally useless."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"While the subjects covered in this book aren't exhaustive by any means, I was more bothered by the lack of proper editing. Blatant misspellings (\\"fiftenn-plus years in the business\\"), missing quotation marks, incorrect punctuation, and bad grammar make this book difficult to take seriously.Subject-wise, the author just doesn't go into enough detail to make this book worth reading. She brings up important subjects, but doesn't explain or define the terms. For example, in chapter nine, the author discusses protecting copyrights. She advises not to \\"give away the intellectual property farm,\\" but doesn't explain how photographers are giving away their copyrights. Perhaps she assumed that a photographer would already know what he or she needed to know about copyrights before reading this book. She would be wrong. After reading a chapter, I have to resort to looking up information online to fill in the gaps.I don't recommend this book. Please don't use it for a class. It was a waste of my money."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"Great book to inspire that inner business in yourself! Most of the book is first hand stories about how to start a photography business by photographers around the U.S. Great read and really motivates you while also teaching you from those who have had the previous \\"uh oh\\" experiences!"},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I admit my first impressions of this book were not all that great. However, the author has a great conversational tone that leads well into teaching and making the reader think and absorb the ideas.This is probably one of the essential books for anyone getting into, or considering, photography as a business. The chapters cover almost all possible aspects of starting a business and cover them well, if not in deep detail. There are specialty books out there for marketing help, pricing, legal issues, etc.Some of the key winning points on this book are that the author focuses in very well on what really IS important when starting up a new business. She lays out the important aspects that need to catch the mind of a new business person and make sure you focus in on these.Excellent starting point for anyone considering going 'pro' or who has realized that their hobby is hitting official business levels."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"As a professional photographer I found this book to be very useful in the early stages of starting my business. After spending much time doing all the things I thought I should be doing (and not getting very far!), I read this book and realized that being a professional photographer was going to mean much more than just being good at photography.Like many businesses, professional photography requires skills in marketing, selling, advertising and dealing with people. This book introduces all these concepts and more, together with a lot of interesting case-studies of people who have switched to photography from other careers, and how they met the challenges of doing that.Professional photography can be very rewarding and is an excellent business to be in - but make sure you get off on the right footing by realizing that 90% of it is knowing how to run a business. This book is an excellent way to start."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"Conrad's comments are completely re-inforced by my experience with this book. Oh with the addition of the fact that there are numerous spelling errors throughout."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I am returning to the market after several years in the motion picture industry and was looking for a refresher on the business end of photography.Vik Orenstein has provided a wonderful primer for both beginner and professional alike, and I unreservedly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about pursuing a career in photography.She thoroughly covers necesary subjects such as choosing CPAs and lawyers, networking, and the various photographic markets available for pursuit. She does all of this in a winsome way, relating both her successes and failures as she developed and grew her own studios.If you are considering entering the field of photography as a professional, seriously consider purchasing this book. You will be making a very wise investment!"},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I happen to be the business mind in our studio, but knew little about photography when I started. This book had many little tidbits which helped me. It would really be helpful to photographers who are not business minded and want to know how to make a great start to making their photography a full-blown business. If you have a business degree and are looking to get into photography this is NOT the book for you.

I refer to it frequently! I love Vik's writing style. Her personality comes out in the book."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"I have to agree, only partly, with some of the previous reviews that say the author is stating the obvious. It may be obvious to a seasoned, professional photographer who has been in business for years - but to someone just starting out, it's valuable information. She uses stories about mistakes she has made, learning the hard way, and gives advice on how to avoid making those same mistakes (e.g. the \\"use tax\\" flub and the tax penalties she paid for her ignorance). As she says, good photographers are not necessarily good business people. I think this book does a good job of giving prospective photography business owners a real, down-to-earth, inside look inside the life of a photographer who is in business for himself/herself. Her writing style is very enjoyable to read, too."},{"Title":"Photographer's Market Guide to Building Your Photography Business","review":"Not Everything you need to know to start a business but a LOT of what you need to know.

She is just beginning to read and she is able to read most of these devotions herself. The devotions are very practical and easy for children to understand. My two year old also enjoys the book."},{"Title":"Growing With Jesus:100 Daily Devotionals","review":"I've only gotten through the first 30 days of this book with my 4 year old and based on that, would recommend this book.Each day starts with a bible verse and then goes on with a simple, short section about what the verse is about and what it is trying to teach you. Often times, the author does this by giving an example that a young child could understand. Example: &quot;How do you feel when you see someone getting something you'd like to have? Does it bother you inside, or are you truly happy for them?&quot; The author then continues about how jealousy hurts you (the jealous one) and suggest the child imagine what it would feel like if it were he/she receiving the present and then to switch that excitement over to them. It then directs the child on what to do today to apply the lesson just learned. Each day ends with a section called &quot;My Amazing World&quot; which gives interesting facts or piece of history but it doesn't always relate to the lesson of the day.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that there are some things that my 4 year old has not experienced and therefore cannot relate to. The days that discussed peer preasure and dirty words are two examples. I still find it a valuable tool in teaching my child god's lessons and use each day's devotional as a spring board to discuss how god wants us to live our lives."},{"Title":"Growing With Jesus:100 Daily Devotionals","review":"As a full time children and family evangelist I fully recommend this devotional.

Even Mom and Dad love this book, and we never fail toALL get something out of the devotional and scripture each night. The book has 100 devotionals which consist of a bible verse, thoughts to grow on (where the author expounds on the verse in a wonderful way that children can relate to based on things in their own day to day lives), a thought/challenge for the day, andmy amazing world - an interesting fact about many things from our bodies to the world around us. One of my favorites of the devotionals is when the author, Andy Holmes, elaborates on the bible verse \\"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.\\" Matthew 5:6. Holmes talks about hearing your tummy growl and how that was your body's way of saying it needed food, and also being very thirsty. He relates that to God wanting you to be hungry for him and thirsty for him, and how God is food for your spirit and living water for your soul. He ends with a prayer to say aloud: \\"Dear God, Teach me to be hungry for you. Teach me to be thirsty for your Word. Thank you, Lord. Amen\\" Imagine my overflowing heart, when after reading that my daughter prayed that, and continues praying that some 2 months later, and 3 weeks ago asked Jesus into her heart. God works through many ways to speak to us (and our children), through His word and through wonderful Godly teaching of His word. Thank you, Mr. Holmes for writing this book for children, and being usable by the Father to help parents teach children God's word and Godliness in our childrens' lives.

The trading chapter could have been a little more with a comparison of major on-line brokerages. One thing which I did not find mentioned in the many books I have read so far and found out the hard way is that some brokerages place a bid related cap on buy stops and sell stops, i.e. if the current bid price is $25 your sell stop can be no higher than $24.25. This can be a real turn off. Additionally, it would also save the readers a lot of aggravation if books like Harry's could say something about the less than fantastic load times of some of these sites.

The chapters can and do stand alone, so this book can easily be used as a reference by many different practitioners. As an editor Moberg does a good job making sure that each chapter is written coherently and the material has an internal integrity. As a pastor, I found the scholarship to be of high caliber and those scholars who quoted scripture did so with a level of knowledge that provided fuel to the discussion and maintained the integrity of the scriptural context.The Editor in Chief of Haworth Pastoral Press states in the Foreword that the text is written from an interfaith perspective. On one level this is true but on another level this statement is a gross understatement. The reason that this may be a gross understatement is twofold. 1) there is a very limited amount of work in the field of aging and spirituality that is not done from a Christian or Judeo-Christian perspective and 2) interfaith is more than just the mere mention of another religious tradition different than the dominant tradition of the author. Interfaith work is new in and of itself in the ecumenical movement so the addition of an interfaith perspective to an emerging field is not to be expected and is not present at the level that the series editor implies. There are some chapters and elements in this book that touch on interfaith issues, but not at the depth to call itself an interfaith text.This book provided this student with a good window into the research that has been conducted in the area of spirituality and aging. I found it especially helpful that this book was not exclusively focused on health care, which is where most of the work in the area of spirituality and aging has been conducted. The greatest contribution that this book makes to the field of gerontology is the breadth and depth of the material presented that should encourage and foster future inquiry. The stand alone chapters can be used by individual practitioners and taken together the book summarizes what has been done and points future scholars to what needs to be done in the future. It cannot be noted strongly enough that this book combines theory, research, practice issues, and even policy history and recommendations. This book offers professionals in aging a little bit of everything with regards to aging and spirituality and is a good basic resource for this reason. If think this book is an excellent primer or baseline text on the topic of Aging and Spirituality and plan to recommend it to others.A common theme throughout the books is the importance of spiritual well-being and the complexities involved with defining that, researching it, and providing good spiritual care to elders. The editor and authors of each chapter present their findings in easily accessible ways and provide the reader with places to go for more information. In this manner this book is an excellent research tool for those interested in the topic of spirituality and aging.I would recommend this book to anyone, pastor, social worker, physician, nurse, or scholar, who is looking for a detailed overview on the research that has been conducted in the field of aging."},{"Title":"Aging and Spirituality: Spiritual Dimensions of Aging Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy","review":"Excelent for the investigation and understanding of the subject matter from the standpoint of the spiritual-religious realm as well as from the the scientific research.

The author, for example, actually includes a home-brew windowing system. you can tell that this guy loves to do what he does, and he likes to think about *every* part of the system, from the O/S, to the user interface, to the software design.I went to the Win32 section, since I wanted to use the windows communications API. I was able to write my application in less than 7 days!, so its better than a &quot;in 21 days book!&quot; however, i have been using Win32 for quite some time.i also got, and will probably return, Serial Port Complete because I have Parallel Port Complete (a gem) and the content seems to overlap.the Serial Communications Developer's Guide, IMO, will awe you with both minute technical detail as well as a good dose of pratical system level insights!"},{"Title":"Serial Communications Developer's Guide - Second Edition","review":"Although the book requires a lot of reading, it describes the use of the CD's source code in great detail.

I have built many products missiles and medical devices with this form of communication. This book still answered many questions that remained from my former work.

It allowed me to rapidly prepare a new software application for use in manufacturing testing.A number of the machines I've developed have a number firmware boards connected to a central computer both by serial and USB ports. This book gives me the information to help design efficient and reliable communication interfaces to these devices. I am a better software developer by having this book available on my shelves. I only wish that I had found this book fifteen years ago.Although the first part of the book is dated by its focus on early MS DOS communication drivers, the remainder of the book is quite valuable.

It even provides you with a complete library so that you can write the serial communication programming in half an hour.The bad part is that I found later that Microsoft had included a MSComm control with VB and VC and it makes the library provided by this book useless. I used the library to write my project and it worked. Then I tried MSComm control and found that MSComm control was better than the library provided by this book. MSComm class gives you more control and it's much easier to use. eg: you don't have to worry about the multithreading because MSComm control has done that for you.So, IMHO, if you are a VC or VB programer and you only want to write some simple Win32 serial port program, you'd better use MSComm control instead of turning to this book."},{"Title":"Serial Communications Developer's Guide - Second Edition","review":"Estoy desarrollando un sistema de corte de planchas de acero controlado por computadora y necesito comunicar el PC con los controladores de los servomotores.

Shipment was quick and arrived promptly. Good communication and I would highly recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"I have to admit that when I started out reading this book, it was terribly confusing. The first five chapters take place in the future, then the story backtracks to explain the events that took place before. After a while, though, it became apparent that this unconventional ordering only made the story even more enchanting.Being a Texan myself, I found the setting and social customs described in the book very accurate. Leslie was a mesmerizing main character, possessing wisdom beyond her years that outshone all of the other characters' intelligence combined. Parts of the book weren't very characteristic of her--Leslie does eventually end up settling down a bit and loses a lot of her initial independence and do-good attitude that made her so attractive in the first place. Also, there are many aspects of the story that weren't very realistic at all--Jett Rink's obsessive, yet weakly explained, infatuation with Leslie, for example.But overall, this is a wonderfully-written book with very memorable characters, is a realistic love story, and is a dazzling slice of Texas history that you likely won't be able to put down until you've reached the end."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"To be honest, I'm one of the guys, who watches a movie and reads the novel it is based on afterwards. In the case of \\"Giant\\" this turned out to be a terrible mistake. I was more than happy, when I finally reached the book's end. But the fact, that George Steven's screen adaptation is that big, should not take you away from reading this novel.Ferber painstickingly tells the story of Texas, from its very beginnings to the oil boom. Altogether, the book spans about three decades,from the years after WW1 to the industrial boom of the 1950's, but several interludes give you an insight about the history of the state. I personally think, that you have to read this book to understand single details in the movie and get closer impressions about the characters. While watching the movie, one always wonders, why Uncle Bawley is so much different than the other Benedicts. The novel will answer you this one and many other questions.In fact, one can only be surprised, how true the movie is to the novel. Although some scene settings have been changed to fit with the length of the movie, the film captures almost every single dialogue contained in the book. One can arguably say, that Ferber needs many pages to deal with a single problem (and she has already dealt with this one in other works like \\"Show Boat\\"), racism, but hey, it has taken a long time and it will take some time until this problem is finally solved.The novel (and the film) do not always portray a sunny side of the Texian population of that period, but somehow the whole story got a landmark of the state and Dimtri Tiomkin's music for the movie is a kind of a Texian hymn. In my mind, this is one of the true highlights of 20TH century literature."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"I loved the movie Giant, but was bowled over by the book. Ferber is a first-rate storyteller-- each character is appropriately developed and the language and phrasing are amazing. The landscape imagery is fantastic, but Ferber's genius is in describing--both visually and in the narrative--the delicate social structure that is the underpinning of the entire plot."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"Having enjoyed the Elizabeth Taylor/James Dean/Rock Hudson film, I decided to read a wonderful old first edition of this novel and was thoroughly engrossed from cover to cover. Different in many ways from the motion picture but still a treat for its fans, the book is as much a glimpse into the evolution of 20th century Texas as it is a family soap opera. Strangely, it is even more of a love story between the Leslie & Jordan Benedict characters, who are its central characters.Definitely a great, timeless read regardless of whether or not you've seen the film."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"Edna Ferber explains Texans to us, and her words ring as true in 2010 as they did in 1952 when she published her book. Having seen the George Stevens' film of the book, I was expecting something even better. I wouldn't say the book is better than the film, but it is a bit different. Ferber's heroine, Leslie Lynnton, is a spirited Southern belle, with some Yankee roots, and an indulgent father, who fascinates Bick Benedict, owner of La Reata, a million acre plus cattle ranch. He meets her, sweeps her off her feet and takes her to this other-world, namely rural Texas. There the wealthy have all had fancy east coast educations (Bick played football for Harvard), but mostly maintain a deceptive, folksy outward presentation to show they are still Texas all the way through.The novel takes place after WWI, at the beginning of the Depression and through to the 1950's. Coming from Virginia, a bilevel society should not have been shocking to Leslie, but she is gobsmacked by the way her husband and white Texans treat the Mexican-Americans who work for them and share the state. The book details her struggle to improve conditions for the Hispanic employees of the ranch, as well as her personal battle to assert herself in an atmosphere charged with testosterone. Texans think that their women come after their cattle and ranches.Ferber's style is a little dated, and her vocabulary sent me to the dictionary a couple of times, but her ability to weave a good yarn is fine, and I was sucked right into the Benedict's world of privilege and squalor. This is a good summer read for the beach, as the story is long and sprawling. You'll be tan before you know it."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"The epic dimensions of the film do seem to dwarf the original text, but it is still a fun and interesting study of a unique place and time in American history, as well as a fast read. Ms. Ferber is a great late discovery for me. She has the ability to take one fully into the world she fashions. A great escape, indeed."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"For today's readers, the gushing language of Edna Ferber's classic, Giant, will read as a bit overblown. Even in the 50s, I don't believe intelligent young women from Virginia would have spoken as Leslie speaks to her husband or his friends and their wives. But for all its flaws, Giant is still a heck of a good story, and if you don't skim some of the wordy stretches, you'll find yourself getting a good lesson in Texas history and culture.Cattle barons, instant oil millionaires, lavish entertaining, family intrigue, the Mexican immigrant situation - it's all here, seen through the eyes of a young and naive bride from the gentile state of Virginia.And it's worth a read. Not great literature, but a great story."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"I love Edna Ferber and I love this books. It's one of my all time favorite novels. Giant is a bit long, and does drag on at times. (The movie is long too- but it's not exactly like the book).The love story of Leslie and Bic is nothing like Gone with the Wind. It's the real struggle of a man and woman born in two different worlds (Virgina and Good ol Texas) and the culture struggle Leslie faces with life on a ranch. Vashti Hake is one of my favorite characters. (There really are women in Texas just like her) Leslie Benedict struggles throughout her marriage in a changing world and trying to keep her love and marriage strong as the horizon of Texas changes from a rancher's paradies to an oil booming feast. Bic struggles as well with the wants of his children, and his desire to have the family ranch, Reata, live on through his son who wants to become a doctor.It's a classic novel that I first read in highschool, and just read again this year. Maybe because I am a Texas girl...I don't know...but I adore this book. When Ferber first penned this novel it was not well received in the Lone Star State because of how she depicts Texans. It's a great cultural read."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"Ferber is a fantastic author, and Giant is one of her best...

And keep in mind that this was written in the 1950's when subjects like how Mexicans were treated in Texas and racial discrimination were taboo topics--- and they are still sore spots to Texans. But \\"Giant\\" takes them on. You would have to say that it was a stepping stone to the Civil Rights Movement in this country. I remember when the book came out and it was announced that a movie was to be made from it. Some Texans said they would shoot the movie screens out. That never happened. But it shows how embarrassed they were to have their dirty little secret exposed to the world."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"As with all great movies that were based on a book, I always ask myself, can the book live up to the movie? Usually, the book easily outshines the flick. This is an exception. No big deal, though, as it still is plenty good.Whereas the movie had a point of view from Jett Rink, this book does not. It's written mainly through the eyes of Leslie, a.k.a. Mrs. Jordan Bemedict and \\"Bick\\" himself, and features the omnipresence of omnipotent Big Texas (or Giant Texas, if you prefer). If I had to summarize it best, I'd call it a satirical, gossipy version of \\"The Good Earth\\" -- Texas style.I think it suffers from too many characters an not enough exposition and it has an ending like \\"The Sopranos.\\" It begins in the present tense until Jett Rink kicks little Jordy Benedict in the groin, daddy Jordan gets out of his chair, then it goes into a giant flashback. The only problem with that is that the reader never finds out what happens after Dr. Jordy is left asking for morphine, clutching his coppers. To be fair, the flashback satisfactorily recounts Leslie's gradual, but incomplete, transformation from a liberal (when it wasn't cool to be a liberal woman) Yankee to a Texan. Also, there's plenty on the history of the Lone Star State and its growth from land, cattle and cotton to oil.I'm not trying to give it short shrift and I'd recommend you buy it. It is a classic -- or at least almost a classic. And it left me wishing I were born in Texas, where everything is giant. But while it has some awesome moments, this novel left me somewhat unfulfilled."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"EDNA FERBER'S powerful, provocative story of the making of modern Texas.GIANT - Best Selling Novel that was made into a major motion picture staring ELIZABETH TAYLOR, ROCK HUDSON and JAMES DEAN!

The film is an epic retelling of this book, and it carried it past 'chick lit' status, to Cecil B. DeMille territory.Frankly, after reading this book I was disappointed, IMHO it lacks the epic scope and the details in the movie.Spoilers ahead:One aggravating thing, is the book just ends. It starts with the scene where Jordan the son of Leslie gets hit by Jett Rink during a fight, and while Leslie nurses him on the floor, she looks up over into the distance and proceeds into a 300 page flashback.The whole book is a flashback. And, unlike the movie, it's interesting but all the fantastic events are dulled and some are missing that in the movie, really gave the characters depth and meaning.Spoiler alert1. For example, the scene in the movie in which Leslie goes to talk to Jett in his house, and it is very apparent he has a crush on her. So much unspoken there, but this is where Jett becomes a sympathetic character.Not much interaction in the book, except he drives her in the car once.2. The death of Luz. In the movie, she took out her hatred of Leslie on the horse by literally beating it to death in her attempt to dominate it. This was very powerful as it showed the depth of her evil, and the horse retaliating and killing her made perfect sense in terms of justice. The book just says she was thrown wearing hoop skirts.3. The part in the film where Leslie leaves Bick and takes the kids back to her home to go to a wedding, and he comes looking for her. She almost feels his presence right behind her and she turns, their eyes drinking in the sight of one another as they listen to the marriage vows in the background and say it to one another in silence. Their love just doesn't come across in the book. Leslie falls a distant second to the ranch, she's like furniture and the script writers for the movie changed this, because frankly it was not realistic and hampered the power of the story. Leslie doesn't seem like a neglected wife in the film, but is literally Bick's lifeline and the true mistress of the house. The movie did a fantastic job of showing the love they had for each other that the book glosses over.4. The growing up of the children, completely passed over, except as flashbacks within the larger flashback. Argh! As is the scene where Jett strikes oil and comes to brag to the others, covered in black gold from head to foot and devilishly triumphant. In the movie, you just knew someone was going to die as the men stared at each other, the dark energy crackled with menace. In the book, Bick and Jett had a small scuffle on the porch and Jett ran off not to be seen until he was old.So much feels missing in this book, I guess it's because I have watched the movie twice and it is one of my favorites of all time. The book feels very thin, just not enough there although one interesting scene was missing from the movie, that is when Jett kidnaps Leslie and her grown daughter Luz when they are out shopping. But, the proposal by Jett to Luz is only briefly mentioned in an offhand way, it lacks the power of the scene in the movie where she sits in an empty restaurant before Jett, picking at the tablecloth while he lets his anguish and longing for Leslie pour out in a proposal of marriage to her beautiful daughter.I feel like the book was poorly edited, and the film makers and script writers took the core and made it an outstanding epic. Having 80 percent of the book as a flashback is just shoddy writing. It could have gone in the right order, and been much more powerful. And at the end, we never find out what happens after Jordan Jr. was punched by Jett and everyone went home. The book just ends. The scene in the restaurant is told as a flashback and it lacks the impact of the final scene in the movie when Bick fights with the owner in defiance of the racism against his own family. In the book he doesn't even find out about the event, the women hide it from him. The book almost needs to be written over again, but the author is long dead. Maybe they could discover her 'papers' in a trunk and have it re written to do the thing justice. If we could have 'Scarlett' as the sequel to Gone with the Wind, they could do this much."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"Ferber tells the story of a rancher, Bick Benedict. He owns a massive, wealthy, family ranch raising cattle in Texas during the early 1900's. During a horse buying trip he meets Leslie, a native Virginian who he eventually marries.Leslie, a smart and book learned woman, is the focal point of the story as she learns to adjust to Texas and its grandness. Ferber goes into detail about life on a ranch and the pride Texans have in their state and culture. Ferber also doesn't pull any punches about Texas as she shows some of the downsides to Texas -- the terrible racism against Mexican workers, for instance. Leslie often sees it as very similar to the treatment of the slaves in the 1800's. The story covers many years and as oil is discovered, Ferber shows how life affected them.The information contained about Texas is invaluable and insightful. Ferber has done her research. However, there wasn't much of a story. Any time there was a threat into the happiness of the Benedict's, it was circumvented or turned out not to be a threat. While interesting on some levels, as a whole, the book failed to deliver on an interesting story throughout. There were periods of interest, but generally I was happy when I was able to put it down."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"Probably everybody that reads Edna Ferber's \\"Giant\\" has seen the famous movie with all the stars. But Edna apparently spent some time in Texas and the book is more than a story of the lust of a rich thug for a beautiful rich neglected woman. The driving across the barren landscape is one true Texas feature. West Texans always drove like bats out of hell across their barren landscape, until Richard Nixon stopped the party. I spoke to one ex-Ft Bliss employee who used to drive 80 miles for a steak dinner, at an average of 80, in the dark. Another interesting feature in the book is the control of the cattle barons of their employee's voting records. While this may insult some West Texans, it is widely reported that LBJ stole a 1954 election by some fraud committed in a south Texas county with significant minority population. See the PBS biography of LBJ for the details. A last feature that interested me is the grand opening party of the Hotel by the oilman. While most of the book seems to be located near Odessa-San Angelo-Midland, the hotel scene matches news reports of the opening of the Shamrock Hilton Hotel in Houston, a grand pile I saw myself in 1962. A lot of wild and powerful people inhabited 30's and 40's Texas, there is a lot of room for books by people that know more about it than Ms. Ferber."},{"Title":"Giant","review":"Unlike many adaptations, the movie Giant is far better than the book. I found nothing but flat characters and gross oversimplification of Texas history and culture. It was a quick read, but it certainly wasn't worth the time.

This is the story of how he slowly left that world and discovered his Jewish roots. Cowan writes from the heart, expressing all his emotions about his journey, including his fears. I am from an extremely traditional Jewish background, and was very impressed at his openness to first learning about something that he really knew little about, and then gradually beginning to practice it. (One of my favorite parts of the book is when he puts on tefillin, a morning ritual for Orthodox Jewish men). In addition, this is also a story about his wife. Raised as a Protestant, she comes to share his love for his new-found faith. A unique book.

Tricked by one of Tarzan's arch-enemies into running away from home, Tarzan's son Jack finds himself banished to the deep jungle with only Akut, the giant age as a companion. As time goes by, Jack learns to cope with the jungle and transforms into Korak, a jungle lord who converses with apes and rides Tantor the bull elephant. Korak rescues a little Arab girl with a hidden background, and the two young people become fast companions of the wild. The action is constant, the plot convoluted but typical of the Tarzan series with never a dull moment. My only objection is the ending of the book. All is, of course, resolved, but it is so quickly done one cannot help wondering if Burroughs was up against a deadline. Nevertheless, it is quick, good reading!"},{"Title":"The Son of Tarzan","review":"The Son of Tarzan deserves a strong 4 star rating. While the story shares a lot in common with much of Burroughs' early Tarzan material, isn't that why you like the Tarzan series? The Son of Tarzan also stands out among the early Tarzan series for its excellent characterization. The book's best feature is the relationship that evolves between Tarzan's son Korak and the kidnapped French girl, Meriem. It is much more satisfactory than the Tarzan and Jane relationship, which really fizzles after the first couple of Tarzan books. The reader sympathizes with Meriem from the onset of the story. Burroughs patiently develops her character throughout the book, creating an appealing feminine presence. The reader also sympathizes with Korak, who proves to be more than just a &quot;Tarzan Jr.&quot; While the two share certain similarities, Korak is his own man whose ultimate fate hangs in the balance until the very end of the novel.Alongside these two strong leading characters, Burroughs works in a number of foes that add significant interest to the plot. The character of Baynes is the most interesting among these, and the reader will appreciate how Burroughs expands his role. The plot does not get overly complicated, nor is the reader buried under an avalanche of endless characters. By the end of the book, Burroughs is able to tie up all the loose ends that he has created.There is a certain amount of predictability, and Burroughs is unsuccessful in his attempt to cloak the identities of the &quot;Big Bwana&quot; and &quot;My Dear.&quot; This does not greatly detract from the overall book, though. I found that the book's pace gained momentum as the story progressed, and found the conclusion to be very satisfactory. It is not a conclusion that merely baits the reader into buying the next edition, unlike the present &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movie saga, for instance. It stands on its own.The 1917 version that includes many outstanding illustrations by J. Allen St. John is the best way to go on this one. St. John's only lapses are his inability to capture Meriem in &quot;civilized&quot; garb, the illustration in which Tarzan looks like a skinny 90-year old man, and the bizarre, strangely proportioned Quasimodo-ish picture of Baynes fighting the black. Aside from these glaring exceptions, his work is top-notch."},{"Title":"The Son of Tarzan","review":"SON OF TARZAN is the most action-packed, breathless adventure story of the four books in the Tarzan series I've read thus far. John Clayton, Jr, aka Korak \\"The Killer,\\" leaps, literally, out of his bedroom window at the Greystoke manse and into a new world of danger, narrow escapes, and love.There are so many twists and turns and incredible coincidences in this book, that you'll be forced to turn the pages as quickly as you can to keep up. And if you think, like I did before reading SON OF TARZAN, that Little (Future) Lord Greystoke would be like the child actor who played the part of \\"Boy\\" in those old Johnny Weismuller movies, you'll be thoroughly surprised that he is just as savage as his father was. Adopted by the Great Apes, he is given the name of Korak, which in ape grunt, means \\"The Killer.\\" And a killer he definitely is.You'll also be charmed by the little girl Korak rescues from her mean and brutal Arab father The Sheik. Meriem is her name, and she is one tough girl. She is also a character who grows up before your eyes and you'll take her to heart as she suffers loneliness, abuse, and a broken heart before and after she is saved from a fate worse than death by Korak.I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it. 5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Son of Tarzan","review":"Son of Tarzan took a vastly different turn than the stories before it. Instead of Tarzan being the lead character, we have Jack, the young son of Tarzan. Jack loves his parents,but he soon realizes that he knows very little about them.This story introduces many concepts to the series, including a more fleshed-out romance than the others so far in the series. If you have not yet red the first three Tarzn books, I reccomend that you do, just so that you enjoy this book a little bit more.On a side note, this book contains some swearing, though not as much as many modern-age 'family' movies. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves adventure, whether old or young."},{"Title":"The Son of Tarzan","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote several books this being one of them about the life and time of Tarzan he is a good writer and can keep your interest.

I would suggest purchasing the &#34;Tarzan the complete adventures&#34; instead of downloading one at a time."},{"Title":"The Son of Tarzan","review":"At the conclusion of the third Tarzan novel, 1914's \\"The Beasts of Tarzan,\\" the Ape Man's archenemy, Nikolas Rokoff, lies dead (and 3/4 eaten!) beneath the fangs of Tarzan's panther ally, Sheeta. But Rokoff's lieutenant, the equally dastardly Alexis Paulvitch, manages to flee into the African wilderness to escape. Needing to know more, this reader wasted little time diving into book #4, \\"The Son of Tarzan.\\" As it had been with the first two Tarzan sequels, \\"Son\\" initially appeared serially in magazine form, in this case as a six-parter in the pulp periodical \\"All-Story Weekly,\\" from December 1915 - January 1916. It would have to wait another 14 months before being released in hardcover book form.The novel begins a full decade after the events of book #3, as we see Paulvitch, now a wreck of his former self after 10 years in the African jungle, finally being rescued by the crew of an English ship. By an astounding coincidence (and author Edgar Rice Burroughs' works are just riddled with these kinds of chance occurrences), before being returned to England, Paulvitch manages to encounter--and tame--the giant anthropoid Akut, who had played such a central role in book #3 as another of Tarzan's allies. Back in London, Paulvitch displays the giant ape before entranced crowds, and that is where Jack Clayton--the 11-year-old son of Tarzan--first discovers him. Thirsting for adventure, Jack decides to not only run away from home, but to bring Akut back to Africa, also (talk about spunky kids!). But once there, events conspire to make it next to impossible for Jack to return. Thus, like his dad before him, the lad goes native, and is soon seen swinging through the treetops, eating raw animal steaks and making enemies of the local tribes. It is a lonely existence for Jack (now called Korak, or The Killer, by his simian friends), until he chances to discover a little 10-year-old girl, Meriem, who had been kidnapped (as Jack had been in book #3) from her French parents three years before and is now a slave of sorts in an Arab village. And as it turns out, this is just the beginning of Korak's adventures with his new jungle companion, in a runaway saga that is to last over five years....As for Paulvitch, author Burroughs deals summarily with him in the book's first three chapters, and the Russian villain's ultimate fate is a satisfying one. Tarzan himself is absent for at least 2/3 of the book's length, only appearing in the opening chapters and then disappearing completely until the novel's second half. The book rather focuses on \\"Tarzan, Jr.,\\" his efforts to adjust to jungle life and his relationship with Meriem. Burroughs stuffs so much incident and plot convolutions into this entry that it is almost impossible to synopsize, but suffice it to say that the action never lags. As usual, the pacing is somewhat frenetic, the chapters always seem to end with a cliffhanger, and the reader is completely swept along; these books are true page-turners. Whereas book #3 had featured two nasty villains, this time around, we are presented with no less than four: Paulvitch, of course; the Sheik Amor ben Khatour, the kidnapper and abuser of little Meriem; and the Swedish hunters Carl Jenssen and Sven Malbihn. Malbihn is a particularly loathsome creation, especially when he takes a hot-blooded fancy for the teenage Meriem; he is almost comparable to one of the love-starved wretches in the H. Rider Haggard pantheon, only with far fewer scruples. As had book #3, \\"Son\\" goes far in disproving the charge of racism that has been leveled against Burroughs' work. In one telling passage, Korak regards a local tribe, and the author writes, \\"What if these were naked savages? What if their skins were black? Were they not creatures fashioned in the mold of their Maker, as was he?\\" (Too bad, then, that Korak becomes the enemy of this tribe, after being rebuffed by its members!)Burroughs' writing at this point, it must be said, seems subtly improved since book #1, \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" (which is celebrating its centennial this month, by the way, having been first issued in October 1912). Though no great shakes as a prose stylist, Burroughs was a natural storyteller, and his facility with pacing and sweep are much in evidence here. Book #4 contains some humorous asides as well, as when it is inferred that Sherlock Holmes (like Tarzan, one of the most popular and famous literary creations of all time) actually exists and is a person one can turn to for assistance! Typically, Burroughs invents some of his own words (such as \\"garmenture\\") and is guilty of an inconsistency here and there (such as when Jack recalls how Paulvitch had once had him tied up and Akut had successfully untied him; unfortunately, it never actually happened this way in the book). The bottom line is that \\"The Son of Tarzan\\" might not be anyone's idea of \\"great literature,\\" but it sure is some thrilling, gripping stuff; a book that dishes out memorable action set pieces and that might even bring a tear to susceptible readers as it draws near to its conclusion. On a personal note, I might add that having just read the first four Tarzan novels to celebrate the big guy's centennial (out of a series that reached, ultimately, to some two dozen), I find that I now need to take a break. Lately, I have begun to entertain a hankering for raw lion steaks...."},{"Title":"The Son of Tarzan","review":"I started reading Edgar Rice Burrows with the John Carter of Mars series.

You might wonder how much could possibly be said about lemonade, but Thompson gives you quite a bit of history of the drink--not to mention all sorts of permutations of basic lemonade, ranging from alcoholic to non, sparklers and spritzers, flavored lemonades, and more. It turns out that this traditional summertime drink is a wonderful springboard to all sorts of yumilicious beverages for year-round consumption.This slim volume has great recipes, ranging from Strawberry-Rhubarb Lemonade to Tailgate Spiced Cranberry Lemonade to Vanilla Bean Lemonade.

I've made it so many times I don't need to look at the recipe anymore. I've also made the Strawberry-Lemonade and that is delicious too, and so easy. Get this book if you are a lemonade lover!"},{"Title":"Lemonade (50 Series)","review":"Way too basic for someone who cooks a lot. A whole section on how to squeeze a lemon? Really? The majority of recipes were also basic: \\"strawberry lemonade\\", \\"tea with lemonade\\", and \\"ginger lemonade\\" started out the run. To my surprise, the author encourages the use of concentrate lemonade and store bought in quite a few recipes (I'm still undecided if that is criminal for such a book or merely a sign of the times). Then, a second whole chapter is devoted to adding seltzer water or soda to lemonade in similar basic combinations as in the previous chapter-- except this time the focus is they are bubbly.Bottom line, I was hoping for more creative ideas and modern blends with lemonade. The book possesses glimpses of such on about five pages (out of 95) giving recipes for 'citron au chocolat' and 'kiwi-lemon spritzer' and 'guava lemonade'. But then it closes with about 14 typical alcoholic beverages that have been renamed by the author. Not exactly what I was hoping for.A quick search online yielded more than this book offered for my needs, however, this book does have pretty pictures.

It is beautifully written and you'll be cheering the team on if you read it.The best part is that anyone who spent any length of time in Oxford would have recognized the characters in the book as the real residents of the town, loosely cloaked in a novel's licensed perspectives. So it truly provides a great insight into life on the Eastern shore.The worst part is that Pope's Tavern had a wonderful mural on the wall commemorating the team's effort and on display was a replica of the cup for all to see.

Her neighbor Phillip Barry is murdered in his office. His son, Peter, who shovels snow for Beth in the winter, asks Beth to help solve the crime. Of course, Beth can't say no.This is an entertaining mystery. There is nothing special about it, but the characters and the mystery were interesting and it was a quick read."},{"Title":"Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly","review":"You can tell a writer doesn't have a plot to share when the bulk of her \\"story\\" is devoted to the ingredients of meals (down to the type of salad dressing) or what color the sofa is in someone's home (take your pick - every living space is described in exhaustive, boring detail).I picked up Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly because I lived in Milwaukee for 38 years. It is my hometown, and now that I am living in London, I do get homesick on very rare occasion. The book is written for those who have never seen Milwaukee, much less lived there, and I freely concede that if you've never been to Milwaukee, Barrett's loving descriptions of the neighborhoods, gardens and festivities might encourage you to make a visit. In reality, however, it's just more padding.The mystery, such as it is, consists of a prominent CPA being murdered and his son asking Beth Hartley to investigate, even though she has no authority or credibility in doing so and could rightly be told to mind her own business when approaching various witnesses. In between implausible interviews, she goes to various Milwaukee locations and gives us close-up portraits of what she finds. Such a shame that she didn't visit the Zoo - that was one of my favorite haunts when I lived in the City.Kathleen Anne Barrett graduated law school and practiced in Milwaukee and Philadelphia. It is painfully clear that she read Scott Turow and John Grisham and thought \\"I can do better.\\" She can't. If the legal briefs she's written are as bad as Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly, I feel terrible for her clients."},{"Title":"Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly","review":"I can describe this book in one word: Lame. Laughable. Amateurish. Boring. Take your pick. The amateur sleuth in this one decides she is going to interview all the people connected to the victim, so she makes appointments to talk to each one. Even though she has no official standing, and is not related to the victim, each one of these people, instead of telling her to \\"get lost and mind your own business\\", readily agrees to meet with her. They then proceed to tell her personal details of their relationship with the victim, such as having had an affair, and point the finger of suspicion at others. Not only was this interview-after-interview style monotonously dull, I find it hard to believe anyone would confide such personal information to a complete stranger. In addition, our sleuth has a romantic relationship with the detective investigating the murder. With knowledge of her activities, which include entering the crime scene apartment of a victim without permission, he looks the other way and continues to allow her blatant meddling in police affairs.The author also loves lengthy descriptions of places, furnishings, and meals. Every place that our sleuth goes in Milwaukee gets a lengthy description that would be better suited to a travel guide. Every room that she enters has each piece of furniture described in exhaustive detail. And what I found most laughable, we were treated to an itemized list of EVERY food she ate at EVERY meal, sometimes even including a list of all the ingredients in a particular dish (what was on her salad, what went into the casserole). Clearly this author has a hankering to be a food writer rather than a mystery writer. I would have abandoned this book in the early stages, but, after a point, I continued to read it for the amusement value, wondering if it could get even worse."},{"Title":"Milwaukee Summers Can Be Deadly","review":"About halfway through this book I just skipped to the last couple of pages. I couldn't keep any of the characters straight and didn't really care about any of them. There were needlessly detailed descriptions of things that had nothing at all to do with the plot.

The author bogs the slender story down with detailed descriptions of who wore what and who ate what along with her tea.

(possibly his third) Yet, there is nothing to indicate he was only starting out. Right away he grabs our attention with the funeral of King Henry V. Henry V's brothers Bedford and Gloucester help us to see the virtues and strengths of the deceased king. The Bishop of Winchester is well drawn as a comical villain who plots and plans, but never succeeds in doing any real damage. (Not until the next play anyway.) Talbot is memorable as the selfless hero of the play. York is memorable as the hero who defeats Joan of Arc. King Henry VI himself is interesting. First we see him as a helpless infant. By the third act, we see that he has both strengths and weaknesses. He makes the mistake of dividing the command between the rivals Somerset and York. But also, we see that he does not tolerate treason or neglect of duty. There are also many memorable scenes. The garden scene that foreshadows the War of the Roses is well drawn. The scene where York comforts his dying uncle is tragic beauty. Bedford's death in 3.2 has almost a divine tone. The death of Talbot and his son is very lamentable. York's sudden rise to power is captivating. Perhaps Shakespeare's greatest achievement in this play is that he simultaneously shows us England's war with France and the dissension with England itself."},{"Title":"King Henry VI, Part 1 (Arden Shakespeare Third) (Pt. 1)","review":"This is not quite as good as 1 or 2, but it is still excellent! Shakespeare grabs us with the dispute between Henry VI and York. While it seems to end peacefully it does not, and the war goes on! York's death in 1.4 is another landmark in Shakespeare's writing. The scene (2.5) where Henry finds true terror is horror, sorrow, and yet beauty and yet another moving part of the play. (The son that hath killed his father and the father that hath killed his son.) The war pauses in disaster for Henry and some comic relief is offered. But the horror starts all over again when Edward IV and Warwick have a falling out. The war starts over again, and the King of France gets involved! The scene where King Henry VI is reinstated is a scene of beauty and hope. While all of this is happening, Shakespeare carefully prepares the monstrously satanic character of Richard III. From here, the play just gets more and more bloody. A final moment of horror is offered when the eventual Richard III proudly compares himself to the one who betrayed Christ.

I was desperately trying to find a way to deal with her colic and having tried the Gina Ford approach with no luck was working my way through every baby and sleep book I could find and just waiting until she was old enough for controlled crying.The author describes how parenting attitudes differ across cultures, and what may be considered 'spoiling' a child in the west - for example, carrying a baby in a sling or sharing a bed - would be considered natural if you lived in a different time and place.Despite my cynicism, this book made me start to feel good about being a mother. It encouraged me to try some things I would have otherwise felt would have been spoiling her. I found a way to cope with the colic until it ended (at 3 months) and I never had to try controlled crying in the end. It also helped enormously with bonding, made me much more relaxed about whether I was 'doing it right' and I only wish I had bought and read the book before my daughter was born."},{"Title":"When Your Baby Cries","review":"This book was just OK, in my opinion.

I think if you are completely new to the subject of baby sleep, then read it. It is easy to read. It is a good beginners book. After reading this one, you will probably want to read other books on the topic in order to get a method down. I am currently reading \\"Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems\\", by Richard Ferber.

The ones that aren't too fussy about dead or alive tend to make more money, which leaves the Bebop crew struggling.Supergenius crimelord doubles, computer brained dogs and annoying alien girls don't really help."},{"Title":"The Diamond Smugglers","review":"Back in the 1950's, the smuggling of diamonds from Africa took on the proportions of a James Bond novel. In this non-fiction account of those times, Fleming outlines the successful counterintelligence effort which was used to bring the rampart smuggling under control.A bit dry, but Fleming fans will appreciate the Bondesque style the story is recounted in."},{"Title":"The Diamond Smugglers","review":"Ian Fleming started his writing career as a journalist before discovering his imagination was both an easier and more lucrative source to work from, yet always strove to play reporter in the guise of presenting background in his James Bond novels. Fleming's one attempt at a non-fiction book thus held promise, yet fails to deliver.\\"The Diamond Smugglers\\" is based on a series of conversations Fleming purports to have with a diamond-smuggling investigator he names \\"John Blaize.\\" I say purports because Blaize's words, both as quoted by Fleming and in an introduction supposedly penned by Blaize, sound very much like Fleming. \\"The trouble with diamonds is every stone carries the germ of crime in it,\\" Blaize explains.The trouble with \\"The Diamond Smugglers\\" is not so much its sense of unreliability but that it's boring. Instead of capers, we get a geography lesson of coastal Africa. The device of channeling the narrative second-hand creates an automatic disengagement with a series of unimpressive tales about investigations undertaken for the great diamond mining interests of the time by what came to be known as the International Diamond Security Organzation, or IDSO. From what can be gathered but is never directly said in this book, the IDSO didn't exactly accomplish very much, yet Blaize adopts a stultifying self-congratulatory tone from beginning to end.Smugglers, Blaize tells us in his introduction, \\"will hear of this book and read it, out of fear or vanity, to see if their activities have been revealed or their names mentioned.\\" Or perhaps for a laugh at the authorities who tried so fruitlessly to root them out.Stories include an investigation into how Liberia, not one of Africa's more diamondiferous nations, became a clearinghouse for diamond export. In one case, a small-time smuggler who keeps a diamond in a vaseline jar is snitched out by a pretend-friend angling for promotion. At one point, the IDSO tries to run a double agent, but he comes back with nothing.When another double agent dies in a plane crash just as he is on the verge of cracking a case, Blaize labels it \\"curious\\" and leaves it be. We are told of great criminal figures who spirit away some diamonds and melt into the shadows, but Fleming and Blaize assure us we are safer not knowing their names.As journalism, this wouldn't merit a segment of \\"60 Minutes.\\" The book is only worth reading for the view it gives us of James Bond's creator switching gears, apparently while researching his Bond novel \\"Diamonds Are Forever.\\" The best parts are when Fleming sets the stage for his conversations with Blaize, in levanter-battered cafes or beaches, where we get that sense of place Fleming conveyed so well. Some humor, too: At one point, in Morocco, Fleming and Blaize avert suspicions about what they're up to by pretending to have a captured coelacanth, a \\"living fossil\\" fish whose discovery was all the rage at the time, in a bathtub.Fleming pronounces himself impressed at the end with this real-life \\"secret agent,\\" calling him \\"a professional to his fingertips.\\" Yet the only thing John Blaize has in common with James Bond are his initials. Otherwise he comes across as a boring bureaucrat with some dusty second-hand stories to throw up. Fleming, in passing them on so breathlessly, seems to have been a bit of a dupe."},{"Title":"The Diamond Smugglers","review":"This book by Flemming is interesting and well written. I like it because it is non-fiction and is a true story (unlike his Bond novels). A real Flemming fanatic will love this wonderful book. I rate it a 4 star book and a piece well done."},{"Title":"The Diamond Smugglers","review":"Ian Fleming is wonderful in this non-fiction story of diamond smuggling in the late fifties. Very well written. Fleming did his homework on this one. Claims to have written it with a chap called John Blaize, of a diamond organization. Went to Africa to research it with Blaize. Very good, because it is true, unlike his Bond novels."},{"Title":"Wilson Plot : The Intelligence Services and the Discrediting of a Prime Minister","review":"David Leigh, long time intelligence journalist for the Observer, presents us with a densely scathing and opinionated cold war expose of the Harold Wilson Affair. As in the Beatles shout out \\"AH AH MR WILSON .. AH AH MR HEATH .. Taxman\\" Set in the 1960s of the PROFUMO and Golitsin efforts espionage environment, this text will be candy for John LeCarre fans or Peter Wright's \\"Spycatcher\\" readers. Leigh is strongly disposed to attack Peter Wright and puts the activities of Liddell and Hollis and the old MI-5 group under a microscope. A little wordy and choppy, there is a GREAT deal of background about PHILBY BLUNT MACLEAN BURGESS before the details of the Harold Wilson affair (HW was PM of Britain in 1964/5 and again c. 1975 when he was sacked by a palace coup d'etat) Harvey Klehr's SPIES has a similar detail and grain; intelligence history is a branch of diplomatic history and this is a detailed exam of the classic era Cambridge 'Circus' in full tory farce."},{"Title":"The Alarm, Sensor & Security Circuit Cookbook","review":"This book does not go into the theory behind any of the sensors shown, nor does it go into any of the theory behind the electronic and optoelectronic parts required to build any of the circuits shown. It is basically just a library of different kinds of alarm circuits complete with theory of operation and parts list for each circuit. The reader should therefore already be familiar with the basic techniques of designing circuits that include discrete electronic parts such as LED's and BJT's. It is a useful book of ideas if you are looking for a complete description of an alarm circuit that you can use for a larger circuit you are building. I cannot vouch for the overall accuracy of the book's circuits, but I have built about five of the circuits included in this book over the last two years, and they all worked OK without modification. The book is unique in that it shows you detailed circuit diagrams and parts lists for detecting humidity, earth movement, twilight, smoke, and fluids. It is relatively short at under 300 pages, but at its low price I consider it a bargain if you think you will ever be faced with designing any kind of alarm circuit. If you want to get more into the theory of the sensors that are showcased here, might I recommend Jacob Fraden's \\"Handbook of Modern Sensors\\", since it is heavy on theory and lighter on circuitry, making it the perfect companion for this book."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"Over the years I think I have read every book that Elizabeth Lowell has written. I know I have at least 30 in my collection. I have to admit that Warrior was one of my favorites. In fact the entire series is one I often read again. I consider most of her books keepers and though I do not read romantic fiction exclusively I am first in line when her latest hardcover comes out."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I Loved this one!

I would suggest this book to anyone because it is short, sweet and worth the time to read it. Make sure to read all of the other books in the series"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I've had this book for a few years and every once in a while I pull it out and re-read it. Yes, it's just that good. Mrs. Lowell is the mistress of emotional writing. As you read this novel you actually feel the pain, love, and fear of Nevada and his fairy-tale girl, Eden. To experience a love like this hero and heroine would the ultimate and I guarantee this sizzler will blow you away. I think this is the best written book Mrs. Lowell has ever done is such short space. Another good book of hers is Tell Me No Lies. Every time I read it I pick up something new."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I read my first Elizabeth Lowell novel just three weeks ago. I have now read 10 more. The story of Eden Summer and Nevada Blackthorn is one of my favorites. The instant recognition of Nevada as her soul mate draws you to Eden. Her love for a man who has felt so much pain that he no longer believes in love is inspiring. This story was so wonderfully crafted that I felt as though I was standing off to the side and actually watching Eden and Nevada's love blossom. When I finished reading this book I did not realize that I was holding my breath until I let it out in a long sigh."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"This could describe the man or the cougars, you choose.This is the first of the Mackensie/Blackthorn series I have read. I enjoyed this story from start to finish. From their first meeting in the town bar to the time spent in the hills tracking cougars, my eyes were glued to the pages.Ms. Lowell has succeeded in providing us a couple who is vunerable, interesting and has a little mystery. Eden is out tracking cougars in a ranching area. Nevada is licking his wounds from his past work with the CIA. Together they make living remotely on a mountain seem like the sexist thing.I find that Ms. Lowell's writing isn't always consistent. In this case though, it is supurb. She brings to life her characters that are missing in some of her other books. You care about each of them like they are friends and the chemistry between Eden and Nevada burns your fingers as you hold the book.As summer is approaching, put this on your list for an afternoon read either at the beach, lake, or park. I doubt it will take you longer than a day to finish it. Unless of course, you decide to reread it!"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"i liked this book a lot. it was much better than some of the earlier books in this series or group.the basic story is eden comes to the ranch to see if there is threat to the mountain lions there are in danger. she meets nevada and they of course develop a relationship.the story is well written, it moves well and i liked it a lot. the characters are 3 dimensional and well written, the story moves quickly but not too fast. i think it is definately worth the read, even though it is very short. i hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I love every book I've read by Ms. Lowell. After reading the other stories about the McKenzie and Blackthorn families, I can only hope with all my heart that Ms. Lowell will consider writing the story of the last Blackthorne brother, Utah. You can bet there would be many other fans and readers who can't wait to read about his story, including his relationship with Sybil. If there is any way to communicate this to Ms. Lowell, PLEASE do so ASAP!"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I have read this book countless times and it still remains at the top of my favorites list. I still have an original copy from when it was released in the Silhouette Desire line. I would have to say that Nevada and Eden are one of my favorite couples and I never get tired of re-reading their story. It sure would be great if we could get a sequel or maybe another story where we could get an update on their life and the lives of Nevada's brothers.You won't be disappointed if you buy this book!"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I read the books in this series one after another. I am already going thru withdrawal (I finished Warrior an hour ago-literally). I hope Ms. Lowell reads these reviews. A final book to catch us up on Mariah and Cash, Luke and Carla, Diana and Ten and of course Eden and Nevada and what about Utah? Also can I hope to see another installment in the Donovan series? Ms. Lowell, if you see this, how about it?"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"Even though this is a short book, it is still wonderful. I loved Neveda's dark and tortured past. I loved that he was able to get past it. The story was fast paced, and I couldn't put it down. This is a book I happily add to my collection."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"The amazing thing about this ELowell series is that there are so many interesting people in it. I wish it was a few chapters longer. There's a lot(!) of angst, but there's smiles and laughter too. You'll read it for the hot scenes, but you'll keep it because it's a great story."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I've read all of Elizabeth Lowell's books, including the mysteries she and her husband wrote as A.E. Maxwell. What I love about all their books is the underlying theme of the unchanging land and what a comfort it can be when you are faced with death or loss. Eden falls in love with her eyes wide open. Love is always worth it, but it can hurt like nothing else on earth, she tells Nevada. Nevada is a warrior who learned to turn off his emotions because they hurt too much. Eden is the &quot;fairy tale&quot; girl who makes him believe love can be more than a fairy tale. This is a beautiful story that offers a lot of hope. It's not just a good romance. It's good writing, period."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I could not find this book anywhere but through Amazon and its wide network. I've been a long time customer and have NEVER experienced anything unpleasant or even mildly annoying. Best customer relations department I've dealt with in all my adult life -- and I'm 69!"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"Book #5 in this 5 book series. Although I loved the beginning of this book it slacked off about the middle of the book. Once again the nickname that Nevada gave to Eden was driving me crazy. I hated it & it was used way too much. The intimate scenes were way too long & too much & they were almost identical to the other books in this series. This is the 2nd time that the female has been a scientist & it just puts an odd picture in my head.I'd give this book 3 1/2 stars if I could but since I couldn't I went ahead & gave it the 4 since I enjoyed the beginning so well.Although I don't recommend book #1 in this series since I didn't like it at all & it doesn't really tie in too much since it's a historical & the rest are contemporary I would say the other 4 are o.k. They're not great but they're o.k. if you have nothing better at the moment. I would not read any of these again though."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"Ms. Lowell has never let me down. Nevada is just too wonderful to be true. Strong, dependable, sexy as all get out and in need of a women to soften that hard shell. Eden is perfect. She's inteligent, understanding, sassy and women enough to try to heal Nevada. I read this book ten years ago and continue to do so at least once a year since. If you're looking for a really great romance this is it."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I think the basic premise of this story is solid enough. Where it falls short is in the development of the storyline and its characters. For one thing, I think the main plot would've benefited if the story were a bit longer, allowing time to develop the relationship between Nevada and Eden and also adding more depth to the characters. In its current state, the characters seemed superficial and the story rushed. Most disturbing is Eden's discovery of her feelings for Nevada and after so little foundation on why that occurred. Eden and Nevada spend a lot of time together but the story skips through much of that and focuses on only sex scenes and sexy dialogue. For me, it leaves a lot to be desired.So, read this only if you can't find anything else better to do with your time."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"They just don't write romance like this anymore. A reissue from 1991 on Lowell's series of the Mackenzie's Western Lovers - Warrior is reassuringly old-fashioned romance with smoldering chemistry between rancher Nevada Blackthorn and wildlife biologist Eden Summers. Haunted by his grisly past as a war veteran in Afghanistan, Nevada has dispelled and resisted any coil of emotions to resurrect a cold and unfeeling exterior. Yet Eden Summers has penetrated his resilience with her strong belief in love as a healing power - one that would bind them as one or separate them forever. Smoothly setting the passionate story in the grand plains of Colorado, Lowell judiciously uses the nature of cougars to compliment the savagery of Nevada - and explore his gentleness. What is most potent about Warrior though - is the unleashing of coiled emotions of love and its unexpected poignancy between the wounded souls to render it a lacerating experience of passion at its most elemental."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"Nevada meets Eden at a bar where she walks up to him thinking he is the owner of the store she needs supplies from. She is harassed and he defends. She goes to a cabin in the mountains to track wild cats and he follows days later to ensure she is okay. I won't say more as I don't want to give the story away. What I do not like is that she wears her heart on her sleeve and he, not a believer in love, takes what she has to give. He's got too many hangups constantly telling her he doesn't want to hurt her but does it every time and she is his doormat; always available to please him. I agree one hundred percent with review(er) from June 18, 2002. I will get bashed for this but I don't care, how can any woman lower herself to mush for a man who has told her time and again his feelings about love?"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I eagerly bought this book based on the reviews on this web site. The main characters have great potentional however the character development isn't there. Eden was raised in Alaska and is familiar with surviving in the wilderness, but other than helping Nevada out of a tight spot early in the book, the book doesn't follow through with this line. Nevada has burn out and takes it out on Eden. Of course if I wanted someone to leave me alone I wouldn't tell them I desire them? And Eden what is she a door mat? She puts up with Nevada's rudeness and keeps coming back for more. Finally the book doesn't go anywhere. The characters are limited to a small area and have few challenges. I didn't finish this book I was so bored. Lowell should take lessons from Linda Howard."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"Of the Mackensie/Blackthorn series, this is far and away the best one. Although I dearly loved Outlaw (Tennesse & Diana)-- I was captivated by Nevada, a burnt out CIA agent who saw more death than life while assigned to fight/train rebels in Afghanistan. He encounters Eden Summers, who is the embodiment of life, hope, and love. She teaches him how to love and feel emotions again. She brings him back from the brink of self destruction. Truly one of the best stories I have ever read.Nevada Blackthorn's character has remained in my top 10 list of favorite heroes. Buy the entire series but PLEASE buy this book regardless -- and keep it always."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"This is the first novel I have ever read by Elizabeth Lowell, and I am eager to read more. WARRIOR is a steamy romance filled with three-dimensional characters that come to life and are easy to love.&quot;As a biologist, Eden Summers had confronted all kinds of wild creatures, but never had she encountered any as gloriously untamed as Nevada Blackthorn. Life had taught this defiant warrior some painful lessons. Now he believed in survival-and nothing else. Yet Eden saw a gentleness behind the man's steely self-control, and she longed to tame his wild heart...and soothe his restless soul.&quot;I finished this book the same day I picked it up. The first page hooks you, and you're pulled into this hot romance that will not let you down. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"This book was not published in May 2002.

The men are exceedingly sexy but not afraid to be sensitive. The women aren't wimpy either. They're sexy, smart & woman enough to deal with these he-men. I thought the brothers (Tennessee & Nevada) were both great, but Utah's book has never been released. Will this error be corrected in the near future??? I recommend this series to anyone who loves Elisabeth Lowell, or is reading her for the first time.. You will truly become an avid fan just as I have."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I love the writing style of Ms Lowell. She introduces characters &amp; gives them history in other books when she does her series... But, not to confuse you if you don't read them in order. MMMM like Enchanted Series... In all her series she does this. This gives you a chance to connect with the characters. I want Luke &amp; Mariahs' cousins to be introduced. Also, if you read Reckless Love you will meet their ancestors. Like Case. I don't think anyone does a great job like Ms Lowell does in a series writing. She draws you in. I am waiting for Utahs' story as well as the elusive cousins(female)."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"This book, like so many of Elizabeth Lowell's books is one you just can't put down. Nevada is mesmorizing! Even when he's being a ..., you can empathize with him.

I very seldom reread a book, but this one will be an exception."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"I read this book years ago along with all of those in the series about these Mackenzie and Blackthorn men and was captivated. Too bad there are no men like this in real life. I agree with the reader who wanted to read about Utah Blackthorn. I have waited for years to no avail. We want Utah! We want Utah! He just HAS to be hotter than hot; his brothers certainly were. I certainly read everything Elizbeth writes in hopes that Utah will show up!!"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"This was great I couldn't put it down. Elizabeth Lowell has out done herself again. I liked the characters Neveda and Eden because they were both strong and thought they both knew what they wanted. I liked Neveda because he said what he meant and didn't care if it shocked people. Eden was good as well because she was the one person who seemed to be able to reach Neveda where others weren't able to come close. And I think that was because of her love for the land and the animals wild and tame that lived on the land. I think that's why she was able to get closer to Neveda better than others. I recommend this book to anyone that wants a book that's a great read. I have one question for Elizabeth Lowell and that is Will there be a book about Ten's and Neveda's other brother Utah?"},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"If you like Elizabeth Lowell this is a must-read.

In the past few years I have especially enjoyed Catherine Asaro's novels. Since quite a few people label her a romance writer rather than a sci-fi writer, I thought I would try reading a romance novel and see if I liked it as much. Warrior came highly recommended so I got a copy and sat down to enjoy a good book. I read it in less than 2 days. Not because it was so good but because it was so shallow. I apologize to all of you who love Ms. Lowell and this series, but I need more of a plot. This book was like a few chapters of a larger novel. I kept waiting for the mission - an adventure - that is bigger than just the two characters. It never happened. Whatever was tormenting Nevada is not explored in this book, not even in flashbacks. He seems a skilled rancher, not a warrior. There is only one fight, and it is in a bar with drunks. I need a struggle to effect mankind, not just one cougar. It would have been good to take the story back to the ranch and have some interaction between Nevada and his family about Eden, or about the research grant, or about going to Alaska. The book just needed more.If you ever get bored with characters liked Nevada and Eden, try Asaro's The Veiled Web. Lucia and Rashid share both a love and an adventure. Not as much sex, but a lot more love."},{"Title":"Warrior (MacKenzie-Blackthorn, Book 5)","review":"This is the worst piece of TRASH I have ever read in my life.

It is also a good book to refer back to when you have a problem with a brew."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"This is a great follow-up to the Complete Joy of Homebrewing book. It is more a collection of tips and techniques that it is an instruction manual. It reads very well and is a great resource for the intermediate homebrewer."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"Can't wait for the first batch! It started with one son in law and then the second son in law got a brewery. The book seemed the perfect accessory!"},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"If you brew this book is a great adition to The Complete Joy of Home Brewing.....Relax, have a homebrew !!"},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"The information might be top notch but the physical book is toliet paper with reciept quality ink. Who can read this small font, lightly smudged ink on recycled paper bags? If one drop of liquid gets on this book, it will disintergrate. I am afraid to touch the book because it loos like BPA ink. Shame on the publishers for denegrating such an important work."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"This is an invaluable and simple guide to homebrewing. Using this and it's predecessor 'The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\", I have managed to avoid most of the pitfalls that catch many rookie homebrewers. (Most of the ones that did get me were a result of coming up with a \\"better idea\\" than one in the books.) This one expounds on the ideas in the first book and essencially offers the reader the knowledge to design their own equipment, recipes and methods rather than just an set of instructions. Although, for the more laid-back brewer, the recipes in the book have yeilded some really good beers as well. On the downside, it tends to be a little too silly and folksie at times, but it's easy to overlook. Over-all, it's a very good reference for a homebrewer of any level. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"I got this book after about 10 batches, and found it to be very helpful. Has a lot of detail if you're just starting out. If you've brewed a few batches, this book will induce a lot of 'oh, that's why that happened' moments. Really a great resource. The kindle version was formatted well, easy to read."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"This book is an excellent reference to have on your shelf next to your home brew equipment. The amount of information contained in it is exceptional and I highly suggest it."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"What can I say about one of the most important books ever written for the art of home-brewing? The information is extremely helpful and it also has some great recipes!"},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"I'm very happy reading this book. It's really serious and complete.It helps me to brew good beers beacause all items in brewing are explained with enough deep."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"After publishing the best introduction to home brewing Papazian released this unenlightening tome. His snappy style, so essential in his first book, sounds dull and contrived. One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc. This information could have been presented in a two page spread. Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique. The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout. If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.' Papazian's book will most likely be a complete disappointment."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"I bought this along withThe Complete Joy of Homebrewing, also by Papazian. I think both books are a must-have for any homebrewer. _Companion_ is more of a reference text, while _Joy_ is more introductory. Both books have indispensable information about the basic ingredients and processes of brewing.When formulating a recipe, I refer back and forth to both books. Each has a variety of recipes in myriad styles that provide a good jumping-off point. For customizing the recipes, I refer to the table in _Companion_ that summarizes the various malts and their contribution to specific gravity, then I go to the table in _Joy_ that catalogs the different varieties of hops and their contribution to bitterness and flavor."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"Complete Joy of Homebrewing is awesome, and that book has been updated with the times. This companion book - while containing lots of useful information - suffers from dated information (check out the \\"list of homebrewer yeasts\\" which is under 2 dozen... a number not accurate for over a decade).Much of the book is designed on the premise of expanding to intermediate and advanced brewing, with great DIY instructions for building mash tuns, etc. However when you get to the recipes, they do not fit the book's scope because many require malt extracts. (I'm not suggesting that extract indicates beginner, but rather that by calling for 'branded' extracts... cans of Coopers, etc. the recipes lose a lot of their value. It would have been far better to list pure all grain recipes, then provide supplementary tips for converting those recipes to generic extract + steeping grains).Worth having, but a better \\"companion\\" is \\"Learn To Brew\\" by John Palmer, and the best-written recipes can be found in \\"Brewing Classic Styles\\"by by Jamil Zainasheff and John Palmer."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"As a new brewer, this book has more advanced information in it than I need at the moment. It will be a good reference as I progress through brewing and gain more experience. If you only have one book on brewing to purchase, get Charles Papazian's first book on home brewing."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"I have read \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" and was extremely impressed with it and was equally impressed with this book. It is more in depth and detailed than the previous and covers more issues. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"I agree with some of the other readers that this book is not as entertaining to read as \\"The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing.\\" Papazian's wittiness, which was fun and comfortable in his first book, now comes off as sharp sarcasm (ex. \\"if you haven't figured that out by now, maybe you're relaxing a bit too much\\"). However, you're probably not reading this because you're looking for an entertaining read. If you're like me, you want a book that's more in-depth, that'll fulfill your need to become more involved in brewing than you once were. Well, all in all, if that's what you're looking for, you may find that you use this book less than you expected. It has very good information for those who are getting into such things as filtration and artificial carbonation. There is also pretty detailed information on ions in water and their effects. However, the mathematical information presented is somewhat incomplete, and therefore hard to use with this book alone. If you are a beginner, this book is certainly not for you. Get \\"The New Complete Joy of Home Brewing\\" (by Papazian) instead, as it will guide you through an unbelievable range of brewing skill levels. If you're an intermediate brewer, and want to take it to the next level (grain-brewing, original recipe formulation, etc.), I recommend Ray Daniels' \\"Designing Great Beers.\\" There are quite a few things Daniels covers that Papazian doesn't, and Daniels seems to present it in a more concise, complete, and easy-to-use way. Don't get me wrong, Papazian is a great writer and a legend in homebrewing, but this second book falls short of the standard he set with his first."},{"Title":"The Home Brewer's Companion","review":"If your happy just doing kits and not really caring about all the extra little things you could be doing or the in depth process of beer making then you might not want this book.It is however an excellent book to get if you love making beer and like to learn all about it.
