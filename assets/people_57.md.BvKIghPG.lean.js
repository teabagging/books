Schwalm's text revolves around enslaved African American women on South Carolina low country rice plantations. Her focus is their transition from slavery to freedom, their push to hasten the demise of slavery, their struggle to achieve and maintain autonomy over their labor, their resistance, and their plight for dignity while they battled for respect in their own households. Schwalm contends that enslaved African American women slowed plantation production and took advantage of every opportunity presented by the Civil War to secure their freedom. Enslaved African American women were expected to be productive field laborers', in fact, they lay at the very heart of South Carolina low country rice plantation labor. With the Civil War approaching, rice agriculture in the South Carolina low country depended primarily on the hands and backs of slave women. Field labor was not the only responsibility these slave women had to keep in mind, they also had to perform motherly and household duties. Domestic production and field labor, Schwalm contends, were central to a slave women's experience. The Civil War presented enslaved African American women with opportunitites to ease the grips of slavery while they contested the terrible conditions on South Carolina low country plantations. This form of resistance eventually became more aggressive. In the early months of freedom, freed women attacked overseers, looted planters houses, destroyed planters property, and draped themselves and their children in their former masters clothing as a sign of protest and changing times. With their freedom seemingly secure, former slave women turned their attention to the control of their labor. They demanded the ability to live and work as they saw fit and seperate from white supervision. They had their own concepts of freedom and were determined to labor as free people and not as slaves. The slave womens family depended upon her work as much as the rice field did. The task system of labor afforded slave! women the opportunity to devote daylight hours to domestic production. This was crucial to family development. Slave women used their &quot;after task time&quot; to hire themselves out, grow their own crop, fish, and make family utensils. Slaves viewed production, independent from plantation production, as a way to elevate their standard of living and exercise control over their daily life. Slave women applied these same principles in a free labor work force after emancipation. The military experience had a dramatic impact on the relationships between freedmen and women. People believed that the military experience equated to manhood. Proving their manhood through military experience was a goal for black soldiers, their advocates and and white officers. This sentiment carried over to post was relationships between free black men and women. Leslie A. Schwalm's &quot; A Hard Fight For We&quot; is critical for painting a more complete picture of rice plantation labor in South Carolina's low country. We see that enslaved women were depended upon heavily and they fought for their recognition."},{"Title":"The Big Book of Small Stuff: 100 of the Best Inspirations from Don't Sweat the Small Stuff","review":"I received THE BIG BOOK OF SMALL STUFF as an early birthday gift.

During the presidency of Republican Theodore Roosevelt the federal government challenged the activities of powerful, unregulated industries, protected the health and rights of working people, protected consumers from contaminated food and unsafe drugs, and built the Panama Canal. Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt oversaw the building of monumental dams and bridges that serve us still, created the Social Security system, and led the country effectively through the worst war the world has seen. Eleanor Roosevelt mobilized the conscience of her country and of the world on important issues of social justice after her husband and uncle had left the stage. It is chilling to contemplate how the world would look today had they not played the transforming roles they did.The book is really a hybrid -- part biography and part political history. At times, it is organized, like &quot;My Six Crises&quot;, around specific problems i.e. FDR and Court-packing, TR and the trusts, rather than according to chronological order. This synthesis limits details of the personal lives of the three in order to fill in eighty years' worth of historical context. Burn, emeritus historian of Williams College, has written two previous works on FDR. Dunn is Professor of the History of Ideas at Williams and has written about the French Revolution. The book's purpose, they say, is to examine how these three, members of a patrician family and a privileged class, became great &quot;transformational leaders&quot; of the 20th century.The book is very good at showing the steps in that process, but less good at explaining where the interior compass came from that guided those steps. For example, TR at Harvard wrote his mother for information on the families of fellow students in order to make sure they were people of the right sort. Yet just six years later he was hobnobbing with cigar-chomping party hacks in a Republican club above a Manhattan saloon. &quot;He aspired to be a hero in an age without heroes&quot;, conclude the authors. Undoubtedly true, but insufficient to explain what led him from the Porcellian Club and the slopes of San Juan Hill to battles for social legislation like the Pure Food and Drug Law and the Employers' Liability Law.The introduction of the book suggests the Roosevelts took Lincoln as their model. This connects to the authors' concept of &quot;trasformational leadership&quot; and &quot;transformational politics&quot; as practiced by great leaders. But tracing a philsophical thread from Lincoln to TR's foreign policy and trust-busting is quite a stretch. TR compared himself to Lincoln in being a &quot;cautious radical&quot;. The authors' make a much stronger case, it seems to me, for FDR having used TR, rather than Lincoln, as a role model. They say he consciously set out to follow in TR's footsteps: from Groton and Harvard to the New York Legislature, Department of the Navy, Governorship of New York, and the White House. Lincoln doesn't figure obviously, either, in Eleanor Roosevelt's transformation from anti-Semitic society matron to &quot;First Lady of the World&quot;. It seems to have been her frequent contacts with the underprivileged during her White House years, well-documented by the authors, that transformed her world view. When she waded through ankle-deep mud to speak with &quot;bonus army&quot; veterans at their encampment, both she and they gained new perspective. &quot;Hoover sent the Army&quot;, said one of men, &quot;Roosevelt sent his wife&quot;. ER did not go just where her husband directed, but where her expanding conscience dictated.Burns and Dunn have incorporated current academic research into their book. They draw a connection between FDR's &quot;lurch to the left&quot; in 1935 and the popularity of radical economic ideas espoused by Huey Long, Father Coughlin, and Dr. Townsend. They give details of the FDR-Lucy Mercer affair -- a topic Burns called &quot;rumormongers' gossip&quot; in his 1956 biography of FDR.One place where they differ radically from the mainstream of historical scholarship is in their contention that FDR was more radical in his final year than at any other time in his presidency. They call it his &quot;last hundred days&quot;. To support this thesis, they point to his last State of the Union address which, like Lincoln's second inaugural, looked beyond the end of the war to ways to improve a nation at peace. He proclaimed an economic &quot;second Bill of Rights&quot;. Earlier, in 1944, he explored with Wendel Wilkie the possibility of uniting liberals in both parties, but the idea died with Wilkie a few months later. FDR vetoed a tax bill as being &quot;not for the needy, but for the greedy&quot;. He pushed the GI Bill of Rights through Congress. He pressed for the establishment of the IMF. He was exercising &quot;transformational leadership&quot; in the international arena by trying at Yalta to win the support of Stalin and Churchill for a strong United Nations. An amazing list of progressive accomplishments for a healthy, vigorous President -- much less a dying one.The final section of the book deals briefly with Eleanor Roosevelt's energetic last two decades as a &quot;world politician&quot;. She wrote a regular newspaper column, pressed the State Dept to recognize Israel, served as UN envoy, attacked Sen. McCarthy at the height of his power, used her name and money to support early civil rights efforts, participated in Democratic national politics, traveled the globe, and even found time to form an emotional attachment to Dr. David Gurewitsch. The authors say that her most enduring achievement was chairing the committee that drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and then in leading the fight for its enactment by the UN. A work that, Thirty years after her death, &quot;still stands at the center of the planet's moral conscience&quot;."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"All in all, \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is well written, interesting, hard to put down, even a \\"page-turner\\" at times. Problems? Just a few. First is the sheer sprawling scope of the undertaking - ONE book on THREE Roosevelts, when there have been volumes written on EACH Roosevelt? But, overall this works pretty well here, and like the Roosevelts themselves, it's hard to fault the authors for trying to cover too much ground. A more fundamental problem with the book is that although the three Roosevelts' lives overlapped to an extent, their political careers and activities were more or less separate, sometimes giving this book the feel of really being three books sort of stuck together. First, we have a relatively short book on Teddy Roosevelt, followed by a moderately long book on FDR, and then another relatively short book on Eleanor. Are there common themes here tying it all together? Absolutely. But are there also three separate individuals here, each with his/her own story? Absolutely. The last fault of \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is perhaps the most problematic; namely, the authors obviously LOVE their subjects, and the overwhelming positive slant on all three Roosevelts (the authors occasionally cite a fault, but usually just to show how the particular Roosevelt in question overcame it and became a better person) can become a little annoying at times, and even hurt the authors' credibility somewhat. Personally, I agree that these three people were amazing, fascinating, important, even heroic figures, but they were certainly not perfect. The internment of Japanese-Americans under FDR, to cite just one example, is an absolute disgrace, a moral outrage, and a HUGE blot on FDR's record. Teddy Roosevelt's nationalistic/imperialistic jingoism, cruel streak, and even bloodthirstiness are certainly not endearing or admirable qualities either!Having said all that, I still really liked this book, and definitely recommend it. Basically, the authors do an excellent job with the fascinating story of how three pampered, upper-class snobs became courageous activists, leaders, and champions of the common man. The authors give us a good feel for how Eleanor Roosevelt grew to eventually leave \\"the insular world of the patrician elite far behind.\\" Also, how FDR and TR came to despise the idle rich, and how they both came to see inherited wealth as immoral and un-American (FDR: \\"the transmission from generation to generation of vast fortunes...is not consistent with the ideals and sentiments of the American people\\"). What would FDR and TR have made of the current Republican Party's zeal to repeal the \\"Death Tax,\\" as they call it?\\" Mincemeat, for one thing! But, sadly, the Franklin and Teddy Roosevelts of the world seem to be in short supply these days - in either political party.A constant theme throughout \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is that of the WASP establishment vs. the \\"class traitors\\" (the Roosevelts), and how each side came to hate each other. The authors have some interesting things to say about this issue. For instance, that hatred of FDR signified not just rational opposition to his economic policies, but seemed to stem even more from the WASP establishment's \\"horror of equality, from their fear of losing their privileges and, even worse, their sense of privilege.\\" J.P. Morgan had even warned that \\"if you destroy the leisure class, you destroy civilization.\\" Thus, the authors point out that, even as conditions for the wealthiest 2% improved, their \\"extravagant, hysterical attacks\\" on FDR actually increased. And FDR responded in kind, reveling in the hatred of business leaders/plutocrats who wanted only, in his words, \\"power for themselves, enslavement for the public,\\" and comparing them to the fascist menace abroad. On the contrary, FDR had been educated - by Cousin Ted and others - to believe that the \\"noble, virtuous life\\" consisted not of profit maximization, but of public service. In Teddy Roosevelt's memorable words, the rich were \\"malefactors of great wealth.\\" And Eleanor grew to see her class as seriously limited, narrow-minded, smug, reactionary, anti-Semitic, and racist.Ultimately, the authors portray all three Roosevelts as people of courage, vigorous people of ACTION above all, people who disdained the trivial, non-productive life they had left behind, people who were willing to descend \\"into the vulgar world of office-seeking\\" (in other words, real life) to interact with different classes, ethnicities, religions, and even races. In other words, the Roosevelts did what most members of their class shunned. Although the Roosevelts certainly were not intellectuals or \\"geniuses\\" in the usual sense, all three are portrayed as brilliant in their ability to \\"[recognize] the needs of...people early on,\\" to \\"[sense] their political mood,\\" and to \\"[mobilize] their support.\\" In sum, the authors conclude that the three Roosevelts represented transformational leaders for America in the 20th century, changing the course of events dramatically from what they were, and what they might have been. As the authors conclude, \\"from 1881, when TR first ran for the New York State Assembly\\" until the rise of Reagan conservatism a century later, \\"the three Roosevelts charted the course of progressive reform in America.\\" A fascinating story, well told."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"This novel was immensely informative and entertaining. I am an English teacher who reads a lot, and I could not put it down. I loved the descriptions of leaders such as Huey Long and Gerald Smith and the isolationist movement.

My two favorite sections were the descriptions of the New Deal and the class struggle in New York during TR's time."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"The theme is that the three Roosevelts were elite and rich, and yet battled concentrated wealth. This book caught my attention when it received good reviews from major newspapers, magazines, and critics when it came out (which you can find on the Internet). The writing is interesting and moves along smoothly. James MacGregor Burns knows his material well. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of FDR.The section that covers Eleanor Roosevelt is maybe the strongest part of the book. Eleonor Roosevelt was a tireless champion of issues for ordinary people and the disadvantaged. She took up causes that her huspand politically could not. She championed the anti-lynching law when FDR had to be silent or risk losing his political coalition. She astounded a group of impoverished workers on strike by showing up to their gathering to show her support. Here was a well-dressed lady of the highest education and refinement showing up without security to show her support for their cause.The book begins with the solemn scene of President Lincoln's funeral procession, which Theodore Roosevelt as a child watched from his upscale residence. The book then shows how Theodore Roosevelt was influenced by Lincoln's presidency. Theodore Roosevelt did what he thought was right and rejected the life of comfortable leisure. Theodore Roosevelt acted boldly in some circumtances, while in other circumstances he acted compromising. This book has limitations. Theodore Roosevelt's foreign affairs are not mentioned. The emphasis is on the progressive nature of the three Roosevelts.The book shows that Franklin Roosevelt followed the path of Theodore Roosevelt. Like T.R., FDR was born into a rich, elite social class. He entered politics, became under-secretary of the Navy, and then governor of New York. T.R. was in FDR's wedding to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was from T.R.'s family circle. And he used masterful political skills as president like T.R. (and Lincoln), except that FDR took the power and achievements of the presidency to an all-time high, transforming that office into the \\"imperial presidency.\\" The coverage of FDR is very good, although you really need to read a full-length biography to learn the full story.All three Roosevelts (Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor) made \\"The Time 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century\\" list. FDR was ranked the runner-up most important person of the 20th Century, along with Gandhi. (Einstein had the top spot). \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" is a good way to learn about the three Roosevelts without having to read three lengthy biographies."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"James MacGregor Burns and Susan Dunn, Democrats by conviction, give an unequal account of the life of three Roosevelts by dedicating most of their biography to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. MacGregor Burns and Dunn show their audience how these three patricians left behind a relatively easy life to descend into the arena of politics. Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt had to overcome their prejudices about other classes, religions, ethnicities and races to get an understanding of the issues at hand and, at times make, painful compromises to get things done. MacGregor Burns and Dunn explain to their readers that the three Roosevelts have ultimately left an indelible imprint on the psyche of the nation by each setting an example of transformational leadership. On the domestic front, the country has been working on the best possible reconciliation of the respective interests of business, labor and consumers as well as the rights and duties of its respective races and ethnicities. Abroad, the country has weighed the pros and cons of an interventionist policy on a case-by-case basis to safeguard its vital interests, and to advance the cause of a world that espouses the values of responsible democracy and capitalism."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"It may have seemed like a good idea to write mini biographies of three prominent American citizens with the same surname and place them between the same covers but it doesn't really work. Burns's admiration for FDR is nothing new, and his (and his co-author Susan Dunn's)coverage of Eleanor Roosevelt is little short of hagiography. The poor relation of this book is Teddy Roosevelt. We get a bare bones account of the life and career of this fascinating individual before we move on to the meat of the book, the life and career of FDR. Unfortunately there is little analytical comparison between the presidencies of TR and FDR except to say that they both moved to the left in their political philosophies. At a more trivial level we are told of the remarkable similarities between the career paths of the two titans but just how much this was planned by FDR is unclear. The overlap in their political lives is not very revealing with TR coming to the end of his groundbreaking career and FDR beginning his. One note of discord was FDR's choice of party. We get glimpses of both personalities but not enough, TR the domineering presence who overwhelmed all who met him, who was possibly one of the most intelligent men to hold the office of president, and FDR the highly self-aware, calculating politician who had an uncanny ability to tap into the American psyche. TR was also the subject of a multiple biography by James Chace (1912; Wilson, Roosevelt, Taft, and Debs - the Election That Changed the Country). He fares better here with both Taft and Debs being relegated to bit parts. The treatment of Eleanor Roosevelt in this book is truly gentle. Although she did some great work in the UN (The Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be her undying legacy) she had difficulty escaping her patrician past. Her liberal tendencies did not see her move with the times and her stubborn support of Stevenson over Kennedy smacked of anti-Catholicism. Nevertheless she embraced many unpopular and sometimes dangerous causes and remains the most influential First Lady in the history of the presidency.An enjoyable read but this is only a taster. For a deeper understanding of these three shapers of history you will have to go elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"Trodding the well worn path of assessing the administrations of TR and FDR, and the historical significance of THE THREE ROOSEVELTS naturally means covering some very familiar territory. Teddy the extroverted outdoor adventurer; FDR - complex, secretive, manipulative, and Eleanor the activist. So what's new? The authors offer the view that without the three, the course of 20th century US history would have been vastly different. &quot;The genius of these three leaders lay in their recognizing the needs of the people early on, sensing their political mood, mobilizing their support, and then - above all - acting&quot; The common theme then is that the THREE ROOSEVELTS &quot;charted the course of progressive reform in America.&quot; They brought &quot;transformational change&quot;.It's a nice try and the book does explore some possible common motives that drove these three activists. Family, culture and the social environment all have some role to play. As a result the biographical sketches provided on each is sufficiently detailed. The problem with the theme is that the two men - their personalities, the way they governed, and their administrations - were more unalike than similar. TR was somewhat puritanical, FDR something else entirely; TR's side of the family was traditionally Republican while FDR is an icon of the liberal democratic tradition; FDR governed through &quot;brain trusts&quot;, of personal followers (the first example of modern-day &quot;cronyism&quot; some argue) wheras TR delegated and relied heavily on a very strong cabinet.Overall the author's portray all three in very favorable terms, moreso FDR and Eleanor; not as much time is spent on Teddy. Negative views of FDR's latter terms, such as in THE NEW DEALER'S WAR by Thomas Fleming, will not be on these author's reading lists. Contrary to such books, here FDR is not seen as weak or ineffective following his 4th term victory in 1944."},{"Title":"The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America","review":"An interesting fact of American politics - that many of our Presidents came from the &quot;upper class&quot; of American society - is the central premise of &quot;The Three Roosevelts: Patrician Leaders Who Transformed America.&quot; In this book, co-authors James MacGregor Burns and Susan Dunn examine the role played in American history by arguably the most influential &quot;patrician&quot; family of the twentieth century - the Roosevelts of New York.&quot;The Three Roosevelts&quot; is essentially a book containing short political biographies of Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt (TR) became one of our greatest Presidents. Early in life, his sense of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; caused him to choose a career in politics rather than a life as a member of the wealthy elite. He was elected, in turn, state representative; then governor of New York, as a Republican. He was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the McKinley Administration. Three years later, he was elected Vice President of the United States, and succeeded to the Presidency when President William McKinley was assassinated on September 14, 1901. His seven years as Chief Executive were some of the most successful of any Chief Executive up to then.Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was a young man who appeared to have little of his cousin Theodore's intellectual acumen, driving ambition, or ideological bent. Franklin followed his famous cousin into politics, but unlike his cousin, Franklin became a Democrat. Like Theodore, Franklin's political career advanced steadily. In rapid succession, he was elected State Assemblyman, then State Senator. By age 31, he had been appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Woodrow Wilson.In 1921, FDR was stricken with polio, which paralyzed him from the waist down. In 1928, after a seven-year hiatus from politics, FDR was elected Governor of New York. His two two-year terms were highly successful, but by then FDR already had his eyes on the biggest prize of them all: the Presidency.From 1929 to 1932, during the early years of the Great Depression, FDR proved himself a capable governor of New York. By 1932, after three years mired in the Depression, Americans were ready for a change. They elected FDR - the man promising Americans a &quot;New Deal&quot; - as President of the United States.The vast majority of &quot;The Three Roosevelts&quot; is taken up with an account of FDR's &quot;transformation of America&quot; during the Great Depression. Here, Burns and Dunn portray Roosevelt as a man employing a pragmatic approach to governance... try whatever works! Congress passed a body of legislation that was tremendous in scope. For the first time, the Federal government actively intervened in American life in an effort to make life better for all. The modern welfare state was born.The third of the &quot;three Roosevelts&quot; - Eleanor (ER) - was an integral part of her husband's political success. After her marriage to FDR, Eleanor remained indifferent toward politics, although she steadfastly supported her husband's political ambitions. As FDR's political career progressed, so did Eleanor's interest in politics. In fact, she was much more of an ideologue than Franklin. Burns and Dunn imply that Eleanor grew to have a tremendous influence on Franklin, possibly pulling him more and more to the left of center during his Presidency.On April 12, 1945, after thirteen years as President, years which saw the United States struggle out of Depression and stumble into a world war, Franklin D. Roosevelt died. He had helped build the modern welfare state, and had guided the United States to a position of victory in the Second World War.In the years following FDR's death, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to be a major influence on American politics. Through her nationally syndicated newspaper column &quot;My Day,&quot; ER continually interjected her ideas and opinions into the national debate. She was appointed as an American delegate to the first organizational meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Later she would serve on a UN commission that authored the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. She championed the cause of equal rights for all Americans, and was vocal in her support of the new nation of Israel.When &quot;The Three Roosevelts&quot; appeared in bookstores in the spring of 2001, I eagerly bought a copy. This was the first book I'd seen in over twenty years that was written by James MacGregor Burns, the historian best known for his two volume biography of the 32nd President - &quot;Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox&quot; and &quot;Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom.&quot;My hope was that Burns and co-author Susan Dunn would provide a penetrating examination of what caused this trio of extraordinary individuals to leave behind the values and traditions of their 19th century &quot;patrician&quot; class, in favor of a progressive and at times socialistic political agenda. It is a question left largely unanswered. &quot;The Three Roosevelts&quot; remains a book very long on biographical information and very short on historical analysis.The authors show an almost complete lack of objectivity toward their subjects. Burns is well known as a liberal &quot;New Deal&quot; Democrat, and his political bias shows on practically every page. He is ably abetted by Dunn. The result: &quot;The Three Roosevelts&quot; is practically a paean of praise to TR, ER, and especially FDR. Criticisms of the &quot;three Roosevelts&quot; are few, and even those are largely muted. Burns and Dunn's unabashed, gushing admiration of the &quot;three Roosevelts&quot; is annoying, and limits the usefulness of the book as an objective study of these fascinating characters in American history."},{"Title":"Teenage Pregnancy: A New Beginning","review":"We use this as a learning tool and quide for our teenage pregnancy class.

Prof. Matthews book does not play games or preach. He tells what true and not glamourized or demonized. His information is from other college students and its a dialogue that many students have had with each other. This book, most importantly, makes you look at your own personal behaviors. I have had the pleasure of having Jim as a professor and he is pleasure to interact with him. In the back of the book he gives his contact information. If after you read this, you have something to say, contact him. I am positive he would love to hear it."},{"Title":"The Tactful Teacher: Effective Communication with Parents, Colleagues, and Administrators","review":"This is a terrific book dealing with all of the various forms of communication that is so critical to teaching. It discusses various types of communication styles that is common in a school and how to effectively navigate through the challenges that arise for each. Examples are the authoritarian principal, the charming coworker that manipulates others into doing his job, overbearing parents, the control freak of a coworker, etc. It will walk you through how to deal with parents, students, coworkers, support staff, etc and I found it to be very authentic. As I read through this I found myself identifying attributes of my parents and coworkers and the advice was dead on when working with them. Typical challenge areas for new teachers are how to deal with an irate parent, when and why to seek help from an administrator, the importance of identifying teachers that are mutually respected by both other teachers and colleagues and seeking advice, identifying and respecting the communication chain of command, and personal pitfalls to avoid. Time and time again I witness coworkers and parents struggle with communication in our environment due to the passion that surrounds what we do each day. I will absolutely give a copy of this to my new colleagues and take the time to discuss the various aspects covered in the book. It also helped to rejuvenate my personal commitment to have a positive communication style and it was great to just take a little bit of time to pause and contemplate everything covered. The book is also very easy and quick to read so find a copy and pass it around!"},{"Title":"The Tactful Teacher: Effective Communication with Parents, Colleagues, and Administrators","review":"Excellent reference for teachers.

It is quite the opposite-- by the second page, the authors are already throwing in equations to represent the relationship between the frequency and wavelength of a sound-- crazy! The book is written by engineers, for engineers, and assumes that the reader is already well-read in electronics, physics, and advanced math! Also know that the work is British, so much of the terminology is different than what we use in the States. For example, proximity effect is \\"bass tip-up\\". Shotgun mics are \\"rifle mics\\". TRS plugs are \\"GPO\\" plugs, etc. The discussion of mixing boards zooms in immediately on features found only on very high-end studio boards, rather than the equipment to which a beginner might have access. The discussion of impedance focuses on how to represent values mathematically, rather than clearly explaining what is meant by \\"impedance\\" and why it is important. This book has ended up being absolutely useless as a beginner's text, and the publisher should not be representing it as such. We are abandoning it for something more beneficial to beginning students."},{"Title":"Sound and Recording, Fifth Edition: An Introduction","review":"When most of the class was buying spain's IORTV translated fourth edition at retailed price 32 euros I recieve it from New Zeland just beneath my feet a few thosand miles away and upside down, the 38 euros fifth edition.

(I still like the stories that lean this way too much, just not as well as the others.) Still, he can write and when he's on he can be really amazing.This collection is arguably a bit monontonous thematically, as it is subtitled something like 'Tales of Alienation in Speculative Fiction', and alienation is indeed almost inevitably the central theme. Honestly, thinking back on this collection I can't quite recall the details for most of the stories, but I did enjoy them all, and it certainly deserves particular recommendation due to it's two real standout stories, 'I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream' and 'Repent, Harlequin!', Said the Ticktockman.' The former is the archetypal, evil, omnipotent computer story, and it's definitely one of my favorite short stories of all time. It's about AM, a massive, intelligent computer which helped bring about the apocalypse, saving only 6 individuals, for the purpose of torturing them endlessly. It's simply one of the darkest stories ever, creating an atmosphere of sheer hopelessness far beyond anything else I can think of. Truly brilliant. 'Repent...' is almost as good, but a lighter, more satirical tale about a future society where such an emphasis is put on efficiency that one has their life deducted every time they're late, focusing on the conflict between the Harlequin, who wishes to disrupt the system, and the Master Time Keeper. (The Ticktockman, natch.) That sounds pretty stupid, I'm sure, but it works in the story. A very influential story too, I remember Moore or maybe whathisname crediting it as a major inspiration for 'V For Vendetta', and you can totally see that.Again, those are the standouts, but it's all worth a read. I also particularly like 'Nothing For My Noon Meal', 'The Discarded', 'Blind Lightning' and 'The Silver Corridor'. (which has a really great ending.)Yeah, check it out."},{"Title":"Alone Against Tomorrow: Stories of Alienation in Speculative Fiction","review":"Published in 1971, ALONE AGAINST TOMORROW is a retrospective anthology of stories based around the theme of alienation, set against futuristic backgrounds. It contains two of Ellison's most famous works: \\"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream,\\" a story of a small group of humans trapped in a virtual hell and tormented by a malevolent virtual god, and \\"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman,\\" in which a relentless prankster causes bits of chaos in a rigidly structured society, and the final message of which appears to be \\"You can make a difference; you can put a dent in the machine.\\"Earth's discarded freaks roam the spaceways; a method actor takes his art to the limit; a man is trapped in a room with a robot programmed to obliterate anything that moves; another man finds he has slipped through perception's cracks.If there is one weakness to the collection it is that some of the stories seem too similar. The theme of a man stranded alone on an alien planet appears a number of times. The details vary, but not enough to make them distinct.Still, while this material may not be as powerful as that in Ellison's other collections (to be fair, it is very early work), it is a book worth picking up should you come across it. At least, until the rest of those Edgeworks come out."},{"Title":"Alone Against Tomorrow: Stories of Alienation in Speculative Fiction","review":"I wish I would have been a bit older when I met Harlan Ellison; then maybe I wouldn't have been so intimidated. He is passionate and has the mastery over words to wield power greater than mere mortals. Not that agree with everything he says; far from it. As far as his collection of short stories is concerned, two stand out since I read them more than a decade ago:\\"I have no mouth but I must scream\\" is horrifying; I wish I could forget it.\\"Blind Lightning\\" is just as powerful, and I am very glad that I will remember it for the rest of my days.

They love the stories and listen to them all the time - almost every night while falling asleep and often during the day. My wife and I love them too! Odds Bodkin is a master story teller, and the voices and music he uses are great. There's alot of humor that the boys don't get but keeps the adults interested, too.

After less than 5 minutes, they were asking me to turn it off. I lasted a few more minutes, hoping it would get better, but ultimately I was forced to agree with them (I think my husband was ready after 30 seconds). The format of the story is a sung or sing-song set of voices (presumably by a single performer) over a constant jingly-jangly banjo-style background. Not only did I find the structure annoying, but the balance of voice to music was such that it was difficult to hear the words and engage in what little story transpired. This element may have been worsened by playing it in the car, but since I believe that is where a majority of children's CDs are played, in my opinion this is a serious flaw. This CD had been highly recommended in a children's book catalog I recieve, and after hearing it I cannot imagine why -- in addition, it was quite expensive.

In his Introduction, Matthew Fox (the former Dominican priest who founded the \\"Creation Spirituality\\" movement) notes, \\"Hildegard offers western civilization a deep and healing medicine for what may well be its number-one disease of the past few centuries: anthropocentrism... Hildegard brings together the three essential elements essential elements of a living cosmology. The first element is science... The second element... is a healthy mysticism... The third element... is art. Neither science nor theology is enough to awaken a people.\\"She asks, \\"Since God is Reason, how could it be that God, who causes all divine actions to come to fruition through human beings, is not active?\\" (Pg. 10) She observes, \\"As long as we are in this world, we cannot know the soul and its merits.\\" (Pg. 169) She predicts, \\"Foreigners will invade Christendom and destroy Church institutions by taking advantage of the Christians' lack of weapons. All this is an indication of the coming of the Antichrist. These days will be saturated with filth...\\" (Pg. 247)In one of her letters, she states, \\"I am but a poor woman who listens to the instruction of the masters.\\" (Pg. 331) She adds in another letter, \\"I am but a poor creature and fragile vessel; yet what I speak to you comes not from me but from the clear light. Human beings are vessels God has made and filled with the Spirit so that the divine work might come to perfection in them.\\" (Pg. 338)She wonders, \\"What about those in the Church who through an interdict impose silence on the singing of God's praise? If on earth they have committed the wrong of robbing God of the honor of the praise which is God's due, then they can have no fellowship with the praise of the angels in heaven.\\" (Pg. 359)While as with other translations supported by Matthew Fox (e.g.,Sheer Joy,Breakthrough: Meister Eckhart's Creation Spirituality in New Transition), scholars might debate its accuracy, this is still a very lively translation of a work that richly deserves modern readership."},{"Title":"Hildegard of Bingen's Book of Divine Works: With Letters and Songs","review":"Sometimes new agers like to take someone's work and usurp it for their own purposes such as \\"creatrix\\".

Not all Labs are \\"good with kids\\" and not all Bassets sit around the house doing nothing. People who want to know more about why their dog does what he does will need more than Santos' book. Her reliance on \\"corrections\\" to help train a dog was disturbing to me. Maybe I'm just lucky. My dog responds best to positive training and normally just acts worse if I use a leach correction. The good part is... I'm happier too if all the training is fun and good natured. Some dogs probably need stronger motivation and the occasional stern word... but if your dog is shy or reacts strongly to perceived \\"correction..\\" this method is not for you.In fairness to Santos... the book does point this out.

Grant Lewi has a talent for telling you the bad things in your chart in a way thats very easy to accept. And he's very eloquent when he is explaining the good things.However, its interpretation does fail on occasion. For example, in your horoscope if you have Mars or Venus conjoined to Neptune or Uranus, chances are his interpretations of your Mars and Venus placements won't hit the mark with you. This book deals almost exclusively with &quot;planets in signs&quot; and only briefly touches on their interaction and affect on each other. For that, you have to get his book &quot;Heaven Knows What.&quot;In short, if you purchase this book and &quot;Heaven Knows What,&quot; you will soon realize that many, many other astrology books are using them as a reference and a source. Studying these two book will place you well on your way to becoming an astrologer. It was how I initially learned and will easily lay the groundwork for more advanced study."},{"Title":"Astrology for the millions","review":"Astrology for the Millions is the book you need to have if you are pretty much convinced that all astrology is pure bunkum.Used in conjunction with HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT (Lewi's other extant title) this book will reveal to you whether astrology has anything to tell you that you want to know.In the early 1970's I started learning astrology with the Grant Lewi titles. Yes, they're simplistic, and yes they're out of date, and yes the new editions have lost something in translation, BUT - Lewi's approach can convince your friends you are not wasting your time fooling around with this stuff.The amazing thing about these two books is that, despite the simplifications, they produce astonishingly accurate results.I have just used Lewi's explanation of the Saturn Cycle which is presented in ASTROLOGY FOR THE MILLIONS in an essay &quot;Astrology for Writers&quot; on simegen.com aimed at convincing writing students to explore the potentials of this powerful tool in fiction writing. Thirty years, and I can't put this book down. I'm glad I bought it in hardcover to begin with!I still have the charts I made out thirty years ago, following the directions in the book and using the chart forms the book provides for spotting the crucial years when transits co-incide. The results match the results of the Matrix Software I currently use, but I STILL read those charts on myself.I recommend all the Grant Lewi titles to my writing students and my astrology students, but especially to those who are both."},{"Title":"Astrology for the millions","review":"My favorite astrology book ever. I have the older hardback version with a 1940s copyright as well as the current version. Regardless of the copyrighted date the book is the best. The current version brings in examples of recent celebrities and politicians to help the reader understand traits and characteristics. Even though the writing style has been updated, it does not, in any way, make the book any less valuable. This is a fantastic book for beginners and intermediates to help develop and improve their chart delineation skills. If, after reading this book, a person can not create a logical and cohesive chart reading, then that person is just not trying very hard to learn astrology!"},{"Title":"Astrology for the millions","review":"This book, along with Lewi's &quot;Heaven Knows What,&quot; are examples of works by someone who has perfect mastery of his field--analogous to Euclid's writings on mathematics.

I consider him the best author of astrology books all-time. Alan Leo is good but a bit out-dated. Evangeline Adams the same. Lewi doesn't miss a beat through the decades. His interpretations of planets in signs is very unique and informative. His short sun sign descriptions are the best I've ever seen, but too short. I wish he wrote a nice long chapter on each, but instead all he did was a page and a few relevant quotes."},{"Title":"Astrology for the millions","review":"This is an excellent astrology book for the person who wants a little more in depth understanding of the signs and the meaning of the planets and moon in the natal chart.

You will be amazed at how close the book is to the happenings in your life and the lives of the people you know well.If you are a person who has wondered why people are different. Or if you have begun to catagorize people into groups that fit the astrological profiles, you will be astonished, not only that your profiles are correct but that the birthdays work. The book takes you on the next step to understand human psychology in a way that Freud dismissed, but Isaac Newton accepted with the pragmatic enthusiasm of a practical observer of natural events."},{"Title":"Astrology for the millions","review":"Grant Lewi was a genius when it comes to astrology.

Hautala's strong point has always been his firm grip of character and motivation, and the mechanics of the horror story itself. Moondeath, on the surface, would seem to be a standard werewolf thriller, but Hautala rips the rug out from beneath your feet. A worthwhile addtition to any horror fan's library. Recommended."},{"Title":"Moondeath","review":"Moondeath, Rick Hautala's first published horror novel, centers around a small town that is slowing seeing its population decreasing. The main character guesses the origin of the creature, but is unable to convince the longtime citizens. The town always reports the deaths to the media in a way that makes no mention of animal attacks. The conclusion is a little weak, especially after the long buildup.Although predictable, the novel is still entertaining. Hautala's style is very smooth and the novel is an easy read. This is not his best work, nor the one for which he is best known. If you can locate a copy, read &quot;Little Brothers&quot;. Others which I highly recommend are &quot;Night Stone&quot; and &quot;Moon Walker&quot;. While long out-of-print, it's worth the effort to try to locate a copy of each."},{"Title":"Moondeath","review":"Rick Hautala was one those horror writers touted as the \\"next Stephen King\\" back in the 80s and all-but forgotten today. I remember he had a bunch of books out for a few years and then just disappeared. I always meant to read him, but never got around to it until I was in a used bookstore last week and stumbled across his name. I was all, like, \\"Oh, yeah! I remember seeing that guy on the shelf back in the day! Let's give him a test drive.\\" Even though it had the worst cover, Moondeath was the novel I picked out. I did not realize Moondeath was his first novel, though I guess I should have, given the crappy old school cover art and 1980 copyright date. Anyway, it sounded interesting, plus it had the \\"best new horror novel\\" endorsement by Stephen King, so I figured that was good enough for me. I paid a couple bucks, flirted with the cashier, took it home and and began reading . . .THE STORYBob Wentworth is a divorced high school teacher who wants to get away from his bitchy ex-wife and troubled past. He takes a job in the sleepy New Hampshire town of Cooper Falls, which turns out to not be so sleepy after all. He begins a relationship with local librarian Lisa Carter. The problem is she is married to an abusive, cheating drunk. Several other townsfolk have similarly dysfunctional slice-of-life stories, including the town slut, suspicious deputy sheriff, and school nerd. And people are dying, supposedly the victims of a \\"wild dog.\\" Like inJaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition), the powers that be in town conspire to hide the murders and pass them off as accidents. Meanwhile, we get cutaways to a sexy witch conducting moon-based black magic, and the werewolf stalking, killing, and eating people.A MIXED BAGIt's a bit slow, and sometimes confusing with the dates of the action in the chapters switching around or jumping forward, and not a lot happens for a long time. I know, sounds real interesting, right? Well, hang on--it's not bad, and it does have some good stuff in it. Moondeath is kind of like'Salem's Lot, but with a witch and a werewolf instead of vampires. It's just nowhere near as good.THE CONSRick's style is clearly rough around the edges here. He basically does everything any decent \\"how to write great fiction\\" book tells you not to (although these books didn't exist at the time Rick wrote this, so I'll cut him some slack). Let me lay it out for you:There are a lot of horrible adverbs (all the characters like to do things angrily, sadly, gently--basically anything ending in \\"-ly\\").There is rampant word repetition separated by commas (e.g., \\"I've, I've got to tell you,\\" instead of the more accepted stuttering self-interruption of \\"I-I've got to tell you,\\" or \\"N-no!\\"). Seeing the same words twice (even with a comma in-between) is super-annoying since it looks like they're typos, not real dialogue. I don't know anyone who constantly repeats themselves like this and pretty much every single character in this book does it multiple times. It feels like it happens every few pages.Then there are the usual problems of too many dialogue attributions (when we already know who's talking to who) and unnecessary action tags to mix up the already too many attributions.Too many exclamation points feels manipulative, like Rick is forcing me to feel excited about things happening when it should be up to me to decide how I feel. And most of the time, I'm not feeling his exclamation points are appropriate. He could have stressed the information he wanted better by making them into separate one or two line paragraphs and/or using italics to call them out to the reader's attention. Exclamation points should only be used in a character's dialogue or thoughts, not when the author is describing action, shock, suspense, horror, etc.Rick really seems enamored of the word \\"snapped\\" as an action, so everything is always snapped on or off, open or shut--basically, anytime he can reasonably say something \\"snapped,\\" he does. The word's overuse becomes distracting.And Zebra Books (the innovators who brought us the cheesy \\"Horror Hologram\\" book cover in the 80s) did their usual bad job editing the book because there are a fair number of typos. How many of these are Rick's and how many Zebra's, I have no idea.I did not really connect that well to Bob (the hero). Not much happens to him, almost like he's only there to be the outsider who must convince the town there's a werewolf on the prowl. He does a really bad job. His \\"B\\" story is his love affair with Lisa, and his personal problem is his past coming back to haunt him at his job. The relationship is bland, but the job stuff feels extremely thin and tacked-on. We hardly get any scenes of Bob teaching English, and all of a sudden, three hundred some pages in, Bob is confronted by oppositional forces within the school administration that I don't remember even meeting before. He should have had more interactions with the administration and his students. Most of the time, the way the book keeps skipping ahead in time (to get to the next full moon werewolf action), it didn't even feel like the hero had a job.Also, Bob switches between being angry and kind of a jerk to being a crybaby loser and a quitter. Lisa (who is no prize herself) dumps him and leaves him crying by the side of the road at one point. Seriously? I can't even remember them having sex yet. Then in the next chapter, they are magically back together as a couple with no explanation (except a week had passed). You can't just flip-flop character feelings and relationships offstage like that. I almost stopped reading at that point, and spent the next several chapters wondering if I was wasting my time or not. Things picked up again after that, thankfully, but then . . .When Bob finally proves the werewolf is real, but loses his teaching job, he just decides to leave town. The hero shouldn't be the reluctant hero this many pages in. He should be committed to his goal. Part of the problem is his only real ally is wimpy librarian Lisa, and she doesn't even believe him and isn't even sure she wants to be with him once she finds out about his past. All this makes him kind of a crappy lead. Not cardboard, but inconsistent, and not as well-developed as he should have been. He's no Ben Mears from 'Salem's Lot, that's for sure. He's like the anti-Mears, a cut and run loser who thinks the world's against him.I also was let-down by the witch, when her motivations were revealed and most of the mystery resolved (with 150 pages still left to go to catch the werewolf). After all the build-up, the witch was not cool at all. Total disappointment.All of this makes for a bit of an awkward, clumsy read, plus there's the inexcusably lame cover art. I can't even tell it's a werewolf novel by looking at it. It looks like maybe it's a were-panther, but even then, I get eyestrain trying to make out the details in that muddy black cloud.THE PROSThat said, Rick's style is friendly and easy-going. It's clear the guy's putting his heart and soul onto the page, even when it isn't perfect. You can tell he's got talent, he just needs an editor and a bit of self-restraint.He's got a good ear for describing details (e.g., \\". . . rows of tombstones reminding him of broken teeth\\") and for developing some of his supporting cast (just not his boring lead, Bob). He's also doing some decent mystery-building, because he doesn't give away who the witch is right away, or even what the hell is going on. Just enough to keep me reading . . .The way most of the scenes are described, I can see them in my mind's eye playing out like the 1978Salem's LotorThe Howling (Special Edition)because the story is told in a very cinematic way. That's a huge plus.There are some cool horror scenes in here, namely the witch's sex magic and the werewolf kills, but the one that sticks out the most for me was the first time the hero gets a good look at the werewolf. He thinks it's a wild dog until the beast rears up on its hind legs and covers its eyes with human hands to avoid the glare of an oncoming car's headlights. That in particular stood out as really cool and creepy to me.Last (and best of all), the sexy witch is always getting off shoving chicken blood and other gooey stuff inside herself during her semi-frequent naked black magic scenes. 'Nuff said.THE VERDICTIt reads more or less like early Stephen King, so it's a very accessible horror novel, but not nearly as polished or well-developed as King's books of the same period. The ending seems very \\"TV movie of the week\\" and the weird epilogue doesn't make much sense (okay, part of it makes sense, but the other part makes no sense, and appears to be tossed in just to make the book close out on the weirdest, most shocking note possible).Overall, Moondeath might be worth picking up for fans of werewolves and 70s/80s horror. I give it a solid 3 stars. It's a decent enough debut, and despite its many flaws, it makes me curious to check out other books by Rick Hautala.Untcigahunk - The Complete Little Brothersis supposed to be his best.OTHER EDITIONSMoondeathwas reissued in December 2011 by Evil Jester Press after being out-of-print for a few decades. Apparently, there are a lot of new typos in that edition introduced by the electronic scanning process (because that's what this book needs, more typos). Also the new cover art is pretty amateurish, but at least I can tell it's got a wolf on the cover, unlike the 1980 edition."},{"Title":"Moondeath","review":"I just recently discovered this novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is a dearth of good werewolf novels out there and this deserves to be ranked highly among them. The obvious similarity would be to \`Salem's Lot. A werewolf suddenly appears in a Peyton Place-like New England town. Of course, nobody really knows it is a werewolf - there are just unexplained deaths around each full moon. The novel takes its time building suspense and developing the relationships among all the characters of the small community.This is a well-written first novel that deals well with the concept of lycanthropy. It doesn't treat it ironically as many recent novels have. A worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Mediamorphosis: Understanding New Media (Journalism and Communication for a New Century Ser)","review":"&quot;Mediamorphosis&quot; by Roger Fidler is a breath-taking, sweeping overview of communications technologies and their impact on the media through the millenia and in the years to come. The treatment is academic and scholarly, with numerous case studies of the interaction between various media forms. Major principles guiding the evolution and evaluation of media technologies are illustrated.Ten chapters cover a wide range of issues including media evolution and convergence, media traits, digital technologies, Internet publishing, socio-political forces of control, new media experiments, virtual reality, user interactivity, and future trends. A list of acronyms and abbreviations is also included. Cited works feature &quot;InfoCulture&quot; by Steven Lubar, &quot;The Story of Language&quot; by Mario Pei, &quot;Brainframes&quot; by Derrick de Kerckhove, &quot;The Control Revolution&quot; by James Beniger, and &quot;The Gutenberg Elegies&quot; by Sven Birkerts.Roger Fidler (rfidler@saed.kent.edu) is a well-known electronic publishing visionary and practitioner. He has worked in the newspaper business for more than 34 years. He was the director of the Knight-Ridder Information Design Laboratory, founder of the PressLink online service for newspapers, and a key member of the Knight-Ridder Viewtron videotex service. Roger is currently a professional in residence at Kent State University. He is also quite active on the international conference circuit, and is a captivating speaker.Mediamorphosis, a term coined by Fidler in 1990, refers to the transformation of communication media, usually brought about by the complex interplay of perceived needs, competitive and political pressures, and social and technological innovations. Instead of studying each form separately, mediamorphosis &quot;encourages us to examine all forms as members of an interdependent system, and to note the similarities and relationships that exist among past, present and emerging forms,&quot; Fidler begins.According to Paul Saffo of the California-based Institute for the Future, new ideas take about three decades to fully seep into a culture. There are three stages of diffusion, marked by phases of excitement, penetration and standardisation.The rate of adoption of a new technology in a society, according to media scholar Everett Rogers, is determined by factors like its perceived relative advantage, compatibility with existing technologies, overall complexity, reliability, and direct observability. Additional influences, according to British academic Brian Winston, come from accelerators and brakes such as socio-economic forces and political motivation. Fidler illustrates the interplay between these various factors in the manner in which FM radio at first floundered for about thirty years before dethroning AM radio in North America within a spurt of adoption of 10 years.Based on these perspectives and his own personal insights, Fidler identifies six principles of mediamorphosis - coexistence and coevolution of media forms, gradual metamorphosis of new media forms from old ones, propagation of dominant traits in media forms, survival of media forms and enterprises in a changing environment, merits and needs for adopting new media, and delays from proof of concept to widespread adoption of new media.Fidler then classifies media forms into three domains: interpersonal, broadcast, and document (including newspapers and Web pages). He sketches the evolution of each of these forms of media through history. These media domains differ in flow and control of content, presentation, and reception constraints.According to Fidler, there are three great mediamorphoses in human communication: spoken language, written language, and the digital language. Spoken language led to social group formation, complex problem solving skills, and the development of &quot;broadcast&quot; forms like storytelling and ritual performance - which in turn divided society into performers, gatekeepers, and audiences. Written language ushered in the development of portable documents, mechanical printing, and mass media.Digital language - unlike spoken and written - enables communication between machines, and mediated communication between humans. In digital language, according to MIT's Nicholas Negroponte, human distinctions between text, images and sounds are irrelevant - they are all represented as bits. We are in the earliest stages of such transformations, says Fidler - but we can already see &quot;how computer networks using digital language are greatly extending human interactions throughout the world.&quot;Three chapters cover technological and cultural contexts of the third mediamorphosis, as well as case studies of successes and failures of new media technologies like online services. The third mediamorphosis was marked by the invention of electricity, the convergence of telegraphy and photography, electro-mechanical and electronic technologies, computers, and networks. &quot;The linking of tens of millions of individual minds through the Internet and other telecommunications systems may, indeed, be accelerating the cross impacts of emerging technologies and the development of new media,&quot; says Fidler.Accompanying socio-political forces in the U.S. over the last century have been competition between various media organisations, changes in government regulation, and increasing competition for existing advertising revenues. In such a context, early incarnations of online services like the TV-based Viewtron failed due to unrealistic expectations, misunderstood customer needs, and inertia on the part of the investors. Interactive TV, too, failed to take off as a mass market medium.&quot;Generally overlooked were the traits of the interpersonal domain - two-way, participatory, unscheduled, and unmediated,&quot; Fidler explains. &quot;Electronic mail services that combine text, graphics, voice and video will be integral to nearly all emerging forms of digital media,&quot; he predicts.Three chapters sketch out projected scenarios of mediamorphosis in the interpersonal, broadcast, and document domains in the year 2010. &quot;The Internet and consumer online networks will meld with telephone and satellite/cable-TV systems to form a seamless, global computer-mediated communication service,&quot; says Fidler. Software agents will act as personal librarians and researchers, users will interact in virtual reality systems, and concerns will arise about social fragmentation and individual privacy.Broadcasters will use the Web to broadcast to growing numbers of cybercommunities. Ethical issues will be raised over the use of sophisticated morphing technologies and the role of parental control. &quot;There is, however, one fusion that does seem all but certain - the melding of video and film,&quot; Fidler predicts.Newspapers represent the &quot;most complex as well as the most immediately challenged form within the document domain,&quot; says Fidler. They are challenged by the trend towards online publishing as well as public perceptions of waste and environmental problems. Portable digital tablets are already beginning to emerge in the form of personal gadgets like the Apple Newton and Sharp Zaurus. In the future, news may be distributed through &quot;a global network of electronic newsstands similar to automated teller machines,&quot; according to Fidler.&quot;Despite the present fascination with the apparently limitless amounts of information that can be found in cyberspace, I am convinced that manageable, branded packages of information that provide an editorial context and have a clear beginning and end will continue to be preferred by most people,&quot; says Fidler.The last chapter addresses some of the promises and challenges posed to media, audiences, educators and governments by technologies like the Internet. &quot;Governments are worrying that they will lose control over sensitive information and will be unable to monitor financial transactions across state and national borders. Parents worry that their children might be exposed to hard-core pornogrpahy and accosted by pedophiles. Already there are growing concerns that African Americans and Hispanics may be left out of the electronic loop,&quot; says Fidler. Though these are serious concerns, the truth is that &quot;societies have always been affected and transformed by new forms of media,&quot; with mixed outcomes.&quot;As the age of digital communication bursts forth, I believe the most valued characteristics of future mainstream media are likely to be their credibility and connections to the communities they serve,&quot; Fidler concludes.In sum, &quot;Mediamorphosis&quot; is a valuable, insightful piece of work for media analysts and practitioners. A list of online resources and discussion lists would have rounded off the material perfectly. There is also lit"},{"Title":"Mediamorphosis: Understanding New Media (Journalism and Communication for a New Century Ser)","review":"This is clearly the most intensive and scholarly book on the future path for newspapers.

But Fidler shows that cyberspace and technology will dramatically change the role of traditional newspapers during our next generation."},{"Title":"Mediamorphosis: Understanding New Media (Journalism and Communication for a New Century Ser)","review":"Fidler's book covers a lot of territory: he divides all of human history into three mediamorphoses, the first being speech, the second printed speech, and the third electronic speech. Along the way he covers such varied topics as the three types of communication (interpersonal, broadcast, and print), why interactive TV didn't work, implications for the future of print, and scenarios for how we will deal with information in our digital future.He's also written for a wide audience: he defines even basic terms like _personal computer_ and _mouse_ but also challenges the reader with detailed visions of new media and new lifestyles built around it. Some of the information is easily skimmed, some needs to be carefully examined and considered.Finally, he presents some interesting historical accounts of the effect of the Gutenberg printing press, early radio and television, and early interactive television.

With careful attention to that word and the 1873 authorship, this book's subject matter itself is perhaps the best book of its kind. For those intellectuals seeking guidance or mentors who seeking guidance for their mentees Hamerton's elegant writing style circa 1873 is a delight for all those who are so intrigued.Hamerton presents his thesis and personal concern using many short stories about the experience of his friends, acquaintances, and his own life. These individuals had very different beginnings in life yet found themselves on similar trajectories. Many if not most of us might (have) find this book life-changing if read seriously while young and yet edifying at any age. Hamerton gently reminds us throughout that life is short and smart people amidst their dreams often underestimate what they can do in a lifetime. Hence they often make a mess in subsequent shortfalls. As a good example of someone avoiding this consequence of haste in living thoughtfully, I found very instructive Hamerton's recounting the wisdom of his father's approach to life. Also as he wrote using the male pronoun Hamerton should be given credit as he writes for both genders (if you read carefully) explaining British culture (~1873) did not recognize female intellectualism since few young women were able to get support for such an orientation. Hamerton then observes there was no reason why women could not seek development of a higher intellect. Several of his stories were about young women.On the topic of the welfare of unmarried men, who as men found it easier to develop as intellectuals in 1873 circa Britain, he laments their frustration with finding suitable marriage prospects. These women would understand and accept their husbands' psychology and be undaunted by their often uncommon personalities. He notes the unliklihood of this type of match might lead to poor choices. Happily for Hamerton he did find just the right woman although late in life. Hamerton wrote several other equally prescient books.The type font chosen for this publishing, perhaps for economy, has a very thin letter style (ie font weight) and for me is somewhat harder to read. Otherwise this soft cover version is well-made. There are the online versions however as a bookshelf destined gift this book is a classic. There are hardcover reprints. Thus the paperback is a bargain. Otherwise it will be rare book prices for the 1873 printing. Beware there is another book of very similar title but different author. My five star rating is for the original literary work and does not reflect the quality of this particular publication."},{"Title":"Christmas Trees for Pleasure and Profit","review":"This book covers everything for prospective Christmas Tree Farm owners from how to know which land is best for your trees to marketing and selling your trees.

Behind the bar we keep several drink books, but this is the only one that actually gets used. Easy to read recipies, non-coded names for liquors, short, sweet, and to the point. Spiral binded so the book will not close while you are mixing.

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to shake, stir, or blend."},{"Title":"The Bartender's Black Book: The Drink Recipe Collection for the 21st Century, Sixth Edition","review":"I had to write a review after reading the prior one of a man in search of a picture book. There are a plethora of [bad] picture drink books on the market. It is funny, he was looking for a common thing (a [bad] picture drink book) and he got the finest drink recipe book ever written. The author painstakingly alphabetized and reworked thousands of drinks. He threw out all the [bad stuff] and made a No [fooling] essential tool, that restaurants, bars, and liquor stores must carry (they all seem to). The book is unbiased (no liquor companies pushing their product) It lays flat so I can work and read at the same time. I own a 4th, 5th and a 6th edition and I await new editions.

So I ordered it online from Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Bartender's Black Book: The Drink Recipe Collection for the 21st Century, Sixth Edition","review":"Don't know which kind of Orgasm is right for you? The Bartender's Black Book, by Stephen Kittredge Cunningham, offers no fewer than three choices. The original Orgasm (aka Burnt Almond or Roasted Toasted Almond) combines vodka, coffee liqueur and amaretto. Orgasm 2 uses triple sec and white cr&egrave;me de cacao instead of the coffee liqueur; Orgasm 3 uses Irish cream instead of the vodka. If Sex On The Beach is more your motivator, you'll be pleased to discover four varieties as you leaf through this handy, spiral-bound volume.If The Bartender's Black Book were a simple compendium of titillating or even interesting mixed drink recipes (Sex on the Sidewalk, Atomic Waste, Quaalude, Dying Nazi From Hell, Rigor Mortis, Wharf Rat, International Incident, Root of All Evil, Tongue Stroke, Wombat) it would join the ranks of dozens of other stimulating compendia; good reads perhaps, but incomplete references. The Black Book, published by the Wine Appreciation Guild, is instead a definitive professional guide, featuring over 2600 recipes for every variety of mixed drink (or drink mix), with special sections on garnishes, bar tools, a wine guide by Robert M. Parker, Jr., and anything else you need to know about drink preparation. Cunningham is a professional bartender whose penchant for detail turned him into a drink recipe collector, then into a careful professional compiler. He revises the book each year, adding dozens of new recipes, many of which continue to expand the art of nomenclature: Leg Spreader, Hot Tub, Dirty Ashtray, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Prison Bitch, Brain Tumor, Boston Massacre, Jumper Cable, Stuffed Toilet, Long Sloe Comfortable Fuzzy Screw Against the Wall with Satin Pillows the Hard Way, and whatever else the mind of man can think to drink.Cunningham covers the novelties, certainly, but he also gives us the ammunition we need to handle the basics. As an example of the care with which the Black Book has been produced, in the case of Martinis, Manhattans, Rob Roys and related spirit/vermouth mixtures, Cunningham provides bold-faced cautions: \\"DRY can mean either make drink with Dry Vermouth or less Sweet Vermouth than usual; PERFECT means use equal amounts of Sweet and Dry Vermouth; SWEET means use more Sweet Vermouth than usual; NAKED means no Vermouth at all.\\" Speaking of Martinis, Cunningham adds a useful section that cross references more than 100 Martini variants: classics like the Gimlet and the Negroni, more unusual varieties like the Maiden's Prayer and the Purple Russian. A 30-page index cross-lists every drink in the book by constituent ingredient; Amaretto, for example, is used in several hundred drinks from the Abby Road to the Zonker; Dark Rum's applications range from the American Graffiti to the infamous Zombie. There are sections explaining beer and cognac varieties, all spirits, mixers and liqueurs, and an interesting monograph on \\"Being a Good Tipper\\" (think, 20%). The beverage references are generic (i.e., \\"Coffee Liqueur,\\" rather than Kahlua or Tia Maria, \\"Orange Liqueur\\" rather than Cointreau or Grand Marnier). The result is a true resource, prized by professionals, supremely useful to amateurs with standards.By the way, I know you're wondering, but, no, I have never actually had an Orgasm, of any variety, nor do I expect to have any Orgasms in the near future. You ask why not? I'm still working through the hundred or so drinks that begin with the letter \\"A.\\" Atomic Bodyslam, anyone?(...)"},{"Title":"The Bartender's Black Book: The Drink Recipe Collection for the 21st Century, Sixth Edition","review":"This book is without a doubt the best investment I have ever made.

There are more than enough bar guides around to satisfy even the thirstiest soul, so the question becomes which one is the most helpful, the easiest to use. Well, this one has a pretty fair claim to the title.At about 4.5 inches by 9, it is of convenient, under-bar size (no bartender wants the customer to know he has to look anything up). It has some 2,700 recipes, and it takes them all with a straight face, from the utterly genteel to the impossibly vulgar (in my view, anyone who orders a German Leg-Spreader or a Duck Fart is a lout who should be flung into the street at the earliest opportunity, but that's the bouncer's job). There's an enlarged section on the martini, that greatest of cocktails, that Bogart of drinks; and sections on flavored vodkas, shooters, floaters and wines. The wine section is especially worthy of note. Bartenders used to take the approach of Tim Costello's old Manhattan saloon, which had its wine list painted on the wall. It said: \\"Red, $2.50. White, $2.50. No substitutions.\\" But times are changing and with any number of places offering wine by the glass, the able bartender has to know more than how to use a corkscrew. In this book, the wine advice comes from that demigod, Robert Parker Jr. himself. Nuff said.But the best thing about this book is that it has a comb binding--something like a spiral-wire binding, but made of plastic. It means this book, unlike all the others I've see lately, lies FLAT. No more bending the book open, flexing it until the binding cracks, and then weighting it with a beer bottle to keep the thing from flapping closed. Sometimes strokes of genius are as easy as they are rare.--Bill Marsano is an award-winning writer and editor."},{"Title":"The Bartender's Black Book: The Drink Recipe Collection for the 21st Century, Sixth Edition","review":"This book is great for bartenders, as it has about every drink imaginable.

Now, there is a resurgence of interest in this old art form of seeing the creator in these works of nature--for which this beautiful area is so famous.Congrats to Dartmouth's Bob McGrath for producing such a painstaking piece of work on this school. Also look for Catherine Crawford's book on indexing all the available paintings she could note in her book for the Forest Society.

Sounds incredulous, but that is what it purports to be, and that is exactly how it spoke to my heart. Jesus tells his story, a story that brings out his human nature so vividily, with many of the frailities that we have. For me, after reading this book Yeshua (Jesus in Aramaic), is so much more real and lovable.A must read for all who want to know the 'real' Jesus."},{"Title":"Magian Gospel of Brother Yeshua","review":"This book gave a very personable approach to the life of Yesuha, it showed him as a real person with real emotions and conflicts, and showed how he dealt with those conflicts and emotions.

It presents a much more human view of Jesus that you heard in church. I found myself saying all the way through, \\"I knew it had to be this way\\" or \\"I've always suspected that was the case\\". Don't read this book if you worship the Bible. The material is \\"channeled\\" that is: coming directly from Jesus through a channel who is the author. The original editions used a cryptogram for the authors name since he lived in a Menonite community and feared for his family's safety. Bottom line is that the book is awesome."},{"Title":"Magian Gospel of Brother Yeshua","review":"I would roughly divide this book into two types of material: the story line, and teachings. I really enjoyed the story line, and thought the author may have written a gospel that is truer than the four biggies. At the minimum, he probably filled in some gaps. As for the teachings, I felt there was too much of it in the book, and it took away from the impact of the story. If the author had just made this a story without the teaching it would have been a much better book, and also the teaching at times did not seem very enlightened at all. That will be quite apparent to you especially if you have read A Course in Miracles.If you are fascinated by the life of Jesus and you are not satisfied with the material in the new testament, this book will help you to create a more satisfying picture of the historical Jesus, or, it just may confuse the heck out of you as to what he was really like.

Another swig of this marvelous gentleman's work dries out the wet algae in my thinking.Born in 1903, Konrad Lorenz, winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine/Physiology, does not speak down to his reader. For the reader is often one who perceives the illness around him, who is already frightened by his own smallness and witnesses this waning as a root cause of our present-day world problems.This gifted scholar selects concepts from his magic bag in a manner which best describes an understanding poet or novelist: straight to the reader's heart and mind, concepts which people hold in their deepest &quot;No Admittance&quot;, but for various and often unavoidable reasons, do not express.He begins by writing truthfully that with the nuclear threat, the prospects for human survival are dismal, continuing that even if this does not occur, if somehow there is a check on human's &quot;incredibly stupid and blind conduct&quot;, he still is in grave danger of the &quot;progressive decline of those human attributes and attainments which constitute their humanity.&quot;This master animal behaviorist shares stories of Man's (and animals') pleasure in collecting -- baby fish miraculously appearing in one's aquarium, fruit in one's orchard, increase of the herd, a &quot;stock split&quot; - items which are of one kind. These, in his opinion, are more influenced by genetic programs than other kinds of joy found in possessions. But, he cites the immense danger that the greater the collection, the more intense is the desire, the urge for more. That this rage to collect can consume the personality is no secret, he wryly observes.He continues to write of the neurotic lust for power, threatening the existence of all mankind - the highest possible position in the pecking order (not sic), and the utter ridiculous sight of it.In his search into animal and human behavior, he often uses the word, &quot;Gestalt&quot;, which means the coming together of diverse impressions and memories into one formidable idea.In his twenty-five years with shamas, birds said to be the greatest &quot;artists&quot; among song birds, which species assemble beautiful, complicated songs when at play, he notes that should this bird have to defend its territory, court a mate or in any way have his song forced to serve a utilitarian purpose, the resultant stress would cause a loss of the song's awe-inspiring beauty.From birds to humans, humans have an astonishing sensitivity to harmonies, the sensory and brain structures which are the Gestalt perception, one of the most important structures of the human. We cannot inspect or see this in ourselves, but enough is known that there is no doubt that they exist, can save us from not only extinction, but from having a life &quot;not worth living.&quot; (not sic.)Excerpts:&quot;Large populations mean that there are too many voters and too few to be voted upon.&quot;&quot;Very few people, regardless of how intelligent or morally faultless they may be, are capable of preserving their whole humaneness once they are in positions of power.&quot;&quot;Many people appear to be 'normal' because the humane voice within them has been struck dumb.&quot;&quot;Thomas Jefferson lived long enough to witness and realize that freedom of the press can be exploited for the dissemination of lies.&quot;* * * * *We will not be more fearful from reading &quot;The Waning of Humaneness&quot;, for the strength of humans to bring beauty and selfless meaning to the world remains in our hands. In Lorenz's words, &quot;A closed system is a non-living system.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Waning of Humaneness","review":"This book is a scientific and spititual view of how the human species has evolved over all of time to become the frightened and violent and deceitful cariacature of his true nature. Humankind is experiencing \\"growing pains\\" that if seen and understood would change his inherited destructive attitudes for \\"solving problems\\" into truly humane solutions that would turn from a slow painful suicide to choices that will fulfill his potential and the destiny that is inherent in him. This book gives insight into this process so beautifully"},{"Title":"The Waning of Humaneness","review":"My mind was not aware that Lorenz was a prisoner of war in Russia acting as a physician from 1944 until 1948 until I saw it in this book this morning. I am 65 years old and Lorenz was still a prisoner of war when I was born. I was looking for radical ideas in The Waning of Humaneness and mainly I came up with a gestalt perception of society as a hellfire harmonica association. Societies that play with hellfire are like an individual with a harmonica that can produce a sucking sound. For me, an evil genius would be telling the truth when the whole world needs to know that its goose is cooked.No Viet Cong ever called me upright. I used to go to church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. People in Minneapolis still think I am crazy because their reality is a social context they thought I was part of, and I went to Golden Valley Health Center like a clique snapping in October, 1989, because raising 4 children in a spasmodic house was too disruptive to form the kind of adults everybody wanted my children to be. The church told me to go to the Vet Center where I was asked:What are you so uptight about?Wild geese are capable of forming pairs that can stay together for life, but as geese are domesticated, their emotions become as detached as any parasite that can pretend to bond to any situation in which it thinks its next meal is coming from whatever its feelings are attached to, or \\"imprinted\\" in one of the words I read today. Lorenz could see that youth were becoming more universal, losing regional traditions and social behaviors as the world became more plugged in to everything that happens everywhere. Truly the adults had not produced any identities that made prolonged agony in a hellfire harmonica association better than lonely parasites with money. One page has observations like \\"epidemic madness\\" and \\"Money can be quantified.\\" Economic growth has produced fantastic financial opportunities for certain manipulators even as a bottom wipe out makes those with power ready to eliminate future expenditures. We always thought we can't go on like this, and now it is truer than ever.Creative destruction is snapping cliques that used to set up governmental programs because the world will turn into chaos that can't afford to do anything except in areas that can protect their own borders from neighbors who envy their prosperity. Lorenz mentioned competition as a human trait that was able to inspire tremendous advances over the way people lived a few hundred years ago, but the pace required for getting ahead does not allow enough reflection to convince Lorenz that anyone can think of where we will all end up. There is a song called Sample In A Jar that accuses you of knowing I would soon end up with the binding belt enclosing me.Chinese Work Songs"},{"Title":"The Healing Home: Practical Ways to Harmonize Your Home and Energize Your Spirit","review":"The Healing Home Book is at long last a book that gives the reader easy to follow, effective practices to create a home filled with peace, light, happiness and love.Based on the Native Tradition of the Medicine Wheel, it allows the reader to pin-point areas of disharmony and resolve them using the power of tested and tried methods based on years of experience by the author.Learning to deal with ley lines and water lines without disturbing the harmony of the Earth is as important as clearing stuck emotional and spiritual energies within the living space in an effective and safe way.The second part of the book gives beautiful ways of re-connecting to the source and creating balance within ourselves, so we are well prepared and able to redress the balance within our living and working space.I would recommend this book to everyone who is aware of the importance of balance and harmony in the space that we inhabit, so that they can create for themselves a life filled with happiness, peace, abundance and health."},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"I've not had the pleasure of eating at El Farol but I have made several of the recipes in this fabulous book.

This is written more for those of us wishing to venture out into the territory of gourmet legends among our friends and family. I have impressed them with the recipe for pork tenderloin with plum sauce to the flavored ailoli's.

The recipes are mostly grounded in classic Spanish ingredients and flavors (chorizo, paprika, etc.), but also incorporate non-traditional flavors such as various Southwestern chiles. I recently cooked the Grilled Honey-Caper Shrimp, and Smoked Salmon Potato Cakes. Both were easy to make and delicious.If I was choosing one definitive tapas cookbook, I'd probably choose Penelope Casas' wonderful \\"Tapas: The Little Dishes of Spain\\".

Every recipe was a \\"keeper.\\" The sauces are time consuming, so if you make them in advance, you should be in good shape for a nice dinner without spending all day in the kitchen."},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"This book, \`El Farol' by Chef James Campbell Caruso contains recipes from the menu of the Santa Fe restaurant of the same name. A few restaurant cookbooks transcend their very simple objective of publicizing the restaurant. Some of the more obvious examples are \`The French Laundry Cookbook' by Thomas Keller and the \`Zuni Caf&eacute; Cookbook' by Judy Rodgers. Both take the reader far beyond simple recipes and provide either very basic insights into what makes a great restaurant or truly inspired instruction on what it takes to cross the boundary between good food and great food. While both of these cookbooks offer over the top attention to details, there are some transcendent restaurant cookbooks which succeed through simplicity, at the cost of providing instruction. The premier examples of such books are the cookbooks of Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers of London's River Caf&eacute;. If this book is to break out of it's mold as an elaborate advertisement for the El Farol restaurant, it will want to emulate these great River Caf&eacute; cookbooks.I believe this book almost succeeds in matching the quality of the Gray and Rogers books. The first thing that impressed me was the modesty of the book's author and \`sponsor', the El Farol owner David Salazar. There was no posturing, preaching about using fresh ingredients, or gratuitous photographs of strolls through the hills around Santa Fe. The next pleasant surprise was that in spite of the fact that El Farol is very close to \`Tex-Mex Central', the cuisine is almost entirely Spanish, and a fairly faithful Spanish cuisine at that. As we see in the subtitle, the cuisine also specializes in tapas. In fact, fully half of the book is dedicated to hot and cold tapas, with another full quarter of the book dedicated to sauces, flavored oils, stocks, and other pantry preparations. The scant last forty pages of the book contain main dishes and desserts.The second thing to impress me about the book was the chapter on \`El Farol Basics'. This is the kind of stuff that most authors stick at the back of the book. I am glad Caruso has gone against this trend, as this very valuable chapter may otherwise be overlooked. Among the thirty-four (34) recipes in this chapter, there is plenty of pretty familiar stuff such as aiolis, stocks, flavored oils, salsas, and vinaigrettes, but even these staples are often done with a twist. I really appreciated that the aiolis are made with mortar and pestle. Jamie Oliver may have single-handedly resurrected this simple tool, but just in case, I really like to see it used whenever possible. It is utterly simple, easy to clean, and actually produces a better result than a blender or food processor for many jobs.I have not studied Spanish cuisine as much as French and Italian, but if this book is any evidence, it seems that butter is an important ingredient at least in some regions of Spain, the world's leader in production of olive oil. There are several recipes here for flavored butters. There are also artifacts of the great Moorish influence on Spanish cooking. The book includes a recipe for preserved lemons and a Moroccan carrot sauce and the Moroccan Harissa spiced chile sauce, a very convenient intersection of old Spanish cuisine with New Mexican produce. The variety in this chapter is truly impressive, ranging from Migas (fried bread croutons) to a Spanish version of buerre blanc incorporating preserved lemons.The first chapter also introduces several pillars of Spanish cuisine, jamon Serrano, Cabrales and Manchego cheeses, the fortified wines, sherry and port, and sherry wine vinegar. I suspect true Serrano ham may be hard to find in these United States, but I believe a good prosciutto will make a decent, if not inexpensive substitute. In fact, a good Italian prosciutto may actually be less expensive than a good Serrano. This ham is so important to the Spanish cuisine, the book even offers a Jamon stock recipe. It's the rare Italian who would put her prosciutto in a stockpot.The cold tapas recipes have samples of all the different classic Spanish dishes you may expect, such as ceviches, escabeches, couscous salads, queso fresco and the very misleadingly named tortilla espanola. For anyone unfamiliar with Spanish egg dishes, a \`Spanish' omelet is not Spanish, and the Tortilla Espanola, is an omelet (actually more like a frittata), and not a tortilla. But, it is very, very good. Believe me, I have made it.The star of the hot tapas recipes is the empanadas, of which Caruso offers four different recipes. The beef and chorizo-potato fillings are expected, but the oyster and portobello fillings are something of a pleasant surprise. As I got to the end of the hot tapas, things started looking a lot like the cuisine of Spain's Italian cousins, especially in Sicily, with the grilled sardines and fried calamari.It should be no surprise at all that the star of the \`Main Courses' is the Paella, with variations using pork and spinach; poultry and seafood; and shrimp and blood sausage. The remaining dishes offer a very nice mix of shellfish, fin fish, beef, pork, duck, lamb, and quail.The desserts are all fairly easy, with a lot of flans and chocolate coming to the party. The chapter on drinks is no surprise, with several recipes for sangrias, brandy, and tequila. There is a useful short chapter on Spanish vintage and fortified (sherry) wines.The most impressive and gratifying aspect of the book is in the simplicity of the recipes, especially for tapas. I recently reviewed two books on entertaining whose recipes for \`little bites' were as complicated or more complicated than many a main dish. This alone compares it favorably to Rogers and Gray of River Caf&eacute;.This book will not replace a good book on Spanish cuisine, but at a list price under $30, it will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"El Farol is the oldest restaurant and bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Frescoes by Alfred Morang decorate the walls of the 1835 adobe. In this eclectic setting, oil paintings by Roland Van Loon dance across your vision as you take pleasure in the Spanish Cuisine.For quite some time I've wondered about using smoked paprika and Chef James Campbell Caruso uses this ingredient in many of his recipes. Have you ever wondered how to make those preserved lemons? There is a recipe with simple ingredients like sea salt, cinnamon, cloves, garlic and olive oil. Once the lemons are preserved, you store them in oil for six months to a year. The Preserved Lemon Butter Sauce calls for 1 tablespoon chopped preserved lemons. This sauce can be served over salmon.One of the most intriguing recipes is for the El Farol Pincho Spice Mix that makes use of all sorts of spices and herbs I've never blended together before like, smoked paprika and oregano. You rub the unique spices on anything you can grill.If you love blue cheese, you may want to try to find \\"Cabrales.\\" Most of the recipes do use readily available ingredients although you may have to hunt for saffron in your grocery store or order it online.Recipes you may enjoy:Lemon-Rosemary Flan - the El Farol's biggest-selling dessertMarscarpone-Stuffed Figs and Dates - sprinkled with pistachios and arranged with orange slices.Grilled Artichokes in Saffron ButterBeef Empanadas - a masa harina/flour based dough filled with spicy turkey filling.Grilled Artichokes in Saffron Butter - one of the most popular tapas (small, savory Spanish dishes)The picture in this book that made me terribly hungry was the Ensalada de Uvas con Queso.

I had wondered about using the small balls of mozzarella and here is the recipe.Pantry items you may need include: sherry vinegar, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, sea salt, sweet smoked paprika, Mexican oregano, saffron, star anise, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, olive oil, masa harina, raisins and of course, lots of fresh garlic.Growing fresh herbs is optional and rosemary is one of the herbs I still need to plant this year. Once it is planted, I'm making the Lemon-Rosemary Flan. I have a feeling we will be eating a little better this summer than last! The food in the El Farol cookbook is comforting, delicious and at times a little exotic. Fortunately dried figs are not difficult to find and most of the spices can be found at the grocery store or here at Amazon.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"I am living in Italy, close to Parma, so I am used to good cooking and food. When I buy El farol I wish to learn to cook some spanish dishes, but what I have found is more. Recepies are written in an easy way, step by step, and it is impossible to make a mistake. There are a lot of suggestions and I have immediatly tried to cook Caldo Pescado and Gambas al Alcaparra.There is a lot of living joy in this book"},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"As a former resident of the beloved Santa Fe, one of the things I miss most about it is the food. A no other restaurant ranks higher on my list than that of El Farol. The food is superb! Executive Chef Caruso pays extra attention to their famous, mouth-watering tapas. It has been a long awaited arrival for this book and it's about damn time. I can only hope to rekindle some of my fondest memories by attempting to recreate his masterpieces in my own kitchen. If you take pleasure in dining on Spanish cuisine, I implore you to buy this book. I, personally, am excited to add it to my collection of cookbooks.Oh and one more suggestion, I recommend the fried avocado (a.k.a. aquacate). It's delectable, although not nearly as pretty as when it is served at the restaurant. I, however, am not a culinary artist nor even close to being a chef."},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"After a trip to Spain in September, I had a serious urge to create a tapas dinner for some friends and family, and needed some inspiration and guidance. A simple Amazon search led me to this book, and the reviews were all so positive that I had to buy it. They weren't wrong.From the very first recipes (which, interestingly, are the mise-en-place recipes that are so often found in the back of books) to the \\"big guns\\" in the entree section, the recipes are simple (a hallmark of Spanish cuisine), easy-to-follow, and easy to alter based on the seasons or your local ingredients. It's a rare cookbook in that it's written so that beginners can cook every recipe, and yet advanced cooks don't feel insulted or talked down to.As with most Spanish food that I've encountered, the simplest recipes often yield the most delicious flavors, and that's the case here. Few recipes contain more than 10 ingredients, with most averaging around 5-7 (and that's including salt and pepper), but they're combined in ways that you may not have thought of, like the Gambas al Alcaparra - shrimp with honey and capers.The #1 hits? The Puerco con Manzanas y Cabrales (pork loin with apples and blue cheese), Albondigas (lamb meatballs), Gambas al Ajillo (garlic shrimp in lime juice)... I'm hungry again.And for an extra-special twist, the desserts aren't just cast-offs, half-assedly strewn together by a chef who knows nothing about pastries. They're delicious, creative, and replicatable.Even if you can't cook, buy the book just for the pictures - frameworthy, each and every one."},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"Inspired by a recent vacation in Andalucia, near Jerez, I wanted to prepare a tapas meal for a friend's birthday. This cookbook was excellent - I was able to pick out several recipes for small dishes that were all easy to prepare and delicious.The Grilled Artichokes in Saffron Butter were a huge hit, and the remaining butter sauce was very popular on bread. The Ginger Fig Puree was wonderful with grilled pork ribs. Also popular was the Chicken with Harissa, and the fish I prepared using the grilled sardine recipe. Unable to find a \\"flavorful small fish\\" at my local supermarket, I chose a mundane cod filet, which I cut into small pieces to be eaten in a tapas style, and prepared according to the recipe. This has now become my standard recipe for any type of white fish, as it is simple and delicious.I love reading this cookbook for inspiration. I started a jar of El Farol Preserved Lemons, and can't wait to start using them when they have aged. I have yet to try the dessert recipes, which are very tempting. Having executed several recipes successfully, I feel very confident that even the first time I try another, I will be able to serve it to my guests to rave reviews.James Campbell Caruso has shared with us some wonderful ideas and recipes on how to add great flavor to food in a straight-forward fashion that a home cook will have no problem understanding or recreating."},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"El Farol is a favorite restaurant in our family.

I'm always looking for something different. And this book brings a high level of intense flavors to the table. If you love spices you'll love this. I've never been to the restaurant but after having this book..I'm ready want to go to the restaurant! Excellent soup stock made with fennel and cloves, roasted chicken with clove, Sweet Pea soup with smoked paprika oil, spicy Harissa sauce, pickled lemons and Rosemary flat bread. The Rosemary flan is exquisite! Book is on nice glossy paper. Recipes are laid out well and will motivate you to try the recipes. Numerous pictures in book but not on all recipes.Instructions on how long you can keep sauces are very helpful. I got this book because there were alot of raving reviews on this book. And today I add one more 5 stars to this book's buckle. I salute you El Farol!"},{"Title":"El Farol: Tapas and Spanish Cuisine","review":"Tried the Lavender Goats Milk Flan on page 165 last night. Ever had an epic fail in the kitchen? Well, this was one for the history books! First, the instructions to make the caramel are incomplete, so if you don't know better, this sauce will never turn out. Secondly, the quantity of lavender in the recipe is suspect. It says to use 1/2c of dried or 1/4c of fresh. Generally when using herbs, the reverse is true because dried herbs are more potent. (I used dried) Regardless, the custard turned a Grinch-like green color, and the flavor was overpoweringly strong. One bite was enough. It was like eating potpourri, or biting into a scented Yankee Candle. Not very appealing! I'm glad I tried this recipe for all of the laughs I got from making such a hideous dessert! :) I will, however, try it again using far less lavender as I still feel it has potential!The Goat Cheese Dressing on page 61 is DA BOMB! My favorite new dressing/dip. The Romesco sauce page 30 is really good too, very versatile."},{"Title":"Dodge Dynasty: The Car and the Family That Rocked Detroit","review":"Having read several of the major histories of Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company, I bought this book (used) looking for the same about the Dodge Brothers. Although not exactly what I expected, the first part of the book offered enlightening information about just how much the Dodge Brothers were responsible for Henry Ford's success and what a direct role the brothers played in the actual manufacture of Ford's early automobiles including the Model T. The remainder of the book is a fascinating tale of a totally dysfunctional family that took the huge sums of money that the brothers made on their own, as Ford contractors, and through the sale of their interest in the Ford Motor Company. None of the brothers' progeny and their many spouses and children ever accomplished anything worthwhile, and were -- in part by the brothers' design and the custom of the time -- incapable of producing anything or even managing the vast Dodge fortune properly. This book should be required reading for anyone who hasn't yet learned that money can't buy happiness."},{"Title":"Dodge Dynasty: The Car and the Family That Rocked Detroit","review":"Dodge Dynasty: The Car and the Family That Rocked DetroitThis book is an unknown Gem........I find the history of the Dodge Brothers endlessly fascinating. The story of the birth of Detroit's Auto Industry, the intrigues and power struggles, the incredible eccentric personalities such as the Doge boys, and Henry Ford. They all come together in this well written biography. I'm a lifelong admirer of all things mechanical, especially automobiles and the men that invented them. As far as I am personally concerned, the book \\"Dodge Dynasty,\\" is surely a five star winner."},{"Title":"City Police (An incredible insight into a cop's world. Tough, brutal-a masterpiece!)","review":"Despite the fact that this book was published 20 years ago, the insights Rubinstein provides from this in-depth examination of policing are still relevant. Rubinstein begins with the origins of policing and moves through a variety of elements pertaining to police work including territorial knowledge, how the police gather information, and even police corruption. Highly recommended for those interested in a career in policing or for police enthusiasts."},{"Title":"City Police (An incredible insight into a cop's world. Tough, brutal-a masterpiece!)","review":"I read this book for a college seminar and found it realistic and honest. The author describes the daily life of police officers in the city of Philadelphia in the 1970's. We get a feel for what it is like to be an everyday patrolman; you have power and responsibility, you are feared by some, respected by many, hated by others. We see how cops alter their law enforcement style to fit the neighborhood standards, and how some officers are jerks while others have big hearts. We also see what risks cops look for (and those they basically ignore), how they gather information, etc.This book is a bit dated, and the author never mentions Frank Rizzo, then the city's controversial police commissioner (and later its Mayor). Still, this is a realistic book, drawn from the author having spent countless hours talking and riding with Philadelphia patrolmen. This is good reading for anybody interested in learning more about law enforcement."},{"Title":"Listen, prophets!!","review":"It's hard to find direction in life when you have the gift of prophecy. This book answered many of my questions plus gave me direction as to what lies ahead for me. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"They Came To a River","review":"I love this book. Years ago I read my mother's copy, and thenrecently ordered my own. It was definitely worth it! &quot;They CameTo A River&quot; by Allis McKay spans the early 1900s - before, during, and just after WWI. It centers around the character Christine Hallowell and her life on the upper Columbia River in Washington State during the apple boom. The first half of the book is about Chris's childhood and adolescence. It focuses on her family life with her parents, two brothers, and little sister. Chris's father is the local pastor, who holds services every week at the schoolhouse. He also runs the ferry on that part of the river, where he transports people back and forth. Many people come into Chris's life, and they all affect her in some way. Life on the river is hard. There are blistering summers and freezing winters. Through it all is the &quot;merciless river&quot; itself. At 17 years, Chris marries Nathan Barnes, a young man whose family owns a large apple orchard across the river. They didn't plan to marry that soon, but necessity brings it about, and they are desperately in love. Most of the second half of the book focuses on Chris and Nate's married life, raising their children, their struggle to bring the orchard into bearing, dealing with pests that threaten the crops, irrigation, etc. Then Chris suffers a terrible, heartbreaking loss, but she &quot;never wavers from her purpose.&quot; The river has shaped her; she endures. As her father says at the end of the book: &quot;There is room in this valley for every man who isn't afraid to spend himself. All my life I have seen them come - the young, the poor, the weak, the strong, the adventurous, the brave, the misfits, the men with fortunes, the men with empty hands. They came to a river, and the river shaped their lives; it showed them the pattern of fulfillment; it was a sign set by God in this wilderness, and they followed it and were content.&quot; This is a wonderful book. If anyone actually reads this review, please take the time to find a copy of this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"They Came To a River","review":"I first encountered this book when I was in high school, read it and loved it, though on a fairly superficial level. Later I obtained a copy for myself, have reread it numerous times, and find it has stood the test of time. Each time I read it, it reveals new depths. The characterizations are excellent but it is the landscape and, above all, the descriptions of the river and its importance in the lives of the people who settled around it which stick in the mind long after the book is finished. This book needs to be brought back into print so it can be enjoyed by a new generation of readers. It is a classic of Pacific Northwest writing."},{"Title":"They Came To a River","review":"The author has written books that I am keeping and have read and will re-read again. I have re-read Women at Pinecreek several times. I just bought They Came to a River and reading it. I will be re-reading it again as well. I am purchasing her Goodbye Summer and will read and keep it with these. I love her style of writing (reminds me of Laura Ingalls Wilder) and the memories and events that unfold to tell the character's stories. The characters come and go in the stories and sometimes reappear later, to tie together people and events. The stories cover a span of many years and so you learn and discover along with the characters about life, family and nature and the land of apple growing, the hardships and successes of those pioneers."},{"Title":"Surviving the Storms: Memory of Stalin's Tyranny","review":"An insightful account of life during the Soviet Period. The authour, Helen Dmitriew, shares how her love for God and family helped her through this very difficult time. After reading this book, it is diffcult to compare today's easy times with the brutal realities that faced our parents and grandparents during the first half of this century."},{"Title":"The Media at War: Communication and Conflict in the Twentieth Century","review":"Ms. Carruthers has put together an invaluable resource for anybody interested in the interaction of media, governments and militaries during times of war and conflict. In looking back at what I've just read, I find that I've underlined and highlighted passages throughout the book for future reference. Those who study the topic in detail (or just want to learn more after reading this book) will find the bibliography extremely useful. I've added a dozen more titles to my list of &quot;must-read&quot; books thanks to her exhaustive research. The book is also very well organized and written, covering the topic using the full spectrum of war -- from total war to terrorism -- which is much more useful than a simple chronoligical view often found in histories of this type. Overall, Ms. Carruthers has written an important book that adds significantly to the scholarly work in this field. As one who works with both the international media and militaries from several nations, this book has earned a spot on the top of the reference pile sitting on my desk and will undoubtedly be worn out in short order."},{"Title":"The Media at War: Communication and Conflict in the Twentieth Century","review":"As someone who has worked in the media covering conflict, Ms. Carruthers has written a book which opened a new dimension for me on \\"Media at War\\". She avoids glorifying war and exposes how even the most well meaning objective journalist is co-opted by governments in covering conflicts. It seems inevitable that journalists covering conflict become, knowingly or not, proponents of war.This book is an essential read for any journalist covering war or other conflict."},{"Title":"When the Sparks Fly: Resolving Conflicts in Your Organization","review":"Author takes a total view of organizational issues that confront companies and reduces the solution process into an understandable, practical, and systematic way to overcome problems. Arnold's years of experience implementing his techniques are specific highlights that bring life to the information. A &quot;must&quot; if you want to take the easier, softer road to problem resolution and positive results. Highly recommended and worth finding."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"When I met John D. (as his friends called him) at the Karamursel Air Force Base in 1964, he had already been in Turkey for 6 years and was quite familiar with Turkish way of life. Having studied Latin, French and German and taught speech at the University of Notre Dame, he learned Turkish quickly. His passion for archeology motivated him to travel extensively in Turkey and visit the many ancient Greek and Roman sites there. As a bachelor he engaged himself in night life where he met interesting people, experienced local customs and became an expert (Saki) in drinking RAKI. An empathetic character, John D. had the innate talent to get along with people. He was a perfect diplomat with a charming smile, intelligence, humility (rare in those days for an American in Turkey) and a scholarly knowledge about practically everything. As an expert bridge player with capacity to drink anyone under the table, he was very popular in social circles. My brief friendship with him ended in 1965 when I left Turkey for an assignment in Canada. As a Turk I loved the book. It was a joy to read it. Thanks to &quot;Scotch and Holy Water&quot; I learned more about ancient history, Greek and Roman mythology and places I have not yet visited in Turkey. My Scottish wife who has been to Turkey several times and is very knowledgeable about Turkish culture also loved it. John D's humor, wit and description of Turks and American alike were just hilarious. When I read about my former colleagues Yuksel Enginsu, Bertram Crane, Kemal Simsek and John Hicks, it evoked so many fond memories of my days in Turkey. More than anything else in this book, as in life, John D. illustrates his deep understanding and respect for Turks and their culture. Anyone who has any interest in or connection to Turkey should read his insightful book. I was deeply saddened to learn that John David Tumpane, a truly Renaissance Man, died in October 1997. Muharrem Sev (Istanbul native), still residing in Ottawa, Canada (Sep 3, 1999)"},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"For perspective, I was 2 years old when John D met me and 12 years old the last time I saw him. As for the book, it's all true, and couldn't have been better said. I recall my father (Art) and mother (Mim) coming back from the evening excusions John D. and the others would go on and how the laughing never stopped. Like other readers comment, it all needs to be put in perspective. I recently loaned the book to an associate who just returned from Izmir...the book has yet to be returned. They're making another trip and have commented toward the value the book has offered in understanding the people and places. Like the many of us who endured there for over 10 years, as the book prefaces the subject, you begin to understand the people, like the people and land, and never want to leave...yearning periodically to consider a return trip.I recommend the reading of this book...it's well worth the time...it'll make you laugh..consider, the literal interpretations that can only exist..."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"My husband and I first moved to Izmir, Turkey in 1996 and we both read \\"Scotch and Holy Water\\". We were still living in a hotel and had not yet experienced the country and very little of the people. I laughed through the whole thing and couldn't wait to see the places he wrote about. I read it again about two years later, we were still there, and it was even better. I couldn't believe how true the book was. It was like he was writing our story. Even forty years later not much was different. We did not live on a military compound and ended up moving to a very small village outside the city. We are very adventurous people with little fear of what kind of trouble we may get into getting lost. And we were lost MANY times!!! Learning the language was very important to really enjoy it. The people are wounderful and warm. Everyday there was something new that would crack us up. They have a very different type of logic. We will go back again one day.I highly recomend Scotch and Holy Water even if you have no interest in Turkey. It is a great Read. He did a great job of bring out the realness of the country and the everyday living of the people as Turks and foriegners."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"John was a special friend of mine and we shared our joy of traveling in Turkey and environs as well as other pastimes such as playing bridge, putting together jigsaw puzzles, trying different restaurants - most anything was an adventure with him. I have owned many copies of Scotch and Holy Water. It seems everytime I loaned someone a copy I never saw it again. When John sent me my current copy some time ago, he inscribed it with words to the effect of not returning it to rightful owner could result in penalty of death. That copy is still in my possession. John was a highly intelligent man who delighted in the world around him, wherever he was. I last saw him in Walnut Creek, California shortly before his death.

Tumpane, is a charming account of the adventures of a fun-loving group of American ex-pats in Turkey in the late 1950s and 1960s.John D was a graduate of Yale who went to Turkey with his family's engineering business. I grew up around John D, and he was always a positive influence on me and the other kids around him. John D adored life and travel and language and people. He traveled extensively around Turkey, learned to speak Turkish quite well, and seemed to rejoice in exploring the Turkish culture.John D often wrote short stories and \\"Scotch and Holy Water\\" is the book that grew from his collection of hilarious stories. He wrote lovingly about both the Turks and the American ex-pats. His writing describes the uniquely Turkish spirit of hospitality and joy of life. When he writes about the Americans, he emphasizes the exploration and fun. John D doesn't cover up the foibles of the Americans there in Turkey, but he does treat them gently and with kindness. Having grown up in the places and times he describes, I can attest to both the accuracy and the gentleness in John D's writing.\\"Scotch and Holy Water\\" is full of good deep laughs from this earlier time of innocence."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"This is an outstanding and hillarious recollection of a man's adventures from his 10 years in Turkey.

It is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"I found myself in Adana, Turkey in November, 1979, as a US Air Force lieutenant with the614th Tactical Fighter Squadron. As the recent emigrant of an Illinois farm town of about 1000 people, my total out-of-country experience had consisted of two weeks in Canada, and about three weeks in Spain, enroute to Turkey.We happened to arrive in Turkey just as the Iranians were seizing U.S. hostages in Tehran, Iran, putting the final stake through the heart of Jimmy Carter's presidency. Our squadron of old F-4D Phantom IIs, worn out over the jungles of Viet Nam, were the closest U.S. forces to the crisis. For a month, we sat on varying degrees of alert. During that month, I fell in love with Turkey, a country I then knew of chiefly through the then-recent movie &quot;Midnight Express.&quot;As luck would have it, I was able to visit Turkey many more times through the 1980s. Each time, I found the Turkish people to be more interesting, more hospitable and generous, and more complex. The country was and is a contrast in opposites, wealth vs. poverty, technology vs. ignorance, secularism vs. religious conservatism, and a liberal democracy sprouting out from underneath an ever-vigilant, and occasionally repressive, army. No matter whom I met, the Turkish had a more definable national character than any North American or European people I had ever met or would meet. They always were generous to those who showed the slightest interest in their culture, their language, or their rich history.John Tumpne's book, &quot;Scotch and Holy Water&quot; is a cult classic among Americans who have met Turkish people and culture, and have liked both. The book consists of a series of vignettes from the author's personal experiences as a contractor for the U.S. Air Force in Turkey during the 1950s and early 1960s. Having been dragged there by an older, more successful brother, the parallels of the author with Mark Twain (and the book's with &quot;Roughing It&quot; or &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;) are always present, although in a more modern context. Tumpane has a very clear and concise writing style, although not nearly so severe as Hemingway's, yet conveys much more &quot;presence&quot; and an almost poetic description of day-to-day life in modern Turkey, which dwarfs any James Michener novel. Tumpane often resembles a 20th-Century Clemens in his narrative of the ordinary, giving insights typical of &quot;Following the Equator.&quot;If you would like to understand daily life in modern Turkey, or the life of American expatriates in out-of-the-way countries, or just escape and have a lot of good laughs along the way, &quot;Scotch and Holy Water&quot; is a great read.Thomas Clar"},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"A must read for anyone who has lived or is living in Turkey.

Often leaving the Base and riding into the countryside. Hitching a ride when some people would take me further.So when I read this book, it was intriguing to learn more about what was still going on the first and second time I was in Turkey. Especially the Driving Rules of Turkey.Also being stationed in Izmir for 6 months and getting down to Ephesus and House of the Vigin Mary by Turkish buslines ... interesting !!!In 1986, I got orders for Incirlik AB, again. Only this time, I bought a CJ-7 jeep, 20 days before I shipped out. Cause I knew, Turkish roads had potholes, that could swallow up a VW bug, easily. My CJ-7 jeep arrived in Turkey with 1409 miles on the odometer. About 18 months later on a 27 month tour, the Jeep had over 36,000 miles on it.Returning to Ephesus, by Jeep and back to Incirlik on a three week journey. Discoverying that the Houses had been uncovered and other things, too.The Officers House Wives, asked me to revise a book, \\"Castles, Cay and Caravanserai\\" which was first written in 1976, revised in 1961 and my revised in 1986, just to get the Americans off the base and look at the history around them. But most Americans who brought cars there, only stayed on base until it was time to ship out their cars or sell them to someone else.By the time my Jeep got shipped out, it had over 48,000 miles on it.Was there nothing to do in Turkey? You be the judge.But Scotch and Holy Water was a major part of my decision to return to Turkey with something better than a 10 speed bike, just to get around in and enjoy what John D described in his Scotch and Holy Water book.I understand John D was producing his second addition to Scotch and Holy Water book, when he suddenly died ...

The short stories are ones anyone can relate to that has visited a foreign country for any extended time period. Read the book, go to Turkey or vice versa. Unless you are narrow minded and demand other countries to be as 'enlightened' as the US you'll appreciate all of what Turkey has to offer."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"I recall the many Americans living in Izmir, serving NATO or supporting those in NATO, that made it their daily routine to leave home, walk to the American Post Office, the PX/BX, maybe visit some other American facility, then back home, complaining about being in Turkey the entire time. They spent miserable lives the entire time they lived there. My wife and I determined that we would not be that way. We traveled and associated with the local people and had a thoroughly wonderful time with a thoroughly wonderful people. The Tumpane company was still providing services for the American community when I arrived and John Tumpane was a legend. I did not discover his book until I had been there for over two years. When I did, I laughed, and nodded my head, \\"Yes\\" on almost every story. He ability to take the daily affairs of life an American in Turkey and make the reader laugh is amazing. As another reviewer said, he is very much reminiscent of Mark Twain. I highly recommend this to anyone that lived of visited in Turkey, or wish they could. Even after living there six years, we wanted to stay, but Uncle Sam said I had been promoted out of a job and had to return to the U.S. When people would ask my why I wanted to return, I could point them to this book and let them find out for themselves. I considered Izmir and life in Turkey one of the best kept secrets in the U.S. military. Had all new arrivals read Scotch and Holy Water, they may have been inspired to get out and live a fuller life among the Turks, a most friendly and kind people."},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"I served in the Navy in Europe from 1985 to 1991. The last two were at NATO in Naples. I was actually expected to be prepared to cover three \\"wartime\\" billets - one in northern Italy, one in Dyarbakir, and one in Eski'ehir. I never knew that I would end up going to Turkey 19 times between March of 89 and June of 91.When I first showed up in Naples, the guy I was relieving handed me a copy of this book. I read it, and like may others, laughed out loud at many passages. When I finished it, I went out and bought a copy for myself and one for my Dad back home in New England. It is a timeless book. I consider it the equal of Luigi Barzini's \\"The Italians\\" and \\"The Europeans.\\" Like those books, this book was still current in 1989 through 1991 in my visits to Eski'ehir, Ankara, Diyarbakir, Antalya, Istanbul, and Izmir.My late father and I bonded over this book. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Scotch and Holy Water","review":"I purchased \\"Scotch & Holy Water\\" Oct 2002 and am currently reading it for the 3rd time.

No more pressure, no more guilt trips about why I am not (overseas, doing this, that, whatever). Backed up by scripture, packed with wisdom, help determine what you are good at and how to identify what God has in store for you with confidence. A must read for anyone either thinking about missions, career, confused, or feeling pressure to do something you are not comfortable with."},{"Title":"When God Becomes My Enemy: The Theology of the Complaint Psalms","review":"This book is a published dissertation, which is naturally written by a neophyte scholar, that still has merit. Most Christians will not find this book appealing, given its scholarly tone; however, its conclusion must be grasped by all Christian. Floysvik demonstrates that the Complaint Psalms have a common theme that should inform our lives: \\"Faith sticks to God's self revelation in the midst of conflicting evidence\\" (176). In essence, these Psalmists, who are in the midst of difficult situations that should cause them to doubt God's love for them, still believe in and appeal to God's love for them despite what circumstances tell them. This makes them very much like the pilgrims in Hebrews, who must not shrink back but have faith; a faith that is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.Further, Floysvik argues that these psalmists portray a prayer life that desires to persuade (not coerce) God to change their adverse circumstances for the better; an appeal based primarily on God's promises and covenantal love. They do not believe that their fate is stagnant, something to endure; God can intervene and rescue them.It is not necessary to get bogged down in Floysvik's doctoral exercise. To get a quick, yet helpful, grasp of his thesis, one can read each of the four translated psalms that Floysvik examines, and the last two or three pages of each respective chapter that focus on the Psalms' problem, prayer, and appeal. Next, read chapter seven in its entirety and the book's conclusion.God's hesed [love] is an everlasting and inherent outflow of his essence, his wrath is temporary."},{"Title":"Europe Of The Dictators 1919-1945","review":"There is a mountain of books on the First World War and two more mountains of works on the Second World War. By comparison there are far less out there on the interwar period. And what is there seems to mainly concentrate on the failed Weimar Republic. This book - which I was lucky enough to pick up disgustingly cheaply 2nd hand - was perfect for filling in my knowledge of the politics of the interwar period. It really delves into the characters and personalities of the different players and the French/German political interplay was well covered. You'd probably have to read this book a few times if you were a serious student of this period as there is a heck of a lot of information in these pages, the author certainly has managed to pack a punch while at the same time avoiding the book feeling like a catalogue of times, dates and quotations.All up I would heartily recommend this book to anybody who wants something broader than just a book on how Hitler or Mussolini came to power as this work covers the entire period and manages to show how fluid the situation was apt to be in the troubled two decades between the First & Second World Wars."},{"Title":"Blood Lust: Conversations With Real Vampires","review":"This is such an interesting subject matter, but there are not many books about it. If you just have a curiosity about vampires, I suppose it's a good source. The writing style, however, is no better than a third grader's, and makes the reading difficult at times."},{"Title":"Gang Nation: Delinquent Citizens In Puerto Rican, Chicano, And Chicana Narratives","review":"Gang Nation is an exemplary counter hegemonic text that unveils how the intersected force of race, class and gender oppression (as a neocolonial matrix) drive the racialized panoptic and carceral regimes of the United States. Given how Latina/o youth like African American are demonized and then converted through the \\"justice\\" system into abjects and throwaways this study reveals how poor Latina/o youth negotiate institutional violence on a daily basis for survival. Through Browns illumination of the complexity, eloquence and poltics of self-representation in Latina/o gang narratives and autobiographies, we get a picture of the results of extreme poverty, urban decay, trauma, and neocolonial racism on these kid's struggle for empowerment and survival. Part of what is also crucial about Browns study is the willingness to critique and condemn the \\"normalization\\" of sexual violence against women and girls \\"in the hood\\" and shows how patriarchal norms of the dominant culture are re-articulated in non-dominant communities. In this regard the read of Luis Rodriguez's Always Running and the chapter \\"American She\\" which examines the fetishization of Chicanas in gang in the media is useful and politically cogent. Furthermore as a text for classroom use, it is surprisingly jargon free and at the same time a theoretically nuanced and complex read of the historic, insitutional and everyday forces that criminalize and violate Latina/o youth. A must read.....!!!."},{"Title":"Gang Nation: Delinquent Citizens In Puerto Rican, Chicano, And Chicana Narratives","review":"Brown's book undertakes an important analysis of gang literature and representation, but the use of the concept &quot;gang nation&quot; is, in my opinion, questionable. For a more grounded account of gangs, I recommend that people read this book along side Miranda's Homegirls in the Public Sphere, Kontos' Gangs and Society, and work by Vigil and Moore. Good work overall!"},{"Title":"Internet Book","review":"He's the leader in his field. I've used his books for teaching and as referrals.

I started to read the book in small parts in order to understand only particular chapters, but it is so readable that I read it from the first chapter to the last. In fact, I read over 100 pages in one sitting--something that normally I can do with someone like John Gresham or Tom Clancy, not an author of computer networking. This is a great book for anyone who wants to understand data networking and the Internet. It covered the entire subject without using words like ethernet, token ring or frame-relay"},{"Title":"Internet Book","review":"Douglas Comer has an amazing ability to cut through the heavy fog that surrounds Internet technology. Many well trained and accomplished academics are terrible writers. I have wasted much money buying from these authors. I have read Douglas Comer's many books from detailed implentation of TCP/IP to overview of computer networks and internet. I am not surprised by the excellent quality of this book. I will buy any book anytime that Dr. Comer writes. I think this all the result of his pioneering reseach and great desire to teach."},{"Title":"Internet Book","review":"Well, not a bad book. But it deals with pretty elementary concepts and spends too much time in history (though some people may like it, I was annoyed). Mostly, there are too many words than information.If you are completely new to internet and wan to make some background for a serious start [or if you like reading for the sake of reading:-)] this may suit you."},{"Title":"Internet Book","review":"Based on the glowing praise of previous editions of this book and reviews of this book I purchased. I am very new to networking and was very excited to purchase based on all the outstanding reviews.Unfortunately I am disappointed overall. While the author does have a very good way of presenting the information and provides tremendous analogies to illustrate concepts, there really is no \\"meat\\" to the book. I found myself excited to grasp the basic idea of each chapter only to be disappointed that the author does not take it further. It really does not teach you how things work. It is too much of an overview. I would also agree with other reviews that there is a lot of useless historical info that is very interesting but is really just filler.At $50+, this book really does not deliver on the expectation. The authors writing style and examples are excellent but the ultimate information content is lacking. At the end I found myself with far more questions than I had before reading it. Unless you are extraordinarily new to computers I think readers will find this to be a disappointment."},{"Title":"Internet Book","review":"Although initially frightened by all the acronyms surrounding the Internet and its language, I was put as ease while reading Comer's book. I found that it was written for a person like myself. I have some amount of knowledge of how the Internet and other systems work, but I am a typical user of computer applications and am happy when my machine gives me the information I ask of it. Required reading in a college class is often the only reading I've done for the past seven years. I used to be a reader who read for many reasons. Some days I wanted to be transported away into a science fiction novel. Other days I wanted to live the life of another while reading a fascinating piece of fiction. Sometimes, due to necessity, I read a non-fiction work in order to educate myself just in case I need to know something. Upon picking up Comer's book, I felt that I didn't really need to know much about the Internet. However, after reading, I find that my curiosity was aroused. In fact, Comer dedicates the book to \\"Everyone Who Is Curious.\\" I became one of these people. Comer's writing was a highlight of the book. The complex became simple in regards to understanding the inner-workings of different systems. I found this book to be a perfect companion for the class as it helped me understand a number of concepts in theories that I simply could not understand no matter how many people explained it in the weekly postings. While reading reviews about the book from an Internet book supply company, many critics are not bashful in their feeling that Comer spent too much time relating the history of the Internet to the reader. I wholeheartedly disagree with these critics and found that the history of the Internet had to be explained in order to fully understand why certain features of the Internet and its accompanying systems are in existence today. The book seemed to be quite simply a recap of all that has led up to today's modern systems. LANs, WANs, and other acronyms had to be explained for the Internet novice. Comer did an excellent job of introducing these areas and their relation to where we are today in regards to technology. Others may have wanted him to be somewhat controversial in his interpretations of where the Internet will lead us. For those people, I would suggest another text. For a person like myself, this text was near perfection. There is only major problem that I did have with Comer's book. With my limited knowledge does come some understanding of today's Internet markets. I believe that if Comer would have mentioned a few prominent companies while explaining certain aspects of the Internet, the book may have been easier to read. I found myself writing questions on the margins such as, \\"Is this what Netscape is?\\" His only mentioning of some real world company was of Purdue University. It is only as I write my response to this question that I read that he is a professor at that University. I'm not sure why companies would refuse to give permission for Comer to name them while explaining certain areas. One would think that free publicity is always welcome. I'm not sure if Comer is well known throughout the Internet world. Perhaps he is some type of radical that companies fear. Either way, it would have been easier to understand some concepts if the reader could relate them to aspects in the real world."},{"Title":"Internet Book","review":"This book was required reading for an MBA class.

These figures include -- among others -- Albert Jay Nock (who was in fact regarded as a &quot;leftist&quot; for part of his career), H.L. Mencken, Frank Chodorov (born Fishel Chodorovsky -- did you know that? I didn't), Garet Garrett (author of _The Driver_, which Raimondo argues may have been an important unacknowledged source for Ayn Rand's ATLAS SHRUGGED), John T. Flynn (who among other things wrote a scathing expose of Roosevelt and the &quot;New Deal&quot;), Rose Wilder Lane (author of _The Discovery of Freedom_), and Isabel Paterson (author of _The God of the Machine_ and the former guru of Ayn Rand).Raimondo also discusses the hijacking of the Right by Bill Buckley and the neoconservatives, doing a much better job than Rand did in her little puff piece, &quot;Conservativism: An Obituary.&quot; In fact Raimondo is careful to acknowledge all the genuine conservatives Rand left out of her &quot;obituary&quot;; rather than simply declaring conservatism dead, as Rand did, Raimondo wants to recover it from the people who almost destroyed it in favor of militaristic Statism.Raimondo also discusses some genuine contemporary conservatives, including the late great Murray Rothbard (Raimondo is also the author of a soon-to-be-published biography of Rothbard), and provides a ringing defense of Pat Buchanan against a number of unfair attacks -- though he also harshly criticizes Buchanan's stand against free international trade. (The back of the book features an endorsement from Buchanan, by the way -- a little tribute to the intellectual integrity of both men.)His remarks on Rand will also be of interest to bemused watchers of the &quot;Objectivist&quot; movement. Despite some obvious respect for her talents as a novelist (he thinks, and I agree, that _The Fountainhead_ was her best work and ATLAS SHRUGGED was pretty kludgy), he does not spare the rod as regards her pretensions of originality, her claim to stand within no pre-existing tradition whatsoever, her intellectual fraud in each of these respects, her failure to give proper credit even to those of her forebears who were directly influential on her thought (Isabel Paterson being the primary example), and her endorsement of several policies that would have been anathema to the Old Right. I suspect that Raimondo would be happy -- and I know I would -- if Rand were publicly exposed as a pretentious, pseudophilosophical, cult-mongering fraud, discredited as a representative of the classical-liberal Right, and recognized as the &quot;leftist&quot; she really was. (And any &quot;Objectivists&quot; reading this review are hereby invited to click &quot;Not helpful.&quot;)At any rate Raimondo's workmanlike volume belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in recovering the genuine tradition of liberty. His efforts to restore the memory of an important and all but forgotten strain of American thought will be of interest to libertarians and classical liberals everywhere."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"Justin Raimondo's &quot;Reclaiming the American Right&quot; is one of the most fascinating political books I have ever read. I first read this work a couple of years ago, but return to it often because the stories of the various figures of the Old Right are so relevant to the current political situation. This book should be required reading for all who associate the word &quot;conservative&quot; with &quot;troglodyte&quot; or &quot;warmonger&quot;. It wasn't always so! The &quot;Old Right&quot; conservatives were very interested in personal liberty and bitterly opposed to war and the Merchants of Death who profit from them. They saw that in trying to police the world, America would lose it's liberty. Garet Garrett, John T. Flynn, Frank Chodorov ... these are names that deserve to be widely known, men whose works should be read as an antidote to the interventionist dogma of our times. Raimondo performed a valuable service in presenting their views to a new generation."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"Great eye for detail. Author traces the rise of \\"neoconservatism\\" (surely a contradiction in terms) in the US from it's beginnings amongst 1930s Trotskyites and hard line anti-communist liberals and social democrats in the cold war.Justin Raimondo shows how these groups were alienated by the developments on the American left during the post-Vietnam era and thus migrated to the right becoming a key part of the Reagan coalition. This faction displaced older line isolationist conservatives. It's not just the defection of former leftists to right as individuals, it was a factional migration.The trail for the neocon migration of the 1970s was blazed for them by a previous generation of National Review affiliated \\"New Right\\" thinkers in the 1950s such as James Burnham.There is a most interesting profile of Trotsky's main US apostle, Max Schactman. Max had raced to Trotsky's death bed after Stalin had him killed. Max never had the actual elective surgery that converts leftists to a fully fledged neocon, he remained a lifelong socialist. Max saw Washington as the real centre of the true revolution for global social democracy. He even saw the JFK / LBJ's interventions in Cuba and Vietnam as the historically \\"progressive\\" force versus Fidel and Ho Chi Minh, essentially reactionary fascist nationalists in marxist drag. The shadow of Max and Leon now influences US policy. Unfortunately."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"This book, written and originally published in the early-1990s, has, if anything, become more relevant in the decade-and-a-half since its publication.Justin Raimondo's RECLAIMING THE AMERICAN RIGHT is an examination of the so-called \\"Old Right.\\" The Old Right was anti-interventionist, pro-free market, and overall, anti-statist (think \\"Ron Paul,\\" who's about the only well-known present-day Old Rightist in national politics.) It first arose as a coherent (though unorganized) movement in opposition to FDR's New Deal, and it also opposed American entry into the Second World War. Such writers as Garet Garett, John T. Flynn, Frank Chodorov, H.L. Mencken, Albert Jay Nock, as well as newspaper publisher Col. Robert McCormick are the heroes of this group. In today's terminology, these men would be considered \\"libertarians\\" and/or \\"paleoconservatives.\\"Raimondo also contrasts the Old Right with the now-notorious \\"neoconservatives,\\" who first started to penetrate the American Right just before the Second World War, and who found a permanent, influential place in American conservatism during the early stages of the Cold War. The \\"neocons\\" were primarily ex-Trotskyites who never left the essentials of their Marxist ideas - particularly their vehemently statist (in some cases virtually totalitarian) leanings, their militarism, their elitism, and their utter worship of raw power. According to Raimondo, during the Cold War the American Right was largely taken over by a clique - amongst whom the neocons were influential - who (whether tacitly or actively) supported Big Government and a highly interventionist foreign policy. However, once the Cold War ended, the Right was presented with an opportunity to return to its roots. Raimondo, writing around fifteen years ago, seems optimistic that it would, and towards the end of the book, he points to Pat Buchanan as a rising paleoconservative star in the early \`90s.Raimondo writes well and tells a story that needs telling. Most modern-day Americans either know nothing of the Old Right, or they know of it only in the form of distortions, dismissive caricatures, and untrue smears.I read a first edition of the book, so I'd be interested to read the material that has been added to the newer additions. However, it would seem to me that, with the political lynching of Pat Buchanan, the so-called \\"War on Terror\\" and wholesale imperialism in the Middle East, the Republican Party's virtual blacklisting of Ron Paul, and the McCain nomination in '08, the American Right has unfortunately NOT returned to its Old Right roots, as Raimondo somewhat optimistically hoped in the early-\`90s. Instead, the American Right appears to have been taken over by a version of neoconservatism whose main political trademarks are jingoism, occasional halfhearted references to shrinking government (without the intent of ever seriously following through on them), and shamelessly pandering to evangelicals.If you think of yourself as a \\"conservative,\\" but you've found yourself alienated by George W. Bush's administration and by mindlessly jingoistic Hannity-Limbaugh-Coulter conservatism; if you like free markets and low taxes but aren't interested in imperialism or nation-building; if you just want to be left alone to run your life and take care of your family with minimal interference by the state; if you were a Ron Paul supporter or were at all intrigued by his message - you just might be a paleoconservative or a libertarian, and you owe it to yourself to find out about the movement's unsung origins in American history. This book is one of several good places to start."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"\\"Reclaiming the American Right\\" is an investigation into the evolution of the conservative movement. What went wrong in the movement can best be answered by reexamining the movement's past.WWII and the Viet Nam wars introduced a different kind of \\"conservative\\" into the conservative movement. The original conservatives were non-interventionists. This era found some of these new \\"conservatives\\" were internationalists or globalists. That's where the change became very evident. Even today the branding of some conservatives as isolationists is disingenuous. A point Mr. Raimondo effectively makes clear is that this tag is used rather than a more accurate word- nationalist.In the Introduction the author addresses the changes resulting from the \\"co-optation\\" and \\"corruption\\" of what today could be called the Old Right. Rather than favoring nationalism or \\"America First\\" like the Old Right of Taft, Garrett, Flynn, and today's Pat Buchanan; neoconservatives favor a global empire with as much defense spending as they can get.On page 30 Mr. Raimondo addressed globalism and the neocon buzzphrase \\"exporting democracy\\".\\"This is the new myth in the name of which the world-savers and world planners empty our wallets and fill their coffers; the new rationale for the existence of countless think-tanks and the cushy jobs that go with them; the latest code word for a frankly imperial policy, unrestrained by either modesty or common sense.\\"He contrasts the priorites that have changed. The Old Right emphasized individual rights and property rights where today the key word is \\"democracy.\\"This edition was published in 1993. I am surprised by how vividly some of the Old Right quotes from more than 50 years ago have summed up the politics of today.\\"The Washington of the nineties is ruled, not by Congress, or even the President, but by the lobbyists of every group aspiring to victimhood, competing to rob the taxpayers blind.\\"- page 240. Sound accurate for today? I think so.A Samuel Francis quote addresses what needs to be done to reclaim the original conservative movement(there was a conservative movement before Bill Buckley,jr. and National Review). \\"In short, what is needed, says Francis, is a populist revolt. Not a movement of intellectuals directed at the elite, not an attempt to preserve what has already been destroyed, but a grassroots movement against the welfare-warfare state.\\"Some more topics that the author covers in the book are:*He identifies the first neoconservative.*The origin of the New World Order concept.*The European influence on American domestic policy.*Chronicles the evolution of the left-wing anticommunists of the fifties and sixties to the neoconservatives of the seventies and eighties.*He devotes a lot of pages to Garet Garrett and his books. The \\"Rise of Empire\\", published in 1952 was way ahead of it's time! The material on Garet Garrett alone make this book indispensable.*Garrett's view that the federal income tax was nothing less than power to redistribute wealth and assume power over money. That is an important component of imperialism.*Why the word \\"isolationist\\" is a straw man argument and always was.One motivating factor for my interest in this book was the short recommendation of the book by Ron Paul on this Amazon page.I wasn't disappointed. The author has written an honest, unbiased book about the old conservative movement and some of it's prominent figures.I would rate this book higher than 5 stars if that was possible!"},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"Justin Raimondo has written a fairly respectable book on the history of American Conservatism within the 20th century and how it has changed as a result of World War II and the subsequent Cold War Era. However, in the first chapter covering the legacy and significance of James Burnham (an anti-communist conservative), it is erroneously stated that Burnham was the first \\"neoconservative.\\" Neoconservatism was an intellectual movement whose pedigree can be traced back to the founding of a publication called \\"The Public interest\\" by Irving Kristol in 1965. James Burnham was one of the first conservatives however to identify this movement's first emergence within political circles in 1972 during the Nixon years. For a more accurate and complete account of the achievement as well as significance of James Burnham within the context of 20th century conservatism, I would highly recommend Sam Francis's book \\"Beautiful Losers.\\""},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"I've wanted to read this book for a long time, and was very happy when ISI announced its republication earlier this year. Certainly worth the wait, it ended up being more than I expected. While the jury is still out, I'm inclined to agree with Scott P. Richert in the first of two \\"critical essays\\" added to this new edition that \\"Reclaiming...\\" is \\"well on its way to being considered a classic of American political conservatism, on the order of those works of Albert Jay Nock and John T. Flynn and Garet Garrett which are discussed herein\\" (p. 299).Other authors before and since 1992, when \\"Reclaiming...\\" was first published, have told the history of the Old Right and made the case that American conservatism did not, as I put it in another review, spring fully-formed from the brows of Buckley and Burnham at a \\"National Review\\" editorial conference in 1952. Few of those other authors, though, can match the depth of Justin Raimondo's research, the apparent range of his reading, or his skill in tying it all together.At least until we get a chance to see Bruce Ramsey's brand-new \\"Unsanctioned Voice - Garet Garrett, Journalist of the Old Right,\\" \\"Reclaiming...\\" may be the definitive taxonomy of his place in the history of American conservatism. Raimondo's salvaging of this all-but-forgotten writer -- and his fascinating and important proof of the influence of Garrett on Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" -- are alone worth the price of the book.\\"Reclaiming...\\" was first published in 1993, and wasn't updated for this new edition (except for the addition of those \\"critical essays\\"). It therefore doesn't address George W. Bush and his form of \\"conservatism,\\" the war on terror and the expansion of empire both at home and abroad, or, most recently, the Ron Paul campaign and the thousands of newly-minted Revolutionaries it raised. Though that makes it obvious this book is 15 years old, you could almost claim Raimondo saw it coming. His sections on the neocons and their imperial project more than stands the test of time.Where this book ended up surprising me (though having read some of the author's other works and having met him a few times many years ago, it probably shouldn't have), though, is that it's not only a well-researched and documented history, but also a spirited call for the intellectual heirs of the Old Right to, well, reclaim the American Right. His energetic defense of Pat Buchanan, his takedown of the myth of Rand as philosopher-sui-generis, and his feisty rejection of American Empire all deserve close reading. And as someone admittedly prone to Nockian pessimism, I found his invocation of Rothbard's driving optimism a valuable tonic.One of Raimondo's major documentary sources, in fact, was Rothbard's then-unpublished manuscript for \\"The Betrayal of the American Right.\\" Now that it too is in print, these two titles together make for great, indeed I'd argue essential, reading for today's conservatives, both newly-minted members of the Ron Paul Revolution and those weaned on Ann Coulter (if you'll pardon the imagery) and Fox News. The idea that we can ever escape our history is a profoundly Leftist one. Fortunately, the American Right has a history that not only is worth studying, but one its heirs can learn and take inspiration from."},{"Title":"Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement","review":"When you think of conservatives, who do you think of? The two Bush's, Bill Buckley, Pat Robertson? If so, this book will not be for you, even though you need to read it. This book traces conservatism back to the \\"Old Right,\\" a rag-tag group of (primarily) journalists who galvanized during the 1930's and 40's against the new deal and other progressive experiments. These conservatives, unlike today's, were largely non-interventionist in foreign affairs, believed that our markets should be kept free, and were socially quite libertarian.The book, though, starts with one of the foils for the \\"Old Right\\" in the figure of James Burnham. Burnham would sew the seeds for what would later be known as neoconservatism with his bookThe Managerial Revolution: What is Happening in the World. A disaffected former Trotskeyite, Burnham argued for a midway between capitalism and socialism that included the United States as a global superpower, government management of industry, and the global war between communism and the West.After introducing this foil, we return to survey the \\"Old Left,\\" who, as chances would have it, were largely known as leftists before Franklin Roosevelt's brand of leftism took over. Albert Jay Nock, H.L. Mencken, and Frank Chodorov all hated to be labeled as conservatives, but their brand of laissez faire, distrust of government programs, and reactions to the New Deal made it almost inevitable that they'd be seen as reactionary. Later, Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard (the author having much more respect for the latter for whom he subsequently wrote the bioographyAn Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard) would bring \\"Old Right\\" values into what would become known as libertarianism.Another reviewer has commented on Raimondo's crticisms of Ayn Rand, and I want to bring them up here as well. As an intellectual historian, Raimondo finds Rand's claim that she had no intellectual forebears to be nothing short of absurdity. He suggests that Old Right \\"member\\" Garet Garrett's book The Driver was most certainly an influence on Rand'sAtlas Shrugged. (A finance man named Henry - not John - Galt who buys a train company and is later attacked by the government and makes a speech at the end about deserving his profit? Really?) (I'd also include Zamyatin'sWe (Modern Library Classics)as a book Rand almost had to have read before writingAnthem, but that is an aside.) I'd dare say that anyone who is a big fan of Rand's may be infuriated, but justifiably so, by Raimondo's meticulous tracing of Rand's work to other theorists who she sometimes read and mostly just heard about. (Every biography of Rand seems to talk about how she very rarely read primary sources.)We end with a chapter on the paleoconservatives (a recent term) and their reaction to the current neoconservative movement and its foreign policy aspirations and \\"compassionate conservatism.\\" We also get some good critical essays at the end on the \\"Old Right's\\" relevance today.All in all, this is a must read for those mystified at how the Republican party and conservatism has gradually morphed into \\"big government light.\\" Whether you are a Tea Party member or (as I am) a libertarian - or both - it will be refreshing to read the often untold history of the \\"Old Right,\\" our unjustly ignored intellectual heirs. One of this book's virtues, actually, is its bibliography, which gives citations for many of the writings of these \\"Old Right\\" figures from Nock to Paterson to Rothbard. (And many of the writings, you can get online free if you search for them.)

He puts Girard, Georgia on the map with stories that will be laughed at for generations to come.Structured as a well-written and incredibly funny memoir--which it is--Long's book also serves as an overview of Georgia farm life during the 1940s and 1950s not depicted anywhere else.Gordon Long is a masterful story-teller. Readers will quickly have a sense of sitting on a front porch with a gifted and remarkable man. He tells his stories with just the right dose of humor as he describes the farm life of his youth.These tales range from blowing up stumps with dynamite to the perils of using a two-man crosscut saw; then offers details of: mule psychology and \\"motivation\\" needed to plow the fields; the ritual of hog-killing for meat, sausage and crackling; milking cows; quail hunting and country dogs; country privies; hunting and fishing trips that bonded families and communities; efforts to save the farm from foreclosure; \\"dirt farming\\" for cotton, peanuts, peas and corn; country meals and how food was stored and cooked.The closing chapters offer a remarkable story how Long, as a young man worked hard to gain a public education to qualify him for entrance into college; attending rural church services, revival meetings and \\"dinner on the grounds\\"; wakes and funerals; and, a memorable 4-H camp.This is a candid, funny and thoroughly enjoyable memoir that will serve as a wonderful education for city-folks who are interested in the skills, traditions, and daily life of Georgia farm life.Long went on from Girard, Georgia to earn his bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, and his master's and doctorate in Business Administration. He then worked for years in corporate boardrooms, later to bring his skills and experience to Georgia College & State University where he was one of the most dynamic and respected faculty in that University's College Business."},{"Title":"Livin PO in Sandbed Hell","review":"I finished the book on a trip that I had to go on to Chicago.

The title is an anagram of &quot;Nowhere,&quot; which is the literal translation of the word &quot;Utopia,&quot; the title by which Thomas More's 1516 work has commonly become known. &quot;Erewhon&quot; is arguably the first anti-utopian or dystopian novel, anticipating the later and better known works such as Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; and George Orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; Whereas More and other utopianists are primarily interested in attacking society's ills and making the world a better place, the anti-utopians engage primarily in either satire of the society in which they live or in making dire predictions about the dismal fate that awaits humanity. Butler is most decidedly in the former category, since he proves in not only &quot;Erewhon&quot; but also his more famous work, the semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Way of All Flesh,&quot; that his main concern is in attacking the complacency and hypocrisy he saw infecting Victorian society.Like More's island of Utopia, Butler's Erewhon is a remote kingdom, not to be found on any map, which is discovered by the narrator of the novel (biographers of Butler have assumed it is modeled on a part of New Zealand, which anyone who has viewed the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies can attest has some spectacular landscapes). Cut off from the rest of the world, the citizens of Erewhon lives according to their own rules and dictates. Butler breaks from the tradition of creating an idealized world that goes back from More to Plato in favor of a more realistic society. In Butler's world there is still money, and both the rich and the poor still exist; there is even a monarchy in charge. It is when we notice strong parallels between Erewhon and the members of Victorian society that we start to see Butler's true purpose.Hypocrisy is rampant in Erewhom, where citizens think nothing of agreeing with things they do not believe in and their friends know that they are doing so. While the citizens pretend to worship deities that are the personification of lofty human qualities such as love, justice, and hope, they really worship a goddess, Ydrgun, and the Church of England is transformed into the sytem of &quot;Musical Banks.&quot; As Butler hits his stride in this novel he creates a topsy-turvy world where illness is treated as a crime (there are no physicians in the country) and criminal behavior, such as theft, are seen as minor weaknesses in character.Unlike Francis Bacon's utopian work &quot;The New Atlantis,&quot; where science was seen as the salvation of humanity that would correct all ills and provide all necessities, Butler's world has outlawed machinery because they might one day become the masters rather than the servants of humanity. Clearly Butler was no more enamored of the Industrial Revolution than he was of Victorian society. In many ways this is the section of &quot;Erewhom&quot; where Butler makes his most cogent arguments. It is also the point where the book's narrator, whose initial attitude of admiration turns to one of surprise, now beocmes one of condemnation as the eccentricities of the citizens of Erewhon are fully revealed. Ultimately, the shortcomings Butler sees in them are the same of which he accuses British society, politics, and religion.Because Butler is satirizing Victorian society his value to modern readers remains inferior to that of Huxley and Orwell, not to mention Edward Bellamy (&quot;Looking Backward 2000-1887&quot;) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (&quot;We&quot;). However, in many ways &quot;Erewhon&quot; is a pivotal novel in the history of utopian literature, not only because of how it follows and breaks away from More's original work and how it sets the stage for what other forgotten writers of dystopian fiction, such as Alexander Bogdanov (&quot;Red Star&quot;) and even Jack London (&quot;The Iron Heel&quot;). &quot;Erewhon&quot; remains one of those novels where its historical significance outweighs its literary appeal."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton (Literature and life series)","review":"Edith Wharton until recently has not received the interest and praise she deserved as one of the finest American authors -- was it because she was wealthy and female? Because people thought she was simply a protege of Henry James? Or because her books rarely had happy endings? Fortunately, a new generation is reappraising her work and finding much of value in it, from her critique of early 20th century American society and subtle assessment of man-woman relationships to her wonderfully textured and evocative style. RWB Lewis, who must be the foremost Wharton scholar today, brings Wharton to life in this book -- her tremendous intelligence, the terrific emotional hardships she endured, her great capacity for friendships and amazing zest for life. Wharton got started late as an author, not publishing her first book until nearly 40 -- because she had to overcome a tremendous hurdle -- being born into a society where women writers simply did not exist. Everything she accomplished thus was purely out of her own drive to communicate and create. If you haven't read much Wharton, I recommend also The Age of Innocence, The Custom of the Country, The House of Mirth, and any short stories you can lay your hands on."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton (Literature and life series)","review":"I had to read this for a college class about 10 years ago and was reluctant at first.

I looked in several stores and all over the web, and this Bible had the largest print I could find. It's 4 good-sized volumes, but the New Testament is all in Vol. 4 so that's not too bad. I found Vol. 4 advertised separately but I wanted the Psalms too. Kind of expensive but great set."},{"Title":"NIV Giant Print Four Volume Set Green Imitation Leather, Hardback in Slipcase, NIV480 Set","review":"This is a good quality product, both in terms of the print, the quality of the paper, and the hardback bindings.Quite a few Bibles these days are labelled \\"giant print\\", but this is often misleading. This Bible actually lives up to the name.I'm in my 40's, but work in IT, and so am often looking at computer screens. I have glasses with very mild magnification for looking at computer screens. One day, I realised that I wasn't able to focus properly to read the print in a tiny pocket Bible, and resolved to get a large print Bible. However, large print didn't seem very large, so I thought I might have similar problems with eye strain in reading those. Also, some large print Bibles still have multiple columns which might add to eye strain. I also realised that many \\"giant print\\" Bibles are often little better than the \\"large print\\" ones. This particular set of books is in a different league, with the text much, much larger, and presented in one column per page. I have to hold this Bible enough of a distance away, otherwise it's a bit too large close up - but that's probably a good thing. Different people no doubt have different reading distances which are comfortable for them, so whether you like the size of this print will probably be governed by your own preferred distance for focussing, and your own preferences.The paper used is not the thinnest type that you'd get in slim volumes.Four volumes make up this Bible in total, with the final volume being the New Testament. The translation of the NIV used is the older one, rather than the recently revised version. Obviously, you wouldn't buy this for its portability, but I think that carrying an individual volume around is little different to what one would do if carrying a whole Bible, so it can be used in that way."},{"Title":"Verano del Pequeno San John, El (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a fairly good translation of Crowley's book in hard cover presentation. Fortunately Minotauro Editions has restarted the publication of sci-fi volumes as it did in the early \`50s, allowing Spanish reading public to get in touch with this genre.John Crowley (1942) is not a very prolific sci-fi writer, eight novels between 1975 and 2002, but all his books have a very distinctive style. A special \\"taste\\" I risk to say.\\"Engine Summer\\" was the first novel he wrote (circa 1965), yet not the first he published, actually it was his third book (1979).The story describes a post apocalyptic world where Humankind dwells in small and scattered communities with very little communication among them.Little Bellaire is an enclave of \\"truthful speakers\\" that have developed a strange society full of myths about Saints and Angels.Rush That Speaks is the young protagonist of the story. He has a fervent desire to become a Saint and in order to achieve this he starts peregrinate into the vast outside world.At the same time he is looking for Once a Day his long lost love.A strange, magic and poetic world unfold, full of surprises and surprising characters up to the satisfactory end.Crowley confers his tale a structure that mix the classic \\"Hero's Quest\\" with the imagery of the \\"Flower Power\\" movement.Crowley's approach to storytelling has many points in common with PKD, but he is an optimist and this trait pleases me more.A final warning: don't let the first pages full of exotic references stop you, they will soon be explained.Enjoy this astounding opus!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Listen & Learn Spanish (Manual Only)","review":"I bought this book and it came with a cassette tape.

Her childhood antics and accomplishments on an Iowa farm will make you laugh outloud. Her strength, dedication, & love of her family will bring joy to your heart and tears to your eyes. It is a story of the spirit of American women & a life modern women will never experience but can learn from."},{"Title":"My Name Is Esther Clara","review":"Laurel Johnson speaks for her grandmother, Esther Clara Sanow Ford, with this - what the author refers to as creative nonfiction - first-person tale of a woman's journey through life. The reader relives history through the eyes of Esther, who experienced the hardships of World Wars I and II and the Korean War, the discord of the Vietnam War, and the worst depression this country has experienced to date. Esther's life evolved from one extreme to the other, from having to cook on a wooden stove, read by kerosene lantern and use an outhouse to one with all the luxuries electricity and running water have to offer; and from riding in horse-drawn carriages to traveling by automobile. How delightful to read about her antics as a child and terribly sad to learn of the death of a beloved child during her marriage.Esther was a forward-thinking woman who lived during an exciting, progressive time in our nation's history. Her love and devotion to her family, especially her husband Herb, was her number one priority. It is through Esther one is reminded of the basics of life: enduring hardships with bravery and positive thoughts, loving with all one's heart, showing kindness toward others, and above all, being true to one's self.It's a rarity when a book of this quality crosses my desk. It seemed as if Esther sat across from me, talking directly to me. I didn't want to put the book down, nor did I want it to end. Although Esther may not have had a documented impact on the history of America, she certainly made an impact on this reader and, I imagine, many others."},{"Title":"My Name Is Esther Clara","review":"Laurel Johnson's ability to captivate a voice from memory and paint it for the rest of the world to hear is an irreplaceable gift. Reading the family tales and yarns of Johnson's grandmother in My Name Is Esther Clara is to come to know and love Esther. Her voice with its deep dialect can be heard jumping off the page through Johnson's talent and first hand knowledge.The freshness of the frolicking years of child's play through the graying of maturity with the hard lessons of life are woven through Esther's personal dialogue. Heartwarming and charming, it is like standing at a neighbor's fence with ease and down-home familiarity.Antics that will split the reader's rib cage for laughter and hillarity tell of historic perspectives of much simpler lifestyles and the priorities that had to match for survival. Esther's journey will give social awareness to an agriculturally oriented lifestyle in the plains of America. Character is built and personal strength must evolve from determination in the face of hardship and loss. And yet, always Esther has a yarn to tell and a country idiom to explain.Laurel Johnson simply radiates her talent in her tribute to her grandmother Esther Clara. This is a book I will pick up again and again for fun and the value inside. I will give it in abundance to friends, and recommend it not just to readers, but to students as well. It will give anyone the reason to pause and think of the value of heritage.Stephanie S.

With The Best Defense, I listened to the audio version, skillfully narrated by Anna Fields, one of the best readers out there. The difference between the 2 experiences is striking, particularly with respect to the courtroom scenes, which occupy a good percentage of these books. Barbara reluctantly takes on the case of a woman accused of killing her little daughter and burning down the safe house where they've taken refuge from her abusive husband. Public opinion, fanned by some sensational journalism, is that she is undeniably guilty. The buildup to the trial makes for interesting reading, but the story bursts into life during the trial. Fields conjures Barbara out of the pages as a brilliant, impassioned defense attorney, willing to endure significant personal risk, and psychological pain, in her determination to see that the truth prevails. The courtroom scenes are rivetting. Barbara abhors the fact that cross examination frequently forces a lawyer to become a \\"shark\\", cutting the witness to pieces. Her struggle with her two conflicting impulses, to achieve justice and to preserve her own humanity, forms the central theme of this novel. As in real life, there are no real solutions, and Barbara must find a way to come to terms with these facets of her personality.5 stars, one of the best in the genre."},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"ISBN 0449223140 - Give or take 500 words, I might have given this book 5 stars - the problem is, there's reference to a relationship from the first book, and no explanation. If the author really felt the need to drag \\"Mike\\" into The Best Defense, she ought to have included some more details. If the Amazon Product Description hadn't mentioned that he died, I'd have assumed a bad break up.That aside, the book is quite good. Barbara Holloway, trying to come to terms with what she does for a living, and how she does it, sets up shop in a small neighborhood restaurant, offering legal advice to people who couldn't otherwise afford it. Enter Lucille Reiner, sister of Paula \\"Baby Killer\\" Kennerman. Barbara takes the case, finding her client entangled in a conspiracy that goes far beyond the death of one child and the railroading of Paula. The complexity is a bit much at times, particularly during the trial, but it's worth the minor effort to keep the threads straight.It seems obvious that Wilhelm's intention is to carry Barbara's relationship with her father, the neighborhood people and Bill into the next novel. That's fine - I just hope she does the extra work to explain things so that each book can stand alone.

Now she's back in Eugene, Oregon, trying to recover from the case that brought her back into practice and that threw love into her path for the first time her 30-something years of life. Mike, the mathematician whom she loved so completely and unexpectedly, died in the case's messy resolution. Barbara has remained in Eugene to make Frank happy, because she thinks it doesn't much matter where she lives.

When a woman consults her about that woman's sister, whose public defender has already decided his client is guilty, Barbara becomes intrigued only after learning that the accused has been dubbed \\"Babykiller Kennerman\\" by the right-wing press. Paula Kennerman took her six-year-old daughter and fled to a safe house for battered women, the Canby Ranch in a nearby rural area, and small Lori died when the Canby house burned down because someone torched it. Lori, autopsy results indicate, died from trauma before the fire started. Paula has stopped talking, even to her lawyer and her sister. She's already been found guilty, so why bother to cooperate in her own defense?Barbara can't resist, especially when she learns that the source of the news stories about \\"Babykiller Kennerman\\" is a weekly paper owned by neighbors of the Canby Ranch. At first she only represents Paula Kennerman's sister, but she offers Paula her services - free, with Barbara also assuming the case's considerable expenses - after the public defender calls in a doctor to treat Paula and that doctor prescribes such large doses of a powerful tranquilizer that Paula can no longer function at all.This second entry in the Barbara Holloway series of legal thrillers is complex and driven in equal measures by plot and characters. I found Barbara's willingness to spend her own funds on her client's defense a bit hard to believe, but I have to admit that it's consistent with the character (I know this from reading later novels in the series). The references to Barbara's dead lover would be difficult, I think, for a reader unfamiliar with the previous book. This is a true sequel, not just one novel in a series, and it's also firmly grounded in its viewpoints on several controversial social and legal issues. Difficult ground to cover - but it worked for me, and as usual the author handles complex material with a deft touch.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"Loved this audiobook. So refreshing to see someone learn to love and accept certain imperfections they've struggled against for so long. Loved the story. Heartrending to see all the layers of deception, vanity and selfishness. Barbara and Frank team up and cut past all the barriers that have held them apart from each other and together take down a vicious group of criminals. Great story!"},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"Having read and enjoyed the first Barbara Holloway book, I was looking forward to the continuing story....but now that I'm reading it, I am not sure I will be able to finish. Wilhelm takes many opportunities to make people with my viewpoint look like backward idiots intent on destroying others. When reading any book, I can overlook little blurbs that authors insert that are offensive to me, but this takes it to a new level, as there are long diatribes trashing Christians and conservatives. Fortunately, I checked this book out of the library so I haven't lost any money in the process of learning what I can expect from Ms. Wilhelm's books. It's a shame that such a talented author chose to insult a substantial segment of the population in this way."},{"Title":"The Best Defense","review":"The book begins well, rich (or at least well off, but playing at being poor) female lawyer is asked to do the impossible, free a woman pre-judged to be a baby killer. Barbara (the lawyer) does a credible job and succeeds. The book bogs down near the end with a lot of shooting off in all directions apparently trying to explain herself. 'Bad guys' are unbelievably bad: making money on abortion formula while mouthing abortion foe rhetoric. A little too overdramatic...a C-minus for such a lack of sublety. The righteous are 'good-good', the other side is 'bad bad'. Author is no John Grisham."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I read this first novel by Brian Haig after immensely enjoying THE KINGMAKER (five star review of 5/13/03), the third novel with Major Sean Drummond as the central character. I wanted to understand the character development of Drummond and surmised that this book would be a fast paced easy read. If you are interested in the military/legal thriller genre, you will probably enjoy this story by Haig, a West Point graduate and the son of former Secretary of State (\\"I am in charge\\") Alexander Haig. The obvious reason is that Drummond's previous experiences are relevant to the later stories in the series, but in addition I would guess my recognition of the flaws in this book was substantially increased (and perhaps my rating influenced negatively) by the progress the author has made as the series has progressed. In my review of THE KINGMAKER, I labeled Drummond \\"The James Bond of the Legal Profession\\"; in this book his skills are not nearly as developed, the action is less intense, and his personality is not as appealing.The storyline is straightforward. Drummond is chosen to lead a team investigating an apparent massacre of thirty-five Serbs by an elite Green Beret team in retailiation for the slaughter of a group of Kosovars who they were advising during the Balkan war. His team also includes a beautiful but aloof defense attorney, Lisa Morrow, and a by-the-book prosecutor, Captain James Delbert, both of whom possess more impressive credentials than Drummond. In addition, given the high profile and potentially explosive nature of the incident, they have been given a very tight deadline in which to complete their report. As you might imagine, they are met by a wall of noncooperation if not complete silence. However, the physical evidence certainly calls into question the official version of events. Additional violence and intrigue occurs, and it isn't clear whether it is related to attempts to hinder their invetigation or just misdirection by the author.This is what might be termed a military investigation procedural, and unfortunately I am not an expert in a lot of the areas with which this book deals. (E.g, JAG procedure and rules of evidence, Army ranks, etc.) and thus cannot address the criticisms of some other reviewers about the technical aspects of this story. But it is fast moving and certainly plausibly plotted. The major positives were actually the knowledge imparted by the discussion of some of the history and geography relevant to the Balkan conflict and the examination of the moral ambiguities often highlighted in retrospect by such events as that portrayed in this book. Drummond is conflicted by his role in not only trying to assemble the facts but present his conclusions in a way that balances all the competing interests involved. At the same time, tensions develop within his group and along the chain of command above him.The major negative was the straightforward presentation of the story and the seeming inevitablilty of the eventual conclusion. The plot is neither particularly complex or intrinsically interesting. Thus, the tension involved the interactions among the participants (including Drummond and Morrow's evolving relationship), whether and how the truth could be assembled, and how the \\"greater good\\" embodied in the major geopolitical considerations involved would interact with the determination of the details and \\"small truths\\" of this particular event. And this is done in a very balanced and thoughtful way. (I imagine such issues as what ends justify what means are of great interest to the author, and they are certainly playing out in the military engagement in Iraq today although in a very different way.)I enjoyed the book enough so that I also plan to read MORTAL ALLIES (the second book in the series) in the hope that the evolution of Drummond's character and the author's skills will have proceeeded meaningfully by that point. In summary, I was satisfied but not excited by this book, while I loved THE KINGMAKER (now available in paperback). So, if part of your enjoyment is finding new authors and following their development and the evolution of their characters, then read this series in order. But if you want to read only the best story and to meet a really intriguing fictional character combined with a fascinating plot, go straight to the third book in the series."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig (son of Alexander Haig) is a fresh new &quot;voice&quot; in popular fiction. His style of writing -- part witty, part sarcastic and always interesting -- makes Secret Sanction a book to put near the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list. I think you'll be captivated by the story (which moves along at a very crisp pace), the characters ( which are believable and multi-dimensional), and Haig's knowledge of military honor, tradition and politics. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Haig's first effort. There's no doubt in my mind that you'll like Secret Sanction a lot and be looking forward to Haig's next book. The only reason I didn't rate the book a &quot;5&quot; is that I anticipated the ending a little too far in advance of where I would have liked, since the earlier reviews I read on Amazon led me to believe the ending was a major surprise. However, the actual rating level here is not really that relevant. What is relevant is that this is a book you'll be glad to read."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"It's hard to believe that Secret Sanction is Brian Haig's first foray into popular fiction. His multi-dimensional, ascerbic, sarcastic, conflicted, self-deprecating protagonist leaps off the pages and burrows into your imagination, so that you will find yourself smirking and chuckling at his antics as you go about your day. All of the characters are memorable, the dialogue and plot are fast-paced, and the ending will leave you feeling satisfied yet uneasy.The plot is as believable as it is relevant and timely, and for those with a sense of history, it will inevitably cause you to recall the horrific tragedy of My Lai.Mr. Haig is one of the most original and enjoyable storytellers that I have discovered in a long time. I can only hope he has many more entertaining, thought-provoking tales yet to tell."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"While Haig weaves an interesting tale, his writing demonstrates a complete lack of knowledge about international law, military justice, criminal law, and the Army in general. As an Army Judge Advocate myself, I have to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but I do expect authors to do enough research that basic principles remain intact. For example, no Army officer would EVER say &quot;OORAH&quot; or &quot;HOORAH&quot; when referring to the 82d Airborne. &quot;Proximate cause&quot; doesn't get you a search authorization anywhere--PROBABLE cause does. Military suspects being interrogated by CID would know what crimes they are suspected of because of Article 31, UCMJ. And the list goes on (and on, and on). The predictable plot I can forgive; the rest I cannot. Please do not read this book thinking you are getting an accurate insight into the world of military law."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Every military officer knows that some assignments almost always lead to retirement such as the critical but deadly role of garrison commander. That is how Major Sean Drummond of the Judge Advocate General's Corps feels as he stops at Fort Bragg to catch a flight to Bosnia where his next case awaits him.In Bosnia, someone executed thirty-five Serbs gangland-style. The bodies were all found containing bullets in the brains. The international media quickly jumps on the Serbian claim that an American Special Forces team of nine people committed mass murder. Sean will prosecute the case against the accused American soldiers in a military court of law. However, as he gathers information and realizes that at least one of his two aids is a &quot;spy,&quot; Sean knows that there is more to this mass execution then the brass will tell him. Several of the higher ranking officers advise Sean on the record (tape recording on) before warning him about going too far and destroying his career (tape recording off). Can Sean truly prosecute a case that his superior officers want him to lose?SECRET SANCTION is a powerfully fresh military legal thriller that provides sub-genre fans with insight into a different form of justice as well as a close up look at Bosnia. The invigorating story line centers on military justice and wondering if Sean, who believes in the Army values including justice and honor (while higher ranked officials use the values as a convenient facade) can fairly prosecute the case? Brian Haig shows insider information of the working of the US Army in a peacekeeping scenario. This adds spice to a well-written, issue-raising thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Haig writes from the foxholes. His clear cut attention to detail with regards to military tradition and ceremony weaves seamlessly with courtroom drama and Special Forces codes of honor. Haig takes us on a ride from Serb controled Bosnia to the inner circles of the White House with a master story-tellers keen eye for the unexpected. A summertime &quot;must read&quot; that you will be placing under Christmas trees as well!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Major Sean Drummond is a nonconformist, cynical and self-deprecating JAG lawyer...a wonderful character with wit, charm, smarts.Before JAG, he was a member of super secret covert \\"outfit\\" in the US intelligence community.In Brian Haig's \\"Secret Sanction\\" Drummond is assigned to what appears to be a straightforward case. Someone has committed a massacre of 35 Serbian troops who were led by a brutal, sadistic warlord.The army brass fears this will get attention on a par with Vietnam's My Lai massacre.Once in Tuzla Air Base in Bosnia-Herzegovina, what appears to be a giant cover-up/conspiracy greets Drummond and his legal team.NSA, CIA, Green Berets, Drummond's mentor (two star general Clapper) and on up to the Commander-in-Chief are possible members of the whitewash.The pace is fast, the dialogue electric, the characters real and fully fleshed out. It is muscular legal thriller...perhaps John Grisham in army fatigues.Each clue unearthed leads to another seeming dead end...but Drummond is relentless in finding out what really took place.The journey to the d&eacute;nouement is a breathtaking voyage and the ending will take you by surprise.A winner on many levels!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Secret Sancation is a great little read. A great look at the modern military and our militaries job in places like the Balkans and in these other 3rd world conflicts.The main character in this story is right out of a Nelson Demille book. He could have been the main character of Plum Island or Up Country, but regardless it still works.This is a great book and a fast read. I enjoyed that the main characters father in the book was wounded in the rear, i wonder if the author is making a joke about the relationship with his father, the famous general and politician Alexander &quot;I'm In Charge Here&quot; Haig.I enjoyed this book and it is worth your money"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"As a first novel from Brian Haig, I must say I was fairly impressed.A group of 35 Serbian soldiers is massacred; some with close in headshots. A group from the Special Forces A-Team is arrested for this atrocity. Sean Drummond, a JAG lawyer, is put in charge of the investigation, to find out whether it was self-defense or outright murder. With his witty and smart-alecky way, Drummond weaves from cover-up to cover-up in what seems an endless pursuit of justice.I felt really comfortable reading this book. The writing style was fluid. There was not as much suspense as other military thrillers but the manner in which Drummond investigated and interviewed potential suspects kept me on edge. I got a pretty clear picture on the Serbian/Albanian relations and some of the politics involved with NATO operations. Military operations with the KLA brought some insight also.Overall a satisfying read, especially for military buffs.Inside the covers:He said, &#8220;Sometimes those principles they teach at West Point about duty and honor and country, sometimes they clash against one another. The world&#8217;s not as pristine as West Point makes it out to be. Sometimes you have to decide which of those three is most important. You have to decide which principle you need to sacrifice.&#8221;I said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to west point, so I don&#8217;t know about all that. I tell you what I do know. I know what makes us different from the Serbs. We don&#8217;t coddle our murderers. We don&#8217;t lie to the world when our troops commit a massacre. We wash our laundry in the open. That&#8217;s duty and honor and country, all in one.&#8221; At least that&#8217;s what I thought."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I read a lot of debut thrillers and I'm usually disappointed with them. But I thought SECRET SANCTION was a great debut -- one of the best debuts I've read recently. After reading this novel, I'm surprised that Brian Haig isn't a bigger name in the business.I won't summarize the plot, since that's been done by others. This is basically a story about a JAG lawyer named Sean Drummond and the cases he investigates. This novel is surprisingly funny. Drummond is a rather cynical, sarcastic character who has a love/hate relationship with the military. This novel is therefore includes wisecracks on pretty much every page. In fact, Haig's writing style reminds me a bit of Nelson Demille and Robert Parker, because he blends a lot of biting humor with a fast-paced plot. Luckily, Haig has a good sense of humor. I laughed out loud many times at this book.SECRET SANCTION is a lot of fun and provides quite a bit of insight into the culture of the military. Contrary to what you might think, Haig is not afraid to criticise military culture, and I found some of his insights quite interesting.Although Brian Haig is the son of former Secretary of State Al Haig, he aims barbs at both Democrats and Republican politicians in this novel. I didn't feel this book had a partisan edge to it at all.In short, I highly recommend this book. A great debut by a writer who has not gotten his due."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I belong to a book club and we've never selected a \\"mystery\\" for our discussion until I suggested \\"Secret Sanction\\". The plot is absolutely current and riveting. It will force you to think about all the military actions going on today. The characters are realistic, believable and have depth. The objectivity with which the author approaches the subject is both intriguing and enlightening. The women of my book club thought the book was terrific and it certainly generated quite a lot of discussion."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"This is the first of Brian Haig's books about legal matters in the US Army. Faced with another legal novel, I would normally yawn, but this story has two things going for it. First, the US Army's Judge Advocate General's office is not your usual law operation. The military has iis own rules, based on the Articles of War, so things run differently. Second, the protagonist, Major Sean Drummond, is a cocky, fast-talking lawyer, who sees the wry humor in military life. Of course, if you don't see the humor, you will likely become sorely depressed, because peacetime life in uniform is boring, and wartime life is terrifying. In the present tale, Major Drummond and two captains go to Bosnia to investigate charges that a Green Beret team ambushed and executed 35 Serbian soldiers, although the United States was at peace with Serbia. The Green Berets have devised a big cover-up, which Drummond detects immediately. But as he investigates further, the crime is not as clear-cut as it appears, and it extends all the way back to Washington, DC. The story unfolds nicely and should keep you entertained during those long waits in an airport terminal."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I picked this up on the clearance rack at a local store, and therefore did not expect much from the story. Once I begain to read I could hardly put the book down. The story seems written as if Sean Drummand were telling it, and it lends a very easy readability and flow to the book. Read it if you have a chance"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I do not have any military background but Mr. Haig's writing made it appear interesting and easy to understand. Fast paced, very witty and can't help but admire his lead character. I have grabbed the rest of his books...I am hooked! Can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig is the sond of the former Secretary of State. This is his first book (though I read Mortal Allies a while back) and it's a good book, a complex thriller involving international politics and military operations.Major Sean Drummund, the main character, is an army lawyer assigned to investigate what appears to be a massacre of Serbian soldiers. The army is running a semi-covert operation inside Bosnia, with Green Beret teams advising Albanians in nearby Kosovo in the fine art of guerilla warfare so they can fight off their Serbian oppressors. One of the Green Beret teams discovers that the Albanians they were training have all been killed, and they ambush a vehicle convoy in retaliation and kill 35 Serbian soldiers. The difficulty is that almost all of the Serbians have been shot once in the head, just to make sure. This could constitute a war crime.When Drummond is first assigned to the case, he gets a lot of on-the-record covering from his superiors, and a lot of behind the scenes pressure to make sure the whole problem goes away. However, he's a stubborn character, pretty much born into the military, and he insists on taking his own path and finding the truth. When a reporter shows up to try and follow the case, and is almost immediately killed, things get complicated even more. And naturally there's a girl, and Drummond can't decide if she's on his side or not.This is a good first effort, and while it's not going to win any awards, if you like this kind of book you could find many worse things to spend your weekend with."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Fast moving , well written, extremely enjoyable. I have just completed his second book and Brien Haig is an articulate and accomplished author with an upside to rival Coyle and Clancy.. A must read!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"As an avid reader and chaser of military fiction I enjoyed Haig's version of secret military courts-martial investigations. I think that if he did a little more research into the procedures and effort required by the \\"Book\\" he would be able to earn the 5th Star. It appears that he desires his character to be a swashbuckler and hero going his own way, doing the process his own way. It doesn't work that way. I ask him to pay a little more attention to required detail, not so much as to slow the pace, but enough to put Sean Drummond in a position that his case would be won no matter who prosecuted. Another thing, Mr. Haig, you gotta give Sean a sex life. No wonder the Major is short and curt with everyone. I patiently await his next effort, hoping that he will grow in the direction of W.E.B. Griffin."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"This story of Serb soldiers allegedly being brutally executed by an American SpecFor away team was quite a hook. Being presented with the &quot;evidence&quot; by the Serb News Media, the US top-brass send Army lawyer Sean Drummond and his team to investigate the truth of the matter. The tale is told using Drummond's cynical and sarcastic voice which whilst initially witty becomes grating. The cast of characters seems well-rounded and plausible, but for Spec7 Imelda Pepperfield; if I'd come across someone like her in MY military career, she'd have been on a charge of insubordination immediately!I can't comment on the accuracy of the JAG investigation or whether lawyers would actually DO the investigation rather than line officer's and military police investigators. However, the story does drive on at a fast pace to a satisfying conclusion and the book is exciting. For that alone, it's worth the purchase.My reservations lie in language accuracy, some spelling errors. If the author is prepared to allow these to creep into his book, how accurate are the details on which a book like this hangs? Fow example, Haig invents a neologism,namely &quot;conspirational&quot;. What does that mean? We also are faced with the absurd picture of a man having a single thick eyebrow which is PERPENDICULAR to his moustache. That would be a sight! Of course, Haig meant to say parallel.Despite these problems the book was an enjoyable romp."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Secret Sanction captured my attention on page one and never let go. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the characters Haig has created. All were very well developed and very believable.

Imelda was an out n out embarrassing caricature of a short, squat, bulling, ignorant, southern black woman that wasn't funny at all. The story was shallow and uninteresting. There was little investigating.

And I&#8217;m not talking about nickel-and-dime stuff. There are times I think the author literally made things up about the Army and the JAG Corps.For example, Imelda's rank, Specialist Seven, hasn't existed in the Army for ages. Anyone remotely familiar with the modern Army should know that. Moreover, no JAG would head up such an investigation in the first place; it would be a regular officer doing either what&#8217;s called a 15-6 investigation or an Article 32 hearing. (At one point, Drummond does say he is the Article 32 officer. If that were so, he was inappropriately collecting evidence outside the setting of the actual hearing and thus invalidating his own investigation). There are no \\"career\\" prosecutors or defense attorneys like Delbert and Morrow, respectively; every JAG officer does rotations through various positions: prosecution, defense, administrative law, civil law, environmental law, etc.I could go on and on, but my point is that Haig's sole source of research on the JAG Corps seems to be the TV show \\"JAG\\" and the movie \\"A Few Good Men.\\" Needless to say, both are rife with their own Hollywood-inspired concoctions and inaccuracies.What's so odd is that people think this is a semi-genuine portrayal of the way military justice works! Check out the comments here at Amazon.com and on the book&#8217;s cover. Some have compared him to Tom Clancy, which is absurd, considering that the hallmark of Clancy&#8217;s writing is its technical accuracy.As mysteries/thrillers go, this book isn&#8217;t bad, but the frequent mistakes and outright misrepresentations of the Army were too distracting for me."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"First time I've read this author trying to get use to his style.

The book is set during the late 90s Kosovo war in which the US and NATO tried to prevent the genocide of Albanians. That conflict is pretty recent yet I remember little about it. Anyway, Milocivich and Serbia are claiming that a group of US soldiers murdered a batallion of Serbian soldiers. Drummond is the impartial JAG officer sent to determine if charges should be filed. Before he goes, he meets with representatives from the White House and the army basically telling him to be impartial but it would be best if these charges went away.From the first moment Drummond sets foot on Bosnian soil, he knows he's being lied to. He just can't prove it. The novel progresses as Drummond and his colleagues review the evidence and interview the team accused of committing the massacre. There are a few twists and turns but the plot moves only as fast as Drummond's first person narration can take it.The bad news is this book isn't great. The good news is that the series gets better. I've only read Private Sector in the series but thought it was much better than Secret Sanction. When you decide to read a series, it's important to start with the first book. Drummond is an interesting character, full of witty insights and deep thoughts, yet I think that reading a story from Drummond's point of view prevents the reader from getting fully immersed in the story. Yet Drummond is fun to read, so I'm not complaining.For those looking for a new series, I highly recommend the Sean Drummond books. They are in-depth legal thrillers that aren't hard to read. A lot of fun too. This book probably isn't the best in the series, but it is the first and sets the stage for what is too come. On a side note, it taught me a lot about the war in Bosnia."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"The first in the Sean Drummond series, has him off to a good start. Couldn't put this book down!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"West Point graduate Brian Haig's twenty plus year military background provides a useful and realistic framework from which to derive the plot of \\"Secret Sanction\\". Haig's protagonist the wise cracking and self deprecating Major Sean Drummond was a former U.S. Army Special Forces infantry officer who due to disabling injuries was steered into law school and eventually JAG (Judge Advocate General) service by his mentor General Clapper.Drummond was serving on a clandestine judicial tribunal that monitored and prosecuted special forces involved in black or secret operations who had gone beyond official limits committing punishable crimes. He was ordered to head an investigation based in the Balkans, specifically in Kosovo to determine whether a court martial was warranted. He was assisted by Capt.'s Delbert and Morrow respectively the most successful Army prosecuting and defense lawyers.The action is question was the ambush and massacre of a troop of 35 Serbian soldiers by a nine man U.S. Army Green Beret team. Officially the Special Forces were stationed in Kosovo only to observe and train Kosovo Liberation Army forces and not intiate any offensive action. The troubling aspect of the massacre was that each Serbian soldier was shot with a coup de grace to the head.Almost immediately Drummond realizes that this questionable action is being covered up at the very highest levels. Commander of American Special Forces General Murphy, a youthful Army boy wonder is making it difficult for Drummond to manuever. He is also being flummoxed by Jack Trethorne, a high ranking member of the CIA posing as a member of the NSA, who is feeding Drummond phony satellite imagery meant to justify the action. The nine man squadron sequestered in Aviano Air Force base in Italy haven't been individually isolated, allowing them to manufacture a story that all recite verbatim to Drummond.If things aren't bad enough a Washington Herald reporter presumably in Kosovo to cover the potential court martial is found murdered. The forces that be attempt to frame Drummond for the killing.Despite being stonewalled at every turn with his every move being recorded by wiretaps, Drummond plods forward in his inquest to a conclusion that puts his sense of morality to the ultimate test."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig has written 5-6 books. We purchased 4 of them from Amazon.com. My husband and I read all four in a one week period. They were all page turners.The primary character is a JAG lawyer, formerly Black Ops. He is not your traditional Jag person. He is flip and stands up to his superiors. His former profession gives him good defensive reflexes that no one expects from a lawyer so when he gets in sticky situations, which he often does, he can extricate himself.One word of caution, every Haig book that we have read has twists. When you think the main character, and you, have it figured out, up pops a surprise. Buy it, read it, enjoy it.This is the first one of the series. It had special meaning for us in that it takes place in Bosnia; we used to live in Bosnia so places were familiar and we found the details to be accurate. Basic theme is a special ops operation goes bad and someone has to investigate."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I am always pleased to find that the first effort of a succcessful author may be right up there with his best works. I discovered Brian Haig by reading his must recent novel, The President's Assassin. As a result of that I ordered and have read all of his novels that preceeded it. This one was the last read and the first written. The other modern author whose first effort I have been this pleased with was John Grisham. I still believe that his first novel, A Time To Kill, remains his best work. I would rank this one as Haig's best also. For character development, the way the story spins out, dialogue, intrigue, etc., it is all there. After Tucker Anderson's review sets the story, I can not improve on that, although we disagree on it's merit. As a trial lawyer all my life, although not a JAG attorney, the study of the situation, the interrogation of the witnesses, the dealing with the politics of the situation and the very real issues that arose as a result of all of that, I found the story compelling and one I hated to put down before I got to the last page. Brain Haig is a true talent and an author to look forward to."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"While I normally enjoy the military and legal genre, this combination written so brilliantly by Brian Haig should elevate him to the bestseller list regularly. The character development is excellent and scenarios are very realistic. Being an Army veteran, I can attest to his details being exact. Finally please don't be put off by the author being the son of former Secretary of State, Alexander Haig. He does not mix any political viewpoints in the book. Don't miss out on a great read unlike someone I recommended the book to."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"In the book Secret Sanction by Brian Haig, he tells the story of a young Army lawyer named Major Sean Drummond. Drummond is assigned to investigate the massacre of thirty- five Bosnian men by American soldiers. Along with two other American Army lawyers, Delbert and Morrow, he is sent to Bosnia to find out the truth of what happened that day. As Drummond tries to figure out this case, he finds out that there is a big conspiracy out to cause him troubles in the investigation. This conspiracy is so big that there is even a murder, a member of his team and people in Washington D.C. that are involved. This book was very easy to stay focused on and had a very interesting plot. The plot had many twists and unexpected events happen. It is interesting to try and figure out the case and all of the other elements right along with the main character, Sean Drummond. Haig does a great job with characterization in the book as he describes the lawyer Morrow and how good- looking she is. There are very real elements such as the way that Drummond feels about Morrow but does not have the courage to tell her. The conspiracy that is made to deter Drummond from solving the case is so real it makes the reader wonder if it is something that is actually going on in the world today. All around this was a very good book that will keep your attention even if you are not big into reading I would highly reccomend this book for all people especially those interested in mysteries or stories about the Army."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Excellent author. Discriptive but not flowery and rambling. I would compare his writing to Grisham. Baldacci, Connely and Lescroart. I would encourage readers to go to his website and view the video of his speaking engagements, his background and personal views are remarkable. For those who are old enough to remember, he is Alexander Haig's son. The only thing negative is that in his first book there was no objectional language but in each book following the language becomes more course. The foul language does not inhance the fabulous plot lines, so I am not sure why he finds it necessary."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Many books having to do with the military are strongly plot driven but have one-dimensional characters. A fewer number have strong characters but plodding action. A very few, like Haig's Secret Sanction, have the whole package. A legal drama when reduced to its most basic element, this is a riveting book that points out vividly that in war the line between who the good guys and bad guys are is often hard to decipher. The twists are many and Haig does a good job of making the moral grayness of war apparent."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"read it, love it, wait for the next page, then wait for the ending you'll never figure out and then wait for his next BOOK.it's that good"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Very good firstie by the son of Al Haig.

That I don't quite know where Haig (or his lead character) stands politically is testament to the fact that he's written a novel, and not a treatise. Looking forward to the balance of his books. (I've already started number two.) It will also be interesting to see how his character develops as the \\"real life\\" world Presidency changes (this novel features an unnamed Clinton White House - we'll see how a Bush White House is handled)."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"OK I couldn't resist the title of this review. I am so glad Amazon offered a \\"freebie\\" deal on Brian Haig's books (buy one, get one free) or I would never have discovered this wonderful author. His style truly reminds me of a mix between Nelson DeMille and Robert Crais. I LOVED the character of Sean Drummond.First, the plot, which has probably been covered extensively since this book was written so many years ago. Drummond is a JAG attorney assigned to determine whether a group of special forces troops in the Balkans should be prosecuted for crimes (they supposedly massacred a bunch of Serbs).You should know a bit about Haig. He is the son of Alexander Haig, former SecState to Reagan. He also worked under Nixon. Some of this seeps through in Brian Haig's writing. He refers to Drummond's father as someone who loved Nixon, but he also seems to respect him very much.This book is about duty, honor and country and could easily be written today. Those who march for peace will probably not like parts of it. I'd have to say, get over it. This is war. Granted the time period and the fight was a humanatiarian war, but the atrocities were very real and only become clear as the novel progresses. Drummond is witty, sarcastic and self-deprecating. I look forward to reading more about this character, and certainly more from this author. So glad I discovered him. Thank you, Amazon, for offering this buy one, get one free deal!"},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Very unique character and presentation. I was surprised how much I liked this book.

Personally I had given up on legal thrillers. But Haig has got me hooked again by a lawyer who is really hard not to like. The book is well-written and fast faced. Brian Haig's own personal miltiary experience is evident in his keen observations and interesting depiction of how military justice works. I really look forward to several literary installments with this great new character."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Another Brian Haig winner, good plot, great writing, fun to read, gripping, very good ending.

Drummond is his sarcastic self in this episode of his career and it takes his unorthodox behaviour to crack the case. But the ending is not terribly satisfying - maybe because life really isn't \\"black & white\\" - and leaves room to wonder about ethics in our society."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"An enjoyable read. A refreshing style of writing. I smiled and chuckled throughout the book. Looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"It is unique to come across a book that is both a legal and political thriller, but that is what Brian Haig has accomplished in his latest work. The book is full of unanticipated plot twists and political and military conspiracies. The lead character, Major Drummond, is both aggressive and irreverent, which I found refreshing in this genre. He uses these uses qualities to look past the calm and organized setting and ferret out the turbulent and ugly reality beneath.The book cleverly develops complication upon complication,generated by one disobeyed order, and leading ultimately to an intractable disaster. I found this book to be a bold and extraordinary thriller full of suspense and surprise. A wonderfully satisfying read."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Don't usually get into the military novels, but this one is an exception to the rule.

Definitely would (and have) suggest to others for a \\"good time.\\""},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"I bought this audio book after reading all of the Amazon reviews. At the same time I ordered this book from Amazon I ordered his other 3 books after reading all of the reviews about them. I won't bother to rehash the plot line since so many reviewers have already done that. As suggested by several reviewers I will read them in the order that they were written. Even though the books are not a continuation of each other, it was suggested it was better to read them in order since some of the same characters return. I have to say that at first I thought the book would be boring in that I have absolutely no interest in the military. Turns out it was not the least bit boring and it was a great mystery that just happened to have a military plotline. I can't wait to listen to the second book (Mortal Allies) which I will start on my drive home tonight. I am always happy when I find a new writer to listen to. Since I listen to so many audio books it is imperative to point out that no matter how good the book is if the person reading the book isn't also very good the audio book turns into a dud. As soon as I started listening to John Rubinstein (the reader of this book) I realized I had heard this voice many times before and that he was one of my favorite readers. Then I realized he is the reader of a lot of Jonathan Kellerman's books. If you like audio books, another great &quot;reader&quot; is Joe Mantegna. He has been the &quot;reader&quot; of a lot of different authors including Elmore Leonard. They don't get any better than him."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Jag Officer Major Sean Drummond has just been assigned to the kind of case he loathes - one that is neither black nor white and carries the weight of negativity no matter what was decided. In other words, a no-win situation. And Sean Drummond (along with partners Morrow and Delbert) was in charge of choosing whether there was enough evidence to proceed with a court-martial or not.The case involves a group of nine Green Berets known as a Special Forces A-Team. They were in charge of training a team of Kosovar Albanians to fight the Serbian army that had driven them out of their homeland.This all was to be done secretly because there was no official war which involved American forces. Basically, the Americans were to keep their hands clean while still finding ways to help the Kosovars defend themselves.Seems fairly cut-and-dried...until something went horribly wrong, resulting in the massacre of the Kosovar team and a group of thirty-five Serbian soldiers. And if Drummond thought the case wasn't complicated enough to wade through as it was, he hadn't seen anything yet. Questions would multiply into more questions and the answers were pointing to more than one conspiracy . Ones larger than what Drummond could handle on his own, especially when there was a mole in his own team.Brian Haig's breakthrough novel, Secret Sanction, may seem geared more toward hard-core military fiction fans at first glance, but it easily grabs the attention of a larger audience. While there are a couple occasions in which the investigating team uncovers something they find to be groundbreaking information that the average reader isn't able to pick up right away, it all opens up and becomes clear in the end. And this slight confusion only adds to the feeling of empathy toward what Drummond himself is experiencing.This is a novel of intrigue, suspense, murder and large-scale conspiracy. Add all that to the adorably cynical and smart-mouthed Major Drummond and Brian Haig has a winning novel sure to earn him a large following."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Had a few feelings at the beginning of the story but as it progressed the plot rounded and became a great and believable story. I will read more of his books as he comes along and I am sure that I will enjoy them."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Of all the military/legal 'thrillers' I've read, this one takes the cake. This is a great piece of work, stylishly devised to both entertain and educate the reader. Brian Haig's method of drawing the reader into the first-person, understated personna of the narrator is captivating and compelling. I found myself wanting to get to know Sean Drummond a lot better, and hoping future Haig novels will take me there. Mr. Haig has a rare and important gift, and I am a bonified fan, breathlessly awaiting his next effort . . ."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"This book is like a summer thriller movie: you can pick apart the plot 9 ways to Sunday, but when it is all said and done, you realize that you've been entertained. Considering this is Haig's first book, I'm willing to give him a lot of latitude and only wish that I could put forth such a first effort. The book was enjoyable, the main character was likable, the plot was basically plausible and, frankly, I couldn't put it down the last 200 pages.

I usually don't like first person narration (too self indulgent and self analytical), but this book flowed well, and the story moved.The Kindle edition was formatted just OK, with no Typos. BUT, there were many instances where different lines of dialogue by different characters were in the same paragraph and not separated out.

S. government in this, his first novel. Who else would have the courage (or, in today's world, foolishness) to follow through on his convictions.It appears that he's entered the mass market paperback arena for most of his succeeding books; he's been on a roll, so to speak, and some sound inviting. He's really gone high tech with digital versions; apparently, he has 'publishing savvy' to get so many out to the public in only two years. Could it be he has a ghost writer as an aide?A West Point grad, he served as special assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That's heady stuff, but as a career military strategist this was his destiny. Though his dad showed gross arrogance during his stint as Secretary of State, the son -- due to his military lifestyle, no doubt -- is more down-to-earth.I didn't care for his use of \\"Yep,\\" \\"Un huh,\\" \\"Nope\\" and such as dialogue, his story line moves along satisfactorily. Actually, it was two stories in one -- a major scandal of a government coverup involving our special forces called Green Berets and the resultant botched investigation, and a crime closer to home as a consequence.A vast conspiracy to keep details under wraps by devious political leaders and maneurvering generals at the Pentagon seems to have roots in the Oval Office. Living that close to the inner workings and observations of those in power, he knew first hand of the secret \\"wars\\" kept from the public. Where was Dan Rather then?! It's best (and safer) not to probe too deeply into military affairs, especially those chosen by officials not to pursue. The system has rules and everybody has to obey them.There were references to Hollywood movies, 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and 'The Caine Mutiny' to show how the underlings rebel at times of great stress. That's life. He inserted some references to Delbert of the comics and Johnny Carson/Ed McMahon spiels (also Ed Morrow) on t.v. to relieve tension from so much military \\"justice.\\"This was his first novel, though some of his articles previously have appeared in national publications and the 'Harvard Journal.' His use of mild vulgarisms seems normal for a soldier but hard to overlook by an average reader. These multi-faceted characters were not intellectuals, that's clear, with many things glossed over.Maybe his writing style is a \\"nice mix of wit and wisdom\\" as Nelson DeMille avered, but if he'd clean up his language, he might just become a first-rate novelist to match the glowing endorsements on the cover of this incredible story. Metaphysically speaking, of course.I like \\"first novels\\" as they incorporate much of the writer's personal experiences and beliefs. If I had a military background, I would probably have gotten much more to appreciate and less to doubt the \\"searing honesty\\" as presented from that viewpoint. I've learned that it is best to doubt until the real facts are proven and substantiated. This is not the kind of \\"suspense\\" fiction I've spent a lot of years enjoying. Yet, the larger print was a feast to my sore eyes.This is a son one could be proud of, but he will burn himself out before his time if he continues to release his creative efforts at such a rate. Take it from Gregory Macdonald, it is best to pace oneself in this industry."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Haig has rather blatantly imitated Nelson DeMille's style, and has also ripped off plot elements from two DeMille books, &quot;Word of Honor&quot; and &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;. The plot of &quot;Secret Sanction&quot; is completely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard cutouts. Don't waste your time with this pathetic imitation, go for the original--both of the two DeMille books named above are excellent. Haig's book is junk."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"Brian Haig's protagonist is possibly the most obnoxious fictional character I've come across in a long, long while. He is involved in a pedestrian, by-the-numbers plot and works with a wooden supporting cast. Is there anything that could make this novel worse?Yes, there is -- its being read by Scott Brick. In his reading, every character sounds exactly the same; the middle-aged Black female sergeant from South Carolina is interchangeable with the young New England-educated JAG officer. Worse, Mr Brick has a distinctive and highly annoying idiosyncrasy -- a rising tone at the end of certain sentences, and, again, it crops up irrespective of character. After that, the fact that Mr Brick has no clue regarding the pronounciation of the few French phrases common in English comes as no surprise. (He renders \\"sang froid\\" as \\"sang Freud\\", and transmogrifies \\"coup de grace\\" into \\"coup de gras\\" -- although, presumably, a cholesterol hit wasn't exactly what the author had in mind.)In short: Avoid this audio book like the plague!(Note: I rated this product with 1 star, because Amazon wouldn't allow 0 stars."},{"Title":"Secret Sanction","review":"ALthough this is Haig's first, it is a good one.

Also, an excellent daily reference book"},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","review":"Yes, I already gave it five stars, because I read one of her other books \\"Tapping The Power Within....\\" When I was about 14 or 15 years old, I was in a afterschool class, and the instructor gave us each a copy of \\"Acts of Faith.\\" The title of the book was very powerful to me, and I tried to read it then, but I was not ready. See, thats the thing about most self help books like these, you must be READY to read them. I actually got \\"Tapping the Power Within...\\" last month from my counselor, thats when I realized I still had two of her other books. My aunt also bought me one of her books when I was of the age 14, because I was going through a tough time. The book was called \\"Don't Give it Away.\\" Which I am now in my THIRD YEAR OF COLLEGE... YAYY ME, and I passed the book down to my sister. (Also, I wanted to leave this portion of my message for a poster on here named Tigress \\"JD\\": Do not feel stupid for buying a collection of her books. Actually, I had just did the same thing. I am about to buy more of her books).Its quite hard choosing which books to read. I am currently reading the \\"Acts fo Faith\\" day by day, and I have finished reading \\"Tapping The Power Within\\" Which is helping me a lot. The following books I already have purchased was already shipped to me is \\"Faith in the Valley,\\" \\"Living Through the Meantime,\\" (which I started to read, but I was not sure if I was ready, after reading a couple of pages through)\\"One Day My Soul Just Opened Up (which I am debating with \\"Living Through the Meantime\\"), and \\"Yesterday I Cried.\\" So I have about seven of her books. I am going to purchase more right now. I hope you all remain strong, and I hope the books will help you all a lot. (sorry for all the typos its 3:12am in the morning in NYC and I could not help it, but to get back online and purchase some more books, plus I cannot fall asleep)."},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","review":"This book knocked me for six. An extraordinary and powerful piece. Definately not for the faint hearted. I had to keep putting it down to cry my eyes out. It exposes you completely and empowers you in a way that you can never imagine. I found that i had to keep putting it down several times before i could finish. I described the &quot;value in the valley&quot; to one of my friends as a knock out in the ring. I am not just recommending this to every single female but also male readers. It's helped guide me through a difficult period. I was able to make a very confusing, difficult and the most important decision my life look so easy.Iyanla, when would you be coming to London?"},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","review":"I was first turned onto this book when I raided my sister's bookshelf. She is just as avid a reader as me and I go over her house to get reading material whenever I have run through all of my own. Now I own a copy of this book myself. I just had to have it. No book has come closer to evaluating my real life. If the things in one chapter didn't happen to me, then they have certainly happened to someone I know. I think this book should be required reading for all women, no matter what their age or race. It helps put a method to the madness of our daily lives and the things we endure in relationships."},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","review":"I'm a 26 year old single parent, and just happend to pick this book up by chance.

She said it was a book for black women but it's really for all women. It will help you understand the misfortunes in your life and why we go through the same pain over and over again. When I started to read it, I found myself relating to a lot of the stories these women went through. And then she would explain why we choose the people we choose and why we go through it anyway when we know it's not good for us. I thought it was amazing. I have been recommending it to every woman I know ever since. It's an inspiring book and helps you become strong or stronger. It helps you empower yourself to controlling your life the way you would really want to live it. Definitely a book to read and have in your collection!"},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","review":"Do not try to read this book all the way through or in one sitting. You will be overstuffed, as if you have eaten a large and tasty meal. You will miss the flavorful seasoning, the tender morsels, the fresh, handpicked ingredients with which this book was prepared, if you read too quickly. Trust me, I have made this mistake in the past. I am now learning how to appreciate each word and concept by rereading it sl-o-o-o-wly.My suggestion would be to read one chapter per week (or per month!) and concentrate on it. Or maybe find out what valley you are in and only read about that particular one. Or you could even ask a silent question, then open the book and read wherever Spirit guides you.Can I give this book 6 stars?"},{"Title":"The Value in the Valley: A Black Woman's Guide Through Life's Dilemmas","review":"This is truly one of the best books that I have ever read. From start to finsh, the author captivated me with her spiritual and inspirational style of writing. It is also one of the few books that I did not want to rush to get to the ending. I wanted to savour every last drop of inspiration and knowledge this novel had to offer. I recommend this book to any woman who has ever gone through trials and tribulations in her life. And I don't know any who have'nt. I wish I could have read a book like this a long time ago. I know I would have had a different outlook on life. After reading it, I gave it to my 23 year old daughter to borrow until her copy comes in that I purchased. This is a book you'll want to refer back to time and again. The &quot;valley&quot; she talks about in her book, is what one goes through in life. The &quot;value&quot; is what one learns, when she comes out of the valley, if she truly gets it. There is a whole lot of &quot;value in the valley&quot;. This book has really changed my life, and made me a better person. Too bad the rating ONLY went up to five stars. If you or someone you know find yourself in the valley, do yourself a favor and get this book.

Her references to portions of the book made me want to read it too. When I ordered the book and saw that it was written \\"for Black women\\" it occurred to me that ALL women, whether Black, White, Green or Purple, go theough the same types of trials and difficulties in their journeys through this life, and I have bought a copy for my church library and have recommended it to several of my friends. It also occurs to me that many men would benefit from the heartwarming and inspirational stories in this book, and it is a great resource book for devotional talks.

On the other hand, if you're impatient or have a short attention span, save it for a rainy day or the line @ the DMV. It's chock full of empowering points and lovingly explained, taking nothing for granted and guiding you all the way. &quot;Value&quot; is a treasure, and can actually help you get out of those ruts and start on your individual issues.

I have to order a second book since my sister friend &quot;won't&quot; return mine. I feel this book is one we all should read. Those of us that are constantly doing spiritual work to better ourselves know this as a reference tool for all times. The sister's work is phenomenal.

I have read many in my lifetime. Mostly good, some so-so. It is important to read a book relevant to what one is going through at that time to get the full scope of things from the book we read I believe. Iyanla's books are one of them and one of my favourite authors. The first book I got from Iyanla's collection was \\"Yesterday I Cried\\" and that had helped me through the ditch I was going through at that time. A friend of mine recommended a book of hers \\"One day My Soul Just Opened Up\\" which at that time I had already knew about her and went on to search on amazon her other publications and purchased the whole series of her books. Yeh - crazy me! But hey, she's good! I like her approach in the way she writes and conveys her message. It's real. I can relate to her. I have almost the whole collection of her books that she has published and reading them one by one as I go through my life's ups and downs. For the past few months I've been going through many valleys, I started reading \\"The Value In The Valley\\" which has given me many insights into my own valleys that I am going through and have gone through and approach life and my valleys in a different light. I have just purchased the Audio CD version of it to listen while I drive or at home. Can't wait to get it and the rest of the motivational goodies I just got from other authors. :) Thumbs up to this book as well as Iyanla's other books.

Well, I finally dealt with my &quot;stuff&quot; and finished the book. The power of this book is in its matter of fact, sister to sister, presentation of the obvious. Here in a book is all that good advice, all that stuff you already knew but ignored and really wished you hadn't. Get this book, read it, and pass it on.

The Baha'i Temple is a visual symbol of the Baha'i teachings of unity, and a monument to the ancient and universal dream, the dream of a world at peace. Each Temple traditionally has 9 sides combined with a central dome. This form is then uniquely blended with the most beautiful indigenous traditions.At the present time there are Baha'i Houses of Worship on every inhabited continent of the planet. They were all built with a similar purppose, to provide a place of worship and prayer for men and women from whatever creed or background they might come. They were envisioned as centers of unity encircling the planet and beckoning the human race to a new age of toleration and understanding.These Baha'i Temples standing around the world are located in Wilmette, ner Chicago; Frankfurt, Germany; Sydney, Australia; Samoa in the heart of the Pacific Ocean; Panama City, Central America; Kampala, Uganda (Africa) and New Delhi, India. This attractively produced book describes each of these Temples including the first Baha'i House of Worship which was built in Ishqabad, Turkestan in 1903 (and later demolished). 100 years later designs are being submitted for the newest Baha'i House of Worship yet to be built in Chile.The book takes the form of a series of meditations on various topics: The Language of Symbols; Sacred Spaces; The Garden as Paradise; Water Imagery; The Mountain, the Journey and the Door; Celestial Circles; A Sacred Geometry; an Earthly Paradise; Metaphor for the Manifestation; Universal Symbols; plus Appendices at the end of the book which give a brief history of the Baha'i Faith and some of its basic teachings. In each of the above chapters the author has used examples taken from various religious traditions and beliefs from around the world and there are photos in color and black and white of sacred sites, some familiar and some not so familiar, besides those of the Baha'i Houses of Worship.It is a beautiful book, unusual in its content, and one to be much appreciated by the student of architectural beauty whether professional or layman. I am delighted to have this book in my own personal library."},{"Title":"The Heart of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom for an Agitated World","review":"If you're looking for a book that clearly explains Buddhism without the trappings -- robes, lotus postures, beliefs about reincarnation, talk of cherry blossoms -- The Heart of Buddhism is the book for you. Guy Claxton is an intelligent writer and the writing is compact, condensed; he says a lot in every paragraph. And the writing is straightforward and easy to follow. If reincarnation exists and if Buddha was reincarnated in some modern, English-speaking country, how would he communicate his message? I think it would be very much the way Claxton has done it in this book.Claxton clearly explains how our own general agitation and unease and even our self-centeredness has come about -- how it is really inevitable given our approach -- and how it can be alleviated. An interesting idea I got from this book is that a third of our unhappiness is caused by external circumstances. Two thirds is self-created, and that's what Buddhism is designed to cure.Why is Buddhism becoming more popular? Claxton wrote, 'It is THE 'religion' for a secular age, concerning itself centrally with improving the quality of everyday life, requiring no adherence to obscure or magical beliefs, and offering a penetrating analysis of the condition -- or lack of it -- that we find ourselves in, as well as a powerful and proven set of specific techniques for increasing happiness, kindliness and peace in people's lives.'He goes on: 'Buddhism is really a deep do-it-yourself kit of ideas and practices for changing in the directions that most people would like: more openness, less defensiveness; more tolerance, less irritation; more ease, less worry; more generosity, less selfishness; more naturalness, less self-consciousness; more equanimity, less frustration.'In this book you get a thorough understanding of the Four Noble Truths (written from an understanding of their meaning rather than translating an Asian understanding into English), a clear explanation of the Noble Eightfold Path and the Five Precepts. Claxton describes the different forms of Buddhist meditation and how they work. There is a great chapter near the end of the book on the benefits of Buddhist practice.On page 168 is a spreadsheet showing a 'brand comparison' of the five most popular kinds of Buddhism (Zen, Tibetan, etc.) which rates each for its emphasis on ten different things like 'moral discipline' and 'reverence for lineage.'Buddhism is self-help at its finest. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I can tell you this with authority: Buddhism is one of the finest set of practical self-help tools available on the planet, and Claxton clearly explains how these tools can be used by Westerners. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Heart of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom for an Agitated World","review":"This was my first &quot;buddhist&quot; book. I just decided to try this out.. and it paid off. A great book written for todays westerners.

Great for beginners."},{"Title":"The Heart of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom for an Agitated World","review":"A nice and comprehensive introduction to Buddhism from a Guy who tried the main traditions (Zen, Tibetan and Theravada). Very easy but never superficial reading, complete with glossary and commented bibliography. I found the first couple of chapters a bit slow, but then again this is really intended to be a first book and this reader has read more than a few on the subject. I also wish that Mr Claxton, drawing from his sincretic experience, had extended his comparison of the branches of Buddhism at the end of the book, which is very interesting but too short. Anyway, he delivers what he promises. It is a perfect gift to a friend who is attracted to Buddhism but is clueless."},{"Title":"The Heart of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom for an Agitated World","review":"Buddhism is principally concerned with improving the quality of everyday life.

Guy Claxton's The Heart Of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom For An Agitated World explains what Buddhism is aptly appropriate for any personal, social or global situation today, and goes on to describe how we can each help ourselves individual, with a teacher, in a group, or on our own, through a Buddhist approach to understanding, meditation, discipline and communication. The Heart Of Buddhism is highly recommended reading for students of Buddhist philosophy and practice."},{"Title":"The Heart of Buddhism: Practical Wisdom for an Agitated World","review":"I read several of Guy Claxton books. I typically love them. But, not this one. He is an original, insightful, contrarian, brilliant type of thinker on cognitive science. But, not here. I don't think he defines Buddhism well. And, does not provide the reader with much to work on or understand, unlike most of his other books."},{"Title":"Paper Stories","review":"I try to do atleast one story from this book each month.

But the book explains each step and makes it easy.

It's a book about electronic schematics."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"This book, as you'd hope, *has* helped me a great deal with interpreting schematics. That said, there is still some definite room for improvement, especially in the little things. For instance, the book starts off by going through each basic compnent - This is the symbol for a resistor, etc. This section is exactly what you'd expect to find, and naturally takes you one big step towards understanding the schematics. A chapter later, however, they show several schematics that have the symbol for a ground connection... but they never seem to mention what the symbol means. I knew what it was because I'd starting learning online... but if I hadn't found it online, the book would have left me wondering.I also have come across a few symbols on various shematics that aren't anywhere in the book... which I guess is OK, as this is a beginner's guide, and not a &quot;definitive collection.&quot; I did, however, just expect a little more.With all that said, I would still recommend the book to people just starting out with schematics, because it really will help you, and the price is right."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"I'm not a particularly techie sort of person, but I found I needed to have a grasp of the electronics of some of the equipment I use (I'm a musician). Most beginners books are overwhelming in theory and completeness and end up more confusing than anything else. This book is baby talk and exactly what I needed. The five stars are for its simplicity and usefulness. It has flaws and it's not exciting to read, but it has the simplest explanations of components I have come across. If you don't need to know everything, but just fix your wah wah or explore a little circuit bending, this book will demystify a lot of electronics for you. It won't tell you how to do anything, but it will enable you to figure out what you need to know from more complicated books. If, like me, you've started with electronics a few times and given up because the books you've used have offered way too much information and spent too much time on electrons, or just been written from too knowlegable a point of view (one 'basic' book I tried has four pages on capacitors that I read several times without really ending up knowing what they did), this is the book for you. It will make the books that have frustrated you in the past far more useful."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"This book is an excellent book for anyone who wants to have basic knowledge of reading schematic. I read this book like I was taken a course. It is not a love novel. It took me three weeks because I wanted to adequately digest, understand, and be able to apply what I read. So I didn't run through it like most forks does and be disappointed later. Great book. Anyone wanting to buy this book should do so with a mindset to study it not just read it. Maybe this book needs few improvements but hey what do I know. I got all I wanted out of it."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"I bought this on impulse while ordering another book. Sorry I did, wasted my money. I can't really figure out who the intended audience is: If you have never been exposed to electrical schematics you wouldn't likely want this compendium of symbols with no conceptual background, and if you have had even a little conceptual background you have already been introduced to most of this. You don't need a book to find out what the schematic drawing of a transistor is, for instance, because any instructional material dealing with electronics circuits that you look at will include that information. Reading the individual symbols used in circuit diagrams and schematics isn't difficult- they are just symbols you can look up in any table of electronic symbols. The difficult part is conceptualizing how the components work together by \\"reading\\" the schematic- following the signal or current flow or being able to identify functional blocks, something this book does not help you with. All the circuits used as examples in this book are very basic, and the theory that is discussed is very superficial. I am not saying this book has no value, but it's value is minimal and can be easily found in the introductory chapters of most any primer on electronic circuits. For that I recommend a similar vintage TAB book written by G. Randy Sloan entitled \\"TAB Electronics Guide to Understanding Electricity and Electronics\\"."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"I'm just getting started teaching myself electronics. I've never been able to make heads or tails of a schematic. However, after about 2 evenings reading this book, I now have no problem reading the schematics for the beginners projects I've been working on. This book also explains WHY some of the symbols look the way they do, which goes a long way to help in reading schematics even if there is a symbol a little different than what's in the book. I would recommend this to anyone learning electronics."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"This book was more about symbols and looking them up and not about actually explaining the flow of electricity through circuits. Anybody can look up symbols in a legend and find out what they are and surely we don't need a whole book about it. However getting use to reading the way electricity flows through various circuits and devices can get pretty confusing and this book did very little to help clear up that. That's what I call reading circuits. I thought this book would have various example circuits of increasing complexity and trace the path of current flow through each one and explain some of the anomalies we might encounter. Thumbs down on this one."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to reading schematics","review":"If you have absolutely no experience reading schematics this book will help you some. I got it because I have a basic understanding but wanted to brush up and improve my reading skills. The book was of no real help and I stopped reading it halfway through. They show you symbols but give no real explanation of how the acutal equipment functions in the circuit. The author also does a poor job of going trough the paths of more complicated circuits. There is also a full chapter explanation of \\"symbology\\" that tries to turn into some sort of sociology/linguistics lecture. Totally unhelpful except in the most basic way.

However it turned out to be a massive disappointment. The title is memory management, algorithms and implementations. However, the algorithms don't even really start until the last third of the book, and when they do, they are overly simple, and barely touch on the theory or critical characteristics behind the algorithms. This book is filled with useless tangents, some of the most random of which involving microkernal versus monolithic kernal, scanning of faces at the Super Bowl, and instructions for setting the 80x line of chips from real to protected mode! This book presents no practically useful algorithms, as all of the handling of cases such as growing the memory block are left as 'excercises for the reader' as are performance improvments even though final performance is essential in order to be able to properly compare and contrast the algorithms.In closing, skip this book and pick up either 'Operating System Concepts 6th ed' or 'Operating Systems: Design and Implemenation 2nd ed' which actually have meaningful insight into practical approaches for memory management and concerns."},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"While a lot of books on computer memory end up abstracting their discussion somehow, Blunden's book lies at the opposite end of the spectrum. All aspects of computer memory are examined (hardware level, OS level, application level) and in each instance concrete, non-trivial, examples are presented. Nothing, and I mean nothing, is left to the imagination. This book is nothing short of an exhaustive look at memory management. Engineers interested in this traditionally neglected topic should buy this book!Having read other reviews, I will agree that the material in the last chapter is just a little prophetic."},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"This book, is one of the few computer books I have read from cover to cover - code listings are easy to scan/skip, and the book itself is not huge (however the cost seems fairly high for the size).This book is clearly written, and well researched. It is not for beginners.This book spends time on the hardware aspects of Memory management based on the Intel 386 and above architecture. Real Mode versus protected mode and how the processor design allows for memory protection in protected mode.This is then followed by a survey of Operating Systems, from DOS to Linux to Windows - which is moving from the simple to the complex - and how the OS provides Memory Management services.Then the development of computer languages, and how they allow for memory management starting with COBOL and moving on to Object oriented C++ and Java Virtual Machines.Finally the last part of the book has a lot of code listings with very simplistic memory management and moving into slightly more complex algorithms for memory management for programs. The focus is on introducing multiple approaches and how to measure the real performance of each - some parts of this part of the book seemed like they were repeating the same text in making comments about the code.Overall, I liked the book. I read the Pentium Protected Mode architecture book last year, and it prepared me for this book.I have not done much assembly level x86 programming, but enough to understand what was being shown in the early examples.The book has a very good bibilography of sources for each chapter - six long chapters. I felt, while looking at these bibilographies, that the time spent in going through all of the items in the bibliography was part of the reason that this books price was set so high. The references here are thorough and identify some turning points in computer sciences to me.The structure of the book is the layers by which memory managment is accomplshed - the memory management code is more of an intro. I felt that the book might be targeting Computer Science courses as its real market - the books structure lays down a good foundation for further exploration.The deeper development of Memory Management algorithms is where I too found the book lacking, and the title a bit deceiving - a complaint from another that I would agree with. This is the reason for not giving 5 stars. It would have taken a lot more time to develop the code and write explanations for more complex approaches and the author states this repeatedly in this algorithm section of the book.I am inspired from this book to learn more about x86 assembly language, and to study the actual code of the Linux Kernel.If that sounds of interest to you too, then you should buy this book."},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"This is probably the only book I have ever bought that actually gave a discussion on protected mode that I could follow. He does keep the discussion basic (flat model, no paging), but it got me over the hurdle.I also liked his high-level memory managers. They were to the point and easy to understand. No fancy syntax, no cryptic pointer swizzling,... just straightforward code. What Blunden provides is a solid foundation that has a low learning threshold.Finally, Blunden speaks to the reader in a casual manner, as if you were sipping high-octane coffee somewhere on El Camino BigNum."},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"Memory allocation is a fascinating area, ripe in trade-offs and cutting-edge research. In this book, Bill Blunden manages to provide a pretty-good overview of the topic.It begins with an introduction of the lowest levels - the hardware, namely the CPU memory management unit. Then it goes on to explain how operating systems manage memory - segmentation, paging, virtual memory and what's between them. Next, memory is examined on the programming-language level - compiler-level and heap allocation mechanisms in Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, C and finally Java.The second part of the book is the practice: the author implements several manual memory management schemes (own implementations of malloc/free) in C++, and compares them in terms of performance and other characteristics (like memory fragmentation). Finally, he implements a couple of simple garbage collectors (reference-counting, and mark-sweep), and in the last chapter of the book also briefly mentions the important topic of sub-allocators (also known as \\"pools\\" or \\"arenas\\").Overall, I enjoyed the book. But I do have a few points of (constructive) criticism. First of all, the book is a bit too conversational for such a technical work. It feels like a collection of blog posts, and thus also lacks in depth. For example, the section on memory management of Windows is quite disappointing. As much as I can admire the author's attempt to show his exploration process armed by various tracing and monitoring tools, much of this information is well known and has been described. Instead, I would expect a more thorough presentation of the topic.The other problem is the C++ code. C++ code in books is a pet peeve of mine - for some reason it tends to be exceptionally bad in most of them, and this book is no exception. I won't go into examples because there are simply too many, so just a word of advice: if you intend to follow through this book actually implementing the code (always a good idea!) read about the algorithms the author describes, but write your own implementation. There's nothing good to learn from the C++ code in this book, so you might as well get some more practice on your own."},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"Look out for the name Bill Blunden if you're a systems programmer. In my opinion this man will be one of the best known authors in this area in the next decade. I bought this book thinking all I will get was details on garbage collection algorithms but the author actually takes the reader through memory management at the hardware level in an easy to follow manner. He also reviews how 3 different operating systems actually manage memory.After this, he then jumps into the high level details of memory management for applications.If you're a system programmer, do yourself a favour and buy this book. However, it should be noted that this book is not for the inexperienced. It digs into low level stuff and also assumes that the reader is fluent in C/C++ and assembly."},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"Might not be the book can be put into immediate use, but definitely bring your understanding of memory management to another level, the author has a gift to make complex topic easy to grasp, for example, \\"Siege Warfare\\" is used in the case study of Linux to demonstrate memory protection.Where source code is used like the manual memory manager, it's always keptas simple as possible, I appreciate Bill made effort for the reader to \\"get it\\" instead of impressing them with syntactic acrobatics.The quotes from the first three chapters are:\\"Everyone has a photographic memory. Some people just don't have film.\\"-- Mel Brooks\\"If I could remember the names of all these particles, I'd be a botanist.\\"-- Enrico Fermi\\"My problem is that I have been persecuted by an integer.\\"-- George A. MillerThe author runs out of quote from chapter 4, even thouth, the book still worth a five star given the enlightenment and fun I got from reading, by the way, the author never loses humor even handling the driest topic, makes technical reading an entertainment.The closing quotes at the last page of the book sounds rather like a prophets:\\"We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't.\\"-- Tyler Durden\\"In time, you will come to regard me with not only awe and respect, but love.\\"-- Colossus, speaking to Charles Forbin in Colossus: The Forbin Project (1969)"},{"Title":"Memory Management: Algorithms and Implementations in C/C++ (Windows Programming/Development)","review":"As a public servant involved in technical copyright work, I normally don't stray too far from my area of specialy.

She writes in a personal, relaxed way (often disarmingly so) about her own life, struggles and joys and how her Christianity informs and undergirds relations to the famous and the obscure. One word to men folk: despite its artistic graphics and appearances, &quot;With New Eyes&quot;is not simply a touchy-feely &quot;women's book&quot; - do not dismiss it as such. Maggie writes for &quot;real people&quot; of all genders and ages -- and all faith traditions. Hers is a full-blooded faith, yet one unafraid to honestly confront doubts and admit mistakes. Even though I first read this book in 1998, five years later I recall her vivid word pictures, and reread certain chapters in order to share them with friends and family. As a priest and pastor, I return to &quot;With New Eyes&quot; frequently as both a stimulus for new ideas and interpretations in preaching and teaching, but as refreshment in the midst of &quot;parched deserts&quot; one encounters in the ministry. Maybe what I like best about this book - and why it's the fall 2003 selection for our Christian Education book group - is &quot;With New Eyes&quot; lack of &quot;agenda&quot;. Maggie doesn't want to &quot;save&quot; her readers - nor shame them, impress them or convince them of the rightness of one position or another. This is a simple &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (Four Grammy nominations notwithstanding) generously and bravely revealing herself and her experiences to fellow Pilgrims - with no pretense, puffery or posturing whatsoever. Strange as it sounds, as I finish one chapter, I can almost hear Maggie saying, &quot;...but enough about me! Won't you tell me your story?&quot; And, what's more, somehow I know she'd listen. MY SUGGESTION- Purchase three copies of this book: one for yourself, one for your pastor/priest, and a third as a &quot;loaner&quot;.

This is what Estes claims in this book.

The horrors of war are only hinted at by the author's uncle but the reader easily draws parallels between the transitions in life with a fallow field, a fir tree covered with decorations and the emergence of new life and promise from a piece of fallow ground.

Since that's a mistake, I should also review it here.This book is filled with errata. Not just typos or 'oops, I missed that'-errata, but huge misunderstandings of mathematics and, to a lesser extent, grammar.Some of my favorites:a) Is r prime?(1) [something](2) r^2 = 17^2Answer from CD: (2) is insufficient because r could be 17 or -17 and each is prime.Real answer: Prime numbers are integers > 1 as we all learned in 5th grade or something. This isn't just a little mistake. If negative numbers were prime then 'The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic' (that natural numbers are either prime or UNIQUELY factorable into the product of primes) wouldn't be true. Think the authors of a book teaching math ought to know about 'The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic'?b) A cylindrical barrel is filled with a chemicals. \\"If the chemicals weigh 0.9 kg/l what is the total mass of the chemical in the barrel?\\"(1)[something](2)[something else]Answer from CD: [verbatim] Neither statement is sufficient, either alone or in combination because althought the statements can be combined to give the diameter [and height] of the barrel, there is no way to determine the density of the chemical in question, so there is no way to determine exactly how much of the chemical will fit in a barrel of that sizeReal answer: I almost fell off my chair laughing. Somehow the authors remembered from high school physics that there is something different between mass and weight and then got confused. There is a little wording problem here because kg can be a unit of mass or weight and they're mixed here. However, anywhere on Earth the 1 significant digit figure means you can mix up mass and weight with no problem. If 0.9 kg/l is not a density, I don't know what a density looks like. Perhaps the authors didn't know that 1000 liters = 1 Cubic meter (fourth grade?).c) [Drawing of 4x4 grid of city blocks of equal length]How many different routes can Casey the cabdriver take from the Northwest corner to the SouthEast corner that travel the shortest possible distance?Answers: A.9 B.11 C.14 D.16 E.18Answer from CD: E. There are 18 routes that drive '3 blocks down and 3 blocks right. If these possibilities are expressed as D and R, the total possibilities are: DDDRRR, DDRRRD, DDRRDR,....'Real answer: Casey needs to go three blocks South (S) and three blocks East (E) so the number of routes are the number of ways of arranging three \\"S\\"'s in 6 spots and then filling in the open spots with \\"E\\"'s. This is 6 choose 3 = 20, which has the decided weakness of not being one of the answers. Of course for fun, you can find which routes the authors missed in their \\"exhaustive\\" list (they are: DRRDDR and RDDRRD). Is this the way the authors want you to solve these problems? What if there were 10 city blocks? BTW - The answers to these city block questions are always numbers from Pascal's triangle and usually near the top and the middle, so if you have to guess it's very likely to be 10, 15, 20, or 35. None of the choices on the exam are reasonable numbers from Pascal's triangle.d) [Bunch of stuff that says a scientist sampled 20,000 fruit flies and found that 6 of them had a genetic mutation] [verbatim] \\"How many fruit flies would the scientist need to include in his experiment in order to have a reasonable expectation of locating approximately 50 fruit flies with the mutation in question?\\"Answer from CD: 250,000 because 1/5000 has the mutation.Real answer: I haven't a clue. \\"Reasonable expectation\\" is not a mathematical term. \\"Expectation\\" is a mathematical term that ought to be used here, but the question needs to be phrased more technically than the GMAT's require. If I appeal to the Central limit theorem here, I have approximately a 50% chance of having at least 50 mutations if I sample 250,000 fruit flies. Is that a \\"reasonable expectation\\"? Who knows?And I could go on and on and on (the verbal ones are not as bad, but still pretty bad).The book says 'Aim for the High 600's!' on the cover. Personally, I think that is not a very high aspiration. If you buy this book and try to learn from it, your ceiling will move from 800 to the high 600's (which is probably the ability level of the authors). Want to spend $30 and some time doing that? I think you would be nuts to buy this book when there are a bunch of pretty good alternatives out there."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's GMAT with CD-Rom (McGraw-Hill's GMAT (W/CD))","review":"The format of this book is nice, but it is filled with errata. The verbal section seems to have fewer than the quant section and the book seems to have fewer than the CD. For example, one of the CD answers includes the fine statement before an incorrect answer that 'There is (probably) an infinite number of prime numbers' when in fact 'There are (easily provably by any college math major) an infinite number of prime numbers'. This lack of erudition is evident throughout the sample tests. Particularly troubling to me were the frequent question asking 'what are the odds?'. 'Odds' is a fine concept but it doesn't mean the same thing as probability, unbeknownst to the authors (if the probability of an event is 1/3 the odds are 2:1 against, but the authors evidently don't know this). Many of the asnwers on the CD are of the ilk 'Statement 1 is true. Plug in numbers to verify'. This is a terrible solution, made worse by the answer being wrong in places. Even simple grammar explanations in the book are incorrect (e.g., 'either ... or' always requires a singular verb according to the authors which just isn't true, as it requires a verb matching the closest antecedent). Other examples include a clumsy and/or incorrect definition of the standard deviation (how many places on the web could they have gotten this?), the statement that 0^0 always equals 1, etc., etc..The front of the book says 'Aim for the high 600's or better!' and this book will help with that. If you need help with basics and you are going to miss the hard questions anyway, buy this book. Otherwise, I think it's best to find a book by authors with higher aspirations and a better grasp on the material they are supposed to be teaching. I don't know who Hasik, Rudnick, and Hackney are, but there certainly aren't academics or, I would bet, particularly high scorers on the GMAT's themselves.Oh - HarveyWallbanger below - '0' is definitely an integer.

The book is ok, and I plan to finish it as part of the test preparation.

This teaching of Jesus Christ, known as the Golden Rule is the starting point of human relations building in this book's discussion on the laws of life. Another principle Jesus taught is found near the conclusion, i.e., that of giving. Templeton writes &quot;Giving makes you a magnet for success&quot; (p. 299).In between these two principles there are numerous other words of advice.On individual growth, Edison is quoted saying &quot;If you are doing anything the way you did twenty years ago, there is a better way&quot; (p. 273).We're reminded of the fact that &quot;success feeds on itself and creates move success&quot; (p. 259).Writing on the quality of life being manifested by one's thoughts, Templeton observes quotes Arnold Patent (p. 251) who noted &quot;What we focus on expands.&quot;A discussion on work being a revelation of one's gift is worth attention. He cites the Latin origin of the word &quot;vocation&quot; as being &quot;to call&quot; and goes on to say that one's work is a person's calling.

The book is divided into three distinct parts. The first section centers on &quot;Religion and Ideology&quot;; here, authors look at fractions among Protestant sects during their time period, and the mututally reinforcing ideas of domesticity and religion. The second section is called &quot;Economic Structure and Opportunity.&quot; It begins with a discussion of middle class attitudes towards property, especially as it effects providing income for a family. The other discussion in this section looks at men and women's respective roles in the economy, focusing on men's action and women as the &quot;hidden investment.&quot; The final section, &quot;Everday Life: Gender in Action,&quot; looks at marriage, the respective roles of motherhood and fatherhood, defintion and importance of the home, how gender was registered and finally, middle class influcen in the reform-minded public sphere. Family Fortunes is a big, thick, informative book which is well worth reading for people interested in the rise of the middle class, and social or religious history. Though clearly scholarly in focus it is relatively accessible, and the use many different textual sources helps to illustrate some of the more dense parts of Davidoff and Hall's arguments."},{"Title":"Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class, 1780-1850 (Women in Culture and Society Series)","review":"Family Fortunes is an account of the rise of the middle class, both as a class and as individuals, in England between 1780 and 1850. The book's focus is on \\"the delineation of gender difference at a time of rapid economic, political and social change.\\" It argues that class consciousness always takes a gendered form and that the sexual division of labor within families was central to the development of capitalist enterprise. This approach rehearses arguments that are commonplace in feminist historiography, but Davidoff and Hall add a significant dimension to the case and hold their reader's attention through a narrative built around religion and ideology, economic structure and opportunity, and an account of gender in action in everyday life. Their section on religion and ideology is particularly informative and the strengths and weaknesses of the book can be ascertained by examining this section's analysis and contentions. (p.13)Religion played an important role in shaping the culture of the emerging middle class. Even though attitudes towards masculinity, femininity, and the family varied among the different Christian denominations, all accepted that the home had to act as the basis of moral order in the immoral world of the market. The family therefore stood at the center of attempts to construct a moral order for capitalism. Indeed the concept of the Christian family was a metaphor for the organization of society. The Birmingham Independent minister, John Angell James, stated that the family: \\"when directed as it should be, has a sacred character, inasmuch as the head of it acts the part of both the prophet and the priest of his household, by instructing them in the knowledge, and leading them in worship, of God; and, at the same time he discharges the duty of King by supporting a system of order, subordination and discipline.\\" By extension, a congregation of believers gathered in a church was regarded as a family. The concept was also applied, through the language of paternalism, to social structures where the servants and laborers of the middle class man were seen \\"as the dependants and children of their father, their master, their guardian.\\" Similarly business partners \\"were in some senses brothers who represented each other.\\" (p.109, p.89, p.21, & W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law, cited ibid., p.200.)For middle class men the church also provided an opportunity to display their worthiness for public office by acting as church officials and engaging in public works. Davidoff and Hall note that by \\"the early nineteenth century the traditional concept of stewardship associated with aristocratic patronage and the devolution of obligations from the lord to his agent was transposed into religious discourse.\\" (pp.73-74)The position the church assigned to women was filled with tension. In an eulogy of a pious Christian woman, James wrote that \\"the same blessed page which proclaims your dishonour in the sin of your first mother, displays the glorious part you are to bear in the instrumentality of saving a lost world.\\" Because of Eve's transgression, women had to suffer. Through childbirth woman suffered and came to understand the nature of sin. At the same time, childbirth opened a road to personal salvation through the link between maternity and salvation established by Mary the mother of Jesus. The need for women to contain their sexuality, through service to the family, justified women's social subordination even if men and women were spiritually equal. Subordination did not imply inferiority but separate spheres of activity. The home and children were women's sphere. Because of the pressures of business men left the moral education of children to women. This situation led to a contradictory position for many women personified in the life and attitudes of Hannah More. In her writings, More confined women to the domestic sphere but argued for the central importance of woman's influence in nurturing morality in an immoral world. She played a leading part in public moral crusades arguing that the home was the only sure basis for a moral nation. More's terrain was the contested ground that Davidoff and Hall see \\"between the recognition of influence [within the home and on children] and the marking out of the female sphere.\\" Women often had to enter the male sphere to provide for themselves and/or their families. But this was an action open to condemnation unless presented in terms of maternal necessity or along religious lines as in the activities of More. (p.115, p.114, p.171, & p.117)Davidoff and Hall comment that religion was the key \\"that could give meaning to women's experience and express some of their aspirations.\\" While this was no doubt true, the authors here come up against the issue of oppressed/oppressor relations. Woman may well have used religion to give their life meaning, and to give voice to some of their aspirations, but the parameters of the discourse of religion ultimately were set by men for men. Women's experience within these parameters may have been rich and fruitful, but their experience was still within a male discourse. Hall and Davidoff are sensitive to this issue, but they offer nothing to move us beyond the impasse of a hegemonic oppressor discourse. For instance in discussing women's philanthropic work they argue: \\"Women may not have been exerting real social power and engineering major social change through their associations, but nor were they simply taking as given the boundaries of female social action.\\" (my emphasis.) What, we may ask, would it have taken for women to exercise real social power? Davidoff and Hall regard the period as one when there may well have been more cooperation between middle class men and women because they were involved in shaping the basis of their identity in middle class families. It was only when this identity was established that the isolated and trivialized nature of the domestic sphere became apparent. In other words women played a part in shaping a middle class identity that debased women's place in society. The authors show how the male discourse was able to override attempts by women to create a position for themselves that engendered respect but the reader is left to ponder whether the situation could have been, or ever could be, different. If the aim of Family Fortunes was only to recount the rise of the middle class this lack of analysis would not be such a serious shortcoming, but given that the authors specifically link themselves to \\"the Women's Liberation Movement and the questions which feminist history has raised\\" the reader is justified in expecting some discussion of the difficulties in moving beyond a hegemonic discourse. (p.148, p.430, p.454, & p.11.)In some ways this criticism is unfair because, in general, historians who deal with the social relations that stand behind an analytical term like hegemony have not confronted the issue of how to move beyond one set of relations to another. The greater the degree of dominance the more likely this statement is to be true. For instance E.P. Thompson's Making of the English Working Class displays some hope for alternative social relations in the nineteenth century whereas David Montgomery's The Fall of the House of Labor is ultimately a grim reminder of the ability of capitalism to gain compliance from American workers. Few historians are as successful as Davidoff and Hall in showing how a shared ideology, and its practice in everyday life, produces hegemonic relations. With the understanding they provide it is possible to ask how real power can be exercised by women and other groups whose interests are marginalized by hegemonic discourses."},{"Title":"The Fantastic Art of Sulamith Wulfing","review":"At last, a book about the mysterious Sulamith W&uuml;lfing that actually discusses her artistic techniques, albeit in a single paragraph. The vast majority of her works were created as follows: \\"first, the drawing was made with a hard #2 drawing pencil; then water colors were applied with a #4 brush made from marten hair; palm and fingers were then used to 'daub' the paint; and finally whiting was added where necessary.\\"For those of us who are primarily interested in her use of color, a major part of her work unfortunately remains in the black-and-white stage. This book has 31 full-page color reproductions, and eight of those that lack color other than a delicate sepia and gray with white highlights.The editor, David Larkin advances the notion that Sulamith W&uuml;lfing was not primarily a fantasist as were Rackham and Dulac. She was born in 1901 into a very spiritual German family (her father was a Theosophist) and \\"her earliest memories include seeing the angels, 'gnomes' and small, delicate creatures which have always populated her drawings.\\"My own preference is for her fairy tale illustrations such as the \\"The Saving from the Little Mermaid\\" which is tinted with the muted rainbows of mother-of-pearl. Her Madonnas and Holy Families seem a bit stiffer, more gorgeously robed, rather in the style of Byzantine mosaics.For close to seventy years, Sulamith W&uuml;lfing created works of extreme beauty, using the delicate palette of the aurora, the interiors of sea shells, the pure glints of a glacier's interior. Rackham also used this Northern palette but his drawings were more restless, some with the ferocity of a stormy sea. W&uuml;lfing draws on the calmer, deeper vein of a Midsummer's Eve. Flowers and strangely beautiful reptiles abound. Mysterious knights meet gorgeously robed maidens by the light of the evening star. A mermaid floats peacefully, eyes closed, in the foamy arms of the sea.You'll have to decide for yourself which of Sulamith W&uuml;lfing's styles you like best. This book is a wonderful place to meet her."},{"Title":"The Fantastic Art of Sulamith Wulfing","review":"Because there really isn't another book like it, this book is a priceless anthology of mystic artist Sulamith Wulfings's work. As such it is a very good collection, comprised of some of her most popular and loved pieces. Larkin has also included a number of lesser known pieces as well, making this a good starting point for those interested in exploring this unique, underrated artist.My one gripe is the quality of the prints leaves something to be desired. Having owned an original copy of Band XX, the limited edition her family press put out of her illustrations for The little Mermaid, I know what they were intended to look like. There are several prints from that series included in the book, and the palette is somewhat darker here than it was in the originals. You can't really fully appreciate Wulfings's craft until you see a decent print. She had a lot more technique than most people realize. No wonder she was dubbed, \\"Durer's little daughter\\". Still, with no competition to speak of, I would urge the enthusiast to track down a used copy of this book. I found mine thru Alibris and paid just double the original list price of $7.95 and was happy to do so.

He faced the reality of living in a complex, disorderly world on a daily basis as he ministered to the needs of his parish. Father John teaches the seeker of the hard truth how to face life's challenges with God's support, rather than trying to go it alone. And what is the hard truth? That in facing our sins (anything that separates us from God) and humbling ourselves through a life of prayer, we become more able, not less, to be effective intercessors for our brothers and sisters who are poor in spirit, mistreated, and troubled; as well as more centered, creative, and joyful in our own lives. Father John's counsel offers a way to organize, deepen, and enrich your life. This book is not to be missed by anyone desiring a Christian lifestyle that incorporates all the beauty, mystery, and devotion the Orthodox Christian Church has to offer."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Counsels of Father John of Kronstadt","review":"With this book, \\"The Spiritual Counsels of Father John of Kronstadt\\", Jardine W. Grisbrooke has presented to us exactly that: the spiritual advise of a truly saintly man of \\"The Church\\" . . . and a man who knew the day to day troubles and needs of the \\"everyman\\". Fr. John wan't a \\"monk\\" following an arranged and artificial daily structured ritual-life . . . he was a pastor in a parish and lived with and among the everday people. . . and there must have been a recognizable sharing of their lives by him because he was much loved during his own lifetime. No \\"hagiographic embellishments\\" were needed to establish him in the minds and hearts of any who knew him . . or even for those who \\"encounter\\" him now, via stories and books and his own writings, \\"My Life In Christ\\" from which the cousels in this book are excerpetd.God has been so provident, that He has never faikled to place in our midst individuals who \\"glow with' and \\"reflect\\" the transcendent light of heaven incarnate . . . the St. Paul saying is \\"it is no longer \\"i\\" who live but Christ Who lives in me\\" . . . and a procession of such \\"lights\\" have existed and walked among us since the very fist generation of believers and even until now . . . and doubtless will continue to be found in our world until the end of time. Father John of Kronstadt was just such a man.This book gives us his words . . his instructions . . his thoughts .. in a way, his \\"presence\\" so that we too can encounter and experience his reflection of \\"Christ living within him\\". . . it is the same Christ we too desire to live within ourselves (and Who does indeed already in ways mysterious and mystical, but no less real). Reading Saint John of Kronstadt's words help us to recognize that light within us . . .to see it for what and for Who it is: Christ. (There was a term popular in theology some years back: \\"annonymous christian\\" . . . that is, people who \\"did the will of God\\" though they themselves may not have recognized themselves as actual believers . .they wanted to 'do right\\" . . strove to \\"do right' and \\"did do right\\" . . . with a little bit of light to make their inner souls visible to themselves, they might not then be \\"annonymous christians\\" but would recognize themselves as \\"de facto christians\\" . . .

He epitomised all that there is to being an Orthodox priest - kindly, humble, constantly immersed in prayer and loved by all - rich and poor alike. Kronstadt itself during St John's life, was an extremely undesirable place to live. Yet following in the Lord's footsteps, St John was there as one of Christ's workers in calling all to salvation - he comforted the broken hearted, helped the sick, poor and needy and constantly offered prayers and intercessions for all. He placed great importance on prayer being constantly on the lips and serving the Sacraments daily. To him, the Sacraments were medicine that sustained him in fulfilling his priestly duties.In his counsels, St John talks of the importance of prayer both for ourselves but especially for others, together with gratitude as a means of healing the sick soul - too often we take care of the body, but care next to nothing for the soul. The one way of healing our spiritual infirmities is by fervent prayer and supplication as well as thanksgiving to the Lord. He teaches men to have complete faith in God - to give gratitude to God for all things, good and bad and to give up our own will and replace this with God's will. This holy saint counsels the faithful on other issues of importance - issues as relevant in his day as they are today such as gluttony and drunkenness, fasting and abstinence, humility, irritability, malice, almsgiving, the ordering of our daily lives and many other issues which are of great importance to amending one's life for the better.Saint John's spiritual counsels are like sweet honey for anyone with an open heart hungering for righteousness. This book is a pleasure to read; no parts of it left me confused or wanting to skip over. I've read it twice so far in the space of two months and with God's help will continue to read it throughout the remainder of my life.

But on the contrary I found his book fascinating. Over all I thought Campbell-Kelly weaved together many hard-to-find facts and statistics into a comprehensive, well-researched, and well-written story of how the software industry evolvedBasically, it reviews the development of the various software industry segments; what we now refer to as professional services companies, enterprise product software companies, personal computer software companies and game companies. For each, it describes the major events that created these industry segments&#65533;e.g. in 1970 IBM unbundled its software pricing from its hardware pricing ushering in age of product software companies; the major companies who dominated these segments; and the business models.A few things that were of particular interest to me.When I grew up in the software business, we used lines of code as a way to estimate the work it would take to create an application. I have overseen the development of systems with millions of lines of code. So I was surprised to learn how few lines of code were in DOS 2.0, just 20,000+, and even more surprised to learn that the venerable early business language Fortran, in its first incarnation, was only 18,000 lines of code.And it helped put into context what I have lived through. For example, in 1973, straight out of C.C.N.Y., I first entered the job market as young Cobol programmer trainee at Royal-Insurance Company in New York. As a youngster I had no awareness that Thomas Watson Jr. bet his business on the IBM360, or that it was the reason for IBM&#65533;s unprecedented industry dominance. I just knew that I worked on IBM 370-145, an updated, at that time, version of the IBM 360.And does this sound familiar? &#65533;Never before has the stock market shown quite so much enthusiasm about an industry as it has lately about the computer industry. Recent prices of computer stocks represent some of the highest prices-earning ratios ever recorded. Even shares of giant I.B.M, which increased six fold between 1957 and late 1966, have doubled since. In July the market valued I.B.M., whose physical assets amount to less than $6 billion , at more than $40 billion&#65533;more than any other company in the word, actually as much as gross national product of Italy. And the market value of smaller and newer companies in the industry has gone up even more steeply than I.B.M.&#65533;s. In less than three years the price of University Computing Co. of Dallas rose form $1.50 a share(adjusted for splits) to $155. The stock market valued this newcomers, who sales last year were than $17 million, at more than $600 million.&#65533;This quote that Cambell-Kelly provides is about the timeframe 1964-1968, which was another time period of &#65533;irrational exuberance,&#65533; like our recent dot.com debacle. Only I hope that our recovery will be sooner than that one. It evidently, took almost ten years for the market to again buy software company stock.I do have one quibble, though. Campbelly-Kelly challenges the common perception that Microsoft dominates the technology industry. He quite correctly cites statistics which show that, even if Microsoft is a giant, IBM is a titan, towering over Microsoft; where Microsoft has at most owned 10% of the software industry, IBM owned fully 75% of the entire IT industry consisting of computer hardware, software and services. To put this into perspective, the total of computer hardware, software and services revenues world-wide today is thought to be something like $1 trillion. If IBM had maintained its earlier level of control it would now be worth $750 billion while Microsoft today has revenues of roughly $28 billion. His point is that while IBM was almost the entire industry by itself, Microsoft controls just a piece of the software industry.While this is true, I don&#65533;t believe the issue of Microsoft&#65533;s dominance is about revenues. I believe it is about cultural impact--which Campbell-Kelly does allude to. Microsoft, almost single-handed, created a cultural revolution, making it fashionable to be a nerd, to dress casually in business, to work insane hours, to believe as a young twenty-something you can be an over-night millionaire. Whereas IBM made an impact on businesses--certainly being viewed for a long time as one of, if not, the best-run business on the planet--Bill Gates and company, captured the public&#65533;s imagination and changed our society in a way IBM never did. And why not, when Bill Gates and Paul Allen are the first and third richest men in the world.All in all though, this book was an enjoyable and insightful read."},{"Title":"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry (History of Computing)","review":"This is a history of the Software Industry. &quot;Software&quot; was coined to distinguish it from hardware; it describes the spirit that activates electronic machines. There are three sectors: software contracting, corporate software products, and mass-market software products (pp.3-8). The book covers events from around 1950 to 1995 in the USA. Chapter 1 gives an overview of the sources available. Chapter 2 tells of the origins of software writing, and its need for high-maintenance. Could errors arise from &quot;one minor change&quot;? Early users cooperated in sharing software. FORTRAN and COBOL became the first standard programming languages. But high costs and slipped schedules became typical. Government support for SAGE helped establish US dominance of the computer industry (p.48). The &quot;Great Society&quot; led to investments in non-defense projects.Chapter 3 discusses &quot;Programming Services&quot;. The established techniques of engineering management filtered into programming projects. Program flowcharts became institutionalized, then flushed away by the &quot;fad for 'structured programming'&quot; (p.69). The boom for software companies in the late 1960s reminds me of the dot-com fever in the late 1990s. All fueled from government spending (p.75, P.80). The arrival of minicomputers around 1970 allowed middling companies to own a computer. Chapter 4 tells about the change to &quot;Software Products&quot;. Computers were more plentiful and more powerful (pp.90-91), programmers didn't keep up. Lines of code used increased 1000% every 5 years, the cost of developing quadrupled by 1965. Page 100 discusses flowcharting, whose purpose was to graphically represent a program's operations. Sort of like a condensed slide presentation of a topic. Page 102 tells of a secret machine instruction used to improve sorting speed (what was it?).Chapter 5 tells how the software industry acquired its current shape, and gives an overview. Software products was a capital goods business. Industry specific software requires in-depth knowledge; in systems software programming skills are critical. The success of CICS can be compared to a system of roads where applications can freely travel (p.151). Chapter 6 discusses the maturing of corporate software packages, and growth through acquisition. It focuses on three large firms that became prominent in the 1990s. Some grew by acquiring smaller firms for their products (diversification). The rise of the relational database had an adverse affect on older database technologies. The use of fully integrated business application software (ERP) created new companies. Pages 182-4 overviews the successes of Computer Associates. A relational database did not require knowledge of the internal structure of the database; ever faster computers masked its relative inefficiency. Sales of SAP R/3 benefited from the &quot;fad for business re-engineering&quot; (p.195). Page 197 explains why SAP is more important that Microsoft.There are strong parallels with other historical systems, such as railroads to airlines. If the database was bundled with the operating system there would be no independent vendors. European firms were able to pioneer ERP because they not not been locked into &quot;legacy software&quot; (p.199). The remaining chapters discuss the history of the personal computer."},{"Title":"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry (History of Computing)","review":"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog may sound like a mystifying title, but this book provides a reasonable overview of the history of the software industry.

The &quot;Acknowledgments&quot; lists his sources and references. Chapter 7 reviews the early development of microcomputers. The invention of the microprocessor in 1971 made microcomputers possible (p.201). The Apple II was the transforming event of April 1977. The fall 1979 release of VisiCalc transformed &quot;toy computers&quot; into a useful machine for businesses. Digital Research's CP/M allowed any application to run on any computer that used CP/M; this allowed program vendors to access a larger market. Microsoft eclipsed DR by providing DOS for the IBM PC, and its games and programming languages. PC software was usually sold by mail, then at stores. The invention of VisiCalc is credited as boosting the market for personal computers. Productivity applications drove the software industry in the early 1980s (p.215). Word processing was aimed at home computing; Word Star was the most successful. Most computer games were produced by sole authors, lasted a few months, and made little money.Chapter 8 discusses the now mature PC industry. Why did a few companies succeed where many failed? &quot;The Autodesk File&quot; says: product improvements, complementary products, training networks (p.243). Technical competence does not guarantee success unless it meets user needs (p.244). The need to work with two or more applications simultaneously led to &quot;windowing&quot; (p.247); but this required more time and money than first estimated (p.251). Page 253 tells of the big mistake by Lotus' management in rewriting the program. A similar mistake doomed Word Star (p.255). Ashton-Tate's demise is described on page 257. These were one-product companies. Page 259 explains Microsoft's winning strategy for its Office Suite. Page 264 tells of Symantec's strategy for success.Chapter 9 describes software used for entertainment, and looks at videogames, CD-ROM encyclopedias, and personal finance software. Arcade games replaced older pinball machines during the 1970s. Videogame consoles for the home allowed playing many games. Home computers had a keyboard and secondary storage, and could be programmed by the user. Videogames are similar to recorded music's stream of new titles, and relatively short life. The purpose of a CD-ROM with an encyclopedia was to justify the cost of a computer (p.289). Microsoft's Encarta broke into the 1993 consumer market with multimedia. This coincided with the falling price for CD-ROM drives (p.292), and lowered prices for CD-ROM software. By the early 1990s Quicken was the best selling consumer software product of all time. Its founder entered a crowded field with no track record, an untried product developed by a single programmer (p.295). It was designed to be easy to use, and continually improved.Chapter 10 discusses the success of Silicon Valley, and the economic and physical environment that created its culture (p.303). Hardware companies tended towards success, software companies less so (p.304). The great number of computers in the US created a market for software companies. The prices for their mature products ruled out competitors. This pattern continued to the personal computer age. One effect of manpower training is to create off-shore body shops to benefit US multi-national corporations. Clustering firms in a small geographic area helps, as does Government subsidies (like the Internet). But misdirecting support can hurt rather than help (p.311). [I found Robert X. Cringely's book to be better.]"},{"Title":"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry (History of Computing)","review":"The emphasis of the book is on the economic history of the software industry. There is a very small number of references to the technological developments that enabled the progress that the author outlines. Among others, he leaves out the one significant event that explain, for example, the mushrooming of Microsoft. The author glosses over the importance of the scientific and technological aspects of software development and their influence on the history of software. Also, in the exposition of his methodology (he is a &quot;certified&quot; historian) he says that most of the software history writings are anecdotal -- but that his isn't. Then throughout the book we find lots of quotes of peoples opinions; of tables published in magazines whose origins are not questioned or cross-validated. This does not ring of rigorous historical research and the double and triple typical crosschecks. In a nutshell, if what one is looking for financial &quot;facts&quot; regarding the software industry history -- which company was the first, second, etc., money wise, during a given decade, then you will enjoy the book.

Campbelly-Kelly challenges the common perception that Microsoft dominates the technology industry. He quite correctly cites statistics which show that, even if Microsoft is a giant, IBM is a titan, towering over Microsoft; where Microsoft has at most owned 10% of the software industry, IBM owned fully 75% of the entire IT industry consisting of computer hardware, software and services. To put this into perspective, the total of computer hardware, software and services revenues world-wide today is thought to be something like $1 trillion. If IBM had maintained its earlier level of control it would now be worth $750 billion while Microsoft today has revenues of roughly $28 billion. His point is that while IBM was almost the entire industry by itself, Microsoft controls just a piece of the software industry.While this is true, I don't believe the issue of Microsoft's dominance is about revenues. I believe it is about cultural impact--which Campbell-Kelly does allude to. Microsoft, almost single-handed, created a cultural revolution, making it fashionable to be a nerd, to dress casually in business, to work insane hours, to believe as a young twenty-something you can be an over-night millionaire. Whereas IBM made an impact on businesses--certainly being viewed for a long time as one of, if not, the best-run business on the planet--Bill Gates and company, captured the public's imagination and changed our society in a way IBM never did. And why not, when Bill Gates and Paul Allen are the first and third richest men in the world.All in all though, this book was an enjoyable and insightful read."},{"Title":"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry (History of Computing)","review":"There has been a need for an authoritative history of the software industry, and this book fills the gap. It is entertaining and gives an excellent account of the origins and development of the various sectors of the industry. Its focus is wholly on the United States, a decision for which the author gives full justification, but despite my interest in the UK software industry I still found the book fascinating and illuminating. It provides an important corrective to a number of myths, from the Software Crisis to the dominance of Microsoft, and offers plenty of evidence in support of its analysis. There are entertaining illustrations at the beginning of each chapter. As a university lecturer, I shall certainly be using this book extensively and referring my students to it."},{"Title":"From Airline Reservations to Sonic the Hedgehog: A History of the Software Industry (History of Computing)","review":"While I enjoyed the book, especially for it's exploration of the early days of the software industry there is this rather curious mistake.\\"In March 1983, Warner Communications decided to cut its losses and sell Atari. The video console and home computer division was sold to Commodore Business Machines, the arcade videogame division to the Japanese firm Namco.\\"It was in 1984 and it was to Jack Trammiel, the founder of Commodore. Warner retained the arcade business.It makes me wonder how true the rest of these facts are in the book or whether this is a one off mistake.

The plot is precisely orchestrated. The symbolism is clear and allegoric. Both Old and New Testament allusions flow between the lines. The theme is intense and unified.

The diction is creatively suggestive. The characters are plausible and consistent.I think this is a masterpiece! The conclusion is strong and symbolic.

I'm not Jewish, so what a miracle to find Roth's Itzie confronting the rabbi in the same way I was confronting nuns with similarly confrontational questions - and at about the same age. (There wasn't any hitting involved, but parents were called.)From a simply technical perspective, Roth keeps the energy of the story going ever higher (appropriately enough) until.... Well, you'll just have to read the story. I first ran across this story in a battered copy of \`Best Short Stories of 1959' which had been abandoned at some summer house. I don't remember any other stories in the book.Whether you are Itzie, \`always with the questions,' or Blotnik, for whom things are either \`Good for the Jews or Bad for the Jews,' there is one take-away message from \`The Conversion of the Jews' we can all agree on: You should never hit anybody about God."},{"Title":"The Conversion of the Jews (Short Stories Series)","review":"A smart-alecky adolescent wants to prove that if God is almighty as Jews claim, He could have impregnated Mary with Jesus. Thus, in his mind, and apparently from the author's perspective, the Jews are to blame for inter-religious strife arising from their bigoted refusal to give creedence to fundamental Christian precepts.The Gentiles who read the story consider it a noble proclamation for religious tolerance. But the blood that spilled in the two thousand years since the death of Jesus has been the blood of Jews, hideously, brutally murdered by Christians believing they were doing the word of their lord. Roth attempts to create a totally false impression that he alone among the Jews is sufficiently wise and broad-minded to preach respect for tenets of other religions. But in fact it has always been a first principle of Judaism that any religion teaching belief in one God and charity and requiring just dealings among mankind is a valid religion. {These are the laws that the Jews' God imposed on the sons of Noah.) Christianity, by contrast, historically has deemed itself the one true faith, and many non-believers suffered awful deaths as a result.Roth wrote this story to broaden his readership beyond the small population of Jews in America -- who would find his charicatures of themeslves funny--so that he could sell his work to wider audiences. For Roth, the royalties he sought justified his trashing the truths about his people and supplying ammunition to those who would ridicule my brothers and sisters.

This book is well researched and clearly proves that their was a thriving gay culture in San Francisco well before the Stonewall uprising in New York. The idea that San Francisco was able to sustain a gay community based upon its \\"wide open\\" ideology and its status as a shipping port and military base also helped further cement this position as a gay bulwark in America.

It is the first in a dark fantasy trilogy Lustbader wrote before his early mainstream book THE NINJA went on to become a bestseller and he ceased writing record reviews in Rolling Stone. The second of the trilogy, SHALLOWS OF NIGHT, is a strong follow-up. The protagonist, Ronin, flees the claustrophobic subterranean cylinder world of this novel and winds up in a pseudo-Edo. The feudal politics, well-portrayed Japanese culture and new cast members are an interesting shift of gears. Unfortunately the trilogy stalls in the rushed and shabbily edited third volume DAI SAN. When, halfway through the book, Lustbader discards Ronin's name and begins identifying the character as the Sunset Warrior the series dies before the lengthy, predictable battle scene climax.SUNSET WARRIOR is the best of the three and could be read as a standalone novel even though some of the bad guys survive. The ultra-violent martial arts combat is vivid, jumping off the page. The original characters and novel premise coupled with Lustbader's stylistic writing (mostly his employment of sentence fragments) all combine to make for a good action adventure tale with an inventive twist. And a clever ending."},{"Title":"The Sunset Warrior","review":"This book is a must-read for all fantasy readers.

Lustbader is great at developing a dark forbidding world were nothing is as it seems. The characters are complex and mysterious with overtones of a society were duty is place above all else.

We follow the adventures of Ronin, a gifted, self-conflicted warrior, trapped in a decaying underground community that has been cut off from the rest of the world. With advanced technology increasingly falling into disrepair, conflicts in the Freehold are settled by swordplay, which makes dueling experts like Ronin valuable to the powers that be. The Sunset Warrior is an entertaining mix of political intrigue, love, loss, betrayal and vividly described battle scenes. It's a bit uneven in places, and Ronin is not as sympathetic a character as some readers might like, but these minor complaints aside, this is a fun, fast, exciting read, highly recommended to fans of escapist fiction."},{"Title":"The Sunset Warrior","review":"Eric Van Lustbader writes a great fantasy novel!The premise of \\"the Sunset Warrior\\" (and the trilogy in general) is based on the idea that some great ecological disaster has taken place. People have been driven underground, but so long ago that those that are left have lost the history and reason why they have left the face of the planet. The technology that has supported the peoples of the \\"freehold\\" is beginning to shut down and the people have split into a feudal, caste system similar to 16th century Japan. There are none left that completely understand how their technology works (not far from where we are today).Enter Ronin, a highly skilled warrior and free thinker and he begins to ask questions.This novel is so very human: it questions the mores and attitudes that most of us just accept as reality. It is about the sacrifice that each of us must make in order to \\"fit in\\" and in contrast, the sacrifices that we make to be genuinely ourselves. \\"Sunset Warrior\\" is a wonderful metaphor for questioning the \\"machine\\" that we all live in today.An orginal fantasy that is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Sunset Warrior","review":"If only they made more books like this one.

I am a lover of American History, but only recenly did I read this book. I found it in a dollar pile at a book fair and it was one of the greatest things I've spent my money on.I cannot remember the last time I was so moved by a book. Bishop's discription of this day has a rare quaility of being both objective and emotional. Such events in human history are bound in emotion, but there is one other way to present this material except objectivily because of its power and meaning.\\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\" was one of the only books that caused me to weep while reading it. \\"The Final Hours\\" are presented with such digneity and grace that; while events occured over 150 years ago, they are as moving if they had happened 5 years ago. I would say that it has been 15 years or more since I have been so affected by a book. Bishop gives the reader an oppertunity to be apart of history and not just learn from it. You feel as if you are part of the crowd at Ford's Theater or at the Peterson home.This is a great find and an important read for anyone who cares about human history."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"My grandmother loved this book back in the 1960 when she read it.

Not that I'm saying that Bishop's facts are in error - I imply nothing of the kind one way or the other - but the absence of sources puts this work outside the historical realm. When Bishop put quotes around sentences in a conversation, how do we know where he got them? Are they accurate, or is the author creating them? Any book claiming to be historical that fails to source its data is worthless. However, TDLWS is so well written that I advise you to read for enjoyment if nothing else, but never cite it as a data source on a paper or in your book."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"This is a classic book on the Lincoln assassination. Anyone contemplating a serious study of that fateful night of April 14, 1865 should start with this book. Even though it was published over twenty years ago, Bishop's book has stood the test of time.What is so appalling is the gross neglect and incompetence by the government after the shooting."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT should be required reading for anyone with an interest in American History. The sheer amount of detail here is invaluable. Historian Jim Bishop has gone to the original newspaper accounts, court documents and government records to get at the indisputable facts. Contradictory reports have been reconciled, confusing motivations and events have been plainly explained, and the result is a book brimming with information but which is still easy enough for us laymen to read.The format of the material will be familiar to any fan of the television show \\"24\\". Like that piece of modern drama, the book is laid out so that each chapter is devoted to a single hour. The result is a slow, detailed progression through the day that pushes up the tension as the fatal hour approaches. The book begins at 7 a.m. on the morning of April 14th, 1865, continues through the actual assassination during the 10 o'clock hour and then concludes with the death of Lincoln at 7:22 a.m. the following morning. Of course, the similarities between this account and the much-hyped television series are purely structural - the story isn't fictitious, and we already know the ending.Two chapters interrupt this narrative. One that gives a background into the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, and another that gives us a brief history of the conspiracy. This book doesn't try to give more than a short summary on those two topics, so readers interested in those subjects should also find other material. This book is primarily concerned with getting across the actual events of the day rather than trying to put every single fact into a historical perspective. It reads like an extremely detailed journal told from an omniscient observer.One thing I didn't like was Bishop's tendency to write the factual events in an overly dramatic style. We're treated to people's inner thoughts, their facial expressions, occasional over-dramatic language, and other items that couldn't possibly be known to the author. To be fair, Bishop does acknowledge in the introduction that he does take certain liberties of that type in the name, presumably, of dramatic license. The only problem I had with this approach is that the fourteenth of April 1895 is already one of the most gripping and shocking days in American history. There really wasn't any need to make the action more exciting. More often than not, these little pieces of intrusion annoyed me, though this wasn't nearly enough to distract from the hard facts of the event.Prior to reading THE DAY LINCOLN WAS SHOT, my knowledge of the mechanics behind the assassination was sadly deficient. This book has provided me with a lot of information behind the events of that day as well as firing up my interest in U.S. Civil War history. I hope that future books that I read on this subject are as organized and as lucid as this one."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"mr. bishop composes a must read account of that fateful day. a must for history persons"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot is, in fact, about the entire day of Lincoln's death. If you decide to pick up this book make sure you set aside a lot of time and anything else you could be doing. This book is a very detailed hour by hour account of the day Lincoln was murdered. I do give the author credit for being historically accurate. Although it was accurate, this book did not have the ability to capture and hold on to my attention. The plot was pretty straight forward and I felt as though i was reading something straight out of a history book plus what's inbetween the lines. Mr.Bishop did make a good effort and put alot of time into this book judging by how detailed it is. The level of detail however, was my biggest problem with this book. I understand that Lincoln got shot and it was tragic but I don't need to know his murderer's every action throughout the day to get to where he was when he shot Lincoln.In conclusion, reading this book was comparable only to cruel and unusual punishment and I can only hope to never read anything this horrible ever again."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot is an old book. It was available when I was in grade school, but although I entertained an interest in history at the time, I was not yet into US history. A friend recently reintroduced me to the book, since he knew I had developed an interest in the period. I must say, I am glad he did. The book is strikingly well written and very well researched. Jim Bishop was not a professionally trained historian, but he was a writer with an interest in history and a methodical manner of approaching his subject. According to the introduction, the author kept notebooks on each of the major participants of the drama of Lincoln's last days, adding to them whenever scraps of information came his way. When he finally put pen to paper he had such voluminous data in anecdotal form, that he was able to untangle events in a way that no one before him had been able to do. Although he puts speeches into the mouths of his subjects, this dialogue is reconstructed from information from diaries, printed speeches, trail transcripts, and other documents from the time, that give credence to the author's construction.The book is written on an hour by hour basis, departing from this format only to add a chapter on events that immediately preceded the fateful day. The author follows the activities of each of the major participants, describing their behavior, interactions, and words, creating a drama every bit as riveting as a novel or play.I had read a biography of John Wilkes Booth that had raised the possibility of a conspiracy by Northerners to remove Lincoln and his more conciliatory approach to reconstruction by using a misguided Booth as a pawn in their political designs. At that time, I felt that there was a distinct possibility that this might have been the case. Bishop's book, however, made it apparent that this theory is not new but has been around since the events themselves. The author discusses the theory that the Secretary of War Stanton may have been behind such a scheme, but dismisses it as misguided, though I'm not entirely sure that his reasons for doing so are any more valid than the previous author's were.One of the things I enjoyed most about the book is that Bishop doesn't leave one hanging at the end. Lincoln isn't just dead as the finale. The author details some of the fates of those who participated in the events. We are not only told what happened to the perpetrators of the murder, but what became of individuals like Secretary of War Stanton, Vice President Johnson, Surgeon General Barnes, Ulysses S. Grant, among others. We are even told of the fate of the Ford Theater and its owner. The wrap up is very good.The book is a delight to read. It's full of information and colorful detail. It's clearly and understandably written, and would make entertaining reading for anyone from 5th or 6th grade reading level to the adult."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"Jim Bishop is an outstanding writer and his format using hours of the day (i.e., 7:00 am, 8:00 am, etc.) took you to where everyone was at that time--Lincoln, Booth, Johnson, The Surratts etc,. His research was in-depth and made you never question its validity. I lived in the Washington D.C. area for eight years and have visited the Ford Theater and the Boarding House Lincoln died in--after reading the book--I go visit those places everytime I return--and picture Jim Bishops clear explanation of events. After reading this book and visiting the Ford Theater--you will envision the actor John Booth jumping from the balcony and tripping as he took his last step on a theater stage. Not only will you sit in the low lighted rooms and learn of the intricate details behind the assassination--but will also learn many facts about the city of Washington D.C. during that period of time."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"Bishop writes a good book. The story is well researched, full of fascinating details, fast paced and never dull. Although you know the ending, the tale is constructed in a way that has you hoping someone will make a move in the story to avoid the awful destiny that must unfold.My only quibble is that the author takes a lot of license with what the various players were thinking.

For example, taking the president as a hostage to try and get what the Confederate states wanted out of the war.On the day of the assassination, President Lincoln had received notice from the people who were to accompany him to the play that they would not be coming. As a faithful president, he still attended the play to show his support, not knowing that it would cause his death. This book also helped to show the arguements that Lincoln went through with Mary Todd about pubilc appearences and even going to Ford's Theater that night.Taking and hour by hour look at Lincoln's life helps to familiarize the reader with Lincoln and his family and his usual daily tasks. It helps show Lincoln as the man that he is instead of just the president."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"All history books should be written by Jim Bishop. He is able to bring the past to life with wonderful story telling that doesn't lose any details. This book taught me more about Lincoln than I have ever gotten out of classes and lessons. I had no clue that he disliked his wife and that John W Booth had failed so many times in his attempts. The deep research involved in such a writing must make it almost impossible to create history books in its image. Yet, we could do with less encyclopedia-like accounts of our past so that we keep our heritage instead of trying to wade through it. I will make sure to add Bishop's other masterpieces to my collection as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. A masterpiece in the sense that it reconstructs the day Lincoln was shot. You will live that day in the 21st century by reading this book. Hour by hour all the actions and conversations of all key personalities have been dissected and presented. This is a great historical forensics book."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"For lovers of history. This book places you in the tumultuous society of the American Civil War. The events surrounding the killing of President Lincoln are brought to life in the style of a modern CNN report. The questions who, why, where and how are well covered. This is an excellent historical account most appreciated by those that lived through the JFK killing."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"A few months ago, my grandmother said she had too many books and to come grab 'em up. So I went. And grabbed. A lot. Old MAD magazines and books nonfiction and fiction, of all genres. I've read six of these books so far and rated some on Goodreads (I particularly liked \\"Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair\\"). But this is my first written review of a book from that stash. \\"The Day Lincoln Was Shot\\" by Jim Bishop touched me in a way that is hard to explain. It probably has something to do with a president cut down in the middle of his glory. This is an old edition, by the way, copyright 1955 and with an 85-cent price on the front.I recommend this book to anyone. You don't like history? You don't like politics? No matter. This book transcends history and politics (subjects I love, by the way). This book has it all: suspense, so much so that when the moment of the assassination arrived, I had to distract myself and then squirm a few minutes before getting on with it - I did not want Lincoln to die! - murder, conspiracy, colorful characters, accidents of history, and yes, even romance. Okay, maybe not romance per se, but the bond between Lincoln and his wife was touching, even if she was a bit (maybe more than a bit!) of a tyrant.I would love to give this book five stars, but alas, it gets four. The postscript needed to deal more with John Wilkes Booth's capture. Sure, yes, the book is set from 7 a.m. to about 7:30 a.m. the next day (basically Lincoln's last 24 hours), and Booth was not captured in that time frame. But a one-sentence postscript after going through agonizing pages of his plotting and his getaway was not satisfying. The postscript where Booth was concerned should have been at least two pages.This is a fine book that brings Washington City and history to life. It perfectly balances action and the need to get history across. No boring textbook, this. True crime at its finest.-Q.

Since then I've read plenty of other books on Lincoln and the Civil War, and thought I'd go back and check this out, and I wasn't disappointed. I was in Ford's Theatre once and one of the guides there recommended this book also, you can't go wrong here, well done indeed."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"In high school I was obsessed with reading about Abraham Lincoln.

It is history of the finest kind: gripping, detailed and well written.This genre was so successful Bishop spent most of the rest of his writing career doing \\"day of\\" books.You won't regret this read.It has been noted by several historical authors of late that there are some factual errors in Bishop's great work. It's true, there are some discrepancies that cannot be defended. But this is popular history, written for the masses and not intended for scholarly peer review. As such, it more than fills the bill. Over the years I have read this book ten or twelve times since I first encountered it in the late 60s. I've bought and given it to many people, many of whom said they didn't like history but loved this book. In that regard it is without doubt one of the best Lincoln books."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"The book was purchased for my 16 year old son for a US History project.

Although you know Mr. Lincoln will be killed - it makes the reader keep hoping it won't happen."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"This is a very entertaining book. Bishop draws the reader into this familiar story from the start and holds our interest. It is by no means the definitive account of what happened (for example, there are those historians who believe Mrs. Surratt was quite aware and involved with the doings of her boarding house) but it's a good read and it brings an important chapter of American history to life."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"This is a tremendously suspenseful and thorough depiction of the last day of Lincoln's life. Bishop chose to include only the minimum of details that led to Lincoln's assassination (reading David Herbert Donald's &quot;Lincoln&quot; beforehand proved helpful to me), and barely any details of what the conspirators faced afterwards (I followed this book with Gene Smith's &quot;American Gothic&quot; to complete my understanding of what happened to them). The payoff is a book that allows the reader to see the movements of the principals in a suspenseful, clock-is-ticking fashion. You couldn't have paid me to put this book aside!"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"A wonderful read about Lincoln's life in the last 24 hours and the conspiracy that resulted in his assassination. This is a wonderful book, and one only grows to admire Lincoln after reading it. One also sees how Booth and his assorted idiots planned the killings. A determined effort by the government in protection for key members could have prevented this. The President's bodyguard went off to a bar, along with the other staff. Bishop researched this book for twenty to thirty years before writing it. The only criticism is that the beginning drags a little, but otherwise a great read."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"&quot;The Day Lincoln Was Shot&quot; is a must read for anybody interested in history, particularly in the civil war. This book draws the reader into the action as if they are in the booth at Fords theater on that fatal night when President Lincoln was shot at point blank range in the back of the head.This book provides a detailed account of what occurred before, during and after the shooting and provides details of the emergency work performed by doctors and the Strong but withering will of Mary Todd Lincoln.As mentioned earilier, this book is a &quot;must read.&quot; My review alone cannot do this book justice. I have had this book before but it was destroyed due to flood (I swore that my children would read and benefit from it). It is difficult to find and thank god Amazon had a listing for it."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"Jim Bishop was a terrific newpaper columnist of the 50's and 60's who wrote the prize winning book, &quot;The Day Christ Died&quot; and followed it with this one during the Civil War Centennial. It is well worth this re-print edition. An absolutely relentless march of the men, women and events of the last 24 hours in the life of Lincoln. The detail here does not slow the history. Indeed it is the life blood of this enthralling book. Meticulous research brings the story to full color. You will feel the heartbeat of Booth as he approaches the President's box. You will suffer the shock of Mrs. Lincoln when she realizes her husband has been wounded. You will weep for Abraham Lincoln. Seldom is history as truely revealing as this. You do not read this book really. You breath it.

No detail escaped Bishop's notice in this suprisingly gripping account of Lincoln's last day. An eminently satisfying piece of historical reconstruction."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"This is one of the best historical books I have ever read. I know everyone has heard this before, but I could not put this book down. As you read the hour-by-hour account of Lincoln's last day, Bishop makes you feel as though you are there on the fringe watching as the minutes tick away. You can almost hear every conversation, observe their non-verbal cues, and feel the emotion as the cabinet sits around the table talking about what to do after the war is over. I strongly recommend this book to anyone regardless of age."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"This book, though somewhat dated now, is still a great read.

I wish the author had finished the story past the 24 hour mark. I would have liked greater details about the capture of the conspirators but just the same I enjoyed the book immensely."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"In this book Jim Bishop does an hour by hour telling of the events leading up to, including, and after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. It is quite readable and is history brought to life. I did find myself at odds with the author over his assertion that the man shot at the farm was John Wilkes Booth. Recent evidence seems to run contrary to this, but at the time the book was written, this evidence was not known. Still, it's a great book, and I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"An excellent presentation of how things came together to allow Booth to assinate Lincoln. The book also provides period context that allows you to put yourself in the time period. Highly recommended for those interested in Lincoln history."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"As the title suggests, this is a chronological time frame of the day Lincoln was shot, taken hour by hour, among the different participants of the tragedy that day. This format allows the reader to get a grasp on the whereabouts of each person at any given moment this day. The book starts out describing Lincoln's breakfast, which consisted of a biscuit and a cup of coffee. I don't know why this struck me the way it did, but it summarizes the detail and the matter of fact approach in which the book was written. I have since read other books and come back to this one in that it gives the events in a way in which you can keep everything in perspective as it happens. I understand the author did another book on the Day Kennedy was Shot. I highly recommend this book to anyone beginning their study about the events surrounding this day."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"Strange that this book is still in print while Bishop's other book about the murder of a President, \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot,\\" is out of print. That book similiarly examines the day Kennedy died as this one examines the day Lincoln died, and both are stellar examples of the researcher's craft and the storyteller's art. Oddly, another book which minutely examines the day of Kennedy's murder, William Manchester's \\"Death Of A President,\\" is ALSO out of print. Conspiracy? At this point, who knows? Who even cares anymore?JFK asked Bishop to write an article about him on the basis of having read this book about Lincoln; the original article was titled \\"A Day In The Life of a President.\\" Kennedy suggested Bishop expand the article into a full book, which Bishop was in the process of doing when JFK was killed, and so the book turned into a sequel of sorts to this one about Lincoln that the murdered President loved. In the words of William Shatner, \\"Irony can be pretty ironic sometimes.\\"I have no idea why the Kennedy book is no longer in print. The Lincoln book is still out there, but \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" has apparently fallen out of favor. Strange.So why a minute-by-minute examination of a single day, even a day as momentous as this one? That's not necessarily an easy question to answer; it is a kind of subset history genre, the close examination of Kennedy's death, or Lincoln's, or Christ's, or 9/11, or D-Day, or Hiroshima, etc. On first blush it might seem of value only to the researcher writing from a larger historical perspective, but in fact a work of history with this kind of focus can be far more interesting than any other approach to the subject. In the case of JFK, for instance, the incredible tension that builds naturally from a chronicle of the day he was killed makes for a more thrilling story than a novel on the same subject could ever hope to achieve.The book follows not only Kennedy but all the players, Jackie, Oswald, his mother & his wife, LBJ, RFK, J.D. Tippett, and so on. At times these separate strands converge, but mostly they're followed separately and Bishop does a masterful job of keeping all the threads tight. It's hard to imagine the amount of research and organization that went into telling this story so cleanly, because it is certainly one of the most confusing, contradictory days in world history, but Bishop makes it look easy. He is a brilliant storyteller, and anyone will tell you that is what a great reporter has to be. It's not just the facts, ma'am, it's the narrative drive, and this one moves like a supercharged Hummer.So why has it fallen out of print? And why has another book on the same topic, William Manchester's \\"Death of a President,\\" also fallen out of print? I'm not much on conspiracy theories; there's nothing in either book that the \\"military-industrial complex\\" would find terribly distressing. Bishop does mention several eyewitnesses who saw or heard shots coming from the famous grassy knoll---as, incidentally, do the live news accounts of November 22---but by far most of the evidence Bishop (and Manchester) collects points squarely at Lee Harvey Oswald. I think this excellent book is out of print now because people just don't care who killed Kennedy anymore, and they certainly aren't interested in a blow-by-blow account of the assassination.To say this is \\"too bad\\" would be an understatement of biblical proportions. Every day, every hour, we are losing our sense of wonder and curiosity about our world, and we are most particularly forgetting the lessons the Sixties taught us: don't trust the official story. They may be right (in this case, I think they actually are: I believe Oswald did act alone and the \\"coverup\\" all these years has been the CIA, FBI, Dallas police dept., etc. covering up how incompetent and ineffectual they were protecting Kennedy that day), but you should ALWAYS look into the story for yourself. Books like \\"The Day Kennedy Was Shot\\" (and Oliver Stone's masterwork film \\"JFK\\") help us do that, by marshalling all the available information into a powerful narrative thrust. If we forget, or more importantly if we simply cease to care, then the ones who want us to sleep our lives away have won before we're even out of the starting gate.Read this book, not just because it is about one of the most important days in American history, and not just because it is a remarkably well-written thriller, but also because it is important, SO important, that we never forget this man and how he died and the lessons his death taught us."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"This book sat on the shelf for too long before I picked it up. Too bad for me, because it is a gripping narrative that holds the reader's interest right up to the final page. I found myself wanting Bishop to keep going after Lincoln's death, since the book was such an absorbing read. Bishop says in the forward that the book is \\"pretty much a journalistic job,\\" but acknowledges that some of the quotations are reconstructed rather than direct. It is up to the reader to determine how much faith to put into Bishop's details, as in this account of a chance meeting between John Wilkes Booth and a co-conspirator on the afternoon of the assassination: \\"Atzerodt, drunk and brazen, said that he 'enlisted' for capture, not murder. Booth sneered at the carriage maker called him a coward.\\" The reconstructions are plausible, and it appears all the important quotes and activities are based on thorough documentation. This hour-by-hour recounting of 24 hours and 22 minutes of April 14 and 15, 1865, will appeal to general readers as well as history buffs."},{"Title":"The Day Lincoln Was Shot.","review":"an excellent write on the last day of lincolns life. you can tell jim did a lot of research on the subject. the book makes you feel like you were there. other excellent books by mr bishop are the day christ died and the day kennedy was shot."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"Sergio, you are obviously a pawn of the liberal, self-eviscerating academic illuminati that run a majority of the world's history depts.

After sifting through such garbage as Alan Clark's 'Barbarossa,' Soviet volumes of the &quot;The Patriotic War&quot;(Patriotic with a gun to the back of your head.) and other establishment dogma, a book that may take a perspective outside the mainstream is quite welcome.

By the time the Allies opened up a second front in the West, the Germans were already heading for defeat.I anticipated more personal stories from a soldiers point of view rather I found the book contained more narative explanations.The book does contain some chilling accounts of the life of a german soldiers during the Eastern campaign."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"Sincerely I find this book full of commonplaces and banalities related to East Front. And, why not, boring in his try to show that Germans lose the war because of mud, snow, sun, wind and so on.. :)An other example? German resistance is always heroic. Russian resistance is always fanatical. Slavs are dumb or passive. Germans are creative. and so on...to these, there are some claims that I think show well how Lucas would like to redraw the entire history. SS (and the Army ) acted fiercely on civil not because of Nazi racist doctrine against Slavs and Jews but for reprisal.Also when he talks about the civilians working for Germans to build fortifications or other things, he never mention that all these people were forced by Germans to do those works. These and other suspiciuous forgetfulness you could find here.This and many other 'neutral' views give you a taste of how objective is this book.. probably written under 'cold war' influences.Also, IMHO he copied an entire chapter about the effect of bombing with rockets from the despised by him Russian's &quot;History of the Great Patriotic War&quot; where he simply changing German with a Polish serving Red Army, and Katyusha with the nebelwerfer."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"I thought the writer made too many excuses for the SS and their actions.

Ridicolous."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"Having read this book when it was first released in hardback I am happy to see it has been re-released in paperback. This is one of the best books I have read to date that covers warfare on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. The chapters cover a broad spectrum of subjects, all of which involved the German soldier in Russia. From the different style of warfare and fighting to the horrific and barbaric conditions encountered by German soldiers. I particularly enjoyed the chapters on the highest scoring Sturmgeschutz commander and the German Army's greatest tank ace. If you are looking for just one book to describe the fighting I could not think of any better. The story flows along faultlessly even though each chapter covers a different aspect of the war and fighting. From war in the trenches to a bicycle mounted anti-tank unit fighting against the oncoming Russian hordes. This is great and enjoyable history and I am sure that you will find something in this book you did not know before. Recommend to all students of military history."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"For me, history comes alive when you can begin to comprehend the circumstances, situations and emotions individuals endured during historic events. Lucas' book achieves this. The book has about 15 chapters that touch on diverse yet very fascinating aspects of the war in Russia. His writing skills paint a picture of the mud, dust, cold, snow, brillance, horror and bravery. If you have read many books on the Eastern Front, I still recommend this because you will learn even more. The stories are very unique. Read it!"},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"What to say? This is by no means an academic book and has no 'scientific' pretentions. It is an informative work aimed to transmit to the casual reader a feeling of what war on the Eastern front looked and 'felt' like - and in this it's probably successful.The book is divided in chapters, each concerning a specific subject (like partisans, the German High Command's invasion plans, the characteristics of Russian terrain and Russian weather, etc.). It is not an organic work, and I have an impression that many of the chapters are drawn from specilistic sources (for example the chapter on partisan warfare is indebted to Hesse E., &quot;Der sowjetrussische Partisanenkrieg 1941 bis 1944&quot;). The one chapter of interest for the reader already having some understanding of WWII is n.17, concerning German Assault Artillery (generally known to the American public as SPGuns).The book has a penchant to emphasize the German feats of valour; and this, depending on the reviewer's perspective, may be interpreted as an attempt to liven up the narration, as a well-deserved recognition to Teutonic discipline and heroism, or as a pro-National Socialist stance. I don't really care what, but this book could be the right choice for a history teacher willing to introduce his pupils to a pro-German inclination without making it too obvious that he's doing so.All in all, I would recommend this book only to beginner students of WWII and the Eastern front. Otherwise you may wish to look for Kershaw R., &quot;War Without Garlands&quot;, or, in a more general perspective, for Overy's (or even Erickson's) general histories of the conflict in the East."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"This is a good book on the topic because it covers many of the issues the average solder had to face. The author does not bog us down with a lot of detail on tactics or hundreds of different division names from multiple armies. This book reminds me of \\"Eyes Deep in Hell\\" which covers the foot solder in WW 1. The author does keep the story moving and before you know it you have completed the book. This book is not the overall history of the front, just a very well written overview. If you are looking to start studying the eastern front or just want a good book on the topic, I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"Lucas has produced a well researched and readable book.What he sets out too do is to describe the environment (eg the influences of the pripet marshes and weather) of the fighting in Russia together with some short eyewitness experiences.

Well worth the read"},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"The book consists of separate chapters, each in the form of an article that addresses phases of the Russo-German war.

Sorry."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"As the title indicates, this is not a general history of the campaigns on the Eastern Front as viewed from above, but rather an attempt to describe the fighting experience of the German soldiers who took part in them in a sourcebook-style format. In this it must be described as successful. Drawing heavily upon primary sources, James Lucas has produced an excellent introduction to the topic, with chapters spanning a large breadth of topics from the development of the assault gun arm to the winter lodgings of the enlisted infantryman. Now and then the reader is treated to the story of a famous battle or ace soldier, but usually the focus is on the everyday impression of the war.The great strength of this book is the author's eye for detail and his ability to vividly describe the living and fighting conditions of the German soldier in the East. Lucas does not in the main rely on published authors, but uses the letters, diaries and private testimonies of German veterans to reconstruct a fascinating view of their sufferings and efforts. The resulting narratives are of a uniformly high quality, and on some points illuminate other accounts of the same setting, both memoirs and secondary histories. While many of the technical facts the book lists will already be known to the seasoned reader -- although there are some rare gems here, too -- these superb descriptions make it worth its value to the novice and master of World War II history alike.Another reviewer appears to have accused the author of pro-Nazi leanings. Of this I, at least, found no trace in this book upon reading it. What is the case is that Lucas portrays the experiences of German fighting men in a humane and insightful manner, but this, of course, has nothing to do with sympathizing with the political cause of Nazism. Indisputably this book is very much about the German perspective on things; but then, it says as much in the title. For those who are interested in a Soviet view of the war, there are many other excellent books that they can read instead of -- or better yet, together with -- this one.I heartily recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the topic it covers."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"I read a lot on the the war on the Eastern Front, and this is a very objective book, that covers both the German and Soviet perspectives. The chapters are fairly short, which means you can not get bogged down on to much detail. Also I was amazed by all the new information I learned, especially about the partisan warfare, and how the climate of the Soviet Union affected both the German and Soviet armies. This is an extremely easy read, which the reader will find informative and very entertaining."},{"Title":"War On Eastern Front (Greenhill Military Paperbacks)","review":"My favorite part of this book was the chapters detailing the use of self-propelled artillery in many of the battles.

No offense to anyone who wants to go there...it's just that those books don't reflect who I am and even if they did I can't say that I'd enjoy reading about it.Personally, I want to read about men and women who work hard and are doing really well. That's what I loved most about \\"Sleeping Dogs\\"--it was refreshing and wonderful to pick up an African American dramatic story where the characters are clearly getting paid and enjoying the material and social fruits of their labors.I applaud Tracie for helping to change perceptions that women of color are restricted to only handling their business in the bedroom and not the boardroom.

This author is among that percentage. This story moves in too many directions. The story is old and stale. There was nothing new learned from it.

I also thought it was pretty predictable. I need a book to grasp my full attention and this one did not."},{"Title":"Why Sleeping Dogs Lie","review":"This is my first Tracei Howard book and I must say I was very disappointed. The story line was ok but the book was very rushed. Not enough description for me and a little too much fairy-tale in the story line. The main character, Mallory, the sexy and sweet young editor, had a short affair with Saxton, the rich mutil-millionaire who left her because he was scared of love only to end up with Deena the bi-sexual daughter of a southern judge who cares more about her ratings then anything else. There are other characters in the story who mingle in and out here and there but I just could not get into this book. I love the sparks between Saxton and Mallory. Black love is so beautiful. But everything else seemed to happen so fast. THere is alot of designer name dropping (Prada this, Gucci that and Brooks Brothers this no wonder people think black people are so materialistic) all throughout this book which makes it loose it's appeal even faster. Mallory was pregnant by Saxton but gave up the baby for adoption but kept close ties to the adoptive parents? THen the parents die in a horrible car accident and all parental rights are automatically given back to Mallory? Didn't she sign those over when she signed the adoption papers?

Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Why Sleeping Dogs Lie","review":"Tracie Howard's first solo novel is an average read with a misguided title. It would have been better titled, Why Beat a Dead Horse. Now don't get me wrong the story is full of bite and is the kind of thing that is sure to spark a debate around a many office coolers, but haven't we read this type of work before?Backstabbing women with hidden agendas and scandalous pasts, start an avalanche with one gossipy snowball after the other. Mallory Baylor left Atlanta years ago to take a bite out of the Big Apple. She lands a staff writing position at Heat magazine, which is beneath her drive and talent. Her chance at a much coveted feature writer slot opens for her, but she has to interview someone from her past- multimedia mogul Saxton McKenzie, the love of her life and father of the son she gave up for adoption, in order to get it. When Saxton realizes that his old flame is his interviewer he makes a careless mistake. He offers her the new executive editor position at his fianc&eacute;e, Deena Ingram's Spotlight Magazine and thus, adds to the snowball building Avalanche headed for both his, Deena's and Mallory's lives.Girlfriend confidences and fireside confessions leak into the \\"Talk of the Town\\" gossip column whereby Saxton and Mallory's skeletons tumble out of their closets one by one. Who's telling these secrets? Will this ruin Deena's celebrity stardom? Will Saxton find out about his son?This novel has more things going on than an evening episode of \\"The Young and the Restless.\\" So why did I give it an average rating of 3 pens?When I read this story I saw E. Lynn Harris not Tracie Howard writing this. I see stereotypical characters morphed into sleeker camouflage. Nicki, Mallory's roommate is a vindictive she-devil reminiscent of EJD's antagonist, Jessica Lawrence in The Other Woman and Sheila Moore of Jacqueline Thomas' Prodigal Son. All of these women were dark skinned morally inept women ruled by ambition over common decency. Yet, the difference between those main characters is that the reader knew what was behind the mask, but Nicki was never unveiled. As a brown skinned woman I wonder about the implied results of such characters. Nonetheless, the main witch of the novel, Deena Ingram is a bonafide BAP who would \\"pass\\" any day of the week, if it meant an increase in her ratings or her father's rise to the Supreme Court. I found this labeling worrisome as well. What does this say about our society and about the African American woman's voice?Dee Y. StewartR.E.A.L.

However, I was irritated by the constant deluge of designer names to describe the clothing and shoes being worn by the characters. The ending tied together nicely as expected. If you are looking for high brow literature with complicated plots and subplots, you will not find that in this book. Yet, I found this book to be a good read that held my attention to the very end."},{"Title":"Why Sleeping Dogs Lie","review":"WHY SLEEPING DOGS LIE is a perfect example of the search for power, which ultimately translates into greed. Several years ago Mallory Baylor left Atlanta via Philadelphia with a secret and ends up in New York City as a staff writer for the urban magazine Heat. Mallory is given the opportunity to interview Saxton McKensie, a man from her past who now serves as the guru of Ingram Enterprises. Ingram Enterprises is the media-operating machine of Deena Ingram, a television diva who happens to be the fianc&eacute;e of Saxton. The interview serves as a catalyst for the story that unfolds.If you like drama and more drama then this one is for you! Added to the steamy mix are Nikki, Mallory's roommate and would be model and Beverly, Mallory's best friend and lawyer by trade. Also, Deena's parents, the esteemed Ingrams of Boston and Greg, Saxton's best friend who is a gynecologist that touts himself as the Love Doctor, adds a humorous touch. Not only does Mallory have a secret, Deena and Nikki are elusive and secretive as well. As information transforms from the lips to newsprint, backstabbing is apparent and abundant.WHY SLEEPING DOGS LIE is very well written and the transitioning is easy enough to follow. A few of the negatives are most subplots are not fully developed, such as Saxton's involvement with his sisters; they are mentioned and appeared to have had a wonderful childhood but how do they play into his world as adults, is the question. Designer fashions and labeling was overdone, each time a character changed clothes we were treated to the brand name for each piece of clothing. Mention it once and we get the picture.WHY SLEEPING DOGS LIE is engrossing and will keep you reading. However, the neatly packaged ending left a lot to the imagination.Reviewed by Dawn R.

The story was brisque, sexy and dramatic, holding you in its grips from the first chapter to the last. There was something for everyone. Saxton McKensie, one of the lead characters, is a charismatic, sucessful dreamboat, torn between Mallory - the good girl - and Deena, the super bad girl, with whom he's engaged. Though Deena is a media celebrity, she also has a very nasty little secret in the form of an equally bad girl, Nikki! Why Sleeping Dogs Lie is a romantic story that is also quite titaliting.

This alone made me curious as to why such a devilishly handsome man and his svelte companion would be gracing the cover of a book so titled. Eagerly I picked up Why Sleeping Dogs Lie, to see what lay between the pages. I was impressed with what I read. Author Tracie Howard, has done it again.Mallory Baylor has a secret. Forced to leave Atlanta, with a stop over in Philadelphia, she ends up as a staff writer in New York writing for their hip magazine, Heat. While on assignment to interview the cover story for this particular month's edition, Mallory comes face to face with a blast from her past, Saxton McKensie. Saxton, former ball player now top executive of a Media Relations Firm, Ingram Enterprises, is set to become an even more powerful mogul when he marries Deena Ingram. His story is notable and while Mallory has her doubts about seeing Saxton again, she does a wonderful job on the interview.Saxton is elated to see Mallory again. Plus he's impressed with her article and decides she would make a great edition to their company. Mallory isn't all too thrilled about working so close to Saxton in light of their past, but decides the compensation is worth the switch. Sounds cookie cutter so far? I invite you to read Why Sleeping Dogs Lie. Mallory's roommate and Deena are enough to keep the drama going. You've yet to uncover the secret and the cast of supporting characters are so tightly intermingled that you'll be on the edge of your seat completely to the end.Tracie Howard has co-authored two books and has done right stepping forward on her own and molding her craft. Why Sleeping Dogs Lie is well-written and I hope this will not be her last solo effort."},{"Title":"Something Unpredictable: A Novel","review":"During my freshman year at SUNY Albany, I had Barbara Chepaitis as a professor for a creative writing class. I decided to read her novel Something Unpredictable and was pleasantly surprised. Chepaitis' sophisticated, witty, and spiritual personality shines throughout this remarkable story.Delilah is a thirty one year old underachieving waitress with a bachelor's degree. She lives in Key West with her parents in a household far from predictable. At the age of ten she loses her twin brother, her mother constantly has guests over helping with social activist campaigns, and the man she is so-called seeing, Thomas, has her participate in his odd art projects, such as sitting nude in a tub filled with blue Jello.When Delilah's mother unexpectedly finds her very own birth mother, Delilah is the one forced to go visit her grandmother. Carla, a retired old woman who formerly tamed tigers in the circus, lives on a large piece of land in upstate New York. Her house is falling apart and just like Delilah's home, Carla's constantly has people coming in and out, such as a dwarf named Kootch. Delilah remains upstate longer than expected despite her and her grandmother's constant butting of heads. During her stay she encounters some very interesting situations. She becomes friends with an eye patch wearing man named Jack Brown, she attempts to reignite a flame with her cheating ex-fianc&eacute;, Michael, and she forms a relationship truly touching with Carla. Oddly enough, it isn't until tragedy strikes close to Delilah that she actually becomes passionate again for the first time in a long time.Something Unpredictable is a story full of happiness and hope, proving that true love can be found not only when, but also where you least expect it. I am thrilled that I read the novel and had the pleasure of being in one of Chepaitis' classes. I highly recommend this novel for those wanting to read about a woman's unpredictable journey through life."},{"Title":"Something Unpredictable: A Novel","review":"Thirty-one years old Delilah still lives with her parents in their mini-mansion in Key West and works as a waitress even though she has a bachelor's degree. She sees the man living in her parents' guesthouse but she knows they have no commitment to one another. When her mother locates her biological mother, she is afraid to meet her so she sends Delilah to Brentville, New York to see what Carla is like.Delilah's first impression of her grandmother is that of a crusty, independent woman while octogenarian Carla thinks her granddaughter wastes her potential and sets out to do something about it. Delilah meets Jack Brown who fixes things on her grandmother's property. She realizes that he is a deep soul who won't be content with a minor fling. While caring for her grandmother, Delilah starts sleeping with her ex-fianc&eacute;, who lives in the area, but they can't recapture what they once had. When a tragedy occurs, Delilah finally opens her heart that has been closed since her twin brother died over two decades ago.SOMETHING UNPREDICTABLE is a moving relationship drama starring a protagonist afraid to commit to a relationship. Her visit to her grandmother makes her take stock of what she is not doing with her life. Carla sees herself in her granddaughter, which is why she feels compelled to meddle and despite herself, Delilah comes to see that her grandmother is right. Though some unnecessary coincidence enables additional insight, Barbara Chepaitis has written a poignant family drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"I would recommend this to an unbeliever.

We have used this book 3 times for Adult Education Classes in our Church. I highly recommend this book for believers, skeptics or in-betweeners."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"While I am not a \\"Christian\\" according to the fullness of the contemporary definition of that word, I unhesitatingly acknowledge that Yeshua (Jesus) is my King and personal Savior, and I am well past ANY doubt that the Bible was Divinely inspired - though certainly not inerrant as \\"Born Again\\" Christians somehow insist. I don't exactly recall when or why I came into possession of 'WHO MOVED THE STONE?' but finding it in my To-Be-Read Bookcase, and knowing it is considered one of the true classics in Christian apologetics written by a former skeptic, I read it with interest.I appreciated the powerful reasoning ability that Frank Morison brought to the Scriptures and how he - much like I tend to do - dissected passages, examinig every word for nuance and hidden meaning. A couple of reviewers have complained that Morison uses only the Bible itself to prove the historicity of the Gospel accounts of the Resurrection of Christ. Though this is not wholly true (he occasionally references extrabiblical sources such as the Apocrypha and the Jewish historian, Josephus), I think that the thrust of his argument is that the New Testament \\"books\\" contain many internal proofs of their authenticity. I agree! Even so, one reviewer here wrote \\"Though this is an interesting study, this is not a book for newcomers.\\" And I agree with him also (we'll come back to this point later).My personal definition of a 3-Star book is: \\"Worthwhile though notably flawed.\\" In what way is 'WHO MOVED THE STONE?' notably flawed? The book was originally published in 1930 and Morison's writing exhibits the more formal (read: \\"stiff\\") style of his times. It's nothing like trying to read Shakespeare, yet be prepared for words like \\"hitherto\\" and \\"hardihood\\", and phrases such as \\"wrought to the extremest pitch of anguish\\" and \\"ever memorable in human history.\\" These are small prices to pay for the meaning that his careful analysis sometimes wrings from the Scriptures. Still, I feel that some of his conclusions are highly arguable - being based on tortured suppositions - and I even disagree with one or two basic assumptions (i.e., on page 37 Morison states that at The Last Supper, Judas knew that the spirit of Jesus was \\"already bending to the Cross.\\" I am not the only person who believes that Judas recognized Jesus as the true Messiah but didn't recognize the Messiah's true mission. Judas meant to force Jesus into a position where He would have to assert Himself and violently defend his Kingship. Judas was caught by surprise when Jesus went to the Cross rather than fighting for the Crown, thus the \\"traitor's\\" remorse that drove him to suicide in Matthew 27.) But one doesn't need to agree with every point in a book for it to be well worth the reading.I particularly enjoyed Morison noting that it would actually have been strange \\"if the band of mourners had not been predominantly women.\\" It makes perfect sense these being \\"the mothers of His men and the woman whose life His influence had utterly transfigured\\" and that they were in possession of \\"the mighty and unchanging instincts of the human heart, especially the feminine heart.\\" And chapter 12 which takes a good hard look at the motivating factors that drove Saul/Paul, \\"the man from Tarsus\\" from being \\"the outstanding figure on one side of the controversy\\" to becoming \\"the outstanding figure on the other\\" was very well conceived and executed. Morison even observes that Paul believed that Jesus would return in glory to the earth during Paul's own lifetime. This gets overlooked by so many Bible students. There's reason to suspect that John also misperceived the timing of the \\"Second Coming.\\" Saint Peter it seems was the only apostle who clearly understood that the return of Jesus was two thousand years in the future (see 2nd Peter:3).Overall, 'WHO MOVED THE STONE' is a valuable lesson in deductive reasoning, and reading it would help train anyone's mind in the way that he or she should undertake a serious study of Scripture. (I'm always surprised when supposedly earnest Bible students give me that blank stare when I mention that there are verses in the Bible that indicate Jesus had the ability to materialize and dematerialize at will PRIOR to the Crucifixion and Resurrection! Aren't they THINKING about what they're reading?)If that \\"Still, Small Voice\\" inside is telling you to acquire this book and read it now, I am the last person who would attempt to dissuade you from doing so. But I will also point out that if you are new to Scripture study and simply looking for something to get you started and to give you confidence in the reliability of the Bible, there are probably better points of entry. If you want something brief but potent, I would first recommend the booklet, 'MORE THAN A CARPENTER' by Josh McDowell. If you want something more extensive, then go with 'LEARN THE BIBLE IN 24 HOURS' by Chuck Missler. But either way, I would suggest that you EVENTUALLY make time to examine what Frank Morison has to say here, and make double certain that someday you also investigate the book, 'MERE CHRISTIANITY' by the brilliant C.S. Lewis.As Pope Yoey O'Dogherty VII wrote in his second papal bull, \\"Dovete leggere tutto il libro del Morison franco e mangiare tutti i vostri spinaci; sono buoni per voi.\\" I've been told that this translates to, \\"You must read all of Frank Morison's book and eat all of your spinach; they're good for you.\\""},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"WMTS shows a conversion from theistic scepticism, following sane historical reconstruction theory in linking literary (& non-literary) data by plausible conjectures. A self-supporting reconstruction might not be proof but is at least plausibility with a face - worth looking at unless any essential conjecture is shown to be impossible. With throw backs to Morison's scepticism, it swallows the camel of bodily resurrection yet strains out the gnat of angelic interaction, and shows undue scepticism about canonical reliability, consequently having a picnmix approach to biblical witnesses. It still has much primary credence, aided by Morison having well read extrabiblically the historical life settings that interconnected at the cross, so to speak.It argues an interesting hypothesis of the High Priest's Servant being first at the tomb, and that Roman guards were neither in the arrest nor burial details (I don't agree with either line). It argues that the women's visit was factual, the guard unexpected; holds that Mk.16:9-20 is inauthentic (I now agree); is academically dated (eg Jesus died on Nisan 15, contra WMTS; the trial hadn't gross illegalities, contra WMTS); well argues that Caiaphas & Pilate planned a showcase trial (pillow talk led to Claudia's dream and in turn to Pilate's reconsideration). It shows that the accused was as ready to be convicted (ch.3) as his enemies were to convict him, controlling the arrest date & time, and how Rome & Palestine each had agendas helped by cooperation against the accused, and reconstructs the Roman trial with psychological insight.As to the missing body, it rationally dismisses the ideas that Joseph of Arimathea, Rome, or the Sanhedrin, removed the body, or that Jesus revived in, then escaped from, the tomb, or that disciples either visited the wrong tomb or invented visitation stories. What's left, however improbably, must be true - physical resurrection. It examines some, hitherto antipathetic to Jesus, who become leaders of his church, risking their mortality to save their sanity. It leaves unresolved the Q as to who moved the stone, and doesn't even begin the Q as to why Jesus had a [redemptive] death wish. But what it does do, it does very well, especially at the primary level. A moderate update should primarily IMO remove some masculine pronouns, better respect canonicity & angelic interaction (thus rethink the HP's Servant), change from the Revised Version (accurate yet grotesque in its days), and examine Jewish legalities in their C1 timeframe rather than to the later C2 Mishna. Much should be left in place, and rationalists are well served by this book. See also [...]"},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"In this age of skepticism, this book is more needed than ever. It has been a blessing to my own life, and has been an important part of the spiritual journey of others -- including Lee Strobel, who wrote a foreword to the edition that I just purchased. (I have a decades-old copy whose binding came unglued -- hence this purchase, and a resulting invitation from Amazon to write this review.)The author examines the events of the few days prior to and following Christ's crucifixion -- including what the Jewish authorities must have been thinking at the time, what Jesus friends and disciples were doing, and seven alternate explanations that skeptics have offered as to what happened to Jesus' body on that first Easter morning. Some sound plausible at first, but -- one by one -- we see that each theory has its own problems. Initially an unbeliever and intending to write an entirely different book, the author came to believe that Christ did indeed rise from the grave as he studied the New Testament accounts of this period. \\"Who Moved the Stone?\\" is a fitting title to the book he finally did write.In it we see clearly what was the \\"crime\\" for which Jesus was executed: it was for saying that He was the son of God. If He were not the son of God, it would indeed have been blasphemy -- a crime punishable by death under the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 24:15).We are given insight into what the Jewish authorities must have been thinking before Jesus' arrest. They may have wondered whether Jesus was \\"arrestable\\", since they had tried it before unsuccessfully. They intended to try again after the feast days, but acted suddenly instead when given inside information by Judas that Jesus was expecting to be arrested and crucified, and that He would not be offering resistance. Only then did the authorities act. What they heard from witnesses during Jesus' various \\"trials\\" was insufficient for a conviction, but they did hear one consistent theme -- something about \\"in three days\\". That got their attention, and we know that they set a guard at the tomb for fear that someone would steal the body and claim that there was a resurrection. Of course, they did afterward claim that Jesus' disciples stole the body. Morrison says \\"Whatever the explanation of these extraordinary events may be, we may be certain it was not that\\". Morrison then deals with each of six other theories.I was asked to substitute-teach in an adult Sunday School class recently, and chose to review the resurrection of Christ. I used this book as the outline for the lesson. I think it would make a good subject for high school kids to study before they go off to college and listen to professors attack their faith. In this age, we all need to review the strong foundation on which our faith is built, and none is more important that Christ's resurrection. This book provides a good outline for such a study, and I highly recommend it.(While we're at it, we could also study the 40+ prophecies about Christ's crucifixion and resurrection that are specifically pointed out to us by the gospel writers. Jesus said to the yet-to-believe disciples on the Emmaus road: \\"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\\" Other writers have examined the question of how likely is it that these prophecies could have been fulfilled by accident. The answer is that the odds against it are astronomical. God had to have been the One to give those prophecies hundreds of years in advance, and to bring about their fulfillment in Jesus' birth, ministry, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. When Jesus said \\"It is finished\\", I believe He was including --along with the sacrifice of Himself for our salvation -- a long list of fulfilled promises.)\\"Christ is risen! He is risen indeed!\\""},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Frank Morison (or Morrison) was a literary pseudonym for Albert Henry Ross (1881-1950). In this book he focused entirely on the last seven days in the life of Jesus; using everything that we know of that crucial time in history to assess the truth of Christianity's fundamental tenet. First published in 1930, this book was of special significance to me since I read it as a 30-plus year agnostic and it caused me to open my mind to a faith that I have for the last 25 years wholeheartedly embraced. It is quite remarkable how well the gospel stands up to what is an investigation as intensive as a brief for a legal case. While the book depends to a large extent upon what we find in the Bible, it does not do so blindly; rather it looks for contradictions, corroborations, and other forms of supporting or conflicting evidence. It invites and rewards additional study to confirm what it asserts. Of the Jesus that he finds described in the gospel, Morison notes: \\"In all His story there is no trace of those characteristics which are the hall-mark of the unstable mind. On the other hand, there are many indications of that high sanity which accompanies a firmly disciplined mind. He seems to have been supremely a lover of truth and sincerity, and that inner humility which is man's greatest claim to kinship with God. He was a great hater of shams and hypocrisies and futile boasts.\\"Although short, this book is by no means a light read - as another reviewer noted. It is very detailed and carefully correlated with what is written in the Bible. I was astonished, when I first read the book, how much relevant detail the author had wrung out of the four gospel accounts, without there being any contradiction beyond what could be reasonably expected of accounts by different individuals of how they recalled the same events. And Morison does not limit his study to the gospels; he includes what Paul wrote as well as extra-biblical sources and archaeological evidence. For all the excellent books published in recent times in support of the Resurrection and the Jesus of the Bible, this for me is the most remarkable."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"I have bought this book numerous times because I have given it away numerous times and have to keep re-buying it. For anyone searching for answers about the Christian faith, \\"Who Moved The Stone?\\" is a very thought provoking and inspirational place to begin. I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Frank Morison's book, _Who Moved the Stone_, is a classic defense of the Resurrection for good reasons. The book is clearly written, well-argued, and reflects sound research. Morison is useful for readers who have read the Gospels, and don't know how to \\"put the pieces together.\\" One of the strengths of Morison's work is that he pays careful attention to the minute details, and shows how these details are important for bringing the Gospel accounts into focus. Although he is aware of traditional answers and solutions to the puzzles presented in the Easter texts, Morison provides a number of innovative explanations to make sense of the data. As a student of apologetics and biblical studies, I found myself surprised to discover new theories as I read Morison's reconstruction of Easter Sunday.Although Morison seems to question everything, and provide solid answers, I wouldn't go so far as to say that this book is for the hardened skeptic who denies the historical Resurrection. Morison seems to work under assumptions that those kind of skeptics won't swallow. Yet this book will be useful for other readers. Many Christians will benefit from Morison's shrewd investigation of the Resurrection that puts it all together in a single story. Moreover, \\"soft skeptics\\" (e.g., those who aren't Christians but would like to know one way Christians \\"make sense\\" of the historical case for the Resurrection) will find Morison to be an informative guide through the issues and questions that they might hold themselves. The book also covers some of the most popular objections to the Resurrection, which will be of benefit to anyone who hasn't intellectually wrestled with them. Even though this book is 75 years old (at the date of this review), it remains a classic apologetic for the Resurrection because it explains the Easter story with clarity and in terms that most people can grasp."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Every Christian has their own story about how they came to knowJesus Christ as their personal savior. This is known as their testimony. Frank Morrison's testimony can be found in Who Moved the Stone? What makes this story compelling on many levels is that Morrison, an English journalist and one-time skeptic of Christianity, actually began this book as a means to disprove the very foundation of the Christian religion: the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He researched numerous historical documents including the four gospels found in the Bible and it became apparent that over the course of his research one question continued to plague him, thus the title of his book. What began as a narrative aimed at refuting the resurrection soon became a testimonial of how one man transformed from skeptic to follower. Rather than argue the case for the resurrection with faith alone, Morrison uses logic and reason to discount the counter-theories that heonce believed to hold the truth. For example, why would the Jewish highpriests hide Christ's body when the resurrection itself poses such asubstantial threat to their power? Why would the disciples do the sameand not immediately proclaim that Christ had risen, knowing that notdoing so would risk the movement running out of steam as had been thecase with other philosophic and religious leaders at the time? Instead,they waited months before doing so, perhaps because they were askingthe same question that Morrison was asking. And if the resurrectionwere false, how could such a large following have developed on itsheels? If you're a Christian, you will enjoy the pure and simple reason that Morrison applies to the trial, conviction, execution and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If you're searching for spiritual answers, Morrison may very well have provided them.Reviewed on behalf of [...]"},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"The book sets out - as its title suggests - to investigate and answer as to who moved the stone. It however covers more topics and events than that;- the last evening at the Garden of Gethesemane, the role of Judas, the trial before the Sanhedrin, the trial before Pilate, the burial of Jesus, the fate of the remaining disciples and the visit to the tomb by the women on Sunday morning are some of the events which are covered.However the question who moved the stone remains inconclusive and unanswered - was it the guards, the angel or Jesus himself or someone else?The book however conclusively establishes that the empty tomb was an accepted fact in all quarters - Jesus' supporters, his adversaries, and the general (neutral) populace. Why and how it became empty was the mystery and various theories were put forth. The author very decisively (and with a legal bend of mind) breaks down all such hypothesises till we are left with only one which comes across as the historical fact - that the Resurrection indeed took place. To the rational mind the process of elimination used by the author will appeal. To the faithful and the one who already believes it will give an objective dimension to his or her belief in the Resurrection.However from the middle of the book and more so towards it end the author seems to lose the grip and becomes repetitive and arguementative and thus the book tends to gradually drag.This may not be the best book on this subject (frankly I have not read any other) but a must read. It is as topical today as it was 80 years ago when it was first published."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Mr. Morison explains how the evidence itself is so convincing that it would take more faith to deny it than to simply accept the truth.

I mistakenly recalled that Frank Morison was a lawyer, but now see online biographies stating he was a British Journalist with no mention of law training. When I read the book as a new Christian back in the early 70's I was impressed that the empty tomb had been strongly supported. I began my re-read anticipating a repeat of my early 70's satisfaction. Although I still found the book presented a thorough examination of many details in the scripture, I was disappointed in some ways.1. His conclusions on most points were conjecture, although with reasonable rationalizations.2. It was apparent that he did not consider the New Testament scripture to be the infallible Word Of God. His reasoning was based on human reasoning alone. He based his examination on the Gospel of Mark and reasoned that any \\"apparent\\" scriptural conflicts found in Matthew or Luke were not factual.3. I consider my English skills and vocabulary to be reasonably good with high school and a couple of college years, but frequently encountered unfamiliar words. In addition I found him to be returning to points made so frequently as to be annoyingly repetitive and wordy as well. I found finishing the book became a chore of quite limited satisfaction.I would recommend the book as being beneficial for those who don't already consider the New Testament to be God's infallible Word, but who appreciate a thorough pondering of the finest details of the empty grave story found in Mark's Gospel. This is what the author provides and does so strongly."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"This is an intelligent objective presentation of the events and details of the resurrection of Christ.

The strenght of this treatise of the resurrection event is the detailed examination of all parties, their motives and presence at the time just prior and just after the cruxificion. The author had used his legal knowledge extensively to shed light into the legal procedure of the trial of Jesus. I would believe that many have missed the cruxial point that in Jesus' trial, He was forced to accused Himself which is beyond what a prisoner supposed to do. As Morison lucidly explains, it is the duty of the accursers to bring convincing evidence of the charge. In Jesus' case, the ultimate confiction was attained NOT thorough witnesses' testimonies (because they were conflicting and thus void), but through a sworned testimony decreed by the high priest onto Jesus using the most holiest oath.I highly recommend this book to any one who is interested in discovering what happened exactly that week in Jerusalem when Jesus was led to His trial and after His resurrection. This book presents a very rich nuance to this important event in human history and shed light to hidden motives of many parties involved."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Very thought provoking, well presented, make one think for oneself, but gives details as to the actual events not found in commentaries etc."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"was very excited to read this book, but found it too wordy to be interesting.

That's when Mr. Morrison made a fatal mistake. After spending 13 chapters and 170 pages fleshing out his logical, but not always substantiated, views on the Gospel accounts of the resurrection, he showed what he really thought in Chapter 14. Regarding the Gospel of Mark, Mr. Morrison stated that \\"Thus the young man at the grave, who really was a young man in the original story, became in course of time the great angel of Matthew, and the two mighty and dazzling celestial visitants of Luke.\\" This indicates that Mr. Morrison feels that only Mark is true and accurate--the resurrection accounts by Matthew and Luke are embellished legends that spun off from Mark. This is not Biblical and does not display belief that the entire Bible is God-inspired. For those who profess belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, this book is not for you. Stick with \\"More Than a Carpenter\\" by Josh McDowell or \\"The Case for ...\\" series of books by Lee Strobel."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"I was given a copy of this book by a friend who knows I'm always up for a short apologetic text I haven't yet read. This work is particularly bad- the language is very flowery but says very little. His entire edifice is built on claims which are never sourced. He talks about there being evidence of Christ's trial, but never provides any sort of citation for it. Unfortunately, no such evidence exists. Claims like this and statements like \\"all historians agree\\" bring the author dishonor and discredit. There are better apologetics works out there- I recommend skipping over this vapid and simple minded tract and find something that at least makes an attempt to support it claims."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"I've read many books on the historical reliability (and unreliability) of the New Testament; I've seen many educated opinions varying in every way; I done studies many resurrections-centered topics; but I've never seen a book quite like this! Morrison takes nothing for granted. He trusts his instincts, and, though coming shy of any kind of Biblical-Christian opinion, he beautifully defends the resurrection in this short examination. As a doubter I find it difficult to swallow what many Christians take for granted in their own faith. This book is not like most. However, as a believer I was thrown by Morrison into the last week of Jesus' life (and the following weeks) as I never have by any lecture or writing. Morrison brings to light many historical details missed my so many people (including myself). He is easy to read and difficult to put down.To the skeptics: I was once a skeptic. It was not a brief reading of one or two apologetic works that convinced me; instead, it was months and months of hard research, with this book as one of the many highlights. I encourage all to read this.Morrison's book will forever remain one of my personal favorites.Luke Gilkerson"},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Verily verily, the Christian Bible is very clear on the foundational importance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Regardless of personal interpretation, Scriptures such as Romans 10:9 and 1 Corinthians 15:14 clearly state that for the believer, Jesus' resurrection from the dead must be regarded as a non-optional issue, and must be personally subscribed to doctrinally. Obviously, this can be an affront to the modern intellect and have the potential to collide with our reasoning faculties and idea of intelligence. In fact, that was exactly the case for English journalist Frank Morison when he began to write &quot;Who Moved The Stone&quot; over 70 years ago. As a skeptic, he set out to prove that the story of Christ's resurrection was only a fabricated myth... what he found, however, was a seamless validity in the biblical and extra-historical record.I call this book a &quot;study&quot;. By that I mean that it is not a light read, and one ought to follow up on all Biblical references and make notes as one goes along. I filled up half a notebook with detailed timelines, summaries, and diagrams, with the end result being that my initial understanding of the resurrection was further strengthened in a way that is impossible to exaggerate. For me, one of the greatest testimonies to the FACT of the resurrection has always been that the authorities at the time did not dispel the &quot;myth&quot; by simply displaying the crucified body. In the early stages of the apostles' preaching, when the church was gaining converts left and right... all the authorities would've had to do was PRODUCE the body of Jesus! Why didn't they do it? Read Morison's book with even a half-open mind and I believe that you will finish it in agreement with me... that they DID not, because they COULD not."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"This interesting study that deserves to be read despite having been written over 70 years ago. Despite what a previous reviewer said, the book is not misrepresented nor is \\"Morison's entire argument is based on the acceptance of the Bible as historical fact, word for word\\". This assertion is flat out untrue. Consider Morrison's novel conclusion that the indiividual Mary Magadelene and Women met in the Tomb on Sunday morning was a ordinary man. Mark says a young man (Mk 16:5) but Matthew and John's gospels both say it was two angels. Luke clearly implies an Angel as well. Morrison argues in favor of a Young man not an Angel. He does not take the Bible word for word. Nor is it true that Morrison cites \\"no references but Biblical ones\\". It is worth noting Thomas Paine wrote his deist polemic \\"THE AGE OF REASON\\" a scathing criticism of the bible using ONLY the bible and nothing else. However, Morrison does cite extra-biblical books that are NOT in the Bible such as the Gospels of Peter, Hebrews, as well as the works of Josephus, the Jewish Historian and the few historical writings on the character of Pontius Pilate. The above mentioned Gospels of Peter and Hebrews are NOT in the Bible. One wonders if a previous reviewer was aware of this fact for Morrison gives a lengthly quote from it (gospel of Hebrews) on the last page of WHO MOVED THE STONE. One of the more telling arguments put forth by Morrison is that there is NO historical evidence that tomb was not indeed empty; There are only assertions by Jewish authorities that the disciples had stolen his body. The truth is Morrison was a skeptic in the tradition of 19th Century Biblical scholarship that is still with us today with such annual events as the Jesus Seminar and the Historical Jesus movement that discount the historical reliability of the New Testament accounts."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"This book explores whether Jesus of Nazareth rose from the dead. The author indicates at the outset that he was not favourably disposed to believe that the resurrection was a real event of history. The author explores the events found in the four gospels concerning the last week of Jesus' life. The author argues that the negative claims or skeptical arguments to explain the resurrection away fail. The author cites what he believes is positive evidence and arguments to accept that Jesus did rise from the dead and that the Christian faith is something to be believed in.One point needs to be noted. Many popular Christian authors have asserted that Frank Morison was a lawyer. This is incorrect. Frank Morison is a pseudonym for Albert Henry Ross (1881-1950). He was a prolific writer and worked in a London advertising agency. However he never studied the law. Readers interested in this biographical background can refer to another book available from Amazon - Ross Clifford, Leading Lawyers Case for the Resurrection (Edomonton: Canadian Institute for Law, Theology &amp; Public Policy, 1996)."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Almost 2000 years ago, Jesus of Nazareth was executed by Roman and Jewish authorities in the most humiliating manner of the time. His followers, who thought he was the promised Messiah, fled to the countryside, disbanding in confusion and despair at the death of their teacher.Yet within weeks, they began to publicly and confidently advance ideas and practices radically at odds with centuries of Jewish culture and teaching, establishing the foundations of the Christian church. In the years to follow, all were tormented and killed for advancing these beliefs.What happened to trigger this change, to reconstitute and energize the ministry of Jesus, and subsequently change the world? People aren't willing to die for something if they know it to be a lie.The cause is given in the Bible; the physical resurrection of Jesus and subsequent interaction with not only his followers but hundreds of other witnesses on many occassions after an agonizing death on the cross.\\"Who Moved the Stone\\" analyzes the events of the week leading up to the execution of Jesus and the discovery of his resurrection. Four somewhat different views are provided by the four Gospels and Morison shows how each contributes a piece to the interlocking puzzle of events, enhancing the coherence and credibility of the resurrection precisely because of the way they fit together (and sometimes seem not to).This is a stimulating, well-written book everyone should appreciate and read, since it illuminates the foundational event of modern civilization. The author offers interesting inferences regarding the arrest of and formulation of charges against Jesus based on Jewish law of the time, Biblical accounts, who was involved and how it relates to historical practices. One begins to appreciate subtleties of the situation.The book ended without addressing all questions people might have, such as seeming variations between the gospels regarding who was in the open tomb and when. A timeline that clearly harmonized all accounts (who was where when X happened, etc.) would have helped. However, Wenham's book \\"Easter Enigma\\" does this completely. William Lane Craig also has some good, if somewhat academic, analysis such as \\"The Son Rises\\" (which to me reads as being somewhat more \\"brittle\\").All in all, this book is an excellent and persuasive argument for the Resurrection of Jesus."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Although Frank Morison, an English journalist, had reverence for the person of Christ, he was skeptical of the historical authenticity of Christ's resurrection and set about to settle the matter. What followed amazed him as step by step he was drawn into the facts of the case. His explanation of the three-hour delay between the time Judas left the Supper and Christ's arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane is detailed and credible. Likewise his explanation for the hurried up trial, why nine of the disciples were not at the crucifiction, why Peter and John were, why Mary and Martha were not. It is riveting reading to find out why the tactless and brutal Pilate did not believe Jesus was guilty and washed his hands of it. What was Caiphas so worried about that he hurried everything up to be sure that Jesus would be crucified by sunset the following day? What were the roles of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus in Jesus' last day. Morison covers the last seven days before the Crucifiction as well as the time immediately following. He asks the questions that the people living then would have asked and follows in their footsteps literally at times. Finding out who he thought moved the stone was the climax.

My first reaction was three stars, but in the end analysis, I stepped it up to four--mostly due to the last few chapters.However, after I reflected on the book for a week, my overall impression has improved. Morrison uses contextual analysis to break down the &quot;true&quot; story of Jesus, his last week and beyond. Building upon the gospel story along with non-canon books, Morrison presents the case that Jesus must have risen from the dead--as unbelievable that is to non-Christian believers.I bought this book last year and read it during lent this year--as appropriate a time as any--it will challenge those who read the Bible literally without room for debate, but proves to be a worthwhile read for those looking to enlarge their knowledge of Christ."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"This prominent English journalist set out to investigate and disprove once and for all the myth of Christianity, the resurrection.In the process, he found faith in the life, death and resurrection for his own salvation.Most of us have heard the historic story retold so many times we think there's no way it can continue to captivate us.Morrison does this through his own testimony of being brought into faith, and the analysis he went through.

Morison started out trying to disprove the Easter story as a rational journalist and ended up doing a 180. He still relies on reason and balancing the written source material for his analysis of the aftermath of the crucifixion. He relies on the Gospel accounts enough that believers will likely be strengthened in their faith while those who are skeptical might remain skeptical. He also seems too ready to find the Gospel accounts non-reconcilable in certain details when they can be reconciled (such as whether the figure who confronted Mary Magdalene at the empty tomb was an angel or not, if there were more than one, etc.). Does a nice job of looking at these events from a variety of perspectives.

The birth of my daughter really made me think about life and the world around me. After some discussions a co-worker asked me to read this book.Though this is an interesting study, this is not a book for newcomers. Being one myself, this is not a book that I would have chosen to start with. It is very interesting, and has many things for a person to consider and look into. However, it is quite overwhelming and analytical for a beginnger.There is really no introduction, other than the forward. Morison, just jumps right in with his analysis, with no thought of set up or background. Now, I'm not faulting him for this, because this may well have been his intention. However, it made this book very difficult to jump into. It is assumed that the reader is knowledgable of this time period. There is neither a glossary or appendix for reference. However, it may also be assumed that the Bible itself would be reference enough.Morison's points are well thought out and he uses knowledge of Roman and Jewish society to lead to his conclusion. He connects what would seem unlike events to make a cohesive timeline of Christ's final days before crucifiction. So, even for a beginner he provides lots of information for study and reflection.This book was written in the 1930's and you can tell, as the writting style is a bit dated. I'm sure that a more modern version of this would be easier to read (much like the Bible). The copy that was lent to me was from 2002, so I don't know if there have been any updates that may address some of these issues.I will have to come back and reread this book once I've come futher on my journey. Now I have some things that I can study more in depth. But again, I would not recommend the book for anyone just begining to find their way."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"Book was easy to read and understand. Found it interesting and informative."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"As an agnostic (formerly a Christian), I must say that Frank Morison deserves great praise for his book Who Moved the Stone? He is cautious and polite, and he relies, for the most part, on natural reasoning as opposed to supernatural suppositions. For all these reasons his book is more accessible to us non-Christians than the works of many strident Christian resurrection apologists.The first half of the book focuses on the arrest, trial, execution, and burial of Jesus. Morison's detailed, minute-by-minute reconstruction is very impressive, though necessarily somewhat speculative. (He seems to accept almost every odd bit of the gospel accounts as significant and tries to knit them all tightly together.)Eventually Morison arrives at the resurrection question. His suggested answer to his own title question, Who Moved the Stone?, is that the tomb guards moved the boulder away from the entrance to the tomb of Jesus out of curiosity after they heard the sounds of a resurrection. As he writes in Chapter 13: \\"... some unusual circumstance caused them to look inside the tomb.\\" This motivation that Morison ascribes to the guards does not seem very plausible to me, but at least he suggests natural, human agents at work on the stone, not supernatural ones (angel, miraculous earthquake, as in Matthew 28).In the process, Morison comes very close to another and, I truly believe, much more probable answer as to why the tomb guards would have moved the stone: In order to remove the body of Jesus. Why do that? It makes perfect sense if the guards were working on the orders of the Jerusalem authorities, who were understandably (from their viewpoint) outraged by the offensively honorable burial of the corpse of Jesus, and wished to eliminate any potential worship of his tomb, including any violent rally that might soon occur there. That motivation would also explain the request for tomb guards made by the Jewish authorities to Pilate in Matthew 27 much better than a resurrection prediction they had never heard. Morison shies away from such a body theft conclusion, but it lies very, very near to his reasoning. No other Christian writer I know of comes as close to this scenario. Please read Matthew chapter 28, deleting its supernatural passages, and see what it reveals: A body theft involving the tomb guards in collusion with the religious authorities and their underlings. Then reflect on Morison's own words: \\"Think of the highly placed Sadducees who were prepared to go to almost any length to discredit and overthrow the [Jesus] cause\\" (Chap. 14).Another question deserving of a book title is this one: Why Did the Resurrection Happen at Night, and Without Any Witnesses? Again, the probable answer: Because there was no resurrection, only a body theft. Once removed by night, as the situation required, the body would then have been burned, destroyed with lime, fed to animals, or reburied secretly some place where it would have decayed beyond recognition within a couple of months. Corpses normally decompose completely, down to the bones, within less than a year. And the new Christian sect was tiny and trivial for the first years of its existence (unless one believes in the fantastical \\"three thousand\\" converts of Pentecost, and the \\"flying flaming tongues\\" of that same day). The Jerusalem authorities must have largely ignored the Christian sect at first. Nor would those authorities have needed to produce the body to contradict the resurrection claims of the Christians. They already had a pat allegation in place that the disciples themselves had stolen the body. That was persuasive enough for the Jerusalem masses. There was no need to say or do anything more. The Christians remained a tiny sect in Jerusalem and Judaea for years, largely unsuccessful in their proselytizing efforts. And of course the few people who did convert must have been mainly attracted / intimidated by the Christian claims that the \\"End Time\\" was near (which it was not).But back to Morison. He wisely avoids discussing in detail the reputed resurrection appearances of Jesus as related in the gospels. He recognizes that the earliest, pre-gospel reports were actually very vague ones (Jesus \\"was seen,\\" that's all), easily due to visions or vivid dreams or cases of mistaken identity or the like. (Morison, Chap. 14: \\"Granted that a vision came to one of them and perhaps to all.\\") Years or decades later those first bare reports were embellished to produce the gospel scenes of a risen Jesus walking, talking, and eating with his followers.All in all, Frank Morison deserves great respect as an \\"honorary agnostic\\" for his cautious and largely naturalistic attempt to explain the ancient mystery of the empty tomb."},{"Title":"Who Moved the Stone?","review":"The author's points are valid.

If you do not also accept this as true, this book will not help you in any way. There are no references but Biblical ones.His arguments are a little weak, in that he often, OFTEN, says things like &quot;the way this passage reads, it doesn't sound like a made up story, it sounds like an historical account would read, so it must be true!&quot; Which is a totally bogus argument. He often states his opinion as fact and draws &quot;logical conclusions&quot; that do not follow any defined rules of logic.Despite all this, there were two or three very good points in this book that have certainly made me reconsider some of my opinions on specific items, so it has proved to be a little bit valuable to me, though you might not get anything out of it."},{"Title":"Hunter Star Quilts & Beyond: Techniques & Projects with Infinite Possibilities","review":"As with her first book, Lone Star Quilts and Beyond, Jan takes a traditional pattern and turns it into something beyond what the ordinary quilter has imagined.

The Hunter's Star, though, is far from the usual half-square & quarter-square triangles, or nickels-stitched-into-square-blocks quilt -- this one has angles, biases and inset seams.It is possible the author is so very experienced, her focus is on variety rather than practical aspects of construction. The book offers an interesting variety of different looks that can be achieved with the Hunter's Star, and varied by choices of pattern, color and textures. Those things are well covered.What I'd hoped for was a good-sized section showing step-by-step directions and tips on how to avoid the inevitable stretching that goes with its eccentricities.

What she chose to do with her life is inspirational, and even more incredible considering that as a female in that point in time, her power should have been limited.

She was born in France in the 1800s and gained most of her training on the stage, developing into an international superstar of manic proportions by age 30.There is an all encompassing problem with the book - its tone. A vast amount of information is contained but is told with little feeling save that of a clinging, saccharine nature that still manages to sound drier than last year's fish. I just could not get involved with Bernhardt's life at all, and the constant literary bowing (without no real explanation, just to say she was great) gets very tiresome fast, with the subject to me eventually coming off as an overacting egotist. I am curious as to if Bernhardt would be popular today at all actually, based on her tendencies towards very dramatic, wriggly death scenes and the like. The tone is complicated by its overall smugness, a pervading sense throughout the book that seems like the author is sitting on a 100 foot high pedestal holding her nose at non stage folk. Especially if they're Americans, it seems.The book has a fairly comprehensive index and then would be alright for a school report, but just to read is awful."},{"Title":"Madame Sarah.","review":"Madame Sarah [a biography of Sarah Bernhardt, 1844-1923], Cornelia Otis Skinner [1899-1979]; Houghton Mifflin Company (1967)Excellent, despite the oft-abysmal editing (or lack thereof) that resulted in MS regrettably being assigned a less-than perfect rating.

I love the section on different story formats to build interest in your presentation. He talks about how to field audience questions, the importance of emotional appeals rather than pure logic, mistakes to avoid, and other pearls of wisdom.The book was an enjoyable read. You can almost feel the author materializing in front of you, wise and generous, sharing his years of hard-won experience with sincerity and humility.

One of the best features is that Boettinger wrote before anyone was using personal computers with PowerPoint, so he concentrates on the real and permanent issues of presentations, not the unimportant features of a specific tool, and it's easy to use his insights with modern technology.

Author Carl Van Doren presents a rich and detailed portrait of Franklin - printer, writer, philosopher, scientist, inventor, politician, statesman, and one of the founding fathers of the United States of America.By tracing the major influences on Franklin, and the key events of his life, Van Doren presents this self-educated genius as the apotheosis of the 18th century &quot;Enlightened&quot; man. Imbued with an insatiable intellectual appetite, a keen scientific mind, a high sense of morality, and a fervent patriotism, he was shrewd, wise, witty, and always confident in his own limitless abilities. The author describes in detail the great events of Franklin's life - his youth and young adulthood as a printer and writer of Poor Richard's Almamack; the philosopher, scientist and inventor of note; Postmaster General for Pennsylvania, and later for all the colonies; representative of the American colonies to Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution; signer of the Declaration of Independence; U.S. Ambassador to France after the Revolution; and signer of the U.S. Constitution.As good a biography as this is, &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is also outstanding history. Van Doren skillfully &quot;paints&quot; Franklin's portrait against the backdrop of the tremendous social ferment, scientific awakening, and tumultuous political events which occurred during the second half of the 18th century. I gained not only a fuller understanding of Franklin's life and great genius, but also a greater appreciation of the times in which he lived.&quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; is written with grace, clarity and obviously great scholarship. Winner of the 1959 Pulitzer Prize for biography, it is a brilliant masterpiece - one of the best biographies of any person I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"My summer project was to read biographies of our Founding Fathers. I was not looking forward to this rather daunting book and have never been so completely turned around on a subject. Van Doren masterfully handles an immense amount of factual information in such a way that makes this biography read like a novel. I love Ben Franklin! Thank you Carl Van Doren."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"Van Doren's biography of Franklin is nothing short of remarkable. While the author may be faulted for the near veneration of his subject, Franklin's continuing reputation supports the author's obvious admiration of Franklin. Franklin's life is reviewed from start to finish almost as a metaphor for the 18th Century enlightenment, the early colonlial life in America, the beginnings of the industrial revolution, the decadence and decline of British Imperialism, as well as the making and maturation of a true genius and renaissance man. Parallel with the swiftly changing account of the myriad activities of Franklin is the story of a truly fine human being; a man whose essentially humble and self deprecating nature belied his strength of character and integrity. Anyone who reads this book will come away awed by this unique individual and the question: Where are the Franklins of our time?"},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"1991 Penguin Books reissue of 1st edition (1938), 862 pages (of which 782 pages form the main body of the book).I read this book because of Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner). Benjamin Franklin is the man Charlie Munger admires and has attempted to emulate most. Franklin's autobiography was one of the twenty books Munger recommended at the back of the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (the most useful book I have read). After reading Franklin's autobiography I was very interested to learn more about him - which I'm sure was Munger's intention. Thus I was led to this biography (one of two on Franklin that Munger has recommended), which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939. I chose to read Van Doren's before Walter Issacson's newer \`Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,' as I liked the idea of being able to see what new material might have been discovered since 1938.With each of the large biographies I have read over the last year, I have found it has taken quite a lot of reading before I really got into the book. This one was no different. It was only when I was about half way through, reading about Franklin's activities dealing with the appalling British government/monarchy in the run up to the American War of Independence, that I found myself gripped. That may have something to do with me having already read Franklin's autobiography, which was the main source for the early part of Van Doren's book (as the author said: \`Plenty of other men could find materials for the story of his latest years. Only he had known about his obscure youth...').I suspect another significant reason was that up until roughly that point there was very little information on what Franklin was actually like and how he spent his days (as opposed to things he had done or places he had been). Without this information I find it difficult to mentally associate or connect with the subject. This is one of the two key areas of weakness I identified in Van Doren's otherwise admirable book and is also the reason why I preferred Ron Chernow's biography of Rockefeller, Titan to Joseph Frazier Wall's biography of Andrew Carnegie. From about halfway through Van Doren's book we do get very interesting snippets, from Franklin himself and also from other people, about what Franklin was actually like (on pages 405, 419, 521, 600 & 649/650, in particular). I wish there was more, but perhaps the material was simply unavailable.The second weakness was in the account of Franklin's finances. Franklin became quite wealthy through his printing activities before he left business and went to Britain. At sixty years of age, after many years of easy living and generosity, he found himself with money worries. His most important business partnership ended in 1766, depriving Franklin of a significant proportion of his income. He was also concerned that he might lose his position at the post office around the same time. Though this did not happen and he was actually appointed as agent to three further states, I was rather surprised that Franklin left a significant financial legacy when he was close to being hard up a little over twenty years before his death.He did not appear to live frugally for the latter part of his life and so I am not sure where the funds came from. I would much have preferred it if this apparent paradox had been resolved. It seems of particular importance here, as Franklin was a man who preached the gospel of frugality, but also said: \`frugality was \\"a virtue I never could acquire in myself.\\"'I suspect that Van Doren was correct when he said of Franklin: \`That he talked about them [industry and frugality] so much made it clear that they came less from his nature than from his discipline.' So, after frugality had served its purpose he perhaps left it behind (though long held habits almost always leave a residue).With those caveats, Van Doren's biography of Franklin is an impressive piece of work. I am not surprised that \`The final writing of the book called for almost daily use of the New York Public Library over a period of two years.' And that \`This book, full as it is, is a biography cut with hard labour to the bone.' The difficulty (as well as the interest) in writing a biography of a truly extraordinary man like Franklin was that he was extraordinary in many different areas. He was a successful businessman, an absolutely pre-eminent scientist and philosopher, as well as a remarkable and successful statesman (and that in a place and era when rank by birth was of paramount importance).I am not paid for them and so write these book reviews primarily for myself. I thus like to include the most important things I have learned and that I wish to retain and include into my life and conduct. In this case - because of the subject - there are far too many to include here. And that is surely the reason why Franklin is Munger's biggest hero: he was not only successful but he was also wise, generous and benevolent with it. Unlike Rockefeller, for example, he seemed to really enjoy his life. And unlike Carnegie, who appeared to fail Solon's warning (I might rather call it Taleb's warning, as that is where I learned it) to Croesus to call no man happy until he is dead.I do not wish to be happy because I have a distorted view of reality, but because I have seen the world as it is and can accept it. Franklin's life is thus a message of hope: he saw the world with exceptional clarity and was able to love it anyway."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"Van Doren's biography, long the definitive biography of Franklin, is rich in detail (sometimes exhaustingly so), yet accurately portrays the life of this fascinating multi-faceted man. From the statesman's humble beginnings in Boston, to his journeys to Philadelphia and ultimately abroad, Franklin is seen in very human terms, yet within the rich tapestry of the historical period.The author's style is typical of many historians of the 1930's, very linear, precise and detailed with a wealth of background information on every facet of Franklin's life. This may be a difficulty for many readers; the book is so comprehensive that many will be put off by its sheer volume. I found myself reading the book in starts and stops, only because of my personal time limitations. After the first 400+ pages, I found myself skipping over sections to get to portions of Franklin's life I found more fascinating. Fortunately, Van Doren's writing is such that one can do this without any significant loss of continuity."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"This remarkable, scholarly, and readable book brings the reader face-to-face with what seems an impossible life. The usual picture we get in school is intriguing, but here we meet a man whose range is staggering. Franklin the young, self-educated adventurer, writer, apprentice. Franklin the printer, entrepreneur, community activist. Franklin the pioneering scientist, delegate, historical visionary. Franklin the publisher, the spy, the sometimes invisible hand steering the birth of the modern republic. The inventor of a musical instrument that Mozart and others composed for. The outrageous wit who shocked Abigail and John Adams. Franklin the friend, free-thinker, and moralist. Creator of the stove, the lightning rod, the watertight compartment for ships' hulls. The first to understand how weather systems move, and ocean currents, and continents. Designer of roadways to connect the colonies and then the nation. Richly incorporating excerpts of Franklin's own voluminous writing, Van Doren's account is clearly factual, yet appropriately awed and inspired by a man \\"unsurpassed . . . in the range of his gifts or the important uses to which he put them.\\""},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"Sure, this book was written before my parents were born, but it seems to stand the test of time very well. If I hadn't checked the copyright date when I bought it, I might have thought this worek had been published only recently.

One gets a feel not only for what Franklin did, but for what sort of man he was. The author is sympathetic to the object of his study, but not to the point where it becomes distracting. All in all, a wonderful read which contains an immense amount of fascinating information."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"I'm a big Van Doren Bio fan, and a bigger Ben Franklin fan. Carl captures the essence of the scoundrel Franklin. This is a bigger than life, juicy life. I almost don't recognize the Ben I learned about in school.

Read this and laugh at the ways Franklin manipulated and succeeded against many odds."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"After reading &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;, he would be the one person -- dead or living -- who would make the most fascinating dinner guest for an evening. His list of accomplishments is practically endless: printer, writer, philosopher, postmaster general, inventor, scientist, diplomat, statesman, traveler, and conversationalist. The majority of people who are ultimately successful have a key talent in one area, focus on that talent, and rise to the top. It is so inexplicably rare to find someone of such vast talent who also excels in all his (her) talents. Benjamin Franklin was such a gifted individual and, thankfully for our nation, focused much of his energy and time into serving the public. Carl Van Doren has written an incredibly well-researched biography of one of our key founding fathers. Van Doren's style can sometimes be dry and too academic, but keep in mind that this book was initially published in 1938. Today's reader may expect a more conversational tone and faster moving story. However, Carl Van Doren's biography is heroic in its effort and the author's admiration clearly shines through for Mr. Franklin."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"With this hefty tome, Carl Van Doren succeeds in authoring a compelling biography equal to the intellectual scope and achievement of his subject, Benjamin Franklin. The title 'renaissance man' was perhaps never more aptly bestowed than on Franklin, whose pursuits ranged from printing to (most famously) electricity to temperature patterns and ocean currents to politics.Following the sweep of Franklin's advancing renown, first in the United States and then in Europe, the narrative never descends to a mere recounting of the man's many achievements (though this would undoubtedly make for fascinating reading in its own right). Rather, Van Doren devotes substantial attention to the greater social context in which Franklin works; in particular, the thread of family life in Philadelphia and later in France helps to anchor the broadening pace of his scientific and political thought, culminating in the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the establishment of republican government in America.Fittingly, the treatment of Franklin's death sounds only the faintest of elegiac tones. Van Doren recognizes the triumph of Franklin's life in the contributions to science, philosophy, and politics that would long outlive the man himself.A must-read."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"In my many years studying the history of our great nation and others, a carelessness of sorts followed my endeavors on Benjamin Franklin. As I finally considered closely examining the great philosopher/politician's life and accomplishments, I set out to find something written from a point of view somewhat unbiased yet informative. Carl Van Doren's accomplishments here should be considered in a manner befitting high esteem by any colleague serious enough to take the time out to comprehend his work. The facts of Franklin's life are grounded in traceable formatting, generously unbound with a sense of Mr. Van Doren's recurrent commitment to uphold a standard sometimes arguably overlooked by today's historians. Although I would have enjoyed added information on Franklin's later Constitutional convention involvement, enough was presented to obtain the idea of his role in shaping our important beginning. You will not be disappointed if you were to add this fine book to your collection."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"I read Franklin's Autobiography years ago and loved every word.

Filled with Franklin's whitty quotes and substantive research, Van Doren gives you a great book packed full of interesting facts and a great view of history. It is a very long book, as the preface tells you in its first line, but a page turner which reads quickly and envelopes you into Franklin's life. One of my favorite biographies I have ever read."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"As I get around to it I read Pulitzer Prize winners and when I came across this one I decided to read it, tho Franklin did not seem too interesting to me when I first learned about him in 4th grade. I was pleasantly surprised. Van Doren does a very good job making Franklin's life enjoyable to read about. He was a great man, and the most famous American of his time."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"I have not read Cabel's bio from 1918 on Franklin but this one by Carl van Doren might be the best. I tend to discount autobiographies as they tend to be highly partisan & even revisionist. The version Franklin's autobiography I read, & there seems to be dozens of them, was fairly modest.This is a whole life biography & is taken in large part from Franklin's own writings, letters to from & about Franklin. The unabridged audio version was a real treat & the amount of research must have been staggering, considering it was written in the thirties.This is a very through book. Where it treads lightly, whole books have been written. That is Franklin's lovers & the numerous children from these liasons, mostly in France. Mr. Van Doren is skeptical, keeping in mind when this book was written. Franklin loved woman & woman loved him but not nessarily in that way. He had many friends & \\"daughters\\" refering to his many, young female admirers. He keeps the wise grandfatherly image I had of him. In fact he was a neglectful husband & an absentee father to his own daughter deserting his wife during all those years overseas.There is so much to him, a true citizen of the world. He was a self-made wealthy merchant, inventor, scientist, philospher & statesman. The title he was most proud was master printer, an individual who started from nothing. He had many roles in life & van Doren covers them all.His most important years were spent in England & France. He loved London & Paris. He may have been tempted but he was always loyal to America, keeping her interest in mind. He was the face of America in Europe. He played the part expected of him; a rustic American philospher with a fur hat & was all the rage in the royal court of France.The colonies were fortunate to have Franklin in England before the revolution & France during & after. That is where with, Franklin's connivance, the major decisions concerning America were being made.His accomplishments ranged over various disiplines, as the inventor of the lightening rod, the Franklin stove used for heating, bifocals etc. He founded the first public library & fire department in America. He was the major contributor to the Albany Plan of Union in 1754. A document way ahead of its time, was a useful reference during the constitutional convention in 1789. He assisted Thomas Jefferson with key phrases in the Declaration of Independence. He was important in reaching consensus when the U.S. Consititution was being drafted.Had he stayed in Philadelphia, he may simply have remained a popular, loyal, prosperous printer & businessmen. He saw first hand the disdain King George III had for him & the colonies. To him America was merely a source of taxes without the rights accorded to all free Englishmen. This & the humiliation he suffered at the hands of British Parliment, turned him into a uncompromising (for one of the few times in his life) rebel. With his patience, gentle diplomacy, wisdom & sense of fairness, America was well served. With apologies to Washington who never left North America & Jefferson, Franklin may be the greatest founding father.While writing this review it occured to me that there are many similarities to Winston Churchill. Franklin was not a warrior as Churchill was but both men were visionaries & peace makers. Both were geniuses & prolific writers on any number of subjects. They were both statesmen & active in public service to a very old age. Both men dominated the times they lived in.Read or listen to this fine book, then move on to other newer biographies. They all add somthing to this remarkable man."},{"Title":"Benjamin Franklin","review":"I loved this book. A great picture of Franklin throughout his life. Political, scientific and personal history."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"Few readers will be able to resist the charm of Triton, who, eleven years old at the midpoint of the 20th century, becomes a member of Ranjan Salgado's Sri Lankan household as a houseboy. His life under the demanding and belligerent older servant Joseph is a challenge, and Gunesekera delightfully conveys Triton's point of view, skillfully revealing an 11-year-old's sensibilities and imagination as Triton envisions Joseph being brought low or stricken by disaster, while his own heroic acts save his master. As Triton gets older and acquires more and more responsibilities, Gunesekera reveals a character of unwavering conscientiousness whose personal devotion to Salgado and admiration for his intellectual accomplishments are absolute.Reef is not just a story, however, as fascinating as that may be. It is a delicate allegory of the small changes which can bring cataclysmic results to a society, just as the coral reef which Ranjan Salgado studies is \\"very delicate. It has survived aeons, but even a small change in the immediate environment...could kill it.\\" With the gap between the educated and the \\"underclass\\" in Sri Lanka very wide, and portentous changes occurring to the country politically, the reader is constantly reminded that, like the reef, \\"if the structure is destroyed...then the whole thing will go.\\" As Salgado's love for Nili makes him more and more self-centered and less altruistic, and as political movements inspired by other countries become more aggressive, the \\"small changes in the immediate environment\\" begin for Triton.In prose that shimmers with the light of the tropics and the scent of flowers, the reader is absorbed into the Sri Lankan jungle and sea, watching as the outside world propels along the small changes which may devour everything--the jungle, the sea, and the cultural fabric of which they have all been part for eons. As as one reads this remarkable novel, one joins with Triton and Salgado in yearning for peace, the \\"twilight when the forces of darkness and the forces of light are evenly matched and in balance [and] there is nothing to fear. No demons, no troubles, no carrion. An elephant swaying to a music of its own.\\" Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Reef","review":"This glimpse of post colonial Sri Lanka as seen through theeyes of Mister Salgado's manservant, Triton, is reminiscent of Remainsof the Day.

I have given this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"You won't be able to put this book down... it reads like a teledrama or an American soap opera..."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"This short novel has so many dimensions that it is hard to say where to start. It is a beautiful description of the growing up from a shy boy to a confident professional of Triton, the servant. It has as a background the change in the Sri Lankan society and the decay of the ruling class. Through Mr Salando, Nili and his friends we get a good view on the differences between East and West. To see the 70's hippie, going to India to seek whatever it is, suddenly turn up as a very destructive force in the Eastern cultural fabric is quite hilarious. Above all, it is a beautiful story, told in a very poetical way and never failing to make the reader feel part of it.. Finally, the scenes in London are, again, painted with a beautifully fine brush. I will on my visits to London never again look at an Asian shopkeeper or restaurant owner in the same way...."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"Romesh Gunesekera's debut novel &quot;Reef&quot; is a poignantly observed tale of lost innocence, human courage and determination, and of the deep cultural divide separating the Western educated intelligentia and natives of post-colonial Sri Lanka. The humble servant boy, Triton, is steeped in old world values but hero worships the intellect of his marine geologist employer, Mr Salgado. Both fail to come to terms with the political issues of the day. Triton is too busy keeping house and entertaining Mr Salgado's friends to care. His employer spends his time astral travelling and nursing his many esoteric concerns while impressing his girlfriend, Nili, with his hospitality. Ironically, it is the humble Triton who shows more strength of character and resourcefulness than any of the educated lot. The outcome of Mr Salgado's affair with Nili is reflective of the tension generated by an evolving value system. &quot;Reef&quot; is both subtle and lyrical in its appeal and Gunesekera rewards us with an ending that is both heartwarming and uplifting. It is an impressive debut by Gunesekera and not surprisingly shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"An engaging story of servant and master in Sri Lanka. Triton, the servant, calls his master \\"The Mister.\\" He devotes his life to him, so much so that it is almost (but not) a homoerotic relationship. The Mister does little besides exist. He writes and throws an occasional party and then falls in love. We are also treated to some delightful gastroporn as the servant lovingly prepares meals. There is not a whole lot of plot otherwise. After the failed love affair, master and servant leave for England. Don't we all wish we had a devoted servant like Triton? In fact, he has far more initiative and common sense than the Mister. I'm reminded of a line thrown off by Berta, the housekeeper, to Charlie, in the TV sitcom \\"Two and a Half Men:\\" \\"In an ideal world, you'd be washing my shorts.\\" This is a good read with a lot of local color of post-colonial Sri Lanka. A strong flavor of Merchant and Ivory and \\"Masterpiece Theatre.\\""},{"Title":"Reef","review":"After a short break in Sri Lanka, as someone of dual nationality with Sri Lanka I was enveloped by this book which I read in quite a short time. It begins well, but I found so much of it quite morbid and fearful, both at the level of political/terrorist violence and at a sexual level.The author's trademark topic is food which is well treated in his short stories (read Monkfish Moon by him for more) and really well served up in Reef. This and many other exotic features such as wildlife, native patois are obvious highlights and selling points in the book. Dialogues are sketchy, incomplete and we can fill in the missing words even if the degree of articulateness is lacking or obtuse.There are dark, brooding undercurrents and Mr Salgado ultimately is a failed, lonely guy - in romance and in his job (though the romantic side is incomplete - by the end and there may be reconcilliation). His failure is because of the nature of Sri Lanka itself apart from anything personal. The way that the governments there cannot be expected to protect people or do any real good and the way the country swings from one extreme to another. This is captured in the dialogue.There are also dark sexual overtones/undertones in this book. Things to do with homosexuality, male bonding, fear psychoses, violence. Sexual references are covert and psychological - e.g., there is a greatly distorted story of Angulimala, more violent than the original describing a necklace of fingers, but in a subtext, penises. True to Sri Lankan style, we don't hear much beyond a couple gazing at each other and finding comfort in company. At the end there is a violent break up, perhaps too violent.I am concerned that the impression of Sri Lanka conveyed may be overcritical, brooding and dark. I think the Man Eaters of Punanai by C. Ondaatje, conveys something of Sri Lanka's troubles and potential treasures without any brooding sentiment.This book was dark, depressing and aromatic. Good to have read its limpid, chatty and at times disturbing/churning prose."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"A finalist for Britain's prestigious Booker Prize, &quot;Reef&quot; is the story of a Sri Lankan boy who carves out a place for himself in a precarious world.Animated by the lyrical narration of Triton, whose simple, focused voice resounds with enthusiasm and curiosity, mixed with the ignorance of the humble and uneducated, this is a touching, absorbing, entertaining novel.In the first pages, Triton is an adult, a restaurant owner in England, who stops at a gas station and encounters a cowering immigrant attendant who begs his help in figuring out his new job.Triton is plunged into the memories of 20 years before in Sri Lanka when, on the eve of a &quot;bungled coup&quot; he is scarcely aware of, he was brought to work at age 11 for Mister Salgado, a brooding scientist with a pessimistic passion for the nation's coral reefs.&quot;Mister Salgado's house was the centre of the universe, and everything in the world took place within its enclosure.&quot;His life shadowed by the hated figure of Joseph, the manservant, young Triton secures some pieces of onion to rub on the man's bed pallet. But suddenly there's an eruption of screams from next door. The old wife, it turns out, has tied her unfaithful husband in the bath and rubbed him all over with chilli powder. Triton chucked away his onion quarters; &quot;they seemed too tame, but I was not ready to use chilli yet.&quot;But soon, after a scene of abuse Triton can never speak of, Joseph is banished from the house and Triton has what he wants. He has Mr. Salgado to himself and he goes about his work with single-minded dedication, anticipating his employer's wishes, reading his books, emulating him in small matters like list-making.But even this is not enough. With the outside world irrelevant, except as it affects the mood and movements of his master, Triton, an ambitious man even if he doesn't know it, transforms himself into a chef extraordinaire. There is nothing he cannot create.And a new, exciting presence at the house, Nili, a woman with an appreciative appetite, and a salutary effect on Mr. Salgado, spurs Triton to go all out. The food is &quot;more than good. I knew, because I can feel it inside me when I get it right. It's a kind of energy that revitalizes every cell in my body. Suddenly everything becomes possible and the whole world, that before seemed slowly to be coming apart at the seams, pulls together.&quot;The house enjoys a resurgence of love and energy but outside events intrude, eroding their homelife and threatening their physical safety. Triton ignores politics as no concern of his, but no one can remain apart from the world, although it doesn't necessarily do any harm to try.Absorbed in his art, focused on his master, Triton finds contentment and satisfaction which he conveys in simple, delectable language and deceptively offhand anecdotes. Triton is a captivating character and Gunesekera a subtle, graceful writer with a rich feel for language."},{"Title":"Reef","review":"Romesh has added the 'spice' of Sri Lankan life to this fascinating book exposing the 'real life'scenes from Mr.Salgado's household.

Though I was disappointed with Gunesekera's &quot;Sandglass,&quot; I couldn't put this one down. I enjoyed the story because it was written from the point of view of the house servant, who knew more about the goings on in the house than his own master. It was interesting to see (and realize) just how much &quot;the help&quot; can know about intimacies of the families they work for, and how those who stay on grow so close to their families as well. The language is descriptive and paints an accurate picture of life in a middle-class, post-colonial household. The references to Sri Lankan food, culture, places and ideas all made me feel like I was visiting a Sri Lankan village again. There are parts when the book does drag from over-description, but it's over pretty quickly. I plan on exploring other books by this author as well!"},{"Title":"BABA OF KARO. A Woman of the Muslim Hausa","review":"Baba of Karo, a Woman of the Muslim Hausa, first published in 1945, is the fascinating autobiography of Baba, a very elderly Hausa woman. Baba talks about Hausa domestic life, slavery, farming and explains Hausa rituals. Her memories reach all the way back to the days of intertribal warfare and slave raids, providing an invaluable history of Hausa life in the late 1800s through the first half of the twentieth century.Although Baba of Karo remains a valuable classic in the field of African studies I think that it would be equally valuable in the area of women's studies. Anyone who is interested in women's history will find this an especially fascinating and informative book. At a time when no outside male would ever have been allowed access to interview a female, Mary Smith learned Hausa and spent uncountable daily sessions with Baba as the old women told her life's story of living in a polygynous marriage in the Hausa male-oriented society from a woman's point of view."},{"Title":"Human Rights Watch World Report","review":"About one-fifth of this global review of 1995 deals with the Middle East, and the picture of it is generally negative. Algeria hosts \\"an increasingly ugly war.\\" The human-rights picture in Egypt is \\"dismal.\\" Use of the death penalty has expanded in Iraq. Saudi Arabia experienced \\"further deterioration.\\" The Sudan suffers from Draconian emergency laws, the enslavement of women and children, and increasing economic difficulties. The only two governments to get thumbs-up are Kuwait and Morocco, with \\"significant improvements\\" in both cases.While Human Rights Watch and similar organizations do excellent work exposing individual abuses, in the aggregate, their efforts raise three troubling problems. The first has to do with a near blindness to scale: minor and occasional problems are seen as much the same as brutal and systemic ones. When Turkey is said to have \\"serious problems\\" and Syria is a \\"tightly controlled society,\\" that one is an open democracy and the other a totalitarian despotism gets obscured. In the literature of human rights, the censorship of a book is hardly different from mass murder. Second, emphasis on human-rights to the exclusion of all else leads to myopic policy recommendations in which national interests are virtually abandoned. For example, in the case of Turkey, the report implicitly criticizes the Clinton administration for not permitting human rights concerns to outweigh Turkey's role as an ally and a \\"big emerging market.\\" Third, an exclusive concentration on states means that such movements as Hamas and Islamic Jihad appear not to rate even a single mention.Middle East Quarterly, June 1996"},{"Title":"Human Rights Watch World Report","review":"The \\"Human Rights Watch World Report 1996\\" is a very interesting and an important collection of the human rights violations taking place around the world.

The book is organized by regions (Americas, Europe, Asia, etc.) then by countries with a detailed account of the human rights violations taking place within each country. This is an excellent research resource for those exploring the conditions of a particular country and wish to learn more about the human right of a particular country."},{"Title":"The Mysteries of Creation: The Genesis Story","review":"I'll start by stating that the book did stick to it's title: The Mysteries of Creation THE \\"GENSIS\\" STORY. To help one better gauge this book, if i had my own ranking system, i would give this a 4 on the nose. It's not 4.5 or 4.9, falling short of a 5 star rating. If you're looking for a book that compares creation accounts extensively in great detail, this is not it. At times, the author's writing style can be a bit vanilla but he makes up for it by sharing some interesting tidbits to tickle your mind.For example, he gives a little background on how there were other Hebrew creation poems and traditions that existed in Israel in ancient times. He refers the reader to Job38:7 and Isaiah40:12,21-22 as remnants and allusions to those earlier epics. He states that the Hebrew Creation account based on biblical experts(no names given) plausibly date the text narrative around the 6th century, B.C.E. and belive the author wrote it for the exicled Jews in Chaldea (Babylon). He does wet the appetite for one to do more research on Creation accounts. He gave a side by side of the Hebrew account vs. the Babylonian Cosmogony, 'Enuma Elish':GENSIS (Hebrew Creation Account)1) Chaos; darknesscovering the deep2) Light created3) Creation of firmament4) Creation of dry land5) Creation of luminaries6) Creation of man7) God rests and hallowsthe seventh dayENUMA ELISH (Babylonian Cosmogony)1) Primeval chaos; the Ti'ama(the sea)enveloped in darkness2) Light from the gods3) Firmament4) Dry Land5) Luminaries6) Man7) The gods rest and are festivethe seventh dayHe also touched on the authorship of the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy with reference to sources such as: \\"J\\" - Yahwist(Judah/Southern Kingdom); \\"E\\" -Elohist (Ephraim/Northern Kingdom); \\"P\\"-Priest and \\"D\\"-author of Deuteronomy. And also, \\"R\\"-Redactor(Editor of the J,E,P, and D accounts.) To better understand this belief or methodology, i'd refer one to Richard Elliott Friedman's: WHO WROTE THE BIBLE? This book is an excellent read but would have been better titled: 'WHO WROTE THE TORAH' or 'WHO WROTE THE FIRST FIVE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE?' This book will give one a greater understanding of what was going on during the time of the judges and kings. I highly recommend it!Back to the Mysteries of Creation. The author made reference to the HEPTADIC Principle, which focuses on the number 7. He goes on to explain that the number seven was not uncommon to be used as a daily part of Near Eastern Semitic customs and manners. Ex. When a king sat in council he generally had six ministers of state seated with him. He states that in the original Semitic language, Genesis1:1 consisted of \\"seven\\" words; the second verse contained fourteen(2 x 7); the literary of teh creation account itself consisting of six creation days and the final day of rest. He lengthens this point by sharing that teh nouns \\"God(35 times, 7 x 5),\\" \\"heaven and earth (21 ties, 7 x 3)\\" appear in multiples of seven. The term \\"water\\" appears seven times. And the expression \\"that it was beatiful\\"(Hebrew: \\"that is was good\\") appears seven times. He states that this same principle can be seen in the book of Revelation with the body of the book having seven visions, each vision divided into seven parts. Seven churches, angels(messengers) admonitions, lampstands, seals, trumpets, bowls and so forth. He strengthens his arguement by stating how some researchers claim that the adoption of the number seven may have originated from pristine astronomy. Seven planets were known to the ancients: SUN, MOON, MERCURY, VENUS, MARS, JUPITER, and SATURN.There are quite a few nuggets of insight in this book. The author does does a great job of providing the Hebrew and or Aramaic word for better understanding. An example is the origin of the name Jehovah. He states that a Christian scholar, Petrus Galatinus, who was a confessor to Pope Leo X, around 1518 C.E., transliterated 'yhwh' into the Lating consonants 'jhvh' and combined the vocalization(vowels) of the Hebrew term 'adonai'(Lord) with these Latin consonants, producing the name \\"JEHOVAH.\\" He goes on to briefly state that the term yahweh was so sacred that the Hebrews never pronounced it. Biblical scribes substituted 'adonai'(Lord) every time they read 'yhwh'.Later on in the book he breaks down the term \\"adam\\" and what it means. I won't go into detail so it will leave one open to the reading of this book. I will say how he noted that the word 'adamah' in Hebrew means \\"ground.\\" He goes into even further detail than this. Overall, this was a good book and would be best accepted by those who are seeking a deeper understanding and study of the creation account of Genesis."},{"Title":"The Mysteries of Creation: The Genesis Story","review":"This book was written in 1993, but is based on a 20-pages booklet of 1978/79, called \\"Genesis - chapter one\\", based on the Aramaic Peshitta Text of the Hebrew Bible. The new book is 135 English text pages long, with additional 12 pages of Genesis in Aramaic and Western Aramaic.As usual with Rocco A. Errico's explanation of Bible texts via a translation by meaning of Aramaic idioms, this book is worth being read. It is much shorter, but far superior to Ralph Ellis' take on Genesis, which is based on literal word-by-word translations forth and back of parallel meanings/connotations of ancient Egyptian. For the daring, this in other aspects rather hilarious book is calledEden In Egypt. In turn, Errico followed up his book withAramaic Light on Genesiswhich is longer and goes more precisely into details of the entire Genesis chapter. The book at hand concentrates merely on the creation part. Overlaps are negligible.This first book appears in a semi-mystical light, if there is such a thing. For example, the take on (the non-existence of) races is as ambivalent as is the one on the gender(s) issue, in respect to mysticism. (In this context mysticism meaning the disbelief in separations of any un-kind.) However way (dis)agreeable, for the special interested, it is worth to read the rather brief thoughts on these issues in the parameters of this book.The book doesn't quite reach the quality of Errico's books on the New Testament (e.g.Let There Be Light: The Seven KeysandSetting a Trap for God: The Aramaic Prayer of Jesus), even though it is recommendable. Still, I wonder wether the OLD Testament really has ARAMAIC at its source, but maybe this is meant as an intermediate step or the immediate text version at hand. Knowing the idioms and cultural context leading to a better overstanding than the later literal translations of these words."},{"Title":"The Mysteries of Creation: The Genesis Story","review":"Book arrived on time and in great condition.I own several commentaries by George Lamsa so this area of study is not new to me.

Barry Goldwater ran on the Republican ticket. This book was circulated by the hundreds of thousandsbefore the election, and although Goldwater lost, the message of the book had a profound impact in helping to shape the conservative movement in America. Consequently many eyeswere opened.At the time it was SO popular because of its message (it was never intended to be a literary masterpiece), I was working at a large CPA firm where a few of the staff would occasionallydiscuss political subjects at lunchtime. A couple of us were trying to persuade one of the CPA's as to what was taking place in our country. He inasmuch as said that he would ratherbe Red than dead, which revealed he knew little of the communist infiltration that had taken place in government. He consented to read this book, and it changed his thinking 180 degrees.This was written to INFORM Americans as to what had been taking place in the preceding decades.About a year ago I reread my well worn copy and was amazed at how history has proved John Stormer correct in his assessment fifty years ago. His closing challenge to Americans remainsas viable as it was the day he wrote it. That is why one should read this book!"},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better book on how the Communists influenced the West and how our leaders like Ike, Kennedy and especially FDR sold us out to their goals. Stormer gives detail after detail. This is NOT speculation. These issues are a matter of public record which Stormer references continually. His research is thorough.He covers a variety of approaches instead of pointing to some shady conspiracy, effectively showing how some choose to fight this battle of totalitarianism v. liberty in different ways. From the political manuevering of our troops, financial and military backing of socialist governments, concepts of containment, development of the CFR (which now even the mainstream media has been forced to acknowledge!!), to the numerous traitors (Alger Hiss, John Stewart Service, Lauchlin Curry), Earl Warren's anti-Constitution, power usurping Supreme Ct.There are many details here that you are probably not aware of. That doesn't mean thesethings didn't happen. It tends to mean only that you were misled. I personally don't think it's an accident. It sounds cynical to view it this way, but everyone knows the adage that \\"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" Lord Acton was right, and when we accept this we can change the situation. I can't say enough good about this book. The only issue I have with it involves somewhat insulting treatment of the actions of the POW's in the Korean War."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"After reading Ann Coulters bestseller Treason, I happened to run into this old book by accident. It seemed intriguing so I plowed through it. Now part of the reason I gave it just an average rating wasn't so much because I think the author was some kind of nut, the impression one may get by reading some of the other reviews, but simply because I'm used to excellent writing and more concise topics. This little book just jumps all over the place, tries to cover too much ground.Now, as to the accuracy of his words, well, much of what he claimed to be happening has indeed been proven true. The soviets did intent to keep taking as much as they could and the fact that they failed doesn't in anyway prove those worried about it were wrong.American politicians betrayed countless peoples to the insipid and cruel system of communism, and the only people that try and act like that isn't true are either leftists or those ignorant of history. Our own government was infiltrated by soviet spies, of that fact there's little argument, it's just how many and what they were trying to accomplish and what they did accomplish that brings up two arguing camps.If you're the type that thinks Coulter is a fascist, you'll obviously gain nothing by reading this book. For others, you have to have an interest in the history of the time to really enjoy this book which reads much like a text book at times. Part of the reason I gave it only three stars was because of the age of the work and the period it covers, being outdated meant I wasn't able to pick up on a lot of the flavor of the work.If you're doing research on the topic, however, I'd say the book probably would rate a four or five star rating as it gives details and footnotes and covers a lot of ground."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"My Dad picked up a softcover copy of this at a garage sale and gave it to me to read. I read it through and then bought 2 copies and gave them to my Dad and Brother. I plan to get more as soon as money allows.I recommend this book to anyone I engage in conversation with. If you want a detailed explanation of the systematic unraveling of our Constitution and our Nation this is the book for you. Don't get caught up in the political smoke screen the politicians put up. There is NO difference between the Democrats and Republicans, this is abundantly clear to anyone with half a brain today, however this book just goes to show how long the raping and pillaging of America has gone on by our politicians. It is very eery to read the warnings that were written half a century ago and to see how precisely the schemes are being put into place today. The facts layed out in None Dare Call It Treason all have footnotes and cite the original source of information, no hearsay in this book.The bottom line is if you want to understand the big picture, read this book!"},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"It has been years since I read this book but as it inspired my undergraduate paper, it made an impression.I think the author, Stormer, was sensationalizing. I remember an episode where Nelson Rockefeller supposedly met on a Soviet submarine in Long Island Sound with some nefarious characters to plot the takeover of America by the USSR. In the real world, Nelson was actually quite a bit more hawkish than Nixon and was pro-defense spending. Then there was State Department Plan 7277 which was a plan to surrender to either the Soviets or the U.N. Stormer was always a bit ambiguous about Communists and the One World Socialist Conspiracy. It sounded as though they were alternative enemies at times at then at other times one would assume they were the same.There certainly are consipiracies, including obviously a Communist one to destroy our freedom, but Stormer connected too much: politicians, educators, modern art, water floridation. To acknowledge that conspiracies exist is not to credit all history to a grand conspiracy theory. When the conspiracy theory gets too complicated it starts to break down. No single group has such magical powers to control so many events over decades or even centuries.If what he said was true, then how did we win the Cold War???"},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"An interesting footnote to 1950's cold war politics, \\"None Dare Call It Treason\\" tries to send a wake up call to a supposedly sleeping America.Like his hero, the unlamented Senator Joseph McCarthy, John Stormer sees the 'Communist Conspiracy' lurking behind every facade. Teachers, clergy, politicians, and labor unions form a ring of socialist spies and conspirators that will strip us of the Constitution and shackle us to the Soviet machine. From the United Nations to the White House no one was exempted from getting tarred with the Red paintbrush (if I may mix my metaphors).The \\"careful documentation\\" heralded on the cover consists of copious footnotes taken from Un-American Activities committee minutes and the like, the majority of which are fragmentary sentences without context. Several times he classifies an individual as a \\"Communist supporter\\" and then cites himself as a reference \\"as previously stated\\". The only people quoted at any length are the vaunted McCarthy, and former FBI head J. Edgar Hoover, both of whom had known agendas.I will not dismiss his work as paranoid - it is a fact that the times in question were full of uncertainty and well-reasoned fear. The cloud of nuclear war hung over everyone, and espionage on both sides was part and parcel of the times. However the answer is not in purging our infrastructure of dissenters and spying on our neighbors. These were the methods of Hoover ... and Stalin.This book proves that conspiracy theories are always popular, especially when varnished with a thin veneer of research. And if you word it vaguely enough, there will be those who will come back years later and say, \\"See, he was RIGHT!\\" It worked for Nostradamus."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"John Stormer, an octogenarian Cold War relic, left a steady job writing about electronics in 1962 to \\"study communism\\" on his own. No, he didn't do this professionally. Stormer was an early member of the John Birch Society, a white far right wing nationalist organization that was rife with conspiratorial views of history and politics. This book is the first in a series of fervent, inaccurate conspiratorial tomes by this author that history has passed by long ago.NDCIT has no business reamining in print, since it was written pre-Civil Rights, pre-women's rights, pre- Roe v, Wade, pre-Reagan, pre-corporate and investment speculation (& economic collapse) America, pre-internet, pre-cable TV, etc. etc. -- all those other big changes in American society that have happened in the 50 years since this book was conceived.It was also written before communism collapsed in Russia and Eastern Europe, and China became capitalist.As the Soviet Union was coming apart in 1989, the clueless Stormer claimed that \\"Perestroika and Glasnost were merely Soviet propaganda tools,\\" though they actually led to the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in real time and space. Like many fervent anti-communists, he couldn't grasp the Cold War victory of the US and the West, and kept asserting that a vast communist conspiracy was still afoot - even today, infiltrating the US government like some sort of virus. Hello, readers -- corporate lobbyists have infiltrated the US government, not communists!Despite a life of denouncing the US government, Stormer has since 1993 happily collected Social Security benefits. There's no fool like an old fool. He dodders on 50 years later."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"If you are interested at all in the &quot;real truth&quot; in history, you MUST purchase this book. Find out how our history shapes our nation today."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"Stormer first wrote this book in 1964, which shows just how prescient he was. This edition was revised in 1990. I just found out about it, but have not read it yet. Judging from the other reviews, he has added a LOT to it; and he might not have arranged this much expanded material as carefully as he organized the less ambitious scope of the first edition. The first one was very tightly reasoned.As I understand it, State Department Document 7277 was a plan for total global disarmament. President Kennedy presented this global vision in his speech to the United Nations in 1963. All the nations of the world will be gradually disarmed until no state will be able to challenge the progressively strengthened UN Peace Force. Whenever any Congressman expressed concern about this, his colleagues insisted, \\"They're just talking.\\" In other words, just ignore the frighteneing rhetoric that was written into the founding document of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.To understand some of Stormer's new material better, read \\"The Naked Capitalist\\", by W. Cleon Skousen. Read with especial care the section about John Ruskin and the philosophy of Plato. What ties all these disparate movements together is that they all are basically working towards a New World Order based on Plato's Republic. I don't know about Rockefeller being an anti-communist hawk; but Skousen shows that from the beginning, the global communist revolution has been financed by wealthy western capitalists. They are following the dictum of Plato: use any means available to destablize the existing world order, to prepare the way for the new world order. Abraham Lincoln began to understand some of this when he discovered that all the international bankers were financing both sides in the Civil War.The Bible predicts all of this, and prophesies that it will result in the Battle of Armageddon. It is an irony of world history that those who work towards world peace are driving the world towards its final war. When men refuse to submit to the enlightened rule of the new peace-makers, the rulers will in their self-righteousness resort to extreme repression. The sinful natures of the rulers, unchecked by political accountablity- for all men are sinners- will drive them into all sorts of bloody lusts against the people and against each other. The Bible says it will be the worst tyranny in all of world history- a title which, considering the competition, deserves a lot of respect."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"I was forced to read this book as a teenager during Sunday night services at a Baptist church. I was a Goldwater fan and would have voted for him if I had been of age.However, this book is a joke, purporting to name all of the \\"commies\\" in the Government. It just names names without any justification. I recently thought that we had gotten past this kind of name-calling and these kind of accusations. But no, it is now coming back to haunt us again present day (2012).The problem here is that the right-wingers who supported this book 50 years ago and the same right-wingers today don't want to be reminded of the First Amendment to the Constitution and it's phrase \\"freedom of speech\\". I am not a \\"commie\\" but I have had friends who were communists or socialists. I even knew an anarchist. Never once have I ever disputed their right to their views.

It deftly (and inadvertently) makes a case for exactly why NOT to oversimplify arguements into good vs. evil.

It was a sick anti-American tirade then and it has not gotten any better with age. Historians will find this book fascinating for documenting the depths to which America can fall.

God help us if anyone buying this evil, sick, piece of anti-American propaganda takes it seriously."},{"Title":"None Dare Call It Treason","review":"This book is nothing more than fascist cold war propaganda. According to the author, the tiny American Communist Party (thoroughly infiltrated by the FBI, I might add) and its leader Gus Hall have secretly controlled the United States for decades now. The author provides no documentation for this allegation, no verification at all, he just reads Gus Halls self important public statements, then tries to show how this proves that Gus Hall controlled some policy of the government.

It's the story of the church from the 1838 Missouri period to Joseph Smith's assassination in Illinois in 1844. It could be called a historical novel, but it mixes straight history with fictionalized narrative, much like the other books in this trilogy, &quot;The Last Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Rocky Mountain Empire&quot;. The effect (and tone) is not unlike like that of Tom Wolfe. Taylor loves his people but can't restrain his satirical bent. The result is a mixture of reverence and realism that is unique in Mormon literature. This is an epic story well told, and should be interesting to anyone who enjoys Western American history."},{"Title":"Nightfall at Nauvoo","review":"I remember picking up a paperback copy of this book years ago simply because it had a chilling picture of some covered wagons leaving a town during a snow bound winter, and the title added to the ominous impression. My thought was &quot;Why would anyone travel in those conditions?&quot; I was soon to find out. This book was first published as a hardback by Macmillan Company of New York, New York in 1971, and it drew me into one of the most exciting, colorful, and extraordinary true stories that was ever recorded about the wild West during the 1840s. It's a good thing no one had told me that this was about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, popularly known as the Mormons, because had I known that I would have thought &quot;Oh, Oh, religion,&quot; and not given it any further investigation. I came from a Catholic background, and I didn't really think about it until later, but the Mormon church was the other important organization responsible for settling the West. Once a person has this insight, they won't be surprised when encountering entire shelf loads of books about Mormons in bookstores run by folks who actually know something about Western Americana. What you have in this book is the story of a town built by the Mormons in Illinois, and how controversies arose there which resulted in the death of Joseph Smith, the founder of the church. Now I'm not going to spoil it for you by filling in too much, but after Joseph Smith was killed at Carthage, just outside Nauvoo, his church split into a number of competitive factions. The largest of these, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is based in Salt Lake City, Utah. The second largest one, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is headquartered in Independence, Missouri. There were other factions which came out of the incidents in this story as well, but the largest are usually the most familiar. This story will introduce you to the controversies that go on to this day between many Mormon sects - and also between Mormons and the outside world. It will give you an understanding of why there are so many people hooked on collecting anything they can about Mormon splinter groups, or anything published by those sects. In fact, the culture of Mormon politics is exciting enough to quench the thirst of anyone already hooked on political ideology or more familiar forms of religious theology. Imagine a true story which is partly a nerve wracking wild West shoot out, and blend that with the scattering seeds of a peculiar religion, and you've got some idea of the riveting read you're in for. Nightfall At Nauvoo is the reason I'll usually stop to examine any book about LDS (Mormonism), and it's also the reason I nearly always find the time to say hello to their missionaries. It is a great story by a great writer, on the same level of importance as Jim Bishop's The Day Lincoln Was Shot; Bernal Diaz's Conquest of New Spain - about Cortes bringing down the Aztec empire; and William Connelley's perfect telling of Quantrills destruction of Lawrence Kansas. Some readers may even appreciate that it has similar elements."},{"Title":"Nightfall at Nauvoo","review":"In his Introduction, Samuel W. Taylor wrote: \\"I look upon the Nauvoo story as Americana, with Mormonism providing the flavor and color to a unique chapter in the epic saga of western migration.\\" Readers will come away from this book with different thoughts. For me, Nightfall At Nauvoo introduced me to Orrin Porter Rockwell, who was Joseph Smith's personal body guard at Smith's request. Since 1972 I've been chasing Porter's ghost. The chase has been very interesting. It has led me to many visits to Nauvoo where I told an Elder in 1978 that the church is going to rebuild the Nauvoo Temple. \\"Oh no\\" they replied but as of this day there it stands. I can't think of a book that caught my spirit the way Nightfall At Nauvoo did at that time. For those of you who have an interest in Americana be careful of this book. It will grab you and pull you in."},{"Title":"Nightfall at Nauvoo","review":"Samule W. Taylor has done an outstanding job of merging fact and fiction in Nightfall at Nauvoo. I am a lifelong Mormon and a history buff, and truly appreciate the way Taylor presents a balanced picture of what life was truly like in Nauvoo during the time the Church members were there. This is definitely not &#34;faith promoting&#34; history, but telling the truth as accurately and fairly as one can."},{"Title":"Nightfall at Nauvoo","review":"If you are considering joining the Latter day Saints or even voting for Mitt Romney, this is a must read.A history of the church written by a member that was denounced by the church years after it was published.The Mormons do like to re-invent themselves whenever it is convenient."},{"Title":"Nightfall at Nauvoo","review":"As an amateur historian on religion and religious cults I found Taylor's treatment both informative and entertaining. My interest goes a little deeper since I live fairly close to Nauvoo and have visited the site often. My knowledge of the Mormon cult and its founder Joesph Smith was deepened by this book. I find it interesting that a religion with such a stormy and checkered beginning, with conflicting 'revelations,' bloody purges within its own membership, and a set of strange and secretive doctrines, could become so mainline. I am a firm believer in believing in whatever 'God' you want and in anything you want, as long as you don't hurt anyone, are honest about what you believe, and not pretend to be something you are not (i.e. Christian). Taylor's book (even as dated as it is and of course not the only treatment of this subject) opens the door on the Mormon past and its secrets, revealing much that would be kept hidden. I highly recommend it to all who are curious about the cult of the Church of the Latter Day Saints."},{"Title":"Chad and the elephant engine","review":"This is a kid's historical book about the legends surrounding the Denver railroads.

I'm not much of a reader, but this story really got me interested. You can tell that this story is for real, by what happens. This story appeals to me because I can relate to it. Many other younger people could relate to this story and that is why I would actually recommend this to any young kid that has a rough time in school. To some extent it has some lessons to it. For example, she teaches her kids to be respectful of themselves. Without a doubt in my mind if any young kids read this they would fully enjoy this heart felt story."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

The book is so much better than the movie because the book is true. The students really touch your heart. This books reads like fiction because LouAnne Johnson is a professional writer and she knows how to tell a story. As a teacher, I have had many students similar to the ones LouAnne Johnson writes about. And I met her at a teacher's conference. She truly cares about young people and has devoted her life to trying to improve our education system so that more children and teachers can enjoy school. Those teachers who say terrible things about this book are probably just jealous. Sour grapes won't help them become better teachers - but reading this book might help, if they tried some of LouAnne's techniques, such as using private journals to communicate with kids. Her ideas really do work."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

LouAnne's description of the classroom atmosphere and individual lives of students make this more than just a story of HER teaching years. This is real life, baby, and you'll get a healthy taste of the educational system that is still clunking along today. LouAnne is the genuine article, the real McCoy and the students sense her deep-level caring. Fortunately, by reading the book, you can glean a similar sense of the Love, openness, attention, and hope that LouAnne shared with these students. No wonder they were all considered &quot;dangerous minds.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

This story is about a teacher who was an ex-marine that is going to teach at a local high school. The students are troubled and don't want to learn. Ms. Johnson is a new teacher who came to their high school; she didn't know their problems and didn't even know that they were in special classes. There was never a teacher who wanted to teach these students. Ms. Johnson tries so many things to get their attention. She teaches them things that they never knew before. She even helps them with their family problems. Ms. Johnson helps them with their lives and gives them strength to brighten their future. She never gives up on her kids. Ms. Johnson teaches them things they never thought they could learn or do. She gives them hope in themselves.I recommend this book to students as well to teachers. Students should know there are teachers out there who do care about you and will try to help you through things. You're not alone. I think it would also help some teachers to read this book. They would see how Ms. Johnson was towards her students and maybe they could learn something to make themselves become better educators."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

Almost all of her students were troubled and underpriveleged. Throughout the course of the year, she began to change the way these students viewed school, and showed them the importance school will have on their futures. Individually, she connected with each of her students personally, and helped them when troubled, whether in, or out of school. A strong trust between the students and teacher was what made their relationship work well. Each student knew that Mrs. Johnson was there for them, and that she would guide them along where ever they needed help.

You may think you've seen something like this before and you have, you probably watched the movie \\"Dangerous Minds\\". If you have not watched the movie, I suggest you read the book first to compare which one you will enjoy more. As for me, I thought the book was good, but of course, who doesn't like watching movies? Also I recommend that the age groups that do read this are that of High School and above so that they can actually relate to this book. Such as me, I thought even though I don't go to the schools in New York, I feel I can relate to the students in this book and so can you.

As I was reading the book I would be so involved with Ms. Johnson's school days that I wouldn't want to put the book down. I would recommend this book to both teachers and students.

Mrs. Johnson, the teacher of a class full of bad students, was able to conquer what most teachers wouldn't dare to try. Mrs. Johnson showed her students that she cared and that she was not going to give up on them. The book helped me to see that even if someone is labled as a problem student that they are able to learn and achieve great things. I think that this would be good for students who have behavior problems in school, because it will show them that they can also do as good as Mrs. Johnson's class did. This book also shows the devotion that some teachers have when it comes to teaching students such as the ones in Mrs. Johnson's class.

A lot of teachers try to work with them, but nobody has success, until LouAnne Johnson comes. She is able to motivate them to learn, because she has the dream to help the children to make something out of their lives. She knows that they can manage school and life, because in her eyes every single student is something special. LouAnne Johnson should be an example for other teachers, because with her ideas lots of problems would not exist.

LouAnne Johnson encourages them to live their dreams and to never give up. She tells her story with a lot of humor and describes the problems that teachers face in American high schools. I wish there were more teachers like LouAnne Johnson, who really care about their students. She teaches them what's really important for life, and exactly this IS the job of a teacher. I recommend this book to every teacher hoping that many of them will follow LouAnne Johnson's example. At least I wish to add that in my opinion the book is far better than the Hollywood picture. It's much more interesting and worth reading."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

Her","review":"Isn't this book actually about a suburban school on the San Francisco Peninsula, not an inner city school in L.A.?"},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . . Her","review":"The book &quot;Dangerous minds&quot; by LouAnne Johnson describes the situation of a female teacher who loves her job. She tries to give her students important properties such as knowledge and courage of forming their own independent opinion. She always tries to motivate her students although they first aren't fascinated of putting much effort in learning and working hard just for passing school. But in her friendly honest way she never gives up until they realise that you can improve your situation by learning and working hard. They also understand that they aren't learning for school but for their own life. Miss Johnson reaches her goal because she takes every single student just as he is - without any prejudices. Just a friendly word or a single smile can give her students the feeling of being somebody who it is worth working for. Trough her abnormal teaching methods and her perseverance but mostly through her simple and friendly way she interacts with everyone her students gain confidence for a better future. The book shows in an interesting way how a single but highly motivated person can help others although their situation isn't very good. She describes single situations and because there is no chronological order in the book it is often very disturbing. Somehow the book is also too long because she always speaks of the same items -how she helps her students."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

She tries to solve a variety of problems and she teaches her students to see what's really important for them and she's also able to convince them to work on their lifes. I'd recommend that book to everyone who's interested in reading about a &quot;superwoman&quot; teaching very difficult students!"},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

I dont care to recommend it to anyone, but if you like what you see then pick up the book and try it."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . . Her","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much, even when the methods of Lou Anne Johnson sound a bit unrealistic. Nowadays most pupils aren't motivated enough, but I think with practicising these methods it would be easier to get pupils' attention and interest. I've also seen the film and I think its better to understand, because the book contains many snapshots, but the film is a whole story. However, I would recommend the book to many pupils and teachers as well."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . . Her","review":"November 24, 1999To whom it may concern:I was one of the students in the classroom. I played Deanna. She was the student who was loud and obnoxiuos. She told Michelle Phieffer to come and live in her neighborhood for one week.I found that working for the production company at Disney was exciting. I enjoyed all the attention a young person who is also an actor recieves on set!Your head can become quite a bit swollen. The luxury of being a teen with a big cash flow working on a major film set gave me the opportunity to see this was a life-style I could easily get use to quickly.I appreciated the opportunity to develop a character for the film where I was allowed to research for two weeks on set. This is a rare treasure as an actor,but due to the fact that I didn't know the California &quot;lingo&quot; I had to speak to the local people.The information I gathered in regards to my character was very heavy information. Some of the lives of a California &quot;black&quot; girl can be kind of ruff. I tried to represent her pain and the loss of drive in seeing happiness at the end of a high school diploma that wasn't going to effect anything in her neighborhood or lifestyle.After completing the film and coming back to New York, I found myself searching for what was my drive for succeeding in life. I really hadn't taken the opportunity to invest in a set plan, but things have changed.I'm attending New York University now and I'm studying writing and art is my minor. I had a fabulous internship during the Summer where I got to write my first adolescent play.The last thing that has happened is just as classes began this Fall of 1999 I booked a gig to play Mary J. Blige's friend in the movie, &quot;Prison Song&quot;.I'm greatful to God for all my wonderful endeavors and challenges that have happened to me, and I look forward to much more to come!I'm at school right now working on a comedy skit that I'm submitting to Nickelodeon for a possible intership this Summer. &quot;WISH ME LUCK!&quot;I came across your web-site as I was trying to do some research on my last name, Jerido. I'm trying to find out where my last name originates from. This is what I do when I take a break from writing I research to find out more things going on around the world.I had fun writing this and I hope that you will up-date my credits on your web'site for me. I got such a kick of finding my name included on a web-site.This was a great Thanksgiving prelude for me. My last name is credited as the first Jerido and only so far to star in a movie. Not just one, but now three!P.S. HAPPY GOBBLE GOBBLE ;) write me back if you would like.Peace to who reads this and have a great Millenium ballSincerely,Ebony Sunshine Jerido EMAIL ADDRESS: eaj3@is9.nyu.edu"},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . .

Some times I get lost in the book, for example my teacher has seen me reading and she has heard me laugh out loud. She loves it when her students get lost in a book like that. She really wants to be a math teacher but by her teaching english she has helped me learn how to enjoy and understand books like this one. I think every one should read this book."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . . Her","review":"I can't say a bad word about this book. Sometimes I really liked the way the teacher helps students, and sometimes it was just kind of boring and unrealistic. The other thing I liked was that every chapter was about different students and different problems. This kind of helps me to understand the problems which the teacher had with these students. Like I said before, in some ways it was unrealistic but I would like to have teachers like that in some of my classes. In comparing the book to the movie, the book carried more information about students and makes you visualize what it was like in Mrs. Johnson's class."},{"Title":"Dangerous Minds: They Were Problem Kids With One Last Chance . . . Her","review":"*This book is about a new teacher that has just taken a new job in a terrible neighborhood. Ms. Johnson is an ex-marine, which was trained to kill with her bare hands, with this particular feature used to get her students attention. She is one of those people that believe that not everyone is rotten inside. Even though they might be all thug on the outside it's not always that way on the inside. The students that she taught all came from rough backgrounds were most of their did not even finish high school. She goes as far as getting involved with her own students' lives, which is in great danger. She gained her students trust and has faith in to be a person, a human being that does not give up and tries. She gave her students the drive to gain more and more need for knowledge successfulness which no other teacher gave them before.**I really enjoyed this book because it contains all real life evidence of how some students live in bad hoodlums. How they sometimes have teachers that do not appreciate them as much as they should. There are teachers just like Miss Johnson that wish to take these students to a better place of education. To prove that it is not always the way it looks like on the surroundings, it all lies within one-self. This is a book that I would most definitely recommend to anyone who loves to read about life this would be a great book to relate to life itself."},{"Title":"Turkish Cooking: A Culinary Journey through Turkey","review":"I am about to send the book back, for the following reasons : - a large part of the book is not concerned with food, but is an account of the author's travels. I think the presentation of the book should have made this clear. - Many recipes rely on meat substitutes. It has always struck me as the sign of a sad lack of imagination when vegetarian food tries to mimick meat-based cooking. It is particularly regrettable when one writes about Turkish cuisine, which has some of the most delicious NATURALLY vegetarian dishes."},{"Title":"Turkish Cooking: A Culinary Journey through Turkey","review":"It's a good book it brings me back to some great family recipes from my Nana.

Sir Nicolson has an easy effortless style, so breezy and confident it feels like a John Singer Sargent painting, a deft portrait of British aristocracy. Each chapter is a sketch of someone in Nicolson's past and whether the person or the situation is the fiction is for you to decipher, or merely enjoy. If you need a plot and action, if you need important subjects and momentous events, this book is not for you. If, instead, you are a fan of the art of writing for its own sake, wry and dry and witty, vivid characterizations, elegant turns of phrase, even some shades of Nabokov in my opinion, then I think you will like this and think it well worth your time. One note; Sir Nicolson's easy fluency has allowed him the indulgence of ending many a chapter with a french phrase, so the monolingually challenged should have a translator handy for the punchline."},{"Title":"The U.S. Open: Game, Set, Unmatched","review":"This book is Superb bound Quality printed on High Gloss paper containing some very rare and beautiful pictures ranging from turn of the century to Pete Sampras.

This book happened to be in our library and it has become an invaluable resource for me in teaching American history in this very unique context.I appreciate that the author focuses on issues of race, gender, and class in addition to the presidents and wars of old-style history books. The layout of the book is visually appealing and it includes abundant and well-chosen pictures which I find useful for picture description activities (a great way to get language learners to interact with history!)The other advantage of this book is that it's sophisticated enough to be challenging to high school students, but not so difficult that English language learners get bogged down by the text. My students have found it interesting and motivating to read. Overall, I'm very satisfied."},{"Title":"American History: A Survey, Vol. 2 (Student Study Manual, 10th Edition)","review":"I find this book incredibly irritating, in that I can read a sentence; it makes perfect sense, and then I realize -- HOW do people know that? Why should I believe it? There are no sources cited, no primary sources quoted. The book tells me that &quot;...the Pilgrims were less committed to grand designs, less concerned about how they were viewed by others, than the Puritans who settled the larger and more ambitious English colonies to their north.&quot; How do people know this? Are there written records? If so, why aren't they quoted? Or why, at least, are they not cited so I can go look them up? I might even be happy to have a secondary source cited. But as it is, I have no reason to believe any of what it says...

This book is among the best you will find in that category. Once you start reading this book, you will immediately realize that EVERYONE, married or not, is in the same boat: either looking to begin a relationship, healing from the wounds of a past relationship, or trying to maintain a relationship. Hence, almost everyone can benefit from this book. Whereas most books start with the assumption that you are are already in a committed relationship, this book starts from the very beginning: Courtship. The authors take what they call a preventative approach: they base it on their assumption that there are certain markers that define a sound and healthy relationship. They tell you what to look for along the way, beginning with that first email, or phonecall or date. As a middle aged male, I can heartily recommend this book for men as well as for women. One little example: in this book, they discuss the role of intuition. Too often we dismiss the little voices inside that tell us something is wrong in the relationship. These authors are very adamant that one must listen to this voice of the intuition, and trust it! This is also a book about healing, and beginning again. Read this book once a year for at least three years. It can save you from getting involved with the wrong person, or from losing your marriage to divorce."},{"Title":"Going the Distance: Secrets to Lifelong Love","review":"Whether you are in a new relationship, determining if you should seriously commit to one or married, the information in this book will help you.

On the stage she meets Beau McMasters who recently won at a card game a saloon and a ranch in Heaven's Gate.Beau and Abigail are attracted to one another and the locals encourage their relationship. As they fall in love, Abigail's past shows up and to her horror Beau is shot. Refusing to leave his side though that leaves her in peril, Abigail knows she owes Beau two truths: who she truly is and that she loves him.This is a solid western romance that the audience will fully enjoy due to the antics of the lead couple though it is the outsiders who bring the late suspense to the fine nineteenth century story line. LUCK OF THE DRAW is a fast-paced read though the climax seems off kilter as the chasers converge on Butler, which would seem more like a needle in a haystack.

If it weren't for my promise, I would have stopped midway through the first chapter. The author is passionate about her topic; this is clear. But she opens her research files and drops everything she has ever learned or discovered in our laps, helter skelter. The chaotic river of names--in particular multiple names for one supposed entity--from a variety of ethnicities and legends is enough to drown the best swimmer. She makes adamant statements, some of which are merely her opinion yet presented as historic truth. This books cries out for an editor, a substantial glossary of proper names, and a team of proofreaders (one example will suffice: on the title page, the publisher's location is missing the closing parenthesis). Sloppy, narcissistic work. Freshman college English students learn what this writer needs to be told: don't let your sources write the paper for you, and be sure to introduce every person you quote, explaining why the reader should care what the source has to say. Matthews has filled this book with lengthy quotations from other sources without introduction or explanation, merely the requisite endnote."},{"Title":"Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom: The Divine Feminine From Black Goddess to World-Soul","review":"The book is loaded with good information regarding the proper role of Sophia in relationship to God and to the earth. Filled to perfection of truths, that one would not have to study further. It is written very well, and very easily understood. It is remarkable how much truth she gathered with the world trying to suppress the female deity of the Godhead. All efforts to abolish the authority of Sophia were defeated upon the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. The writings of Jesus in the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, G.R.S.Mead, would never be accepted by churchs because they told the whole world &quot;Jesus never wrote a book&quot;.

Next to Merlin Stone, there is no better reference book for those who are following the movements of Wisdom in our modern world. Wisdom or Sophia is now more than ever speaking volumes through the creative voices of current time. For those who 'hear', this book is essential."},{"Title":"Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom: The Divine Feminine From Black Goddess to World-Soul","review":"This is only one of several books about the little understood divine feminine, the feminine side of God. to the modern christian the Shekhinah is a mystery, the holy spirit is a mystery. this is do to the modern church lack of study into the history of the subject.there is no mystery as to the glory filling the temple, or the baptism of the holy ghost. what we refuse to consider is what They believed, (Both the Jews and the early church or why.) We have been molded into a modernistic mindset. Ont his subject I also recommend On the wings of Shekhinah, the Cosmic Shekinah, Was God a Woman? When God was a woman, Did God have a wife? the latter two are scholarly works with an impeccable approach to the subject.Whether you're a believer or not, it will enrich your life on both a personal and spiritual level. through this I hope you can gain the insight to delve deep not into the mysticism, but the beliefs of the early church for knowing your roots is to know yourself and where you're going.For those who are Christians, there is no mystery we cannot find the answer to, for those who are a student of religious history or history in general, you will find the true roots of modern beliefs and through this one can find out why our beliefs on some important subjects has changed through the years.In the Bible there are several hundred references of God in the feminine sense verses the masculine sense. (See the names of God.) We assume yet often our assumptions are based not on research but philosophy. I encourage you to start on a journey of self exploration based on historical beliefs and fact. When one starts this journey, you might be amazed that the early church did believe in the (SOPHIA). One might be shocked to notice the Jews or the early christian church were not the only ones to believe in God or part of God in this fashion.I feel my picks will take this subject out of the realm of new age or mysticism and will allow the reader to gain further insight into the subject."},{"Title":"Sophia: Goddess of Wisdom: The Divine Feminine From Black Goddess to World-Soul","review":"I'll be blunt. I didn't care for this book. I bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the Gnostic Sophia. Instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions Her.

This collection continues to follow the strangely normal lives of this loving couple and their expanding, sometimes erratic, family. Barela continues to show that life as a couple, whether gay or straight, is pretty much a universal constant -- ups, downs, fights, reconciliation, funny, sad, etc. It tackles dating, marriage, children, ghosts, tragedy, and a hilarious visit to Heaven. Whatever your orientation, you'll find that you can relate to what's going on. If you've read &quot;Domesticity Isn't Pretty,&quot; you must read this one. If not, don't be surprised if the ghosts of Tchaikovsky and Brahms pay you a visit..."},{"Title":"Kurt Cobain & Mozart Are Both Dead: Leonard & Larry 2 (Leonard & Larry Ser. 2)","review":"With his second anthology of the \\"Leonard and Larry\\" comics, Tim Barela proves that he is one of the very few artists of a Gay comic strip who gets it right on a regular basis. Then again, any person who followed Leonard Goldman and Larry Evans through their decade long run in Frontiers magazine could have told you that. Yet, if you had to show a gay comic to any members of your straight family, how many do you think would \\"get it\\"? Leonard and Larry often make their point without being so \\"out\\" as to miss their target, and that is what marks Barela's true strength as a humorist/artist. Where most gay comics tend to be overtly clever excuses for all things pink and triangular, Leonard and Larry could be a humor story about any pair of American Marrieds. These two characters have more depth than most TV sitcoms, and indeed, it is Barela's infusion of dimensionality and warmth into all his characters that makes this series so memorable.In \\"Kurt Cobain and Mozart Are Both Dead,\\" the humor has as much grounding in real life as any TV script; Leonard and Larry have an near marriage breakup, Jim and Merle have a spat over the too zealous female, and in this book's best sequence, Larry's near death experience during the birth of his daughter in-law Debbie's second child. The morphing of the angel should be required reading for every 700 Club viewer who threw money at their TV screen every time Pat Robertson spewed an (anti) family values rant at them.That Barela has his characters make their points about gay life without having to toss in the bubble butt tight jeans clone or the limp wristed disco bunny is testimony to the ongoing brilliance of the Leonard and Larry story boards. These two gents are men behaving normally, they just happen to be gay. Can you name any gay entertainment medium that utilizes more stable monogamous relationships? It's the kind of scenario everyone screams the gay world needs presented in entertainment more often, and it's been in a comic book all along."},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"This is a short book, just 164 pages of text (plus notes, chronology, a brief lexicon of \\"heretical\\" terms, suggestion for further reading, bibliography and index), written by Sean Martin, who is identified as a filmmaker, poet and writer.The book has the heft and feel of a television documentary. It provides a reasonably good, if shallow overview of the events that erupted into denunciation, crusade, massacre and burning from the mid-Twelfth to the early Fourteenth Century.The book is consistently neutral in tone. It takes no sides, although there is a certain pervasive admiration for the behavior, if not for the theology of the Cathar Perfecti. Simon de Montfort, French father of the famous English Simon de Montfort, and an unmitigated villain of the first water, is mildly chided. No reader of whatever stripe is likely to be alienated by \\"The Cathars,\\" save for those who simply cannot abide neutrality in anything.The language of the book is as neutral as its content. Incidents of highest drama, such as the scandal at Verfeil, a village near Toulouse, in which the outraged and sputtering Saint Bernard was laughed out of town when he attempted to deliver a sermon against the Cathars, are treated in the flattest of tones, as is the famous siege and massacre at Montsegur.The words of the book are as flattened as its tone. Names, wherever possible, are provided in their English forms: all Pierres, Pieros and Pedros, for example, become Peter. Latinisms are avoided if an English term can be twisted for service. This leads to the exasperating use of English Perfect as a stand-in for both Latin Perfectus and Perfecti. As Sean Martin might have written, Raymond Agulher, a Perfect and Cathar bishop, was captured at Montsegur and he was among the more than two hundred Perfect, including twenty-one Perfect consecrated at the last moment, who were burnt after the fall of the castle.Sean Martin does not press his sources for more than they actually contain. The previous Amazon reviewer finds the discussion of Cathar \\"theology far too vague.\\" It is vague in this book for the simple reason that we in the Twenty-first Century don't and can't know very much about it. The Cathars and their close theological relatives were stretched along an east-west axis that measured about 1500 miles. Their churches suffered through schisms, reorganizations and councils. Their theologians and written works perished, often in flames.What little we do know of their beliefs is preserved in the works of the churchmen who debated them and the inquisitors who condemned them. Then as now, debaters and inquisitors hear only what they wish to hear. It is also probable that many Cathars were not very clear about their own beliefs. Eberwin of Cologne, an early debater, wrote that the Cathars condemned marriage, but he could not discover why, \\"either because they dared not reveal it or, more probably, they did not know.\\" [Page 46]Even as Martin does not strive to extract more from his sources than they contain, he is not critical of those sources that he does quote. He takes historical guidance from Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh without comment (!) and philosophical insight from Philip K. Dick (!!)This is a short overview of the Cathars that is constructed, so far as I can see, entirely out of secondary and tertiary sources. For those who want no more than that, it is a satisfactory handbook. Those seeking a more scholarly approach should look elsewhere. For those seeking a highly readable popular account of the Cathars from a truly skilled writer, I suggest that you seek out Zoe Oldenburg's excellent \\"Massacre at Montsegur\\" from some used book source, for it appears to be out of print at the moment.Four stars."},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"Sean Martin's \\"The Cathars\\" book is a concise and often well-written history of Catharism. This is the 1st piece of sustained writing on the Cathars that I have read so am unable to compare to other literature available. This book is an easy read (I read it in one day on a train journey) and does not presume an knowledge of its subject. This, along with the guided bibliography and \\"heretical lexicon\\" make it a useful resource.However, I did find the actual discussion of the Cathar's theology far too vague. For example, in his closing comments Martin suggests that the true legacy of Catharism is \\"their stress on simplicity, equality, non-violence, work and love\\" (p.163). However, throught the text Martin cites numerous examples where Cathars engage in violent acts (following their Paulician antecedents). However, there is no discussion of why these Cathars betrayed their non-violent tenets or indeed why they were pacifist in the first instance (one suspects it was because of their non-materialism but this is not confirmed).Overall then if you're looking for a comprehensive introduction to Cathar faith and theology then I can't recommend this book. However, if your looking for an untaxing read as an alternative to Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code then give it a go (it also bears, I suspect more relation to actual history)!"},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"I think Martin is probably successful in what he is trying to achieve with this book. I suspect this is supposed to be a simple introduction and basic history of the Cathars. The strength of the book is its easy to read writing style that does not require much energy or analysis by the reader. The book gives the overview of the Cathars with some introductions of Christian heresies in an attempt to set this heresy in its context.I have previously read about the Cathars, so was able to fill in some of the gaps in this book. Martin fails to present much depth in his writing of the theological nuances of the Cathars that make it a severe heresy of Christianity. I think he could have written more about their theology and why the Roman Catholic Church was so intent on wiping them out.As Martin explains, the Cathars gained a sympathetic view then and now because of their asceticism and pietism. Their lifestyles and behavior exemplified many positive religious characteristics; however, their theology was heretical and misguided. Martin writes enough about it for readers to see where it differed from orthodox Christianity. I don't think theology is Martin's strong point, as he offers no value judgement on orthodox Christianity versus the heresies that sprouted.Martin shows some of the political constructions of the middle ages that led to the ever-changing alliances between rulers and the Roman Catholic Church that determined the treatment of the Cathars in France. Here again Martin provides the basics but does not go into much depth about the relationships between the Roman Catholic Church and the leaders of France or from where the Inquisition got and sustained its power over people.Despite its weaknesses in scholarship and the fact that he repeats the idea that the apostle Paul as the first Christian heretic, this is a well done primer on the Cathars and on heresies in general. It also shows the worldliness of the Roman Catholic (universal) Church during the middle ages."},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"This is an interesting, short book about Cathars and the history of their persecution. Because of its shortness, it only gives a quick overview of the subject. It starts with a quick explanation of the Cathar movement and their philosophy. I wish it would go deeper into detail. True, there is not much that can be said about the origin of the Cathars, for their roots were never properly recorded. We have only few pieces of the puzzle and everything else is up for speculation. The Cathars themselves probably did not know their origins and history.But as far as their beliefs are concerned, the Church and the Inquisition did obtain a large number of confessions from them and they infiltrated their movement. Numerous Cathar preachers openly debated Catholic theologians. There should be a lot more information about the details of their religion.After a brief explanation of Catharism, the author goes into lengthy (relatively speaking) account of the wars against it. Then, we get an account of the impact of Catharism on the present day, which usually revolves around maverick historians and archeologists searching for the Cathar treasure, as well as a debate just what exactly this treasure was (gold, Holy Grail, descendant of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene).As I said, the book is very brief. For those who are interested in Catharism, it makes a good introduction before moving on to bigger, more academic texts. For those who are only looking for quick, basic information, this is a good, easy read."},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"As a tourist and frequent visitor to the Languedoc region of France, I found the book fascinating and instructive. It answered many questions about the history and attitudes of the people. Languedoc is still spoken and sung in the area. It is also quite relevant to the later protestant movements. The French Revolution also seems to have taken a leaf from its history with its viciousness, and digging up the bones of the Kings and church leaders at St Denis and burning them just as the church did with the heretics in the Middle Ages. Islam today seems to be going through the same evolution with its non-separation of theology and politics but with no burning. Perhaps they will evolve to allow a personal belief without chopping off heads or suicide bombers.The book does anglicize everything it can which makes for easy reading but sometimes leads to confusion.All in all a very easy must read for anyone interested in French history or the Languedoc region of France."},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"This is a clear, concise and very well researched look into one of the darkest corners of the History of Western Civilization. It is far easier to make excuses for behavior in Christian wars against the alien and poorly understood Muslim nations, who themselves had an unpleasant history of military conquest and forced conversion. While the assault on the Cathars and their fellows covers all of the Occitan, I will focus my review on The Albigensian Crusade and the inquisition in the Languedoc, the area of South Western France, that I know. The Albigensian Crusade' was a war made on peace-loving, gentle and profoundly decent Christians, which makes it far more difficult to justify or even to understand on theological grounds.As your introduction says: \\"Without lifting a sword, the Cathars posed a threat to Catholicism greater than the Muslims or Jews--or so the Church believed. \\" Yet, the Cathars posed no threat to the Catholic religion. They challenged the absurd claim of the Roman Catholic Church that it was -- and as the absurdity continues into our day is -- the \\"Only True Religion,\\" while by every criteria of their shared \\"Christian\\" religion these \\"heretics\\" were far better men than the popes who ordered their murder.I invite you to read this thin book, as an introduction to a visit to the community where I live -- the Languedoc, in the south west of France. Then come to see the monuments that these Cathars built out of stone in Monts&eacute;gur & Montaiollu, still visible through the ruins that remain of them; then come to Carcasonne to see the walls that held off the siege in the best preserved (and restored) medieval city in Europe, where we have great rock concerts in the summer; then on to B&eacute;zier, where I now shop for groceries, and where -- after reading this book -- one can not help but imagine the streets slick with blood and human grease following the slaughter of what this author calls 15 to 20,000 (then \\"A more conservative estimate puts the number at a mere 9,000.\\") Mr. Martin says: a \\"mere 9,000\\" while better estimates based upon more recent census information place that number at over 22,000, men women and children slaughtered in the street then incinerated while seeking refuge in B&eacute;zier's Cathedral.Sean Martin does an excellent job of explaining the complex theological speculations that divided these groups of Christians. However, he is not as clear about the real reasons to which historians attribute this abomination. More sophisticated historians recognize that this crusade was only tangentially theological... Look at the map of France in 1209 at the beginning of the \\"Albigensian Crusade\\" then look at the map in 1329, at the end of this charade when the Inquisition posthumously burned the disinterred bones of Peter Clergue, the randy rector of Montaiollu. Those changes in the map of what is now called \\"France\\" betray a more credible reason for a litany of atrocities. A crusade in the name of religion was the largest land-grab in European history. Parisian princes with the power of a pope misnamed \\"Innocent,\\" stole all the land from very near Paris to what we now call Spain. Theological window-dressing and the slaughter of innocents aside, that is the true history of the Albigensian Crusade.While I, obviously, have very strong opinions about this period, I also respect good work and Mr. Martin has made an excellent introduction to this subject -- well grounded in scholarship -- and with a very useful timeline and bibliography. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the historical period, the social history of the inquisition or the region and spirit of the Occitan. I would put this at the top of my recommended reading list for anyone planning a visit to the southwest of France, an experience that I recommend to everyone.Joey TranchinaS&egrave;te, France"},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"this is a very good well worth the time taken to read.

From the short stories about Carcassone and Montsegur, and the eventual demise of the Cathars in the midst of the Albigensian crusade, this is a nice \\"readers digest\\" version of the sect. If however, you are looking for a deeper understanding of the Cathars, look to The Other God."},{"Title":"The Cathars: The Most Successful Heresy of the Middle Ages","review":"This lovely little book deals with a heresy that has continued to echo in the modern world, as the Cathars have come to be associated with the \\"Holy Grail\\" mystery that has spawned so much popular fiction in our time. There is little of the Pythonesque here, though, and thankfully none of the \\"Holy Blood\\" silliness that spawned a recent series of films. The Cathars almost bridge the heretical gap between early Christianity and the Reformation, leaving the record of non-Orthodox, proto-democratic churches almost unbroken since the time of Christ. This was something I was not entirely expecting. Further, this Dualist heresy was remarkably successful, almost coming to dominate in the South of France around Toulouse, where I have unsuspectingly been, and surviving into the 14th Century further East across Italy and latest in the Balkans.Their fate at the hands of the Albigensian Crusade and the Inquisition is less of a surprise, although the scale of the slaughter is more than I knew. In another personal connection, I stood only months ago on the floor of the ampitheatre in Verona where 200 Cathars were burned. The castle at Monts&eacute;gur, so central to Grail mythology, was taken by the Crusade after a daring night-time climb and another 200 of the \\"Perfect\\" - accredited ascetic religious leaders something like a priesthood - burned on the pyres that they watched being erected from their battlements. The power of heresy over the heart is best illustrated by the fact that another 21 of those trapped were \\"consoled\\" - meaning to join the Perfect - before the castle fell, despite their knowing that this would condemn them to the fire.So what is Catharism? It is a form of Dualism. They believed that the Earth and the material world are evil and under the sway of Satan. Moreover, they believed that the Church was an agent of Satan, which may explain some of their unpopularity. They gave exceptional recognition to the rights of women, a factor which echoes in today's liberal mind. The Perfect lived ascetic lives, receiving a \\"consolation\\" which lapsed if they or their Consoler stayed from the strait path set for them. They ate no meat and did not drink; they were to abstain from sex. The Cathars were widely recognised as the better Christians even by the orthodox.They have passed into time at the hands of the stake and the interrogation stool. They will be missed.

I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed. Other people have already done a great job of covering the plot, so I won't bore you by going over it again. However, I would like to point out that this book is not a collection of short stories. The book has several independent military campaigns in it, but they involve the same people and are interconnected. Also, while this book was written several years ago (mid-80's, I think), it doesn't feel dated they way many books from that era do.The characters have a lot of dimension to them and they react in very human ways to the situations that they face. They also grow over the course of the book. I often found myself wondering how I would react if I was in their place.Unfortunately, there is nothing in this book that you can point at and think \\"Wow, everyone should read this book!\\" There really are no grand or unique ideas presented; however, if you're looking to kill some time, this is a fine book to pick up. This would also be a good book to get someone interested in the Roman Empire, military fiction, or science fiction. Cheers!"},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"I've always believed that some of David Drake's best works are his novels mixing science fiction and the Roman Empire. Having been a Roman history buff for as long as I can remember one could argue that I'm rather biased, but in my opinion Ranks of Bronze rates up there with another of his Roman novel's, Birds of Prey. Ranks of Bronze takes it's inspiration from an actual battle that occurred in the year 53 B.C. Marcus Crassus - one of the three members of the first triumvite along with Ceaser and Pompey - led a Roman army into Parthia ( modern Iran ) to take care of the Parthian empire once and for all. Instead his army was defeated and Crassus was killed. What we do know is that some ten thousand legionaires survived and were either sold into slavery to owners as far away as China and India or the Parthians put them to work as slave soldiers setteling frontier land within the Pathian Empire,just like the British did in Austraila. David Drake has the survivors being sold to aliens - in disguise - who work for a star spanning commercial league. Rather like the organization that was attacking Naboo in The Phanthom Menace. The League isn't allowed to use modern weaponry against primitives who refuse to deal with them. I gather the rules are put down by an organiztion similar to our U.N. So in order to stay out of trouble the aliens buy the Roman legionaries and put them to work fighting their wars. The clincher is that excluding total destruction of the brain the aliens can ressurect the dead soldiers, even if they are decapitated. The main character is a young tribune who eventually rises to command of the legion and the realization that their masters aren't Human. The battles are graphic, but show some serious research on Drake's part. The book gives a nod to the Human ability to overcome obstacles by brain power and nothing else. It's also an intersting contrast of Iron Age soldiers living among advanced technology. I don't want to spoil the ending, but suffice to say you will be kept on the edge of your seat.To paraphrase the previous review, Don't mess with the Romans."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"Consider the title a disclaimer. I'm the guy that started the yahoo group that is referenced on his web site. Ok? But I wanted to reply to a couple of the issues raised in other reviews.How do you define military sci-fi if taking one of the greatest war machines of the historical era and transplanting it into a science fiction universe does not qualify? This is a story about a group of Roman soldiers, and the tribune who ends up commanding them as they travel through the galaxy, serving unworthy masters, and what they do about it. Statements suggesting that it is a set of loosely connected stories are made by people who haven't read the book.Drake considers this one of his more artistically successful stories, and suggests that it sold well too. Jim Baen wanted a sequel so much that he got Drake to agree to one of those shared universe anthologies, and the sequel is more fun that it is legal to have in most states. Luckily, I live in Nevada, where the only thing that is illegal is being a non-smoker.If you like military science fiction, by a man who has been on the sharp end and mostly came back to tell us about it, get to know Drake.As for space opera? Try his Leary/Mundy books."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"This story was published first in 1986. Readers of Drake's modern fantasy efforts, all apparently following the same plot map time and time again, should know that once upon a time, Drake could write an original storyline in a normal-length book.The basic premise of the book is that the remainder of Crassus' defeated legion is sold as slaves to an alien trade guild who takes them into space and uses them for proxy wars on low-tech planets where an enforced convention prohibits use of high-tech people or weapons to subdue lower tech planets. The romans are deployed in set-piece battles and sieges, many of which are described in great detail in the book (in fact, i think well over half the book is battles). Aside from brain and spinal injuries, most damage and even death can be repaired - along with not aging, this makes for a legion with more battles fought and far more experience per person than any roman legion ever had on earth. The conflict in this story is the slow development of the legion's resistance to being slaves of the trade guild, and how that problem plays out. The story is told from the third-person viewpoint of a tribune in the legion.I would comment that none of the armies faced in set-piece battles by the legion seemed to have any knowledge of formations or tactics and were less organized in that regard than the romans. Even some of the physically weaker aliens in tight controlled formations (phalanx, etc) would have presented different difficulties, but in the end the set-piece battles were hard for the romans only in terms of being outnumbered every time. The one siege did present a new complication. Drake does know his roman military tactics from this period.I wish that drake still wrote stories like this."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"I read author David Drakes's \\"Ranks of Bronze\\" for the first time nearly twenty years ago while an 82d Airborne Div. Soldier. Recently I purchased another copy and thumbed through it again. Drake is one of my favorite Sci-Fi authors (Hammer's Slammers, et. al.) and in my humble opinion has successfully mastered the art of simple good old fashioned storytelling.Ranks of Bronze begins as a story where a defeated Legion of Roman Legionnaires (ostensibly one of Crassus' lost legions in the Battle of Carrhae vs. the Parthians) was captured and sold to a space alien trading guild to be used to conquor, as per the guidlines of the alien's own treaties and rules of conquest, peoples (creatures) inhabiting planets that had roughly the same level of technology as the mercenaries employed.The aliens employ a system of diplomacy similar to Star Trek's \\"prime directive\\" where they cannot invade or conquor with their high level of technology but can (and do) employ mercenaries to achieve the desired results by way of proxy.In the end the Legionnaires, after surviving countless surface invasions of countless planets, manage to wrest control of their transport ship from their alien captors. The Legionnaires, who have only held on to the hope that one day they would return to their home, demand passage to Earth.The twist in the end is that however, they return to an Earth a millennium older then when they left.A fascinating and good Sci-Fi read. I recommend it for a lazy afternoon of reading at five stars!JP"},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"\\"Ranks of Bronze\\" follows the idea that a human military contingent is somehow transported to \\"another world\\". In this case it is a Roman legion, taken by aliens to act as mercenaries in their trade wars.David Drake has written workmanlike sci-fi for several decades and this fits that category. It is very readable but not \\"great\\" s-f literature.In the last decade Drake has produced a series of books based on the Patrick O'Brien stories of a Napoleonic war British frigate. But transposed into space opera. In doing so he became a much better writer and I whole heartedly recommend his \\"With the Lightnings\\" and follow on novels.Human warriors transported to other worlds has been done better. Notably the Destroyermen series by Taylor Anderson and, perhaps, the Lost Regiment series."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"In the year 53 BC, Crassus, the richest man in Rome, led an army to a humiliating defeat by the Parthian Empire at Carrhae. The poet Horace mentions, in the novel's Prologue, captive Roman soldiers marrying barbarian women and growing old fighting for their new masters.That bit from Horace's _Odes_ neatly sums up this story except, rather than growing old with the Parthians, the Romans become the military assets of an alien trading guild who uses them to fight the low tech wars somehow required by their political system. The Romans prove quite adept at their new duties. In between campaigns, they whore with aliens surgically altered to mostly resemble human women, watch and participate in strange combat simulations with alien beasts, and try not to think too hard about how they and their comrades are repaired after nearly every injury.There's plenty to like in this novel: the development of tribune Gaius Vibulenas from a callow youth to a true leader of men; Drake's nitty gritty consideration of all the physical aspects - balance, footing, strength, stamina, sight - of battle; the understated relationship Vibulenas has with alien \\"woman\\" Quartilla; the very believable spark that finally triggers revolt and characteristic Roman terror.The only disappointment I had with the novel was its sometimes confusing descriptions of battle and Roman military organization - even though I know something of the Roman army of the period."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"Altho this book is not &quot;new&quot; , I was pleased to find that it has been reprinted.

I enjoyed reading it and I've enjoyed reading the reviews that Amazon users have posted concerning this outing by Drake. Some people who pick up Drake's books do so as a result of the multitude of titles his fans array him with. I've heard him called the \`king', \`the man', and the \`indisputable champion' of military sci-fi. That's all well and good, because he does write a good sci-fi battle scene, but people looking for a space opera by Bernard Cornwell will be disappointed if they look for that in Drake's books.I'm not being critical of Drake, I love his work, but you can't compare historical military novelization and the completely imagined stories of military sci-fi. They aren't in the same genre, and I don't think that a lot of research can be done on the battle between the Zonthar of Sol 26 and the Quitzoids of Betel 5. (Those cheesy names aren't from Drake. He would never sound so corny. I just pulled those out of a big foam cowboy hat.)Speaking of research, and on the accomplishments of Drake in _Ranks of Bronze_, he did a LOT of research on Roman society and culture in order to write these stories. Frankly, he captured them well. I have read \`extensively researched' alternate history novels in which the Roman's were more clich&eacute;d and less true to historical record than those found in Drake's _Ranks of Bronze_.Aside from his research on the Romans, this book is true to form for Drake. Like _Grimmer than Hell_ it is a series of short stories, usually following, but not always focused on a centrally placed character. The men in his stories change, growing heavy of mind, desperate, bitter, harder, experienced, or in whatever war can twist and temper men.As in most science fiction, the military aspect serves, like all other styles of good sci-fi, to bring the heart and mind of the characters into full view, to explore society as it currently exists in the mirror of a possible future, and to understand, in whole, the strange being that is MAN. This has been the goal of science fiction since H.G. Wells penned his famous tales, and Drake continues the tradition, offering a sometimes uncomforting explanation of the true benefit and the greatest destructions of what we know as war.The tempering and strengthening of mankind, and the desecration of souls as minds are sharpened in war are the subjects of Drake, through nearly all of his work. In these stories of an enslaved Roman legion he shows the hope that lingers in all the minds of men who travel far from home to fight in wars begun by other men, men who offer no real explanation for the wars they send these soldiers to die in. Soldiers in strange lands have a hope, and that hope is Home.Thank you Mr. Drake, for another well-written collection of your military sci-fi. It was enjoyable and fascinating, and I continue to enjoy your work."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"I really wish I could recommend this book. I love the idea of capturing Romans and using them as soldiers on other worlds. However, the writing style is so disjointed and hard to follow, that I found myself struggling to stay with it, instead of flowing with it and really enjoying myself.Drake will begin a paragraph with a sentence describing some object in the scene. Then he will start writing about something completely different for the rest of the paragraph, and maybe a whole page, before going back to the original object. By the time he gets around to writing about the object, you have started to forget the original context. Reading this book requires a lot of re-reading to make sure you follow what is going on.Another problem is that there are no chapter breaks. The book is divided into mini-books that are much longer than most chapters. So there aren't many good places to take a break and rest your tired mind (and it DOES get tired after struggling to follow the text).Finally, the book doesn't have an interesting pacing structure. Until the final 50 pages, the book feels very monotone, empty of build ups, climaxes, dramatic slow moments etc... This is another factor in the difficult reading. without the minor buildups, fast-paced action, and slow dramatic moments, it all starts to blend together into, one, long, droning, narrative.And then the end hits you.Its like Drake came back after a long recess. The writing style seems totally different. The final 50 pages are actually entertaining and much easier to follow than the vast majority of the book. But then it ends. Its so suddenly that I was angry. I plowed through all 250+ pages of mediocrity, finally hit the good part, and then it ended in what seems like mid chapter.I can not recommend this book unless you are a die hard Drake fan."},{"Title":"RANKS OF BRONZE","review":"I like Mr. Drake's writting, but this book stunk; I got so disgusted with it that I stopped at page 171 out of 314.The book is made up of a several short stories in which a group of Roman Soldiers battle Primitive Aliens. This Roman Legion lost a battle and their captors sold them into slavery. Unknown to the Roman's or the people who sold them, the buyer is an alien. The alien belongs to a Trade Confederation that is only allowed to war with people at the technological level of their opponent. That's where the Romans come in.In Real History the Roman Legions proved that Soldiers will defeat Warriors every time, discipline makes all the difference. That's one of the truism that makes Military Fiction enjoyable, the idea that hard work and discipline will get you through tough times. The problem with this book is that there is no hope of a reward for the heroes at the end. The get injured, patched up, fight, get injured, patched up, and fight in a never ending cycle. There is no hope of freedom from slavery, no hope of every doing anything but fighting and dying, no hope of finding a wife, no hope of children; there's no hope of anything.

In essence I got interested after reading Cornwells' Sharpe Series and the Prince Roger series by David Weber/John Ringo.I read a review where someone said they stopped at page 171 and put the book down. Well they're better than me, I've struggled to get to page 126, then decided to stop at and write this review.After seeing so many references to Drake as being 'the man' in Military Sci/Fi I finally decided to pick up one of his books.I tried to read \\"Birds of Prey\\" also by Drake and could not even finish it. I thought maybe it was the premise. I think I like to see the story of someone growing into a command position, i.e. Richard Sharpe (Sharpe Series) and Roger McLintock (Prince Roger Series). However, that was not the problem.After a day of reading \\"Birds of Prey\\" I realized I had made a mistake and exchanged it for this book [Ranks of Bronze], since this is supposed to be the story of a 'group' and how one character goes from being a \\"raw kid\\" to a \\"leader of men\\". Well I see now that it was NOT the premise, it is his writing style.Even in \\"Birds of Prey\\" I noticed that his style is...hard to follow. It doesn't flow smoothly. In this book as well, it just reads...bad. I have one more Drake book \\"Grimmer Than Hell\\". However, if it reads anything like the first two I've read, it will be the last Drake book I read.I don't know if Bernard Cornwells' (Sharpe Series) is considered Sci/Fi, Alternative History, or just simple Fiction. What I do know is regardless of which one was written first; Cornwell reads better, the battles are easy to follow, they're action packed, and they seem to be what Drake is/was trying to achieve.Lastly, if you want a better written, in my opinion, story that involves essentially the same plot try David Webers \\"Excalibur Alternative\\"."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"SICP is an excellent, perhaps the best, advanced introduction to computer science and programming. It covers topics such as functional abstraction, data abstraction, OOP, program design, constraint programming and logic programming, always from a language design point of view. You will need a decent mathematical background to follow it.If it's such a great textbook, then why half of the reviewers hate it? Elementary: SICP is not just a textbook, it's also a Computer Science aptitude and vocational test. If you read it and like it, then Congratulations!

That is, at most, a 16 week semester.On the other hand, if you really want to explore the world of programming on your time and on your own pace, it is the ultimate source of programming magic.Some people from MIT and UC Berkeley say these wonderful things about this book, yet they areonly true when you are really after the knowledge not the grade."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I first encountered this book while taking the intro course on computer programming at the University of Chicago. I probably devoted 20 hours a week for 10 weeks to the book, to the programming exercises, and to try to understand Scheme. I had very little programming experience, and was studying mathematics for the most part. The book simply opened a whole new world for me where programming was concerned, interesting me in the theoretical underpinnings of programming. Three years after first reading it, I'm going back over it again, trying to glean all that I missed the first hurried time around.Is it a great book? Yes. But is it right for everyone? No. I would liken it to something like Tolstoy's War and Peace: at a certain point in your life, you can read it and it becomes a beautiful epic. However, if you're too young or not mature enough, it will just be a long drag about a War that happened a long time ago. For some people, this will just leap right off as a great book, and lead them to places in programming that they didn't know existed. For others, it may take a long time and a lot of work to get much out of it.However, this does not detract or subtract from its greatness: there is something in this book for almost everyone if they but spend the time and search for it; that itself is the essense of this book's greatness."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This book is not for the average person with a casual interest in computer programming, or for someone who wants to learn Scheme and Scheme only.

I could have saved so much time and written better more powerful software.The insight I've gained into computation is staggering... it's probably going to take me the rest of my programming career to fully absorb all the pearls of wisdom this book imparts.If you're serious about computation and programming, stop reading what you're currently reading and read this first... it'll take a while to get through, and takes some hard thinking, but will inform your thinking for the better and change the way you code and think about coding forever!"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I've been a professional in the computer science industry for years, and I still find new gems, leading to ah-hah! moments, each time I pick this book up.

Those who care deeply about computer science love this book; those who see this book as the only barrier between them and a passing score in their current CS course clearly do not.This book teaches you to think about problems in a different way, a way which stays with you forever.

However, it may be useful for you to know that this class is a foundation for all other MIT CS classes. Artificial intelligence (6.034), computer algorithms (6.046), computer architecture (6.004), and others all assume a firm understanding of SCHEME.If you want to have more practice with SCHEME, go to the MIT 6.001 website...There, you will find links to problem sets, solutions, previous exams and previous semesters.

Scheme is used as a vehicle to illustrate how large, complex systems can be designed by abstraction. Several real-world examples are used: a picture language, a circuit simulator, a compiler and a PROLOG-like pattern matching language.To get a flavor of this book, search for \\"SICP Lecture 1a\\" in Google Video. It's the first of 20 lectures delivered by the authors of the book in 1986. If you decide to purchase the book, use it in conjunction with these lectures to get the complete SICP experience.

I hated having to learn Scheme.I now love this book. It talks about programming with a lot of depth. (e.g. why a function which calls itself might not necessarily be recursive in its execution). I have learned a lot about how programs behave by studying this book. You will too, if you put in the effort needed to think through and work the exercises. Don't do the exercises and you won't understand a thing.Scheme is a beautiful language to learn especially if you get EMACS to help you match and indent your code. Scheme is especially wonderful to learn SICP because you need not worry about Scheme syntax -- there is hardly any. It is tough to learn programming concepts and language syntax both at the same time. Garden variety programmers are of the mistaken belief that a knowledge of syntax makes them wizard programmers. It does not.After you are done with this book as a student, don't sell it back. Keep it, and after you have 4-5 years of programming experience come back and read it.

There is no other text which clearly presents so much of the foundations of computer science. Doing it in one semester is a frantic pace -- but it's well worth spending two or even three semesters covering it well.However, college studies aside, as a professional you will want to own this book and reread it from time to time. The stuff in it will strike sparks off the things you've been doing elsewhere and give you new ideas and perspectives -- routinely.This is an extremely valuable book to own.

Fortunately, I chose to read mathematics instead, and perhaps for this reason I appreciated SICP it more than I would have otherwise.Discussions of the philosophy of programming are necessary before getting into the concrete, just as one requires the general case before receiving the discrete.By receiving many discrete cases, as is the style of many computer science books, you may, if lucky, become a competent programmer. However, you will have to slowly tease out the underlying principles. You will be often wrong. A book like SICP gives you the general cases, it teaches you the theory, and it assumes that you have the ability to apply them to discrete ones.I don't recall receiving all that many recipes to handle problems in mathematics (although with experience I developed my own); what I got in the very best of courses was insight into the true nature of the problem. Whatever its flaws (and there are flaws), SICP provides this insight to the aspiring programmer."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This is not a book for mass consumption, as the negative reviews below (and eventually above) clearly indicate. This is a book about how to structure complexity so that it remains easily understandable and manageable. You may think this is obvious, yes? But do you know how to do it for immensely complex systems? That's what this book is about. It's the difference between being a mediocre programmer and a virtuoso. If you plan on writing code that will actually be looked at again, if you plan on designing anything anyone will ever care about, if you want your view of computational systems to change how you look at the world, this book is first on your reading list.

To be a successful professional in the computer field it is not necessary. It maybe even misleading. Here you have to manage solid day-to-day work and not feel like an inventor of a new language.Prerequisites for the book are some interest in philosophy and linguistic and a slight remembrance of a few years of college math.It contains lots of small intellectual gems.

I'm a Computer Science student and this is the most difficult book I've ever read. For example, there's no FOR or WHILE loops used in this book. All loops use recursion. As you go on with this book, the programs tend to get larger and larger, because it builds on programs introduced previously, and at some point it's hard to keep track of them. This book uses the language Scheme, which I believe has no practical use, yet it is a good language for your programming skils (such as recursion), and it's an interactive language, too, which means I don't have to compile every time after I modify my codes. Let me warn you again, this book is very challenging. If you're not ready for it or have bought it and found it difficult, may I suggest Simply Scheme by Brian Harvey.

Especially for beginners, this book is very frustrating. The first few chapters often employ obscure mathematical tricks as examples of how the computing concepts can be applied. In the end, the reader doesn't see the forest for the trees and tries to figure out the math just to understand what the code samples are doing. Other parts of the book either mention in passing, or devote very little space to interesting ideas, and instead devote pages and pages to something fundamental, to the point that it gets very boring. Finally, I personally think this book is poorly organized. The first four chapters try to focus on maximum abstraction, and the last chapter presents a totally oposing view of computers--as register machines...which is a completely different paradigm.

I can't say it's fun or easy to understand, but a *few* concepts might seem interesting. However, the large majority of things introduced can't be applied. Streams, for example, are introduced to alleviate the bottlenecks created by Scheme in conjunction with poor code planning earlier in the book. They are completely irrelevant to languages like C/C++.

Mildly curious but nothing useful and certainly no profound theories, as some would have you believe."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"If looked upon as a reference, this book isn't all that bad. There are some interesting concepts here. Few, thought--most of the stuff is self evident. Also, I really think them using Scheme was a big mistake. A book of this caliber should not concern itself with specific languages, true, and they could have done two things: use a syntactically simple language, or ignore any specific language all together and use pseudocode. They chose the former, and that's too bad. Scheme is totally inappropriate for these kinds of complicated things. My other gripe with the title is that it doesn't go in depth into any one topic. Just a bunch of concepts thrown at you and briefly explained. The book migh serve well as a reference, but it definitely isn't for beginners, as it claims to be, and it definitely won't teach you programming. Most of the material here is curious, but hardly relevant to you if you've never programmed before."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This book is good to read when you have trouble falling asleep. Everyone I know, including the professor, were often confused. In the end, he abandoned the book and started teaching from his own notes, and learning Scheme and the concepts became a pleasure. The problem is the author, who thinks that because he's from MIT, he can just write drivel and it will sell. Everything in this text can be explained much more clearly and precisely if done by a good teacher. But the book makes no such effort, and as a result, it's boring and often difficult to understand.

It turns out most of what it talks about is already taught in other beginning courses on structured programming. Other topics...such as things from later in ch3 through ch5 are completely useless in today's programming industry. Register machines belong in a computer engineering course, not in a computer science book. Chapter 4, on interpreters is totally pointless. It shows you how to design a scheme interpreter, written in Scheme! How much dumber can you get? And most of chapter 3 is either completely irrelevant, since the topics discussed are specific to scheme, or they are common knowledge. When the authors spend 20 pages on assignment and how variables should be conceptually viewed, you know you're dealing with time wasters.

What works for a programming language doesn't work for a book.The class this book is designed for is on introductory programming. But don't expect to learn programming here. The authors have too many axes to grind to have time to worry about the best way to teach beginners about programming. They must point out that the C language suffers &quot;defects&quot; and that C programmers can be &quot;reformed&quot; by programming in Scheme. Every member of the MIT computer science department circa 1980 must show up somewhere in the footnotes, another distraction for the authors.There is plenty of good computer science here, but you already have to be a computer scientist to appreciate it.

It's not easy, but it will give you a good introduction to some of the fundamental concepts of computer science: procedural and data abstraction, algorithmic complexity, recursion, interpretation, etc. If you want to be a Java hack, buy &quot;Java in 21 Days&quot;. But if you want to be a real computer scientist, read this slowly and carefully."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Programming is not about the semantics of a particular language. If you want to learn simple C++ as soon as possible, this is not the book you should read. However, don't expect to do anything significant from the above without hard-earned lessons that can be had from SICP.This book is golden. It considers issues important to programmers of all levels of experience. And, I would argue it does so clearly and precisely. Though I came to this book (through MIT's introductory class, 6.001) with a firm grounding in programming fundamentals developed from Unix shell scripting and a little C, I know countless others who read it with little to no exposure to programming. This book requires a *lot* of time and attention to be used well, but its lessons are worth the time.What this book doesn't explain (and what detractors on this page have noticed) is that scheme standard is not consistently deployed. And, no doubt, scheme has some real problems with efficiency, particularly since accessing values in a data structure requires a number of steps proportional to the depth of the structure. Scheme trades elegance for practicality, which is exactly what learning programmers should do."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I was hoping, based on the comments of some people, that this book would be somewhat of a bible for programming...they said it's the best book of programming ever written. I was quite disappointed. One of three things usually happened when I read about a new topic in this text:1. I already knew some things this book talks about. They are, in fact, fairly obvious, like abstraction.2. The idea was fairly interesting, but it wasn't possible to implement it outside of Scheme. In other words, this idea became useless.3. Some things were just a pointless waste of time. Purely philosophical discussions.In short, this book told me nothing new. A huge disappointment. I don't understand what these people see in it."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This book is a bad experience. The authors make no attempt to explain anything, but instead cram the book with many confusing concepts and without any teaching effort, try to make you see the &quot;beauty of it all&quot;.

It'll only be a waste of your time."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"People told me this book was B.S. , so I went throught the entire course without reading it and going to lecture, which worked splendidly. I got this book at another store at the very end, just as a curiousity, and promptly returned it when I saw just how bad it is.Confusing, pointless, dumb. This isn't about the value of fundamental knowledge of computer science anymore, the book is outright poor as a teacher. I'm sure there are other books on philosophy of computer science which will teach you a lot more. This one is just a waste of money."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I can't say this book is absolutely horrible, but it isn't good either. I read it on the advice of some guy who liked it, but I didn't. The breadth and wealth of topics discussed is staggering, but none of them are treated especially well, and some seemed hardly of any relevance. I still think the way they presented structures such trees and lists, with pairs, is a very braindead approach. C style pointers are much more intuitive and flexible. Aside from that, this text might be OK as a simple reference of what's out there, but there are definitely better books on just about any topic presented in this text. I only got through chapter 4 and got very bored along the way.Buy at your own risk. This book is way overrated and boring."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I was not pleased with this book. I listened to the hype and bought it in hopes of learning something insighful about good programming style and some interesting theory. Instead, I got a very boring book. Half of it seems to be Scheme specific, which completely negates its purpose of being &quot;language independent&quot;. The other half is tryly theoretical, but it's either completely irrelevant, or it is self evident, such as abstraction. Anyone who has done some programming knows that splitting programs into procedures, and data into abstract objects is a good thing. Do we really need to read a whole chapter or more to relearn this? Reading this text is futile. Its cause is good, but it falls far short of its overstated goals."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Thiese book seems contradictory. It tries to teach proper programming, but at the same time, it requires me using a poorly designed development system, withoet a debugger, or at least without any helpful statements as to where exactly in the program an error ocured. They couldnt do even this little.But, specific interpreters aside, the presentation of material is bad too. It is either very boring, or if it is somewhat interesting, it is only given 2 pages, such as with huffman trees. Some topics are outright useles, like streams, or self evident, such as local state.

It subjects students to material so boring, and presented so poorly, that only those who can stand through it all ever stay on for more computer science classes.

I realize that it is *supposed* to be about foundations of good programming style, and not about any language in particular, but being language specific is exactly what it does. Many things it teaches can only be done in Scheme. Also, I think the presentation of material is very poor, whatever the purpose. For example, they spend a disproportionate amount of time on simple concepts, and rush through complicated information, such as the implementation of a logic programming language. This book is thoroughly confusing, and chances are you won't learn anything new. Anyone who has read the book carefully will notice its poor style."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This book is filled with pompous statements and philosophical discussions. Who cares? No one. Instead of teaching really useful things, such as algorithms, or tecnhiques, the text spends huge amounts of space on pointless philosophical discussions. For example, when assignments are introduced...(e.g. x = x + 1), the authors take up a boring discussion about the conceptual difficulties and implications this introduces into the language. Again, who cares? Millions of lines of code are written in C every year and everything works just fine. You can tell from the book's preface that the aim isn't to teach you programming, but instead to philosophise about conceptual issues...whatever that means. In other words, this text belongs more in a philosophy course than in a computer science course. There's more talk here, and less real action. It supposedly teaches you how to think about programming, but that is already accomplished by C courses, which teach objects and functions.Aside from that, it does a decent job of introducing Scheme. But here again, that language is strongly tied to the book's philosophy. It is nearly impossible to write anything useful in the language, as it's designed to demonstrate some finer points of reasoning about computer science, and is not designed as a practical programming language.If you are looking to learn practical skills, don't get this book, it'll only waste your time. If you are interested in &quot;philosophy of programming&quot; mumbo jumbo, you might like this book. Although, I should warn you, the text pretends to teach both things, but does neither well.This is pure &quot;programming for its own sake&quot; type of text. If you like that, fine, but if you want to program for the sake of accomplishing something useful, there are only a handful of sections in this book that discuss anything of relevance and you'll just waste your money."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I'm not sure who the target audience is (besides the poorMIT undergrads who are force to sift through this [junk]), buthaving taught (as an assistant to a professor) a lower-levelcomputer science class (one not dealing with Scheme, thankfully)I have asked many freshmen abou their thoughts on this book andthe class taught out of it.*ALL*hated it.

But besides being confusing, it is also pointless. I've been programming for quite some time, and I have never had to use 90% of what is in this book. (Mostly because virtually all common languages come with high level constructs in their libraries for performing the kinds of low level operations that this book wants you do to by hand.)The book attempts to introduce object oriented concepts using a language that is not at all suited for object oriented programming. But worst of all, it doesn't even explain these concepts using analogies that people can understand. And so beginning computer science students are throughly confused by the content of this book.The language used (Scheme) has no practical real-world application. It is not even well suited as a teaching language because its syntax and constructs are unlike anything used in any common language today. In fact, trying to understand this book if you already have Java or C experience might be worse than starting from scratch, because Scheme is such a backwards language.Basically, a confusing and poorly written textbook that teaches a totally irrelevent language which has no real world use (and doesn't do a very good job of teaching it at that)."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I would have to agree that this book has very little to do with modern software engineering.

C++ and Java have been on a market for a Number of years (c was founded in 81), and all of the potential employers &quot;appreciate&quot; ur knowledge of them. Another point I want to bring is in regard to some previous reviews oversimplifying the transition from meta language to C++. Not only it is not easy, but it is also quite confusing. May be reading C++ in 24 hours gives you the idea that you are a big guy, but believe me, C++ is much more powerful than that.

Actually those people either thinks computer science and mathematics are different or they need some spoon feedings on the subject.Computer science(as the book suggest) is the field of Imperative Knowledge and Mathematics is the field of Declarative as well as Imperative knowledge.Now why you need Math in Computer Science? That's because, suppose you have designed some algorithms or data structures or a new computational model, but how can you prove that the designed Imperative Knowledge is true or false? Then you need Declarative Knowledge i.e. Mathematics and for this reason only every field of science and engineering requires a very firm grasp in mathematics.This book is not for mere programmers or casual computer science student, this book is for Computer Scientist or for the students whose aim is to become a serious computer scientist/engineer.And lastly to understand this book you should be very sharp at mathematics,at least to first order logic and always keep in mind mathematics is an inherent part of computer science and this is the only reason that most of computer scientist till to date have conventional degree in mathematics including Dennis Ritchie the creator of C language and there are some beautiful books as \\"Concrete Mathematics\\" and \\"Algorithms\\" by Donald E Knuth[have degree in math] and \\"Introduction to Algorithms\\" by Coreman et all[all those respected MIT professors have degree in Math]."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"If you are looking for the easy way out, you have the wrong book. SICP goes deep into the material and you have to go even deeper to understand it and come out as the better programmer. Reading this book in one sitting only works for the patient and intelligent. I consider myself to be both and I still had to work through it. I am a sophmore at MIT and when I took the course I had never programmed before, but after reading SICP and taking the course along with it, I believe I have come out to be the better person and programmer. The course is 4 months long, and I still found it difficult and falling short on time. The course is one of the hardest courses at MIT and probably the world and the book is equally difficult. Time with the material took me about 25+ hours per week on class time, reading and problem sets. I have never looked for the easy way out and neither does MIT and neither should the serious programmer. Reading this book has made me the better programmer and helped me understand programming in general as a whole. It has made my transition into more mainstream languages a whole lot easier. That is probably the only easy part about this book. I advise you to go online and try the problem sets along with reading this book and you will find that this is no frolic in the park, but definitely beneficial and even indispensible. If you are not serious and willing to work, then don't buy this book and stick with your &quot;Learn Pseudo-Programming in 21 days&quot;. But if you are serious, buy the book and read it religously. It is no easier than reading the Bible itself, but it is as informative to Programmers, as the Bible is to &quot;the believer&quot;.

Be prepared to work! This book is very knowledge dense, and each exercise pays large dividends for the time invested. From a programmers point of view, you will fall in love with scheme very quickly. Keep in mind this book is about the larger art of programming and not just scheme. It just happens to be a powerful language for expression of high level abstractions and ideas.

This is a well-written introduction to Lisp programming and Scheme, and introduces many important concepts in Computer Science. The problem with it is that it is not a suitable book for a beginner -- I don't consider it a gentle introduction to computer science -- and for someone experienced enough to be comfortable with its ideas, it doesn't introduce many interesting ideas until Chapter 3. Unlike other people I guess, I found the reading sometimes difficult, but interesting and comprehensible. I didn't learn much of anything (except Scheme) until the Brandeis course I took reached the discussion of the environmental model of evaluation. But from there on I learned some interesting ideas, especially about the interpretation of computer programs, non-deterministic programming, and logic. Unfortunately we didn't get to the last chapter on compilation, but I might look at that this summer. At Brandeis University, this is the second course in the major, not counting two optional intro courses which are designed for non-majors and people with little background who want to be majors. But even with the interesting ideas, it was mainly Lisp that I learned, which I don't consider a waste of time by any means."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I think its fascinating that there is such a split between those who love and hate this book. For most books, the review is a bell-shaped curve of star ratings; this one has a peak at 1, a peak at 5, and very little in between. How could this be? I think it is because SICP is a very personal message that works only if the reader is at heart a computer scientist (or willing to become one). So I agree that the book's odds of success are better if you read it after having some experience.To use an analogy, if SICP were about automobiles, it would be for the person who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient, safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate SICP are the ones who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.Those who hate SICP think it doesn't deliver enough tips and tricks for the amount of time it takes to read. But if you're like me, you're not looking for one more trick, rather you're looking for a way of synthesizing what you already know, and building a rich framework onto which you can add new learning over a career. That's what SICP has done for me. I read a draft version of the book around 1982, when I was in grad school, and it changed the way I think about my profession. If you're a thoughtful computer scientist (or want to be one), it will change your life too.Some of the reviewers complain that SICP doesn't teach the basics of OO design, and so on. In a sense they are right. The book doesn't directly tell you how to design and write an object-oriented program using the subset of object-oriented principles that show up in the syntax of Java or C++. Rather, the book tells you what those principles are, how they came to be selected as worthwhile, how they can be implemented from the ground up, and how a different combination of principles might be more appropriate for some particular problems. This approach requires you to understand the range of possibilities, and to think about trade-offs as you go through the design process. Programming is a craft that is subject to frequent failure: many projects are started and abandoned because the designers do not have the flexibility, experience and understanding to come up with a suitable design and implementation. SICP gives you an approach that will succeed, but it is an approach based on principles and wisdom, not on a checklist. If you don't understand the principles, or if you are the kind of person who wants to be given a cookbook of what to do rather than to think creatively, or if you only want to work on problems that are pretty much like the problem you worked on last time, then this approach will not work for you. There are other approaches that will be more reproducible for a limited range of simple problems, but there is no better way than SICP to learn how to address the truly hard problems.Donald Knuth says he wrote his books for \\"the one person in 50 who has this strange way of thinking that makes a programmer\\". I think the most amazing thing about SICP is that there are so FEW people who hate it: if Knuth were right, then only 1 out of 50 people would be giving this 5 stars, instead of about 25 out of 50. Now, a big part of the explanation is that the audience is self-selected, and is not a representative sample. But I think part of it is because Sussman and Abelson have succeeded grandly in communicating \\"this strange way of thinking\\" to (some but not all) people who otherwise would never get there."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This is one of the great classics of computer science. I bought my first copy 15 years ago, and I still don't feel I have learned everything the book has to teach.I have learned enough to write a couple books on Lisp that (currently) have four to five stars. Yet SICP, which is pretty much the bible of our world, has only three? How can this be?Reading the reviews made it clear what happened. An optimistic professor somewhere has been feeding SICP to undergrads who are not ready for it. But it is encouraging to see how many thoughtful people have come forward to defend the book.Let's see if we can put this in terms that the undergrads will understand -- a problem set:1. Kenneth Clark said that if a lot of smart people have liked something that you don't, you should try and figure out what they saw in it. List 10 qualities that SICP's defenders have claimed for it.2. How is the intention of SICP different from that of Knuth? Kernighan &amp; Ritchie? An algorithms textbook?3. Does any other book fulfill this purpose better?4.

Why is his name in lowercase?"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"The negative reviewers entirely missed the point of this book. The issues are not c++ versus scheme, nor the gap between the book's examples and real-world programs, nor that recursion is less intuitive than looping.The real point is to teach some very core foundations of computer science that show up everywhere. For example, supposedly revolutionary XML looks a heck of a lot like a nested scheme list, first described in 1960. And processing an active server page (or Java server page) is very much like the textbook's specialized language evaluator. Finally, c++ polymorphism through vtables and part of Microsoft's COM mechanics are the exact same thing as the book's data-directed programming section.This is very deep material for a programming newbie to learn outside a course, but for an experienced nerd who's looking for a systematic framework, it's absolutely terrific. I had done lots of lisp and compiler work before reading the book, so many of the concepts were not new. But it's with this framework in mind that I learn new technologies, and this approach greatly speeds up how long it takes to understand each week's &quot;new&quot; hot product/language/tool/mindset. Put another way: why do so many popular computer books take 1000 pages to describe a few trivial concepts?"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"The reviews of this book are just hilarious; I've never seen a book with reviews so sharply polarized between one and five stars. I think the reason for this is that most of the one-star reviewers had this book rammed down their throats in an introductory CS course, and it blew their minds. This doesn't surprise me; despite the fact that the book is meant to be an introduction to computer science, for most students it will be just too abstract and too difficult. I've been programming for over ten years, and I had to work really hard to understand a lot of the concepts presented here. Nevertheless, I think this is a great book because it discusses lots of ideas that receive inadequate or no coverage elsewhere. The material on compilers, for instance, is difficult (and idiosyncratic because they're compiling scheme, which has its own pecularities compared to, say, compiling C) but if you can work through it you get a pretty deep understanding of what's going on, without having to get bogged down in parsing or other trivial stuff. My suggestion: DO NOT read this book if you are just learning how to program; come back to it after a few years of experience and it will stretch your mind. Also, if you're having trouble I recommend Harvey and Wright's &quot;Simply Scheme&quot; as a much gentler introduction to the same material."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"The reviews here that complain that there isn't anything to learn in SICP, or that there aren't any ideas, or that there's nothing but philosophizing and handwaving, are bizarre.SICP is full of detailed, complete examples of parsers, interpreters, compilers, and digital simulators. It shows how to build your own object-oriented programming system from scratch. It shows how to construct a extensible database query language with a backtracking search to find the answers to complex queries. It shows how to build an optimizing compiler.Sure, none of this is useful---if your goal in life is to grind out CGI scripts. If that's who you are, this book definitely isn't for you. But the folks who don't recognize the SICP examples as real, practical programming projects are living in a funny little fantasy world. They might use the optimizing compiler every day, but it doesn't occur to them that someone actually had to write that optimizing compiler. Nope, code generation and peephole optimization techniques are not applicable to the real world because \`nobody' writes compilers.Every one of these big, complex programs is explained in detail, with *complete* code examples. You can type them all in and run them. These are big projects, and there's a lot of code, so you shouldn't expect to understand any of the examples on the first glance; you have to study it closely to understand how the parts interact.If you're looking for silly little toy examples that fit on one page, this definitely isn't the book that you want. I get the feeling that a lot of the one-star folks are after little toy examples. Maybe they want a CGI hit counter or something.I don't know how well this book works as an introductory book; I had already been programming for about fifteen years when I first read SICP. So perhaps the criticisms that it isn't properly aimed at beginners are on target. But the other criticisms, that say that \`\`There is absolutely nothing interesting here. Just a couple of bored MIT professors trying to teach extremely boring and pointless concepts'' really miss the mark. Sure, building an object-oriented programming system is a boring and pointless concept---if you happen to be a ditchdigger. But what if you want to be the person who constructs OO programming systems? Or what if you want to extend the OO system you usually use with new features? What if you *don't* want to open up a can of precooked beans and heat them up on the stove?There are two kinds of reviews on this page. One kind is from people who say that the book is pointless and there's nothing useful. The other kind is from people who say that the book is full of useful, concrete examples.Maybe the people who found the book useful were suckered. But how can you trick someone into thinking that something pointless and empty is actually useful? That's a hard trick to play! How could there be so many people wakling around, doing their programming jobs, *thinking* that they're using techniques and strategies that they learned from SICP, when actually there was nothing there at all? Where did those techniques come from, then?On the other hand, another explanation is that maybe those people who think that the book is pointless and empty just missed the point. That seems more likely, doesn't it? People miss the point of things all the time. They read a little to quickly, or a little too carelessly, and the explanation or relevance goes over their heads.

My vote is for problems with the reviewer."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"A truly wonderful book. What else can I say?I discovered it about 10 years into my career in software, on a recommendation from a friend from MIT where it is used for the introductory CompSci course (6.001). Originally, I didn't think a book used in a first course of computer science can contain anything I didn't know already. In the end, I ended up getting Scheme (the LISP variant used for exercises in the book) and spent almost two months working through the exercises in the book. Why? Because it challenged and changed the way I think about software.Over the years, my thinking was influenced by Wirth's Pascal (abstract data types), later by the C/C++/Java people (K&R;, Stroustrup,Gosling) and the OO people (GoF). But Abelson and Sussman presented a richer and more powerful approach - software systems as layers of languages and linguistic abstractions, with linguistic abstractions serving primarily as means of formulating and exploring problems and, only then, as means of specifying algorithms for computers to execute. They get that point across by providing reasonably challenging exercises in LISP using first functional programming (the lambda is fun!!), then data abstractions and generic programming (you end up writing a symbolic algebra program), followed by objects and state (the delayed stream approach is really nice). At this point you are about half way through the book but the really interesting stuff is ahead: first modifying the LISP evaluator to implement lazy evaluation and non-deterministic computing, and finally, implementing the evaluator on register machines.While working my way through the book, I went through the MIT 6.001 course materials on the MIT OCW website, as well as the Berkeley SICP course which are both based on this book. Both courses are, no doubt, excellent, but in the end I found the best approach for me was to simply stick with the Abelson and Sussman and do the exercises."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I have very mixed emotions about this book. On the one hand, it is perhaps the best introductory work on the philosophical and theorectical issues of computation, dealing with many concepts that normally are either taken for granted by most programmers, or else are completely unknown to them. If you get past the dry, analytical tone (and the rather flat punnery), it actually becomes quite engaging. It is a book that demands careful thought on the part of the reader, and can reward dilligent and thoughtful study. It scrutinizes even such seeming obvious concepts as recursion and assignment, and often reveals a great deal of hidden complexity to them.However, by itself it is not a very good primer to progamming, either in theory or in practice. The examples given are often unnecessarily tortuous, especially given the imperative to teach strict functional design in the first several chapters. Too much effort has been given to keeping it at 'pure' and 'general', and there is little attempt to connect the important ideas with how they appear in actual use.Among the flaws is too great a concern with language independence, and specifically, an obsession with presenting the fewest possible language constructs needed to achieve a given purpose. It makes no attempt to present the Scheme language itself except where it is absolutely necessary in order to give an example; while this is done to keep the discussion as general as possible, it often has the effect of confusing the student. Many example programs which would be crystal clear with the use of certain language facilities are made hopelessly incoherent because the authors wanted to enforce 'language independence'.Also, because many aspects of the language are ignored as irrelevant, the students learn only a small part of the language itself, and are left with the impression that Scheme is a hamstrung, pedantic language lacking in many obvious features. From reading SICP, few would ever imagine that it supported strings, characters and vectors, or had an iterative construct (do), an escape mechanism (call/cc), a macro facility (let-syntax and syntax-rules), or even basic stream I/O (read and write). Scheme is a simple enough language as it is; it need not be pared down any further no matter how noble the purpose.More importantly, much of the presentation so abstracted as to be completely divorced from real practice, especially in the sections on imperative and OO programming. While this is a good thing in many ways, as it shows the conceptual underpinnings which are so often lost in day-to-day programming, no attempt is made to draw a connection between the theoretical abstractions and the concrete practices. The ideas are left floating aimlessly, and the student is left with no clue as to their relevance or value - which is a pity, because they truly are important, and understanding them can make the difference between a true programmer and a mere coder.The section on logic databases is an excellent example of this. While it presents all the elements of keys, querying, unification, etc. in a lucid, detailed fashion, the databases are represented solely as list structures. No mention of files is made at all, in this section or anywhere else in the book - the word 'file' does not even appear in the index. Nor does it reveal that most database work today is based on the relational calculus, not predicate logic.Similarly, the discussion of streams concentrates solely on their use as a way of representing change in state over time; not only are ports (Scheme's stream I/O mechanism) ignored, at no point is the student given any hint at all that the primary use of streams is for input and output. This is like discussing driving without ever admitting the existence of roads; it is abstraction run rampant. While the discussions are wondefully insightful, the student isn't given any way to apply them, even within the context of study.In the end, I would strongly recommend this book as a supplement to an introductory course based around another Scheme text, such as Simply Scheme. While I think that every serious student of computer science (as independent from software engineering) should study it, really requires the work of a gifted teacher to make it clear, and it should never be used as the sole text. It is a brillant piece of work, and a wonderful source of key insights into programming, but it does not stand alone."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Read this book if you want to understand the difference between &quot;coding&quot; and &quot;software engineering&quot;.

Do not read this book if you just wanna &quot;write code&quot;. Such readers will not understand the book, and it will just frustrate them. Instead, read any one of the many books with titles like &quot;Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days&quot;.And judging by some of what the negative reviewers have said (&quot;scheme doesn't have iteration, just recursion&quot;, and &quot;just a lot of theory&quot;, and &quot;learn a more common language like C++&quot;) if you do not understand this book, do not ask me for a job. Instead, go on believing that today's most fashionable language is superior to all others and that learning syntax is the most important thing you can do.This is a challenging book. It is not a cook-book of algorithms, and it does not contain one example that people who advocate practice over theory would label &quot;real world&quot;.

It's that very superior attitude which prevents the comp-sci field from creating more scientists rather than code monkeys and justifies poor pedagogy and technical writing for the sake of &quot;scientific integrity.&quot;SICP is neither masterpiece nor pariah. No other introduction to computer science has a truer grasp of the &quot;soul&quot; of computer science. Not only that, but there is ALOT of useful theory in here, if you have the patience to look.But, the book suffers for dreadful writing and advocacy of a language that can be really quite a horror for beginning programmers. On one hand, the authors took an approach that should have been brilliantly successful. On the other, they did a terrible job explaining fairly simple ideas (or, rather, ideas that should have been simple.)But, the truth is SICP has SO MUCH to offer. Unfortunatedly, the book is only as educational as the CS professor who teaches it. It turns out that the Berkeley professor who said that SICP is &quot;the greatest CS book ever written&quot; is the finest CS teacher at Berkeley. Unfortunatedly, most CS professors are not even 1/10th as good as he is and therefore help make SICP a tortorous excursion.As a EECS major at Berkeley, I've come to realize just how important theory is in the field of CS. And to that end, I think it is as easily critical that theory should be taught with the utmost respect, not only for the field but the students.

It's even only fringely about learning how to program. What's contained in it is more than a simple description of abstraction, or modularity, or anything else you'd find in an introductory text. It even escews talking about those concepts in their simplest form to a degree. It approaches them from a 50,000 foot level, discussion how everything is an abstraction, and by layering these abstractions we can build comprehensible programs. This book has the possibility to change how you think if you listen to it.That being said, it is _not_ a book on how to build software. I've seen many good software engineers discard this book because most of the code presented has no business anywhere near a real software engineering project. Even a lot of the concepts portrayed don't belong in day to day use.But at the end of the day, this book gets the closest I've seen to explaining the hard parts of computer science and software engineering. It's a book about patterns without explicitly discussing them. It's a book about how design software without much explicit discussion of the design process.

Exposes the basics of programming in a clear, elegant way, starting from simple procedural and structural abstraction up to virtual machine, interpreter and compiler design, through object, concurrent or logical oriented ways of programming. Exercises are rather stimulating, and actually doing them is more than half the substance of the book: it's not a book one merely reads, it's a books one does. Although intended for students of Computer Science, this course should appeal students of all engineering branches, because the principles taught are not only relevant to the art of computer programming, but also to the design of all kinds of complex systems.

Those who think of a college education as preparation for a job have got it all wrong. It is preparation for life.Your success in life will depend on your ability to learn for you will need to learn far more after college than you did during college. Those who think that computer science should be taught in &quot;marketable&quot; languages should note that computer languages come and go. Ask a COBOL programmer. Knowing how to construct software is more important than the language of implementation. My brother is a software architect for Microsoft and most of the people that are lucky enough to get an interview are hard pressed to write code to manipulate linked lists or trees let alone discuss these most fundamental data structures!Computer scientists in academia do all of us out here in the real world a great disservice by foisting upon us this confusing melange of mathematics and software engineering. I find the two years devoted to learning calculus and differential equations more pertinent to mechanical and electrical engineering when logic, discrete mathematics, algorithm analysis, and automata theory, which are more appropriate to software engineering, get short shrift.SICP is an excellent step in this direction and scheme is an excellent vehicle for discussing these concepts and more. Furthermore, these concepts can be developed with a lab-oriented, engineering approach. Contrary to the beliefs of some, any algorithm can be implemented in scheme. What sets scheme apart from other languages is that a scheme program can then be devised to analyze that algorithm giving a rigorous and concrete development of the analysis of algorithms!When it comes to software engineering learning a computer language should be the most trivial of tasks. If you can't implement a software design in the language chosen, you will be without a job. This book is by far the best for learning scheme and the fundamentals of programming and it is already considered a classic. There are, however, less challenging ones such How To Design Programs and Simply Scheme. If you find learning scheme to be difficult then you should expect learning any computer language to be difficult. For those that think the language of the day is a route to a job you might find a shorter program at a community college more suitable.

But there is greatness here, so let's start with that.The book is entirely based on a Lisp dialect. That gives a very strong mathematical note to the whole text, where functions of functions arise early on. This book lays out an aggressive first course in programming, introducing valuable topics like lazy evaluation, logic programming, interpreters, and constraint propagation. These, of course, have many applications and even more implications; the base concepts are useful far beyond the case studies presented here. The students of this course also receive vivid demonstrations of the hazards of parallelism, and the merits of stateless functional programming in eliminating change-of-state race conditions.Sorry, to say, I'm not a functional programmer. I use imperative languages (call them dys-functional if you must). So do 99.9% of all commercial software developers. They're stateful languages, and reflect the fact that the world has state. It may be elegant to move back and forth along the static, four-dimensional space-time trajectory of moving objects with respect to fixed ones. In practice, however, a car ramming a wall should not be considered a reversible event.One must also note that the early versions of this book date to the 1980s, before object orientation became widespread. Even the later edition (1996) ignores the basics of OO practice, since they couldn't be captured in the version of Lisp favored here. Instead, examples (ex. p.189) propagate the pernicious practice of hand-coding polymorphism via switch statements or manual table management. I'm not an OO absolutist by any means. I'm painfully aware of its limits, and willing to recommend functional style when it solves specific problems. I am fully cognizant of the iron and silicon that lie under my program, however, and of the mutualism between hardware and software. In all the years I've been building software and hardware, I've never seen a \\"functional\\" computer. Sooner or later, all of them store bits - if nothing else, the functional program itself.There's a lot of good in this book, including a great example of how to design a programming course for a brilliant novice. Believe me, the smart students can be harder to handle than the plodders (but worth it). This may outstrip the plodders, though.

I didn't enjoy reading it at all."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Scheme is a great language for writing Scheme interpreters and compilers. This book is just as self-referential as Scheme is. It is a book by MIT professors for an MIT class and is published by MIT Press. What works for a programming language doesn't work for a book.The class this book is designed for is on introductory programming. But don't expect to learn programming here. The authors have too many axes to grind to have time to worry about the best way to teach beginners about programming. They must point out that the C language suffers &quot;defects&quot; and that C programmers can be &quot;reformed&quot; by programming in Scheme. Every member of the MIT computer science department circa 1980 must show up somewhere in the footnotes, another distraction for the authors.There is plenty of good computer science here, but you already have to be a computer scientist to appreciate it. And the Scheme language is itself wonderful. Just don't try to learn it here.The teaching method used in the book is adding successive layers of abstraction. To the authors, the world beyond Cambridge, Massachusetts is nothing but a vague abstraction."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"When I had to take a Scheme course in college, I was already intimately familiar with C++ and assembly programming, so when the professor commented as to how fun to use and simple Scheme is, and how well written this book is, I got into a bit of a lazy gear and prepared for an easy time.Well...I was wrong!!! Or rather, the professor was wrong. This book, and the Scheme language especially, is just horrible. I was an experienced programmer, and I still found it a tough time trying to write programs based on this book. I knew what recursion was, but I wasn't prepared to deal with a language methodology that did not allow functions with multiple statements, but instead forced everything to be done with recursive calls. Iterative processes are done recursively, mind you!!This book is supposed to teach &quot;proper programming practice&quot; to fresh students with no programming experience. Instead, this book, coupled with the programming philosophy of Scheme reads like a decree from an evil dictator. Without much ado, it covers abstractions such as passing procedures and data around as one and what's more, uses complex math topics as examples for what can be implemented with Scheme!! The book does a shoddy job of explaining the language. I've found countless inconsistencies between what the book says and how the language works. For example, the book says that nil is a built in constant for an empty variable, yet the scheme implementation doesn't recognize it. That's just one example.I've talked with beginner students, and they all mention how the C programming class was much easire than scheme. There you have it, the book is supposed to introduce beginner to proper programming, but instead, it imposes on them a very strict and IMHO very crappy language, couple with an overall tone of a graduate level computer sciece or math course.I really think if taught properly, a langauge like C++ can be a much better tool for beginners.In any case, beginners steer clear of this terrible book, and experienced programmers too...it won't tell you anything new. You'll come out feeling like you've been grabbed by the hair and dragged around in mud."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"The book is just that, a big bore. It's too confusing for beginners, and it'll put to sleep anyone who knows a little somthing about computer science. I would agree that some of the general topics presented are important, but how they are presented is a disgrace to computer science. Instead of talking about relevant ideas in compiler and language design, authors try to implement a scheme interpreter in scheme. The material was completely divorced from the real world. I showed it to my buddy, doing a Ph.D. in compiler design, and he laughed long and hard at the whole chapter 4, which also manages to completely mispresent databases and query languages. Being a grad student in computer engineering, I found something to scoff at in chapter 5 &amp; 3, where they give a backwards presentation of assemblers, digital circuits, and circuit simulators.Come to think of it, the only worthwhile material was in chapter 2 &amp; some of chapter 3, but that was on data structures, and Cormen's &quot;Algorithms&quot; is infinitely better.My impression is, and others have suggested, that the goal of this book was self gratification for the authors. They wanted to have a book with all kinds of stuff in there, that would be used by copycat instructors all over the world to confuse beginners and bore knowledgeable students. This book would get the prize for the most obfuscated computer science book."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I'm an undergrad who is currently taking an introductory class in C.S using the book as the primary textbook (actually, the only textbook). Sadly, I'm taking it with another class in computer architecture with heavy emphasis on system programming (a la C, MIPS). Like one of the reviewers having pointed out, the excessive zeal of pedantic and theoretical C.S has left the students clueless about the connection between reality and fundamental ideas presented in the book. The authors enforces a grand vision of solving problems independent of programming language. Sadly, this is not the case in practice (I have been trying to port some algorithms in the book into C, oh boy, what a frustrating experience). This vision has left me a very bad impression on Scheme (a good-for-nothing language invented by geeks to impress other geeks).Some people have said they liked the book. At the beginning of semester. I liked the book too, since programming in functional style is completely new to me (who major in C.S wouldn't delight at learning new thing). HOWEVER, the more I delved into the book while taking a computer architecture course at the same time (in which I have to design a complete 8-bit CPU from ground up, as well as doing a lot of low-level programming), the more I feel there are some fundamental issues with using Scheme (or any other functional languages for that matter) as a tool to interpret and design machines and programs. It just struck me as very odd to design a computer \\"recursively\\". How ironic that the book is called \\"STRUCTURE and INTERPRETATION of computer programs\\".I agree with some reviewers in here who bashed C in favor of Scheme. C is not a very good language, but C deserves praises. There are reasons why it has been around forever (both in academic and in industry), and at this rate, I don't see how any functional languages would emerge out of academics as replacement for C. The authors in book braggs that only Fortran has been surviving longer than Scheme, but besides surviving in the this textbook (which has been pushed down my throat by my school), I haven't seen Scheme anywhere else.This textbook reminds me of the Feynman series in Physics. A series which everyone talks about, but when it comes to reality, it's just best used as a supplementary to look up for reference and self-congratulate as being \\"smart\\" rather than the one used to teach and learn from."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"However gave this book low ratings just doesn't get it"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Being a Freshman at MIT and having to use SICP as the textbook for my Intro to Comp.

From the opening concepts of abstraction and compound procedures, SICP builds at a blazing pace, covering much more than just the basic material one would expect from a first-semester Comp. Sci. class, including topics which ought to be tucked away in later courses such as streams, register machine code, and compilation. However, the rewards of keeping up with the pace of SICP are tremendous, as the reader will undoubtedly have gotten quite a firm grasp of computer science and its challenges (Abelson and Sussman have included some of the on-going research topics of Comp. Sci. in SICP as exercises). SICP is a treausre of knowledge waiting to reward those willing to suffer in reaching it. I have personally both suffered and been rewarded.

TLS is a profound and witty tour of recursion theory, but does not touch on the practical considerations of creating efficient programs (and does not claim to do so). SICP provides the assiduous reader with the distinction between a procedure's definition (which may well be recursive) and the process it generates (which may be iterative). It provides the means to make informed choices about program design. In particular, the book centers on writing language interpreters, which is an excellent strategy for understanding all of the problems faced in real-world programming.Because the book evolved from an MIT undergraduate course, the exercises tend to be thematically related to engineering concerns (math, physics, etc.), whereas TLS uses food. Do not be put off by this emphasis on math applications; the book is broadly applicable to all domains of program design, and is not *about* mathematics or engineering. Then again, you might consider the book to be an engineer's approach to program design, in that its emphasis is on correctness and efficiency, and not on abstract beauty or brevity.It should go without saying that you will not get anything out of the book if you do not do as many of the exercises as you are able."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This book is a must have IMHO.

I just read this book for the first time recently (wish I found it when it came out!). I found it insightful, refreshing...and unlike some others: fun. If you care about your craft and enjoy programming, you'll want (and probably like) this book. If programming is just a way to pay your bills, you probably won't like it.It is unfortunate that many of this book's detractors apparently see value only in books that are clearly and directly applicable to their current situation and requirements. Sad really, this is a symptom of why the art of programming is a vanishing art (I refer you to the Story of Mel. Now, that's a Real Programmer).This is a book for the rest of us. This isn't a dry book (cookbook) on syntax, tricks, snippets and samples. This book captures not only the science of programming but the art; it describes the essence of programming; the philosophy of programming.I also like this book because I like Scheme (as well as Lisp, and Prolog, and ...) but that is just an implementation detail....and finally if Paul Graham recommends it, it has to be good ;) because he is one of the most thought provoking essayists on programming today (with a real track record to back it up)."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"You need it, too. I won't pretend to have more useful insight into the art and craft of programming, or into SICP's relationship to it, than Paul Graham or Peter Norvig- if you want to know which reviews to trust, look these cats up.The discussion in the reviews usually concludes that this is the book that separates the computer scientists from the mere programmers. There is a definite logic to this. If you want a book that will have you churning out code that does something helpful in half an hour(because you don't think the several ways to calculate the Fibonacci Sequence are helpful), by all means, pick up Learning Perl or just read the Python documentation. They are great tools. If, however, you want to tool up on problem-solving technique a whole level or three higher up, SICP is for you. The Wizard Book is about learning to think better.Here is where I diverge from the idea that this book is for only computer scientists, though. I am an artist, graduated from college with a BA in art, going to graduate school for an MFA. SICP is one of the books that changed how I work and think. It will make you a better programmer if you read (and reread (and reread)) it in the same way that learning Latin will make you understand language itself in a whole new way. I use ideas from SICP constantly, to design software, but also to design staircases. The book is slow-going, no doubt about it, but you'll have a whole new mental toolset at the end.One caveat- this book is freely distributed in its entirety on MIT's website.

Scheme is a much better choice for a teaching language than C++ or Java. There is no need to deal with memory management issues as with C++ and the development model is simpler than with Java. And scheme makes many things easier to achieve than with other languages: higher-order procedures (chapter 1) and hierarchical data (chapter 2).For my own enjoyment and personal enrichment I have used chapters 4 and 5 as a basis for my own explicit control evaluator for scheme in C++.A classic.

Obviously, if all you do is hack perl scripts, don't buy this book.

It may come off as archaic and worthless to some, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The more I reflect on the things I learned from SICP, the more I realize they are important. The lambda calculus and scheme are simplicity and elegance at their finest.

The point is to understand the theorical under-pinnings of programming language paradigms.

That being said, the book suffers from a few flaws that make is less than easy-going for probably the majority of readers.To start with, I'll mention that the choice of typesetting used in this book makes it a bit cluttered on the eyes. Although I readily admit things like this *shouldn't* matter, they invariably do. This really is the responsibility of the publisher and not the author but the end product is a book that can be a bit numbing to read for long periods (at least in my opinion).Second and more seriously, the book is not a \\"stand-alone\\" item. For instance, to implement the \\"Picture Language\\" examples, one would need add-ons to the standard MIT-Scheme package that the authors refer to. In the problems on Data-Directed Programming focusing on association tables, the reader really is at a disadvantage in not having an implementation of the tables incorporated in the standard-issue MIT-scheme. They are constructed in Chapter 3 and this kind of \\"wait-and-see\\" makes the problems, in my opinion, harder than they really need to be. Also, the Object-Oriented Programming avoids (for understandable reasons) many of the technical features that highlight its robustness. It's not an ideal book for OOP.SICP gives the reader (or I should say, it gave THIS reader) the impression that this is also not a book for people learning programming, it is a book for people comfortable enough with programming to deal with a lot of these issues quickly. If used in a class setting this is probably easily overcome in labs.On to the strengths.The problems in the book range from fairly trivial to quite difficult. One of the strengths of the book is that they introduce a lot of topics and do not shy away from interesting and challenging exercises. The bar is set probably quite high for the undergrads learning this material but for self-study some of the problems can be somewhat daunting.Another strength, in my opinion, is what some reviewers cite as a weakness; the use of Scheme. Aside from the implementation issues above, Scheme is really well-suited (having few primitive control structures) to isolating the concepts of programming (in contradistinction to the emphasis on syntax that plagues most introductory books). The argument that Scheme is \\"useless\\" depends highly on your definition of \\"use\\", since solid understanding of program organization is a valuable language-free skill.Overall, as I mentioned, the book is quite good. Just don't expect that because it is touted as an introductory text that it will be an easy read. There is something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"My first exposure to this book was as a freshman at MIT in '86. Since then I've been exposed to an awful lot of computer science books. And I'm afraid the term &quot;awful&quot; has applied all too often. This book still stands out in my mind as one of the best comp. sci. texts I've ever read. It encompasses so many different areas of computer science that it has only been when I reread it years later that I really appreciated the full scope of the topics the book hits. Every footnote seems to branch off into another interesting facet of comp. sci. It is a bit challenging (it was geared to MIT students) but is definitely worth the read. If you get it make sure you track down MIT Scheme, the language used throughout the book, it'll help you get the most from the book, and is very interesting in its own right. In my opinion the approach the authors take is a much better one than that traditionally followed by &quot;introductory&quot; computer science texts."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Having first watched the authors' excellent video lectures that were built upon the first edition of this textbook I naturally had very high expectations when I set my hands on the second edition. The breadth of the material covered by this book is very much in line with its title. The central topic of the book, as one would expect, are computer programs. And it is here that the book really shines, progressively refining the readers' idea of what a computer program essentially is through multiple interpretations and re-interpretations of that idea.That being said, this book does take the unconventional approach: it uses a relatively unknown language called Scheme and goes into considerable effort to promote functional programming, an approach still considered pariah in the industry. But this is no flaw in my opinion. Current trends in programming language evolution indicate that many ideas that were hitherto the sole province of functional programming will become more and more present in mainstream languages.The beauty of Scheme is that it hardly has any syntax and its few special forms can all be learned in a very short time, liberating the reader from the so ubiquitous tyranny of syntax that plagues the majority of programming textbooks out there. The Scheme that the authors present in this book has no looping constructs: believe you me, there really is something special in writing loops via function recursion - it reminded me of my high-school days and the infamous goto's I would regularly get chided for by the teacher. Interestingly, in the fourth chapter of the book you get to implement some of these absent looping constructs yourself.Another nice thing about the book is that it constantly keeps challenging you: the exercises get progressively more difficult and there are very few one could skip on the basis of them being trivial or non-engaging.I was surprised though, to have seen that many colleges did, or still do, use this textbook as a basis for a first course in computer programming. I find this inappropriate because there is far too little in the way of teaching the essential algorithms and program design patterns for beginners to really profit from here. In my opinion, the material in this book is more suited for computer science sophomores instead.One of my biggest gripes with this text had to do with the way the exercises were laid out: on far too many occasions, the book doesn't present you with enough of workable code to test and verify your solutions - while an experienced programmer will have easily dealt with this issue by consulting MIT's 6.001 course webpage and downloading the code set for the book, a soloing beginner could possibly be frustrated to the point of giving up on the book. The stream section in chapter 3 is especially troublesome since there is no officially provided workable code at all either in or outside the text - again, the solution is pretty simple, but to a beginner probably insurmountable without assistance. I strongly suggest using the DrScheme environment and switching to Lazy Scheme for the purposes of this section. In fact, one can use DrScheme for most of the book, as it's far more user friendly than MIT Scheme Emacs and diverges from MIT GNU dialect of Scheme in only a few sections of the book. One annoying feature of DrScheme is that it has recently rendered set-car! and set-cdr! procedures obsolete: fortunately, the solution is simple. Just add \\"(require r5rs)\\" at the top of the definition window.A second potential problem for students that I see, is a thorough lack of commentary on domains and codomains of functions in the programs. Since Scheme is a dynamically typed language, there is no self-documentation present as there would be were the programs written in a typical statically typed language such as C++, and for a streamlined reading experience such documentation is a must.With all of this in mind, and considering this textbook as an intermediate rather than beginner level material, I rate it as very good, with potential for excellence should the problems I mentioned be resolved.If you decide to read the book, I warmly recommend that you watch the eponymous video lectures in parallel as they are thoroughly entertaining and on some occasions go into interesting theoretical discussions not to be found in the book (you definitely don't want to miss the lecture on the metacircular evaluator as it's far more clear than the presentation in the book and concludes with some really nice lambda calculus hacks)."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"If you disagree, hopefully you're thinkingKnuth.

People who complain that you can only do such things in Scheme, and therefore that the ideas are pointless, are missing the point."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"My first encounter with SICP was in the second year of university, where I took a course named \\"SICP 1'. I already had working programming experience by that time, so the course wasn't hard, but I was struck by the beauty of the subjects it taught, by the Scheme language it used and by the long and interesting homework assignments it had. This course woke my curiosity about functional programming, and the Lisp family of languages in particular.A few years later, with much more experience behind my back, I've decided to tackle SICP seriously and read the whole book, solving the vast majority of the exercises. This endeavor took about 10 months, and I enjoyed it immensely. I think SICP is a wonderful book, a seminal work in the field of programming. It is one of those rare books every programmer should read. In this review I'll try to explain why.In contrast with most introductory books about programming that just teach you a language, SICP takes a far better approach. The main goal of the authors is not to teach Scheme, it is to teach programming. From the beginning, the book takes an integrative path, where the basic axioms of programming are presented, and later are fortified with examples and exercises. SICP teaches about computational processes - iterative and recursive. How to use them best in each situation, and how to implement them. It also explains abstraction by functional composition. These are topics rarely presented in programming books, but SICP puts them rightly in the first chapter, because they are the real stuff programming is based on.The example programs developed in the book are real, large, and exciting. You'll get to develop a powerful picture language, a generic object-oriented arithmetic package including complex and polynomial arithmetic, a simulator for digital circuits, a symbolic differentiation package, an interpreter for Scheme written in Scheme, an interpreter for a logic programming language similar to Prolog, a virtual machine for a simplified pseudo-assembly DSL, an interpreter for Scheme written in this pseudo-assembly, and finally a compiler from Scheme to the assembly language. All these examples are real, well-thought out exercises for skill, taken from beginning to a very complete end. In no other book such a wealth of topics is addressed in an accessible manner.A word about exercises in SICP. They are numerous, some of them are hard, but the exercises are the best way to really understand what the book tries to teach. In a manner, they're as integral part of the book as the text itself. The exercises are very well prepared and lead the reader through the examples coded by the authors into greater understanding of the topics taught. At times, it feels like the exercises are specifically designed to force you to think about the essence of the topics, and not just grasp them superficially.SICP commonly suffers from the criticism that it's too hard for beginners. Maybe this criticism is rightful, and universities should give a simpler introductory course to programming before SICP. But this is an aspect of the educational systems, not pertaining to the book itself. I wouldn't know, I never read SICP as a beginner. However it is being taught, SICP is an amazing book. It is by far the best programming book I have ever laid by hands on, and I seriously doubt that it will be surpassed any time soon. Reading SICP will enlighten you as a programmer, and make you a better one. I can't imagine one programmer who won't gain something important by reading SICP."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"SICP is a great book. If you are a patient reader and willing to work the exercises, then this is the single best book you could read about programming in general and about the Scheme dialect of Lisp in particular. I found it well-written, thorough and clear.Read this book with an open mind. It is not &quot;Teach Yourself Programming in 21 Days&quot;. Many people don't appreciate programming theory; they would rather get on with it and start programming. If you are one of these, then you may find yourself irritated by the theory SICP includes. However, if you want to excel as a programmer it is worth taking the time to learn the theory. Some ideas may penetrate slowly but when they do, the rewards will make up for the effort.This book can be used as an introductory computer programming text, but I suspect that students won't get full benefit until they have a couple of years of programming experience under their belt.This book will make you a MUCH better programmer--something that the many books that teach a programming language but ignore computing principles can not do."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"... and sadly this book is no exception.

If you're not already a great programmer,I would have thought that these few chapters would save you from havingto spend years flailing around in the dark.

It was amazing, inspiring. a whirlwind tour of interesting ideas in computer science. it taught me what a program was capable of. I was so inspired, i set out to become a programmer and took some more computer science classes. Start work as a programmer. but if i had never read SICP, and just learned from my classes and co-workers, computer science and programming would be a drudgerous, pointless task to be outsourced to offshore developers.instead, despite the tedium of having to support poorly designed applications integrated with poorly designed third party software, reading stacks of technical documentation, i continue to be inspired by sicp. it teaches me that there are so many ideas to be explored. that the computer and the software it runs isn't just a filing cabinet or a business process automator. its way to explore problems and think about them. cooperatively with users and designers.chapter 3 and 4 i keep find myself revisiting. i often find myself thinking about them, grasping them a little deeper each time. i still have some ways to go in be able to actual apply the ideas from the discussion of streams vs mutable objects at teh end of ch 3. i wish i could spend my whole career applying the ideas from the event propagation system, the constraint network, the non-deterministic solver, and the relational programming to different problem domains. i'll try, but you also run into limits with users. users can understand and conceptualize filing cabinets / data entry systems. they have problems when you start talking about more abstract systems.i like the conscious decision to not waste time talking about class hierarchies. i love the idea of beign treated like a designer, and being walked through so many different aspects of how things work with prototypes. its almost spoiled me. whenever i see a new system now, i often find myself asking - walk me through how this thing works from the inside out. closed source systems annoy me because of SICP.thank you for writing this inspirational book!"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"It's amazing how polarized the opinions on this book are.

I can imagine it can scare beginners, or render the snooty ones angry.I think the best way to figure out what *you* would think of the book is to take a look at it yourself.

So, in case you have a pragmatic problem you can't just take the book and find a solution: I guess this is the reason for low ratings. But if you read the book thoroughly, you will definitely become an order of magnitude better programmer and that is much more important than knowing concrete algorithms.I also extremely highly recommend the same-named video course by the same authors at http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/ : I first was intrigued and shocked with it and only afterwards saw and immediately bought the book. It is a pity I have not yet had time to watch all the lectures (I watched about a half)."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I have read a lot of reviews here which lament the use of Scheme for teaching the fundamental concepts in this book. People have stated that while the book pretends to be language-independent it relies solely on Scheme, which invalidates the point.I disagree strongly!I think part of the problem is that it takes a bit of time to really &quot;grok&quot; Scheme. If you've never been exposed to it before (as I haven't), Scheme may seem strange and unnecessarily arcane to you at first. However, after doing it for a bit you will realize (as I have) that Scheme is amazingly flexible, succinct, powerful and unbelievably elegant. It incorporates all the features that other languages such as C++ take for granted and skip over, and exposes the real machinery behind them, without introducing a whole host of obscure syntactical details. This clarity and elegance of Scheme has helped me understand all other languages I have to deal with so much better!Thus, in presenting the topics of this book in Scheme, the authors are actually succeding in making their discussions language-independent! Truly, the difference here lies in what your goals are: if you want to program in some specific language and just memorize it, this is not a book for you. However, if you actually want to understand how that language works, this will be akin to an epiphany for you. A very good book!"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Great computer science book overall. I really wish I had read this years ago. This book gave me a lot of insight into concepts that I thought I already knew.There are some bad reviews here on Amazon which are a little hard for me to understand. I can certainly see how this book isn't for everyone - it requires a certain way of looking at things. But then, computer science itself requires that same way of looking at things. If you think Java is a great language for teaching computer science, you won't like this book. But please reconsider your career choice. (And I can't help but address the assertion in one of the reviews that \\"virtually every conventional algorithm is NOT implementable in scheme\\". Obviously this is completely and laughably false, but I would absolutely love to know what the reviewer was thinking - how could someone get such a ridiculous idea in his head?)I do have a few problems with the book. Firstly, the book fairly often describes a few procedures to you, and then wants you to complete exercises using the procedures. But you have no actual implementation of the procedures, and thus you cannot run any of the code you are writing (sometimes hundreds of lines). Frankly, this sucks. One of the great things about computer science is that you get immediate feedback when you code. You write it, run it, bam, there's your result. In most cases, the book does eventually give you the implementations for the missing procedures, but in at least one case, it does not.Another problem with the book is that it does not provide answers for the exercises. This is unfortunately a common situation, not just in computer science. This is probably OK in a classroom setting, but what about us autodidacts? I'm not sure of the answer to a few of the open-ended questions in this book and there's basically no way for me to find the answer.Lastly, considering the book is supposedly an \\"introductory\\" computer science textbook, it's too bad it's not quite suitable for someone who is smart but who has no programming experience to just pick up and use directly. There are too many peripheral issues not addressed for such a person.I do consider these serious problems. The fact that I'm still giving the book 5 stars shows how good I think it is despite these issues."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"So there I was, 18 years old, having been raised on a toxic stew of MS-BASIC, Apple II assembly and some MPW Pascal. My mind was poisoned. Everything I knew about programming was wrong. I read book after book on programming and CS, but none of them really seemed to make a real dent in my style.Enter SICP. In a few months, this book reshaped my concept of what it meant to program a computer. It does not spend time teaching a language; Scheme is presented precisely because its syntax and commands can be covered in about ten minutes, and its structure becomes absolutely transparent within a few days of looking at Scheme code. It does not spend time walking the reader through common coding tasks, as a Learn X In 24 Hours text might.SICP teaches the fundamentals of programming mastery. Abstraction, modularity, design paradigms, compilation and interpretation, and more topics are presented in a style which is exactly as simple as it can be, and no simpler. Scheme allows these topics to be covered without becoming mired in details which would otherwise plague the implementor.It will not show you how to write a GUI, scrape a web page, develop a social networking website or create a network server. It will, however, guide a dedicated reader through an exploration of immensely powerful programming technique, and it will prepare the reader to solve any problem in any language for the future.SICP is not a machine gun, putting power into casual hands. It is a light saber, rewarding discipline and practice with unstoppable capability."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This is the bravest book on programming I have read. I say bravest because, rather than use Pascal or C and give you the topics &quot;you must know&quot;, the authors broke free from tradition. They use Scheme, a language of astonishing flexibility and uniformity, and they show you the topics they believe are beautiful and will enlighten you.The result is a book that makes you think hard, and poses deep problems. If you are the type who likes thinking about the &quot;foundations&quot;, this book can be a revelation, no less. You don't need previous experience or &quot;helper&quot; books, all you need is contained in this one; but you will need to work hard, and even take breaks, as the pace becomes very hard by the last two chapters. The book is beautifully written, though not adorned, and it provides you with a vocabulary and ways of thinking that will become indispensable, and that are rarely found in other books. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"These recent negative reviews are unfortunate. SICP is not a cookbook; it is not \`practical' in the sense that it doesn't teach you the skills you need to know to become a grunt in industry. What it does teach you, however, are the tools you need to think about computing; it gives you tools and ways to think about problems that many--if not most--programmers are unfamiliar with and for some reason resent.People who will appreciate this book are people who appreciate beauty in coding; the book is less about getting the job \`done,' and more about writing the most elegant programs possible using every tool and (more importantly) idea at your disposal.Scheme is not the \`best' language, but it is a great language; in the text's wide array of topics, Scheme is used as the basis for a high level procedural and functional language, parallel language, object oriented language, ambiguous language (i.e., a language with built in backtracking), and logic language. The book teaches you how to program and THINK in all of those paradigms in order to write the most beautiful algorithms.The text is not easy, but it is no surprise why it is the introductory text at MIT and Berkeley (where I encountered it). The intellectual level and the pace that this text maintains is at a level that only the intelligent and hard working can appreciate. But the results are rewarding; in the end you'll have been thorougly introduced to a breadth of topics unparalleled by any computer science text, both in theory and practice.This is not a book for those who see Computer Science as manual labor: those who favor skipping study in favor of experience. This is a textbook for those who want to think about programming, and program in the best way possible. It may not be \`practical' in a world where most code is written in COBOL and Visual BASIC; this is a book for those who see programming as an artform."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"This is hands down the most personally influential book I've ever read on computer science.

I'm on my third run through of some parts, and still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. On a side note, chapters 1-3 should be required reading for all programmers.

However, if you actually want to be any good at programming and be able to *fully* understand what's going on, this book is an EXCELLENT investment, not only in terms of cash, but in terms of the time you spend reading it. My first introduction to this book was as an EECS major at U.C. Berkeley in '91. I can't stress enough the incredible advantage you will have after reading this book over someone who took the path of least resistance and learned programming from a Teach Yourself In 21 Days book.

There is certainly a place for books such as this, and I don't mean the last sentence as a criticism. Seeing an elegant presentation of the fundamentals of any field is always pleasant, and it can stir up forgotten ideas and enthusiasm.I think SICP will also appeal to many scientists, who (1) write terrible programs because they learned FORTRAN from their advisor who learned FORTRAN from his advisor who..., (2) are open-minded enough to change, and (3) won't be intimidated by the (simple and peripheral) mathematical examples in the first couple of chapters.It is true that the book is slightly quirky. For example, as long as the authors are going to alienate the sort of people who gave them one-star reviews, why not give prominent introductions to the theory of computation, functional programming, and correctness? These topics are addressed, but concepts like Church numerals and the halting problem end up buried in problems and footnotes.

It merely retells the same old obvious programming techniques using a very poorly designed language (Scheme) and using completely uneducational examples. In short, this book is an overrated waste of time. If you are familiar with structured programming in a langauge like C++, you won't get anything new out of this.

They don't teach anything that's applicable in general, or will give you better understanding of the issues involved in writing good software.

All I hear about SICP from students and professors alike is that they wish the book ceased to exist.Don't listen to the others on this page...the book won't teach you to be a better programmer, and it won't teach you how to understand programs. It'll simply waste a lot of your time."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"Just because the author graduated from MIT doesn't mean it's great. Like most academic books, this book relishes on sophistication and pedantics for the sake of academics. While it is true that there are some important concepts here, the concepts themselves are a bit self-explanatory. For example, he talks about modularity and how important it is to break code down to parts. Everyone learns that in introductory CS. I even learned that by experience before I took a computer course.I would've excused the dry writing if he had presented some timeless and interesting concepts. But there aren't any.I read a very dry book on algorithms, &quot;Algorithms in C&quot;, andI really found it very useful because it presented some interesting concepts and had some minimal source code examplesto follow.So I would not recommend this book at all. I didn't really get anything out of it."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"That's right, this book is plain boring, even for a CS major like myself. I did not learn anything except for Scheme syntax. Once you get that, the rest of the book is useless. This text is a half-baked attempt at algroithms and data structures, and of course, since it's tailored to scheme, I never found much use for these concepts later. In fact, once you start programming in a real language like C, you'll have to relearn all the concepts and see how they really work in the proper programming setting. On top of that, the writers make absolutely no attempt to be clear. Because no one thought of building iteration into scheme, you're stuck with a perposterous recursion overuse, complicating many simple algorithms, and confusing even the brightest students. Even my professor didn't like the book. It has the feel of a book written for no other reason than Abelson's self-gratification. If you value your time, avoid this book. Get instead the wonderful text by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest : &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;"},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"There's no useful material here, whatever your level of sophistication. Beginners will find that Scheme, and the book's approach in general are confusing. Those who are advanced will find the text is full of bull, and a book like &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; by Cormen et.al. will provide you with many more theoretical and practical topics alike, but it's advanced (and hence more interesting than SICP drivel). If you are a beginner, &quot;C++ how to program&quot; by Deitel will teach you all about object oriented and top down programming, plus you'll learn the C++, the most common language out there.Whatever is presented, is of such poor quality, and so dry, I couldn't stay awake long enough to finish my assignments. You can learn how to be a good programmer from any computer science course or text, and there are only several sections about that in this book. If you are looking for interesting theoretical ideas, look for other texts, such as the ones mentioned above.From what I've read, I get the impression this book was written in a rush, and with the purpose of cramming tons of nonsense and filler in just to have an excuse to present Scheme (a pathetic language). The authors claim to present a view of programming that's widely applicable, and state that top-down (i.e. procedural) programming is by far not the best way to think about programs abstractly. Well, they don't stick to their promise. They present a biased, one sided promotion of scheme as the best language out there. No attempt is made to make comparisons between functional languages like scheme and normal languages like C. The end result, you come out knowing scheme and a few boring applications of it, but can't apply any of it to real programming tasks. This proves this book is just a fancy concotion of some egghead professor who has no idea what happens in the real world. I found many explanations to be incoherent and contradictory. The whole approach is divorced from the computing practice. This is no 21 day book, in fact, you can spend 21 months on it and still not learn a thing, because there's nothing but worthless garbage here."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"The book never lives up to all the hype surrounding it. In fact, of the over 50 people I know who had the misfortune to study out of it, none liked it. I imagine only a few crazy souls who care about nothing but dry computer langague theory would even consider this worth reading.Recursion and information hiding via procedural/object code is nothing mysterious and is taught in all other CS classes, so the text adds nothing new. It merely retells the same old obvious programming techniques using a very poorly designed language (Scheme) and using completely uneducational examples. In short, this book is an overrated waste of time. If you are familiar with structured programming in a langauge like C++, you won't get anything new out of this. In fact, any topic presented here is better learned elsewhere, since the text is just one of those poorly written books that try to be encyclopedic at the expense of being interesting and thorough."},{"Title":"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)","review":"I'd like to point out the fact that this book gets mixedreviews for a very good reason. It's exceedingly boring andmuch of the information is completely worthless as far ascomputer science and programming in general is concerned.I read this text when I already had some introductory datastructures and algorithms knowledge, plus C++ experience.I couldn't believe some of the dumb things this book passedoff as good programming, not to mention how very inconvenientScheme is.So there you are, these authors present either simple ideas whicheveryone already knows, or they present interesting things insuch a way that no one can understand them, and on top of that,they use a language which is inappropriate for most of thealgorithms they show. If you pick up a book like &quot;Algorithms&quot;by Cormen, et.al. you'll see everything is in C-like pseudocode,and I don't know anyone who was able to successfully code thingslike Djikstra's algorithm in Scheme, and yet this is typical ofwhat programmers encounter in practice.In short, this book is pedantic drivel, only of interest tohardcore computer science majors who don't really care aboutcoding efficiency and elegance, and would rather waste timeformalizing basic ideas mathematically."},{"Title":"The Science of Mind: The Thirty-Fifth Edition of the Revised and Enlarged Form","review":"The items, 3 books, were in great, like new, condition.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Gang Nation: Delinquent Citizens In Puerto Rican, Chicano, And Chicana Narratives","review":"Gang Nation is an exemplary counter hegemonic text that unveils how the intersected force of race, class and gender oppression (as a neocolonial matrix) drive the racialized panoptic and carceral regimes of the United States. Given how Latina/o youth like African American are demonized and then converted through the \\"justice\\" system into abjects and throwaways this study reveals how poor Latina/o youth negotiate institutional violence on a daily basis for survival. Through Browns illumination of the complexity, eloquence and poltics of self-representation in Latina/o gang narratives and autobiographies, we get a picture of the results of extreme poverty, urban decay, trauma, and neocolonial racism on these kid's struggle for empowerment and survival. Part of what is also crucial about Browns study is the willingness to critique and condemn the \\"normalization\\" of sexual violence against women and girls \\"in the hood\\" and shows how patriarchal norms of the dominant culture are re-articulated in non-dominant communities. In this regard the read of Luis Rodriguez's Always Running and the chapter \\"American She\\" which examines the fetishization of Chicanas in gang in the media is useful and politically cogent. Furthermore as a text for classroom use, it is surprisingly jargon free and at the same time a theoretically nuanced and complex read of the historic, insitutional and everyday forces that criminalize and violate Latina/o youth. A must read.....!!!."},{"Title":"Gang Nation: Delinquent Citizens In Puerto Rican, Chicano, And Chicana Narratives","review":"Brown's book undertakes an important analysis of gang literature and representation, but the use of the concept &quot;gang nation&quot; is, in my opinion, questionable.

It's aesthetically pleasing, and I'm sure it will hold together for many years. No arguing over the price, either. Thank you, B&N!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read a lot. I mean, really a lot. I'll pick up a novel and finish it on the same day. Crime and Punishment? Took me half a day. Middlemarch? A day and a half.Because I read quickly, I tend not to be overly moved by the triumphs and travails of literary characters. I exult with them momentarily, but their brightness fades quickly once I set down the book.Jane Eyre was different. So many of the book's elements defied nineteenth century convention; so many of the book's elements set my heart racing and my mind on edge. The unexpected first person perspective. Charlotte Bronte's mesmerizing lyrical prose. The strength--or, as the British might say, the pluck--of the book's indomitable heroine. The tenacity of Jane's love for Rochester and the reciprocal power of his love for her.I don't often cry when I read novels, but for the last twenty pages of Jane Eyre, I read transfixed while tears streamed down my face. I doubt a novel has ever made a heroine come to life as vividly as did Jane Eyre.Read this book. Love it. Treasure every breathtaking passage and every witty turn of phrase. Watch as mere ink and paper breath life into Jane Eyre's heart--and your own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"If you are a Jane Eyre fan, junkie, or a first time reader, this is a wonderful edition to pick up. Dame Darcy brings the Gothic elements to life in her illustrations with an artistic flourish. I love these illustrations! They both complement the novel and are great on their own.

It is a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"\\"I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that adresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal- as we are!\\" - Jane EyreJane Eyre is the wonderful story of a plain and simple girl who, as a child, is mistreated and wrongfully accused by her aunt and sentenced to Lowood, a school for orphans. After recieving an ok education Jane goes to be a governess at Thornfield where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. Yet she is only a governess and Mr. Rochester is going to be married to someone else. Jane has to make him change his mind before the dreaded wedding date.I don't want to give too much away but there is a lot more to this story than the summary above. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I read some parts over and over again. Sorry guys but this is mostly romance and drama. How the author tells the story and the plot are very interesting. This book is considered a classic. All of the characters are explained in such detail. You have a connection with Jane Eyre. When I read the back of this book there was one sentence in particular that caught my attention. I hope that will help you in thinking about reading this book. Jane Eyre is now one of my favorite books.\\"Published in 1847 under the pen name Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine- one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect, and tireless perserverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved.\\"That sentence and the quote at the top describe Jane Eyre best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Although I found this novel a bit too windswept, making it hard to turn the pages in an orderly fashion, I was awe-struck by its darkly gothic mood, the barely suppressed passions of its characters, and the threat of violent transgression that seems to haunt every scene like a towering shih-tzu.My gym teacher used to warn me about books like this. One morning after dodge-ball, he pulled me aside, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \\"Son, I know your English teacher is having you read a lot of gothic Victorian novels about frightened young women who fall for mysterious, unattainable men with a dark side...\\" He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye. \\"You know I'm worried, don't you. I'm worried about your manhood. I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- \\"Oh forget it. I'll save the rest of this story for my therapist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Word has it that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most imitated novels in literature, having almost singlehandedly spawned the genre of romantic fiction which supplies all those erotic-looking pulp paperbacks you see next to the magazine rack at the supermarket. What I found in Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, however, was a smart, resolute, and independent heroine who stands out like a beacon in a sea of Victorian fictional women. As if obeying some sort of literary convention, the book does have a sad beginning and a happy ending, but in between there are some very rich surprises: moments of mystery, tension, and ghostly images, delivered in a tightly paced narrative.Jane Eyre is an orphan who has spent the first ten years of her life with a mean aunt who mistreats her and the next eight years at a miserable school for indigent girls called Lowood. With this education, she qualifies herself as a teacher and secures a position as a governess at a house called Thornfield Hall. Her employer is a man twice her age named Edward Rochester, and her charge is his ward, a little girl of French parentage named Adele.Given that Jane soon falls in love with him, it might be guessed that Rochester is a dashing, noble, gallant gentleman; but no: He is unattractive, eccentric, shifty, assumes disguises, and rarely gives a straight answer to a question. These might merely be manifestations of a quirky, enigmatic personality, or maybe he is so evasive because he is hiding something from his past -- as indeed he is, and that \\"something,\\" incriminating and dangerous, is locked up in Thornfield Hall, unknown to Jane and most of the servants.Rochester falls in love with Jane, too, despite his apparent attention to a conceited society woman named Blanche Ingram. After a short courtship and a marriage proposal, however, Jane breaks off with him when she discovers his secret. Abandoning Thornfield Hall for a new life, she meets a young parson named St. John Rivers who is planning to go to India to do missionary work and would like to marry her because he thinks she too would make a good missionary. Thus, she has had to reject two men in her life: the first because he was not honest with her and made her feel used and deceived; the second because he is not looking for a wife, but a co-worker.Jane is not foolish, but she is human. That she returns to Rochester does not mean she has decided to accept his faults, but that she realizes they have developed that special kind of mutually dependent relationship that only two people who are truly in love may foster. By the end of the novel, Rochester loses a great deal because of his mistakes, and Jane's love is his only redemption; Jane, on the other hand, gains much because of the strength of her character, and Rochester's love is the fulfillment of her desire."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The book, Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is considered to be a work of genius, and with good reason. The story revolves around the life of an orphan, Jane Eyre, living in England in the 1900s. The book starts out during her childhood, when she lived with her cruel Aunt Reed and cousins Georgiana, John, and Eliza, and her years at the Lowood School as both a student and a teacher. Then, Jane takes a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall. When she lives there, she falls in love with her master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and they plan to marry. But Jane's happiness is destroyed when she learns of the horrible secret Mr. Rochester has keeping from her, and she leaves him. A few years pass, and Jane is now the head master at a small school, when she learns that she has cousins who are still alive, which is very important to her. She lives with her cousins for awhile, but eventually returns to the love of her life, Mr. Rochester, because she misses him. When she returns to him, she learns of the many bad things which have befallen him and Thornfield Hall, but in the end, she is very content with her life.This is an excellent book, especially because of the way the main character, Jane Eyre, is portrayed. She is not perfect, because she isn't very attractive, or very well liked. She is very shy and has many personality flaws, including \\"a wicked heart, especially for such a young girl\\" ( pg. 39). But she also has many good qualities about her; she is very kind and humble. The book provides just the right balance of good and bad to make Jane Eyre a very real and likeable character. Another reason why Jane Eyre is such a great book is because although it is very long, over 600 pages, the book moves very quickly, and there are almost no long portions of the book where nothing happens. Anytime there was a lull in the book, a major event would occur and the plot would move quicker, thus making the book seem shorter than it really was. Another reason why this book was so good was that it was a great picture of life for women in the 1900s. The book really showed that all that most women possessed was there title, and if they lost that, then they had nothing. However, Jane Eyre managed to rise above this, and in the end, the book's moral was about rising above your position in life, so that you could be truly happy.However, some people might disagree with my view on this book. Jane Eyre is at times a very sad book, and not everyone likes a sad book. Although Jane is generally happy, there is always a touch of sadness in her words and actions, which is why not everyone would agree with my review. However, there is plenty of good to out way the bad. This is a very interesting and compelling book which is very highly recommended. The plot is full of interesting people and places, it is written beautifully, and is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I still have the copy of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; I first read when I was 12 years-old--it is now worn with love and many readings. I can think of no higher compliment to a book than to see its pages worn, cover creased by repeated use. With every reading over the years, I have gained new insight into Jane and Rochester.Jane is (as she describes herself) &quot;poor, obscure, plain and little&quot;, but she is also possesses incredible strength and conviction. Rochester is her match in passion, a dark and complicated hero. Theirs is a love story of two equals. Nowadays, this may seem commonplace (though, unfortunately, not as common as we may think); in Charlotte Bronte's time, this was a major revelation. Indeed, it was considered scandalous. Imagine--a woman asserting her own ideals and independence, considering herself equal to a man! Shocking!I have heard some say that they believe Emily Bronte's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; to be the masterpiece of the Bronte family. While I loved that book, its protagonists cannot begin to compete with the strong, complex characters that Charlotte Bronte has given us. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not only the masterwork of the Bronte family; it is one of the greatest books of the nineteenth century.Because I love this book so much, I cannot truly do it justice in this review. Please read it if you have not before. If you read it long ago, read it again. I promise you a great read and moving experience!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A Realistic, Relatable Fairy Tale, by Michelle Giullain, student of Professor SWILUASome people never get sick of fairy tales. I, for one, have an incredible ability to hear the same story over and over again and never tire. Every once in a while, though, I crave something a little more realistic, while still maintaining that fairy tale \`happily ever after' ending. It is hard to appeal to both sides of the spectrum, but Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre accomplishes this daunting task. Though it does have the typical fairy tale ending, it is a novel the audience can relate to. Instead of a fairy tale princess, Jane Eyre is the fairy tale story of a plain girl who faces real struggles. Bronte's realistic, relatable characters who face normal struggles allow the reader to relate to the novel, making it a book that will be thoroughly enjoyed for years to come.The characterization Bronte uses is truly genius, combining archetypal characters with human flaws. Oddly enough, it contains some of the fairy tale archetypes we are oh so familiar with, the evil stepmother and stepsisters. In this case, it is an abusive aunt and her spoiled children, but they fulfill the same role. Other archetypes, such as the sacrificial best friend, Helen Burns, and the crazy ex, Bertha, all show up in the novel. It speaks to the reader's emotions, because everyone has and archetypal figure in their life of some form. Whether or not you have an evil stepmother, or mother in law, it is comforting to read about other people who go through the same struggles as you, especially if your ex is still haunting you.Additionally, the characterization of the protagonist, Jane Eyre, gives the reader a direct connection to the novel. Her imperfections are what make her so perfect. Her outside appearance pales in comparison to the beautiful princesses, literally. Her pale skin and her plain face do not match the description of the usual princess. But, because Jane is not perfect, the audience can relate to her. Not many of us look just like a princess, have a castle, or a fairy godmother to grant our every wish. When we read about someone who isn't that beautiful, those who feel they are not as beautiful as Cinderella have someone to relate to. However, it is not only the outer appearance that makes Jane so ideal. She also has character flaws. She does not posses the patience to tame a beast, like Belle, or Snow White's affinity to the caretaking of small innocent creatures. Rather, her honesty and stubbornness, un-princess like qualities, show that she is human. She is not entirely confident in herself and feels loneliness. In her own words, \\"I abhorred myself...I was hateful in my own eyes\\" (329). Though we may not loathe ourselves all of the time, there are many instances in which a normal human in the normal world would not like themselves. This additional perspective into the imperfect Jane helps the reader connect to the book.Bronte also makes the other character's flaws apparent, especially in the man Jane comes to love. Prince not-so-charming, Rochester, has his own flaws inside and out. He, like Jane, is not beautiful, dashing, or handsome. He is rustic, unrefined, and unkind and that is not all. He tries to control Jane's actions and play with her mind. He has hidden baggage, too. His crazy wife, Bertha, is locked up in his attic. By the end, however, he has proven that he is a good person, just like Jane. He heroically tries to save his servants and crazy wife from his burning house, and loses an eye in the process. The key to the audience connection is the imperfection of not only Jane, but also Rochester. For, how possible would it be that Jane could find a dashing prince charming when she is not beautiful? And if Rochester were handsome, why would he pursue a relationship with a plain Jane? The two is absolutely perfect for each other. To the reader, it makes perfect sense that these two imperfect characters should get together. And, it might even remind them of their own romantic endeavors, or give them a little hope for the future.Beyond the imperfect characters, the relationship between the characters also contributes to the appeal to the audience by creating even more reality amid a fairy tale story. The Rochester-Jane romance is not a love at first sight experience, even though she does sweep him off his feet. (Actually, his horse slips on the ice the first time they cross paths, but that is not really the same thing). Though Prince Charming and Cinderella lacked a bit of communication, they never had any significant relationship problems. Snow white didn't even need to meet her Prince. One kiss and he made her feel alive. However, like most human relationships, Jane and Rochester fight, argue, feel jealously and hurt. They keep secrets and experience disappointments. Rochester invites a party of beautiful women to his house to make Jane jealous. Then, on the morning of their wedding, she finds out that he has a wife in the attic. Jane then runs away because she cannot bear the thought of being a mistress to Rochester. Rochester is devastated and almost gives up living because he has lost Jane. Though they love each other, their relationship is not always perfect. Jane Eyre has no magic spells, princes, dragons, or balls. She has to deal with real life in the real world of relationships. Because this is more like the world we live in, the audience, who has likely experienced jealousy and conflict in a relationship, is able to see themselves in the story.Alas, all is well in the end, once the real life struggles are over. This fairy tale ending is the perfect finishing to the story, because it what the reader \`wants'. Though life doesn't always follow that pattern, sometimes it does. For Jane, something finally went right. Not many sentences in the novel provide as much joy as the simple declaration, \\"Reader, I married him\\" (462). Jane Eyre finds the love she has always wanted, and the reader, at that moment, experiences a small moment of triumph. That moment is the defining emotional moment of the novel, and what makes this novel so appealing to an audience. But, that is the same with any fairy tale.Because Jane Eyre does not simply focus on the \`happily ever after', but integrates the story into a complicated and realistic plot, it is a more believable story. The book does not begin or end with the usual \`Once upon a time\\" and \\"Happily ever after\\", nor does it focus on the marriage and courtship between the two characters. Jane has struggles throughout the novel, from the abusive cousins to the malnutrition at school to nearly dying from exhaustion. Even after she marries Rochester, she must deal with a blind husband who is an emotional wreck. With small triumphs are placed intermittently between many struggles, it reflects what life is like for the audience, and anyone who lives in the real world, for that matter. Jane may have struggles, but she sees the fulfillments of her dream.Ultimately, those who live in the real world have the opportunity to escape into a book that isn't just about some perfect fictional character in a far away kingdom. Jane Eyre is about the same world we live in because it presents the struggles many of us face, and the triumphs that even plain Jane can experience. No matter what time you may be reading this novel, the breadth of the archetypes and the imperfections of the characters give you the opportunity to enjoy and relate to this beautifully crafted novel.

Instead of collapsing and not carrying on - as was the want of young women in that era - she ALWAYS picks up and tries to find the good in a situation. Even though this was written so long ago - you can see how Jane is an equal match for modern women, who do not think that they need others to take care of them. The prose are beautifully written and even though I have seen three of the films, many times, the book is even better. The story takes you through Mr Rochester and on to her finding herself. The ending is beautifully written and there is enough of her religious beliefs in it, to make a current day religious person feal comforted. A beautiful ending that made me shed tears in the last paragraph.

It is arranged for Jane to be sent to Lowood School, a boarding school fifty miles away. At Lowood, the food is scarce, living conditions are poor, and they have no coats or mittens to keep them warm. Typhus plagues the school, killing Jane's only true friend, Helen. Jane's academics thrive, and after six years she takes the place of a teacher. Two years later Jane places an ad in the Herald, which is answered by a single letter. Jane travels 16 miles to find that she is the new teacher to Edward Rochester's foster child. By the second month she is there, Jane comes to be quite fond of her pupil, Adele Varens, and she is beginning to be aware of how she cares for Mr. Rochester. As she spends more time at Thornfield, Jane's affection for Rochester deepens, as he pursues Blanche Ingram. Jane leaves Thornfield shortly to visit Mrs. Reed, her dying aunt. Mrs. Reed confesses that John Eyre, Jane's uncle has been trying to locate her, but Mrs. Reed discouraged him. She then dies, unloved by even her daughters. Jane returns to Thornfield and is immediately proposed to by Rochester. During their wedding ceremony, Mr. Briggs stands up and proclaims that Mr. Rochester is already married. Jane is then shown to the third floor of Thornfield, where Bertha Mason Rochester, Rochester's wife is locked away. Jane flees Thornfield and uses all her money for transportation. She finds herself reduced to begging and is invited into the home of St. John Rivers, a minister. She recuperates from the trauma in her life under the care of him and his two sisters Mary and Diana. Jane accepts a job as a teacher in a local school. She soon discovers that John Eyre has left her with 20,000 pounds, which she openly shares with St. John and his sisters. St. John proposes to her but Jane repeatedly refuses; she does not love him. In turning down St. John she realizes she is still in love with Rochester. She gets news that Bertha Rochester jumped off the roof and killed herself during a fire that blinded her husband. Jane heads to Ferndean, Rochesters present home, and they reunite and plan to marry. The next time we hear from Jane again is ten years later. Rochester has regained sight in one eye and they have a newborn son. This book ends on a happy note with Jane telling us how contented she is with her present life.I found this book to be extremely thought- provoking. We see the trials and tribulations of a young girl who goes through so many hardships yet comes out a better person each time. I gave this book a five star rating because it expressed the life of a truly amazing young woman in a truly amazing way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I was shocked to see that many of the people who reveiwed this book gave it one star. It took me two days to read this book. I could'nt put it down! Jane is so down to earth and she refuses to feel sorry for herself, and do what she wanted to do the light of what others would suffer if she did. Her devoted love to Rochester was touching. When she discovered his sad secret, she did not follow her own fleshly desires, but left for the good of her lover, heartbroken, yet triuphant in knowing that she'd done what was right. Charlotte Bronte book is the best I've ever or ever will read. Those who rate this book 1 star need to reread it.:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I am a young teen and although I have not lived long I have read some particularly muture books. When I decided to read Jane Eyre I thought it would be like all the others who have the same basic plot with immoral characters that make the same selfish decisions. But, I soon found out that I was wrong. Jane Eyre will awaken your senses and will leave you feeling like you know the characters. Unlike other books Jane Eyre is a book about intelligent decision making and moral. I feel that this book deserves another look at I hope that others will enjoy reading it as much as I do. By Heather Beers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the most beloved books ever written. Before I had read it, I attributed this to the many movies made of the plot, because I did not think a novel written in formal style by an author often paired with Jane Austen would appeal to the general public. I read it. It was as formal as expected, but different. There was imagination here, like a butterfly on a string, and the contents were Truth. Real Truth is interesting and thought-provoking no matter how presented. The style is a lot like Jane herself: a passionate, creative, romantic young woman, though shy and refined, introspective, rather plain, well brought-up and having strict, if select, morals. This may be in part due to the fact that the novel is written in first person, with Jane narrating. Jane is an incredible character; every word, every action, every thought makes sense, enhances and makes more real her being. All of the characters in Jane Eyre are this detailed, and all are completely different from the others, lending comparison essential to the reader's opinion of each, and of what Jane should do. Although some find the dialogue a bit improbable and fancy -- that no one speaks that way in real life -- I only had problems with that when acting it out. Admittedly, dialogue is at times long and too polished to be spontaneous, but the content of the spoken words makes up for it, and this type of dialogue does not dominate the entire book. Rapid, witty exchanges are just as common.The plot is original and dramatic; keep in mind that Jane Eyre in Ms. Bronte's day might be like Stephen King or Danielle Steel in our day. Jane Eyre is, essentially, a masterpiece soap opera, though a very elegant and refined one. It is a story of characters afflicted and tortured by the rules of society and the self-deprivations of morality and piousness. It is melodramatic and emotional, but not to the point of sogginess; crisper, tenser parts balance the sentimentalism. Suspense begins right away, but continues with something of a snowball effect, reaching its height near the end -- but this is only my opinion; many disagree with me. The one fault with the plot (I had no complaint, but it is my way to accept everything in a good book as Law) may be the frequent coincidences. Giving examples would spoil it for those who haven't read the book, but all contribute majorly to the plot, and all just cross the line between probability and unlikeliness. Critics have softened their accusations with the fact the Ms. Bronte believed in her coincidences, and had likely seen them happen.As a writer, Ms. Bronte is an virtuoso. She uses nearly every tool of the trade: extensive foreshadowing, including prophetic dreams, false suspects, symbolism, effective tense shifting, character analysis from a single point of view, and so much more. It is no surprise that the manuscript of Jane Eyre was accepted and published overnight, and became an immediate success. It is still a success a century and a half later, and as fresh and tangible as it always was. Reading Jane Eyre is an experience you cannot deprive yourself of. I would begin today."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a beautifully written masterpiece! Bronte uses eloquent language to convey a timeless love story. The book was moving and profound, and I thouroughly loved it. I suggest it to everyone. It is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I carried this book around with me after I finished readingit convincing others to read it as well. I wanted everyone Iknew to experience the joy I felt while reading this trueclassic. It is a lush, romantic, facinating mystery that younever want to end! If you say &quot;I read that in high school&quot;I urge you to read it again - this time by choice - and Iassure you, you'll be as swept away as I was!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"At first glance, this book seems like the story of a lower class woman winning the heart of a rich and of a higher tier man. However, there is much more to the book than just a passionate romance. In addition it has been linked to have influenced Henry James, the author of The Turn of the Screw, also about a governess falling in love, but with some messed up consequences... sorry for the tangent. Anyways, Jane Eyre really is good, as Charlotte Bronte mixes Gothic elements with romance and focuses on a dynamic character who undergoes a bildungsroman and matures at the end of the book.Set in London, England, a stereotypical place for love, Charlotte does well in establishing the imagery of the fire between Mr. Rochester and Jane. She constantly uses colors to set the mood and uses it to set off feelings. Mainly, she appeals to our sense of cold and hot, to paint Jane's emotions, it is wonderfully aesthetic and should be a good read to those who enjoys language.Not only is her plot above average, and her literary devices superior, she is able to meld the two together flawlessly for those who love to read for storyline and those who enjoy a good analysis on what they read. By now one should get the tone from me that Jane Eyre is not your average romance novel. It is more than that. It also speaks of moral responsibility. This centers around the two protagonists love, as Rochester is still married, and kept it hidden. When Jane finds out, she is caught in a dilemma between her principles and her feelings. Unable to figure out a compromise she runs away. Only when Rochester redeems himself by trying to rescue his wife from a fire is he then able to prove to Jane that he has changed and is a candidate for her love. Conveniently, his wife dies in the fire, and Rochester is left crippled, but not permanently. This represents his forgiveness; he has repented for his sins and is now able to be married. The story ends with their marriage and Jane Eyre's epilogue.Charlotte Bronte is a very good author, able to appeal to both kinds of readers. With her brilliant use of figurative language, making Jane's decisions seem ever more desperate, and diction, which contributes to the overall gothic mood of terror, most readers will be enchanted by her work. However, it is also this aspect that makes the book lack it's wow factor, because it appeals to both, it does has to divide it's attention between plot and device.I would recommend this to anyone who has not read the book yet, so what are you waiting for?

Charlotte Bronte has written a fabulous book and I recommend it to everyone who likes to challenge themselves with a great novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I admit, it took me about 2 weeks to read this book, but it was good. Jane is a very defined character, and although some of what happens is unlikely to the point of being almost unrealistic, it seemed to make sense.The only complaint I have is that I felt, many times, like I needed a French dictionary at my side. When Jane talks to Adele, and occasionally other people, it is usually in French, with no translation whatsoever.But since it was written in a time when most educated people took French, what can you expect?I would suggest publishers put footnotes with translations. The French is not, perhaps, very important to the story line (not that I would know), but it really bothered me to have no idea what they were saying."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I was a little apprehensive to read this book at first because it was written in the 19th century, and I speculated that it would not be an easy read. I figured that I would give it a try though, and I am glad that I did. Jane Eyre is the best book I have ever read.It is a love story, but not in the typical sense of traditional romances. It incorporates an actual plot line as to how two characters fall in love over a long period of time and follows through the depths of despair and joy. The twisting of conflicts and happiness throughout the story leave the reader laughing and crying, and never being able to predict an outcome.Jane Eyre has a well-developed plot that includes rounded characters whom the reader comes to identify with. Bronte's heroine, Jane, (who also narrates the book) is a believable character because she is not exceedingly intellectual, she is not beautiful, she is not wealthy, yet she is autonomous and strong-willed, unlike Jane Austen's heroines (i.e. Emma Woodhouse), who are invariably the opposite. Although Jane is simple and modest, her life is full of constant suffering. She is easy to like because of these characteristics, just as some of the other characters are easy not to like because of their own unique characteristics.Bronte highlights certain aspects in this novel that people of the 19th century went through and experienced through the depiction of Jane's own life: being poverty-stricken, being orphaned, being unwanted, being plain, or being driven insane with the unattainable. This book not only gives the reader a deeper sense of the past, but also allows him to empathize for people that lived in it, and therefore to empathize with Jane.Each time I read Jane Eyre I cry over and over again. It is a fantastic piece of work that should be read by everyone. Truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have read it twice, and I LOVE IT!!! I admit it is slow in the beginning, but it quickly speeds up and you can't put it down! Charlotte Bronte is my FAVORITE author!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I think I've read Jane Eyre three or four times, and the more I look at it the more I appreciate how amazing it is. Often I can't be bothered to start a new book, and I can just pick J E up and read it from any point.I don't understand how Charlotte Bronte could have written so much and had power in almost every sentence. Classics are hard to get into, and maybe the first chapter was slow but at the same time ghostly.I picked out few faults and though I'm an inexperienced school girl I haven't read many more books which were so intense, an yet somehow managed to keep the reader on tenterhooks.How real life her writing is, but at the same time supernatural. For me, Jane Eyre is a living person and she always will be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In short, Jane Eyre is the story of a fairly unconventional life. Jane is orpahned when she is young and sent to live with her Aunt Reed, to a horrible &quot;school&quot;, then to work as a governess at Edward Rochester's home. She falls in love with Mr. Rochester but his secrets may make it imposible for them to ever be together.The book has a really slow, melodic feel to it, so if you like fast reads, it is not the book you're looking for.This is one of the best books I have ever read, so good its one of few that I have actually read several times over. Definately a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful and captivating book. Once you start it you just gotta finish it!The best part of Jane Eyre (pronounced \\"air\\") is the love story between Jane and Edward, her employer. Edward keeps a dark secret , the nature of which isn't telegraphed but instead thrust upon the reader all at once (very well done!!!), that makes him both penurious and tragic. This makes him a somewhat odd match for Jane who is the epitome of virtue and is self denying. The cat and mouse play in the begining of their relationship, the way they individually struggle after the secret is revealed, and the ultimate resolution of their love story makes this one of the greatest novels in Engish literature.This brings me to the movie. It isn't a very good adaptation of the book. Major parts of the plot are missing or altered beyond recognition and signifigance. I watched the movie AFTER I read the book and was glad I did it in that order. Their are some stories that just have to be read in order for you to enjoy them;Jane Eyre is one of them (David Copperfield is another). But that's o.k., Charlotte Bronte has provided us with a tale that mesmerizes and impacts its reader like few others can. If it comes down to the movie or the book...read the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I recently finished Jane Erye and I couldn't bear the thought of there not being more of it to read. At first I thought it was strange that Jane could fall in love with such a cold, hard man. But then it turned out that he had a certain charm and gentleness that was buried deep inside him, not to show its face until Jane uncovered it. I think a big reason that some people don't like this book is because they expect Jane to fall in love with a handsome, obviously charming man. But that kind of romance is done too often in literary works, and eventually it loses its effect. In his own suttle way, Mr. Rochester is Prince Charming, though it takes time and patience to see. The book has a slow start, but stick with it. I've seen two movie versions of this story already, and it's a shame to put the title Jane Eyre on them. They are great stories in themselves, of course, but they hardly do the book justice. I'm 14 years old now, and in a few years I plan to read this book again, in hopes of getting more out of it than I already have."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a thrilling romance novel. Set in England in the 1800s, this novel tells of the life of Jane Eyre. Jane is an orphan left in the care of her aunt, Mrs. Reed. At Gateshead, the Reed's estate, she lives a life of solitude and hate, mistreated and misunderstood by all. At the age of ten, she is sent to grim Lowood school, a reformatory school for orphans. Her years at Lowood are gloomy and dull, and she has few friends. When she is 18, she advertises as a governess, and finds a job at Thornfield Hall. Thornfield is all she ever wanted; there she is happy and loved, until a twist of fate and a long kept secret find her once more in peril. This novel is very romantic and heart warming. Charlotte Bronte has a knack for making her characters and situations seem real. At times I felt as though I were right there with Jane, sharing her hopes and dreams. I found this book to be interesting and fun to read, although at times it became drawn out. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance novels with wonderful characters, settings, and situations."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and a novice towards 19th century British lit. I've never read an Austen and I cannot compair this book to Wuthering Heights (as I have never read that one either). I can only offer my less than expert opinion.This book was very enjoyable, at times. Until Mr. Rochester shows up, however, the book is very slow. The heroine grows on you quickly, so it makes the reading more fun. Jane is likeable, and I certainly cared more and more about her as the book progressed. I liked how blunt she could be at times and how stubborn. She displayed a great deal of strengh and determination, in a tough world, without the gifts of beauty and fortune. Jane has to make it on her own steam, and I think that a lot of modern girls could learn from her example.The story line with Mr. Rochester's crazy wife is a bit random, but very interesting none-the-less, and it added a layer of mystery to the plot.The ending of this book irked me the most, however, because (without giving it away) everything sort of falls into place. This bugged me because, up until then, Jane had to overcome issues and, in the end, her happiness was more or less handed to her.My one other complaint is that dear Jane Eyre likes to ramble about God and life and whatever else she sees fit to ramble about. It is dull dull dull, as the young girl muses on and on in her own head and we have to sit through it.I still very much liked the book though, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting little romance with an awesome heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The Brontes were a family of brilliant minds; Charlotte was the most brilliant among them (so beat me up, Emily fans), and Jane Eyre is far and away her masterpiece. I have imagined Handel laying down his quill after penning the final note of the Hallelujah Chorus, reading it over, and exclaiming aloud, \\"Whoa--where did THAT come from?\\" Jane Eyre is the same type of work. The tricks and seams and recycled gimmicks on which artists rely to connect pieces of greatness are absent here. The novel seems unedited, unreviewed, untouched--uncreated, like Jack's beanstalk that just sprang up overnight.That Charlotte Bronte was a genius in the field of human psychology is best proved by the facts that she was a desperate 20-something daughter of a country parson, she craved love (and sex) and excitement and had none, yet she wrote a novel of moral self-denial that remains satisfying to people who have long since kissed their 20's good-bye--people who have, perhaps, denied themselves very little. Without having had the opportunity to kick up her heels (much less participated in the 12-Step program to bring her down to earth), she understood in advance the processes of temptation, restraint, remorse, and rejuvenation.The first 2/3 of the book concerns temptation. It is the Hollywood part of the work, and the section that most appealed to me as an adolescent. Without the final third, however, the novel is another dopey Cinderella story--Maid in England, maybe: nice ordinary girl somehow attracts the attention of prince, great happiness ensues, no one learns anything, close curtain. (The really interesting psychology in these Cinderella stories, if you ask me, is that of the Prince--what's he looking for under those rags and foreign accents? Who's he pissed off at in Prince-land?) To an adult reader, Jane Eyre is monumental because of the struggle through hardship and denial to a less perfect (but, of course, more perfect) happiness at the end. While Jane's moral quandry takes place within the limits of a 19th century British system of Christian ethics, there is surprisingly little hellfire involved. After all, to Bronte, the daughter of a parson, the answer to Jane Eyre's dilemma could have been a simpleminded, \\"It's wrong, don't do it--just get on with it!\\" just as the answer to modern western readers is, \\"It's wrong but fun--just do it!\\"This book is even great in Italian, which is how I reread it--and I'm not sure Italian even has words for restraint and self-denial.Jane Eyre should not be assigned reading for most teenagers, however, and it frequently is. I can't even imagine the torture it would be for that large percent of teenage boys who are just not interested in the human heart; there is very little action in it--it's purely character analysis. (\\"Ghostly happenings\\" occur now and then, but probably not enough to hold the interest of most modern kids.) On the other hand, some first-time adult readers might put it down early, finding the opening 2/3 of the book somewhat ridiculous--there are some broad character portraits, a plot that seems to be heading down that Cinderella path, and a pretty unbelievable series of events leading to the crisis. So, I'm going to recommend this book to people exactly like me: Girls, read it first in your early teenage years and keep it in the back of your brain; then, every 10 or 15 years, as you pass through another stage of life, pick it up again. There's more in there, believe me--even in a foreign tongue!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This classic novel tells the tale of an orphaned, moneyless girl named Jane Eyre.

After years of being emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins she was finally allowed to go to school. However going to school didn't improve her standard of living much. Jane began to feel that there was something else out there for her so she took a job as governess at Thornfield Hall. Everything was going well until she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester.Jane Eyre is one of my absolute favorite books. I just really love all the characters and the dramatic plot twists. A lot of people who read this book just think it's a romance novel. While it is true that Romance plays a large part, the book is much more than just your run of the mill romance. People who are able to get the \`just a romance novel' idea out of their heads will see that the book is more about a woman trying to find a better life against great odds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre may seem at first to be a boring 19th century novel, but in truth it is a fantastically rich book. There are so many great aspects in the novel. The characters are developed very well. Even though the author was limited in her knowledge because as a woman she was limited with education, each of the characters is portrayed well enough that he/she becomes real in the reader's mind. Interestingly, but not surprisingly, the women characters are more developed and are more various than the men characters. The men in the book are shown to use women and they are not as diverse, but they are still interesting and realistic. Another great aspect is how well the author intertwined themes of social and financial classes, feminism, and faith and philosophy. Some of the ideas are easy to see without having to think about them, such as how money creates the biggest separation of classes. However, some of the philosophical ideas in the book are much deeper and harder to see and comprehend. The ideas are also not from our time period and are, therefore, harder for us to understand than they were for the readers of the author's time period. For example, the idea of how nature protects us and watches over us to make sure the right things happen to us at the right time is a intricate and remarkable concept.Jane Eyre does have one major flaw, though, and that is the plot. It is an interesting plot and easy to understand, but it is too much like a fairytale. Everything works out almost too perfectly, and seems to be coincidental. The plot helps the theme of how nature makes sure things happen, but it is too planned out. One almost expects to see the all too typical line, \\"And they lived happily ever after\\" at the end of the book. This flaw with the plot would only be seen by readers of our time because we are use to reading books with multifaceted plots, whereas in the time the book was written, people were happy just to read such a developed novel. Even with this flaw, still, it is a great book. While Jane Eyre won't go on my favorites list to read again and again, it was definitely a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Set in England of the 1600's Jane Eyre's life story is told through her own perspective, aging throughout the novel. Her thoughts and feelings from early childhood through where she is in life writing the book are told with a grace that comes only from life experience. Jane Eyre is from the time of her earliest memories an orphan. In this book she finds love, acceptance, and herself. Charlotte Bronte's talent for bringing out all sides of a character is shown well in this book, she leaves nothing to be desired as far as rounding out her characters. Such characters as Mr. Rochester who first shows Jane true love, Mrs. Fairfax who helps her to understand her equality to others, and Adele Varens who helps her remember childlike wonder as she goes through her life changing experiences, all play a part in Jane coming into herself. This book is an inspiration and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.Attention was drawn to the dramatic separation of the classes during the time the book was set it. Jane Eyre is an orphan, and therefore frowned upon by all as a dependent and a burden, almost no one expects her to do anything valuable with her life. This remearkable young woman pushed for the right to be sent to school, then ater her graduation stayed on as a teacher, after a mentor and only tie to the school left she advertised herself out as a governess. This was by no uncertain terms a grand achievement for someone born of such a position in the world. Although a governess was not the highest position during her time, she made due with the job and eventually found another window of opportunity. She fell in love with the master of the house and was asked for her hand in marriage. Certain events delay this already unseemly arrangement before true happiness is found.Many readers and critics alike have compared this story very closely to Cinderella. The plots are similar, however, they are not quite the same. Jane Eyre, born an orphan, falls in love with her version of &quot;Prince Charming,&quot; coming to her in the form of an employer. This idea of romance found in hte most unlikely of places with the most unattainable of people is a common thread through many modern works. This kind of fairy tale is appealing to a broad audience and almost any age. However, the level of reading that Jane Eyre is written for would suggest an age group of 12 through adults.This novel left me both uplifted and very impressed with the style of writing that Chalotte Bronte has. The novel's use of separation in social classes to cause a stir and engage the reader's attention to the romance of Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is brilliant. Most people would say that the book is a basic take off of the age old tale of Cinderella, but in all actuality it is a beautifully mastered knowledge of the romantic ideals of many young women. I would remcommend this book to the age group of 12 through adults, this novel is also geared mainly towards women, although it would be a wonderful read for those men in the world who have a taste for this genre. Over all the book was a success, a literary masterpiece that has forever more left it's mark on our society as a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've never been a reader but I joined a book club and this was the book of the month. I was very sure that I would never be able to read one of the classics and that I would be bored to tears. To my delight and surprise, this novel far surpassed any expectations I ever had. I was hooked from the beginning and looked for any opportunity to get away to read the book. It is not a fast read as the language was a big difficult at times but I learned to overlook the things that weren't so important to me and get on with the story. I have read two more classics since this novel and although Jane Eyre was my favorite, I am now a full fledged reading junkie."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Austen wrote the romantic stories. Dickens did the rags-to-riches heartwarmers. Mary Shelley added the supernatural, haunting yet human Frankenstein. Bronte's Jane Eyre pulls elements from all of these works and ends up... something entirely, refreshingly different.What's really great about this book is that it is so rich. The plot moves and moves well, making it an enjoyable and propelling read. While it is mostly romantic-love interest based, it is not as sappy or predictable as, say, Pride and Prejudice. Jane's journey to marital bliss is a bit more pock-marked -- and even drawn into question -- than in most romantic comedies. I enjoyed the fact that, indeed, she questions whether she even wants to marry or should marry -- and refuses to marry, not once but twice, because doing so would compromise who she is.Which brings me to the real reason I like this book and consider it a cut above most. Jane herself is so interesting. She is a very complex character, and the author has clearly taken much time and energy to draw in fine detail the map of her psychosis. This book is re-readable because there is so much to contemplate and reflect on within this finely drawn character. Is she afraid of happiness? Tied to duty? Was it right, or misguided, to leave Mr. Rochester? If it was right, were here intentions right? Was it right to return to him? What changes that allows her to refuse St. John, and return to Rochester?I think Ms. Bronte did us a great favor with this book. She took familiar ground and tweaked it -- taking the romantic comedy formula, so mastered by Austen and Thackeray, in which the tension entirely surrounds marriage, the meeting and mating of two people, and the point of the novel is resolved when the marriage(s) occur. Working within that framework, Bronte brings us a character novel -- in which the tension is only resolved once the character has found a way to be fully who she is, and thus happy and fulfilled. Surely this work broke ground for some of my very favorite works, in which plot becomes a somewhat secondary consideration and the eccentricities of character, the stuff of humans, becomes the focus and point of the novel.

She meets a cynical, odd man named Edward Rochester. His ward, Adele is a delight and quite charming. Almost like a Bonnie Butler. At Thornfield (Rochester's home) secrets unfold and hurt is contagious. A true masterpiece of English literature written by a great author. A book that will not soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charolette Bronte grew up in a world which did not accept woman authors. As she had great afflictions in achieving her dreams as a published writer, so did Jane Eyre in finding happiness in a cruel word. Jane Eyre is a novel which one must read to experience its emotional power. Jane's life was full of unhappiness from birth, she finally finds love with Mr. Rochester. I cried like a baby when Jane was torn between Mr. Rochester and her values, and intended to leave. Then again, I cried in Tarzan so I'm more emotional than most.

It was extremely difficult to get through the book because not only was the plot an absolute bore, the characters also contributed to that boredom.After reading the book twice, trying to comprehend what was the point of the story, I still have yet to understand why Charlotte Bront even bothered writing this book. From what I can interpret, Jane Eyre is a girl who is lonely and dejected but finds love in a man called Mr. Rochester. Everything that happened in the middle is not significant. The story is extremely boring because it is too sentimental, too dull (just like Jane Eyre), and too long for a story with that plot line. What the characters say or do have no lasting effect in the reader's memory- it just blows right by. The characters are basic and have superficial, unoriginal motives. They do not do anything exciting or significant to help add to the plot. I kept skipping pages or rereading the same stuff because each and every page seems identical content-wise. The entire book has absolutely no memorable moments, proving how insignificant the work of literature truly is. Reading the book is a world of pain.If you are thinking about picking up this book and reading, save yourself the time and money, and go read something else worthwhile."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Reading this book was about as pleasant as a throwing knife to the face. I am going to be a senior in high school next year, and I just finished this book for my summer assignments for AP Literature. I literally took a victory lap around my house upon completion. I HATED this book. It was boring and rather pointless. No one cares about the romantic struggles of a fake character. This is basically the chick flick of books. I honestly believe this is the worst book I've ever read. I encourage everyone with a Y chromosome to stay as far away from this book as possible.By the way, this is Rebecca's son, which explains my disgust for this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped. The plot with St. John seemed uterally meaningless to me.This is one of my least favourite books-- there was no substance, no overwhelming theme. Nothing to be learned from this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have to read this for my summer assignment, its due in 3 days, but Im not gonna read it...why? it looks dry as hell...so my advice? dont read it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This has to be one of the most rediculous books I have ever decided to read. The is no relevancy to anything, the character may have been an influecial person in the 1800's but not now. Sure read this book, but only if you a really intrested in romantic novels of the 1800's."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have reread this book countless times, starting after I first discovered it as a teen. It is a masterful piece of storytelling and the classic romance novel. I hope purists aren't offended by that classification, but Bronte's novel has all the traditional elements of a romance novel -- the meet, the attraction, the obstacles, the Black Moment, the reunion, the HEA (happily ever after) -- wrapped in beautiful writing and characterizations.Although this book has been popular through the ages, it seems to fall in the shadow of the other Jane today. That is, the author Jane Austen, whose works are told and retold in every conceivable way. I sometimes wonder if Austen gets a lot of glory today because she is perceived as a more intellectual read while EYRE is a big, fat, juicy Gothic romance. So unfair if that is true. Bronte's story is clever and intelligent, but also passionate and emotional.If anyone's interested, I've written a book inspired by JANE EYRE but set in old Hollywood.

I know that whoever reads this book will definitely enjoy it like I did.- Review by Johanna"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A story that never grows old despite being firmly set in Victorian England. Jane is a wonderful character, an ordinary plain girl/woman with spirit and dignity.

This book shows a wide range of human experience. I do not think that Jane has to prove anything simply because she is &#34;plain&#34;. I also don't think that Charlotte Bronte had anything to prove. She was a woman who earned her merit as a writer because she was good at it.

I wanted someone to love me like that one day!I love how she was able to stand up for herself to Mrs. Reed her cruel aunt, the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, her self-righteous and controlling cousin St. John, and even her beloved Mr. Rochester when he would have her go against her moral fiber.It was wonderful to learn more about Charlotte and her life and how much shows up in her novel.

Susan Ericksen narrates the audio book and the listening experience was something I looked forward to on my daily commute. The narrator had an excellent speaking voice and sounded just like what I would have expected from Jane Eyre. Her characterizations of the other characters were not as dramatic as I would have liked, though she did a good job with the \`master'. I'm getting used to good characterizations since it makes it easier to follow who is speaking. Overall, I would rate the audio book at 4.5 stars instead of 5 due to the characterization issue.The story itself is wonderful. The main characters are very likeable despite their flaws. It's fun to see the main characters be rather homely instead of amazingly good looking as is common in many novels. It is a beautiful love story and shows strong integrity in Jane. In these days it is good to see this type of values in the heroines and heroes of the story.I highly recommend this audio book.

Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator (Josephine Bailey) was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S.

My only complaint would be that sometimes the book dragged in parts. However, it was still a pleasure to read. Jane is a admirable heroine and I loved everything about her. I truly cared about what happened to her which I haven't been able to do with books I've read. Rochester's and Jane's love was deep and pure and I loved watching them go through the process of falling in love. It wasn't an OMG-I-don't-know-anything-about-you-but-I-love-you-like-crazy thing that I've been reading lately. It was slow but sure and so very sweet. Their difference in age was strange to me at first, but as time went on I found myself not caring. Love really knows no bounds.I love this book. It is definitely near the top of my favorite books.

I never knew what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is Charlotte Bronte's first novel, published under the pen name of Currer Bell. Jane Eyre, orphaned at a very young age, suffers at the hands of her aunt and cousins when her maternal uncle dies. At the age of ten, she is sent to a charity boarding school, where her life is also filled with privation until an outbreak of typhus exposes the austere measures imposed by the manager of the school. At the age of eighteen, she leaves the school to become a governess to Mr Edward Fairfax Rochester's ward, Ad&egrave;le. Here, Jane seems to find happiness: beneath Mr Rochester's moody exterior, there appears to be kindness and perhaps even love? But further events may destroy her chance at happiness.The use of words that seem to be nowadays obsolete, such as: unclose (doors etc); undraw (curtains); undeceive; benignant; show how much can change in a language in a mere 200 years.

I just wanted Jane to go away. I wanted it resolved, but quickly. I was becoming quickly agitated and annoyed. But still, as angered as I was towards the ending (by the way, I didn't care for the deal with the Rivers family at all), the beginning was so majestic I just couldn't insult it too much.

Bronte wonderfully describes the inner voice of Jane which Jane instinctually values from a young age. It leads her to take extraordinary emotional risks.

But as I read on and got used to the book and fully grasped its meaning, I found that this was one of the best classics I had ever read! (And I am a BIG classics fan.) JANE EYRE made me shed a great many tears and touched me deeply. I am so glad I bought this book! I highly recommend this to all!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel, especially they way Charlotte Bronte captivates you with her vivid descrptions. She makes you feel like you are right there next to her experiencing everything she was experiencing. I also loved the whole romance part of it. How Jane never knew her love for Mr. Rochester was so strong until she left him. But then she came to her senses and went back to look for him. She still loved him as much as she did before, even when he was half blind, poor, and only had one hand. That's what you call true love. I love how Jane is such a courageous women to handle so many tribulations in her life. She never gave up and kept on living her life. I think Jane Eyre is an American Heroine for all young women."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's writing is poetical and her characters are well developed.

I read this book for the first time while I was an 8th grader. I did only read it as a romance novel then. When I read it again for my paper, I experienced a paradigm shift. My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text. I think this book is an excellent classic and anyone who thinks different does not appreciate classic romantics. I think Bronte did an excellent job and hope that she knows that there are people who appreciate all of her hard work.

It is impossible not to identify with Jane Eyre, she is orphaned, poor and plain, but she develops a great love for Mr Rochester, her employer.."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book in junior high school and, like so many other girls, fell head over heels in love with Mr. Rochester; after all this time, the book is still a terrific read. The first part is classic Cinderella with an interesting twist. Jane is an orphan who is abused and mistreated by her rich and evil stepmother and her nasty cousins; unlike Cinderella, Jane stands up age age 10 and fights back. She is promptly shunted off to a school for girls from poor families, where she spends the next eight years. Needing a change of scene and environment, she answers an advertisement for a governess and enters the household of Mr. Rochester. Rochester, however, is no Prince Charming; he's 17 or 18 years older than Jane, hard, bitter, cynical, selfish, and, unknown to all but a few, encumbered with a wife who is the prototype of the \\"mad wife in the attic\\". Rochester is a romantic at heart, however; he is captivated by Jane's innocence and simplicity.Many years' distance from junior high school has led me to re-think the entire creation of Mr. Rochester. When all is said and done, he's a very curious romantic hero. In fact, this guy is a world-class jerk. What kind of \\"hero\\" would deliberately try to trap an innocent young girl into a sham marriage? He makes all kinds of rationalizations to himself that his Maker will understand and approve of what he's doing, but come on, now, who is he kidding? Imagine an alternative plot line midway through the book: Jane doesn't write to her uncle in Madeira, so he remains ignorant of the planned wedding. He doesn't send anyone to England to prevent it, so the wedding goes off as scheduled. Five years and two or three children later, Jane finds out about Rochester's first marriage. Can you imagine how she would feel? Her marriage is a sham and her children are illegitimate. What would she say? How would she react? And how would Mr. Rochester feel knowing he had brought this calamity on her by his own selfishness? I don't know about war, but all is definitely not fair in love. Mr. Rochester is a selfish ess-oh-bee.Anyway, the alternative never happened an we all know how the book really comes out so there is no sense in rehashing the plot; suffice to say that Bronte is a marvelous storyteller. The one problem I really have with Jane Eyre is the same that arises in Bronte's other books, and that is her stifling insularity; she seems unable to find value in anything that outside her own narrow, English Protestant frame of reference. However, this is a small caveat in this book. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic romantic novel that has entranced generations of readers and looks good for generations to come, flawed hero and all.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; when I was entering my sophomore year in high school. I was so fascinated by the beautiful language, expressing the love between Jane and Edward Rochester. I love Edward so much, because he is human. He is depressed with his life, and wishes for another. He searched for another, taking any and every risk he needs to...even adultery or bigamy. His love for Jane is deep and real, as is her love for him. This classic hasn't lost it's details, details about hope, love, and dreams, in the some 150 years since it's been published. I still enjoy it, even after reading it about 100 times!!~ I consider it the greatest love story ever written.....a story that defies the stuffy rules and regulations of 19th century England. It just shows that love can be more powerful than anything. With that, I give this story 5 stars....only wishing I could give it all the stars in the world. Why? Because it deserves that!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Come along all you romance readers and enjoy the best love story by the greatest writer of all time.

But when I got older, and could read at my own pace and place, the book is one of the best mysteries ever written. I can't imagine going to a horrible school like Lowood, but perhaps that was preferable to living with her Aunt Reed, a most disagreeable person even unto her death. I cried when she and Mr. Rochester could not get married because of the 'house secret'. She seemed to have such a hard life anyway, that was icing on the cake, or de-icing if you will. The book flowed smoothly and I even managed to get past the 'true English'. I've always had trouble reading English writers, but Charlotte Bronte is an exceptional writer. I like when she addresses her audience, &#34;Reader, you would not believe this but...&#34;, etc. As I said it's a great mystery, and autobiography, but I don't want to say more to spoil the story! Chance it to say, if you've only read the book because, 'you had to', read it again in a new light. I'm taking all of the books I read in my English classes that were 'necessary to read', and giving them a second go-round.

Never had to at school, like so many people I know, so I had a totally open mind. I love Wuthering Heights, by sister Emily, and I was sort of expecting something of the same calibre. Maybe it is because Jane Eyre is more from the romance genre... I am not so sure. I certainly don't think that Charlotte's writing is anything near her sister's. I also find that there are two stories in Jane Eyre - the main one with Mr Rochester, and the second one with St Johns, and I found them slightly disjointed.

I certainly thought that it was very good. The main character is not like any other heroine which I can think of. She was not beautiful like most, nor extremely cunning. Somehow Bronte manages to develop her personality perfectly, and gets you to like this Jane Eyre, though she is probably the only one in the story who you will like. Bronte makes all of the other characters extremely one sided in their personalities, all dominated by a fatal flaw of some type (the domineering spirit of Mr. Rochester, the extreme sacrafice of emotion by Saint John, the extreme simplicity of Mrs. Fairfax, etc.) This was both good (in that it helps one to see that nearly any character trait can be taken too far and become bad) and bad (the characters were rather stiff somehow).The only other complaint that I have is that it was a bit long and drawn out. Somehow it should have been about 50 pages shorter, though I am not quite sure where the 50 pages should be cut from.

Her mixed life mingles between feeling sorry for her orphaned self and trying to be a romantic wife to Mr. Rochester. The novel, Jane Eyre, is an excellent work of Charlotte Bront not only because of the work itself, but because it is a relation to herself as an autobiography. Charlotte Bront was not that much different than the main character, Jane Eyre, in that they both lived without parents and they both know what loss can be like. The book flows eloquently from start to finish and contains many life morals concerning pride, love, and what it takes to live in this world.

This was the very first classic novel that I ever read in English. As I needed that for an exam, and didn't have enough knowledge for reading the original I was supposed to read an abridged version. And so I did. And I loved the book.Years later, I decided to read the real thing, the original novel. Much to my surprised it turned out to be highly accessible, and as entertaining and a nice read as the abridged version. Moreover, in the original book I could find all the details, and were able to savor Charlotte Bront's language.Written more than 150 years ago, \`Jane Eyre' reads as fresh as a XXI Century novel. Bront's use of language is vivid and remarkable. Her descriptions bring the book into life. We cannot forget that the book is the social portrait of the women in the writer's society. It shows how they struggled --and failed most of the time-- to reach a respectable position in the society.Jane didn't have any attractive that was required in her time. She wasn't rich or even beautiful, although smart. But smartness wasn't a good thing for a woman in those days. She is even punished for having brains. She ends up being a governess, and end up having a humiliating experience, being forced to change places and even name. Ms Eyre is only noticed when she receives a heritage and becomes rich. And she does not let all she has suffered affect her.\`Jane Eyre' is a novel ahead its time. This book is about feminism much before the term was created. When Jane speaks to her aunt about her rights --can you imagine a girl speaking about her rights in that time-- she is doing what other women would do years later. Charlotte Bront has managed to creat a strong and sad girl, who is trying to find her place in the world. With that, the writer made a book that will be read for generations to come --even if they read an abridged version before reading the unabridged book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book, like my title says, was hard for me to put down. I just became so inthralled in the book and its characters.You become, early on, compassionate to Jane's pain, hopeful with Jane's encounter with Mr. Rochester, afraid for her when she meets with a ghastly face, and so on and so forth.At times I almost didn't want Jane with Mr. Rochester, but in the end he won me over. Their love is unique, it was very nurturing and longing, but love nonetheless.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story with a little suspense all throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have read this book several times, on differentoccasions, and ech time I've enjoyed it immensely.This is one of those classic stories that will stay with youforever. It appears simple on the surface, but underneath itare well-thought out passages.Bronte is a superb artist, weaving her two main characters, each suffering in their life, into a tapestry of love. Each so different from each other, yet each needing the otherdesparately.I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"First of all, I would just like to say that Jane Eyre is most likely a good book for all those bookworms out there. I am postive that you will not be disappointed with this book if you like classical and dramatic novels. Yes, the novel may seem to be a little long, but it keeps you interested and guessing to the very end. Don't get me wrong, it is not some book that is a mystery. Although, the end is very unpredictable and I had no idea which path Jane Eyre was going to take.When I opened the first few pages of this book, I must admit that I was questioning whether or not this was going to bea dull and drab story. It seemed as though this might be a challenging book to be able to finish. Although, after some questioning, the plot took a turn for the better. The story really started to pick up as I began to enter the life of the orphan, Jane Eyre. The uninteresting beginning was well worth reading because the story was really good.This story begins with Jane Eyre living with her mean Aunt Reed and cruel cousins. She goes through awful torments like being locked up in a dark room all night. The beginning of the story kind of reminded me of the enchanting story of Cinderella. Jane is then sent off to school all alone in the world to become a well-educated lady. She thinks she begins to find happiness there, but some awful things happened. She then goes to Thornfield Hall to try to be a teacher. She actually ends up falling in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. Jane once again begins to feel that everything is going well and that she actually might have found true happiness. Jane and Mr. Rochester are then about to be married when an awful secret is revealed about Mr. Rochester. Jane then has to figure out whether to stay with her one and only true love or just move on to a different life and forget that all of this happened. Jane then does take a small journey away from Thornfield to find out where to go from there.I found that this book contained mystery, drama, romance, andeverything else a person could ask for in a book. This book is the type of book that you would want to take and curl up in bed and just keeping reading it to the very end. There was great detail about the life that Jane Eyre and all the feeling she felt were revealed to the reader. I seemed to really be part of the story and sometimes forgot where I was. There were also some amazing twists in the story that kept me guessing about who did that or why is that women so suspicious. There was also many characters that kept the story alive and interesting. Although, once and awhile it did seem as though the story was confusing. Things were being said and I was not quite sure who was saying them and places I was not quite sure what was going on. Although, with some of this negativism, everything else made up for it. All and all, it was a really good book. For me, it seems to reflect back on today's life. All Jane was doing was trying to find acceptence, love, and happiness. It seems at this day an age, that all people are trying to do is find true love and someone to be there. For this reason, I think that many of you would really love this book and read it. The novel is well worth the reading. I am sure that once you began the story that you will just want to keep reading it to find out if Jane really does find what she is looking for and if she finds true happiness. Now it is you turn to go to your library and check out this great classical novel that you are just going to love.The grade I would give this book would be about a low grade A because sometimes it was confusing. Highly recommended for people who like drama and romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Reading Jane Eyre for the first time, I was engulfed in the novel itself: the characters, the plot, and the setting completely draw the reader's attention and make it difficult to put down. The second time, I read it slower, paying special attention to the characterization, something Charlotte Bronte is terrific at, and the various details that I may have overlooked originally, but which add to the general enjoyment of the novel. The third time, I read Jane Eyre for the language - Bronte's style is captivating: every word, every sentence has a beauty within it that a reader wouldn't want to miss. I read it, again and again, because her words made everything seem new and exciting no matter how often I read them. The explicit descriptions, the prolonged narration, the time she takes to develop the charaters - everything creates a novel that one can read over and over. This truly classic work of literature appeals to so many different emotions and strikes the fancy of probably anyone who can appreciate great writing."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A love story that will never change.

Mr. Rochester, a sardonic, bitter man, accepts Jane as governess to his ward; from there their feelings begin to develop for each other. Mr. Rochester is not the conventional hero (one might even imagine him to be an ugly man), which makes the tale more believable (and thankfully steers it away from bodice-ripping romantic territory).All in all, this is a great book with the usual plot twists, reversals, and character revelations one would expect from its genre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"After reading this story, I feel safe and sound, a large genuine feeling. Because this story is so sweet, not only from the love story of Eyre and Rochester is delightfully fresh, also I learn a lot from Eyre, she is strong, brave, independence, honest and friendly, I think she is a public notice of nowsday's women.Eyre is a orphan whrn she was a child, but she never give up herself, I think many of Hong Kong people must study from her strong and face to their life, after reading this book, they might have some encouragement.The most touching part of the story is the love story.I think it is wonderful! Eyre and Rochester have many of wave, althrough their love is not allow from those common people and Eyre once wanted to give up her love, but Rochester still love her deeply, I feel thouched after reading this book.This book tell us what the true love is, I have learn a lot from it and I really love it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Why I waited until I was middle-aged to start reading the classics, I'll never know, but I'm glad that I did. When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Jane Eyre. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I went between applauding Jane's high morals and commitment to yelling at her for being such a doormat.As I was reading the story, I asked my husband, \\"Was it really like this in Europe back then? Super rich people and super poor people and no in between?\\" It makes for a good story of a girl thrown into a charitable facility/orphanage, going out on her own, falling in love, and staying true to her feelings. The ending was warm and fuzzy.The gist of the story is girl gets abused, sent to an orphanage, succeeds as a teacher and when she turns 18 ventures out to be a governess, falls in love, is gilted, ventures out again, finds relatives, and then . . . well, I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's a good read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I decided to read the book after seeing the 1996 movie version. I heard that the 2011 rendition was great and I wanted to have more insight before reading it. After seeing the movie and loving it, I didn't think the book could get any better.The book starts out with Jane Eyre in her youth. She lives with her aunt and cousins. Unlike families should be, they mistreat her and are abusive to her. Her aunt, claiming that she is a wicked child, sends her to a catholic school. If you thought things were going to get better, you thought wrong. She is still mistreated and shunned by the residents of the school. Jane Eyre grows to be a woman of strong opinions and independence. In adulthood she does not grow to be a woman that is handsome, in fact she is very plain. But she believes that intellect and personality are what really make a person. When she advertises as a governess, she is immediately answered. She arrives at her place of occupation and begins well enough. There are strange things that occur in the house however, for instance, strange laughing and disappearance of objects. It's troubling, but she hardly minds it. After some time, Jane begins to become closer to the master of the house, Mr. Rochester. He's mysterious and different. But in the end, will it be for nothing?The narration and the way the character conducts herself is what really makes this such an incredible read. It's a very unique style in which the book is written. The words are very fluid and it wasn't at all a difficult read. I was stunned with the beauty of the book and how much I loved the book. I have no criticisms for it. I very rarely have no criticisms for a book, but this is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When I was in high school I did anything possible to keep from reading the \\"classics\\" even though my Mom loves the Bronte sisters books. On a recommendation from a friend I decided to get the Kindle version and read it. I couldn't put it down and called my Mom and told her she was right, I should have read these in high school.So, now I'm working on reading some classics between reading newer material!I loved this so much that I ended up buying a soft cover version to add to my library.I would highly recommend this to any of my friends..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I think I read this book during middle school or high school but it left a much deeper mark reading it as an adult. Jane's character is inspiring and refreshing in today's world where strong female role models are scant. I so enjoyed following Jane's journey into adulthood, and took away much from her self-reliance and integrity. This is now easily one of my favorite books, because of the wonderful characters and the eloquent writing (The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is another of my favorite books, for the same reasons)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is a classic for a reason. It is still studied in schools across the world for a reason. Because it's a true work of genius. I cannot say anything about it which hasn't been said already. I just wish when kids read it for the first time, they would truly grasp how very ahead of their time Jane Eyre (and Charlotte Bronte) were. The romantic in me was just spellbound by the intensity of Rochester and Jane's love for one another. A thought that repeatedly crossed my mind was \\"Has anyone ever loved anybody the way Rochester loves Jane?\\" If you read it as a teen, go back and read it with adult eyes. I found I appreciated it in a whole new way. I cannot recommend it highly enough and would heartily give it 10 stars if I could. I am off to find the movie version now..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"AS I said in my title this book has almost been reviewed to its extent and its a wonderful read for any age. I know a few guys that will not admit to it but have read it also. It shows a book that has been loved throughout every generation and will never go out of style, it truly is a classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read Wuthering Heights in high school and loved it, but never read any more of the Bronte sisters. Now in my 40's, I've been going back and reading many of the classics that i was too \\"busy\\" (read - Partying) to bother with. I just finished Jane Eyre last night, and was sad it ended. I'd seen the movie not long ago with Cirran Hinds and it was really good. Although, now that I've read the book, the movie doesn't do it justice, they left out much of Jane's experience at the school and at Gateshead. This is a MUST read for all classic literature lovers!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It was my first time reading this classic and truly loved this book. The first quarter of the book was a little slow to get into. Afterwards, I could not put the book down. Jane and Mr. Rochester's love story is one of the best from the classics. The climax and the final reveal are certainly worth the hundreds of pages. We can learn from Jane's journey from an orphan girl to an independent woman even today in the 21st century. Definitely not a Cinderella story but that's probably what makes it so great to read. Highly recommended to all readers!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Had a hard day at school? Read Jane Eyre. Boss a little cranky? Read Jane Eyre. Life confusing? Read Jane Eyre. Want to explore the weird noises on the third floor...uh...read Jane Eyre. There is not a better book out there. I love modern thrillers, courtroom stuff and chick lit. I love old meloramas, spy novels and Hemingway but this is the best--EVER.Jane and Mr. Rochester and Adele and Pilot and Mrs Fairfax and Bertha and Helen are all so very amazing and still so wonderfully penned. This book doesnt fade, the magic doesnt get dated, the story is never old, and oh my goodness--I STILL hate her aunt and Mr. Brocklehurst."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"\\"I need not sell my soul to buy bliss\\"Jane Eyre is an orphan, raised by her aunt, until one day, she is sent to a horrible school. Eventually, she leaves this school and is employed by the mysterious Mr. Rochester, to care for his ward, Adele. Jane finds herself growing more fond of the man...and more curious about the mysterious circumstances surrounding his home.I have just finished listening to this audiobook, and I am still trying to pick my jaw up from the floor. WOW, just WOW. This was a positively amazing experience, a thrill and a joy, a pleasure from beginning to end. I haven't had this enjoyable a time listening to a historical/classic/romance novel since...well, \\"Gone with the Wind\\"! From characters to plot to story to setting, everything was a joy to unfold, and while I knew somewhat how the story would go, I was still thrown for loops and wondered if Jane would ever get her happily ever after.From the beginning, I knew Jane was interesting and different. She may have been plain, but she was relatively well behaved, curious, and intelligent. Throughout the entire book, Jane grows and develops as a person. She pushes for her own destiny and does not let others tell her what to do--and in her day and age, that is remarkable. She puts up with her cousins until self-respect tells her not to. She begs to be put into school away from her relatives. She deals with the hardships of school, knowing things would be worse in her adoptive home. She is studious, becoming a teacher, and when she learns she can make more money being a governess, she leaves her job. While working for Mr. Rochester, she never forgets her pupil, she remains cordial and appropriate in front of Mr. Rochester, and when she is called back to her aunt's side, she gives the dying woman forgiveness. When Jane learns of Mr. Rochester's secret, she doesn't succumb to what she sees as sin, but leaves even though it could mean starvation and hard work. When Rev. Rivers tries to coerce her into going with him to India, she refuses to accept his temrs and presents her own. Time and again, Jane proves to be independent, smart, and moral--something many a modern protagonist that supposedly is these things could take a lesson in.Our secondary characters are painted with equal care and detail. Jane's aunt and cousins are horrible, and they grow up to be horrible people (well, sort of). I grieved when Helen died; I fell in love with Mr. Rochester alongside Jane; I was devastated at his secret; I loved being with Mary and Diana; I bristled at Rev. Rivers' cold attitude. All in all, the cast is well-crafted and enjoyable.I knew the big secret of the story before hand, but I didn't know how or if Jane ever got to be with her beloved Mr. Rochester. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, wondering how Bronte would pull it off. I was shocked at what happened to Mr. Rochester's manor AND Mr. Rochester. Most authors nowadays wouldn't DARE damage their major characters so permanently and so obviously!The descriptions are long and sometimes laborious, though it paints Jane's surroundings beautifully. I also found myself getting bored in the last third (where Jane hangs out with Diana and Mary) and found some of the circumstances of that part to be a bit hokey (no spoilers!). Also, apologies in advance, but the narrator was particularly bland and almost sounded like those automated computer voices you get when calling your bank or Fedex or some other big business. Her voice was clear and precise, but had almost no emotion and was very dry. A few hours of listening to that voice drained me.This book is excellent, much better, in my opinion, than Charlotte's sister's book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\", which seemed more of a study on how not to fall in love . This is a real, true romance story with real, true obstacles populated with real, true characters. I definitely enjoyed it and recommend it highly.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It was a truly captivating novel. Never expected theending. Jane gives us a full account of who and what she was and hasbecome."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is full of mystery and romance. I have never read anything like it before. It really captivated me.Jane Eyre is true to what she knows is right, no matter how hard the consequences may be. She is poor and plain, yet she doesn't use that as an excuse to live with the man she loves in an improper relationship. She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect. She gives up everything to do what she knows is right, and in the end, she is rewarded in unexpected ways. I will not tell you more because I don't want to spoil it for you.Despite the lessons in this book, it is not moralistic and preachy. It is very well written, and a very enjoyable read. I would recommend it to anyone. I wish I had read it as a teenager!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of my all time favorites. I couldn't put it down. If you like period pieces you will love this one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I heard this as a play when I was 4, and searched the school library for a copy at age 9, much to the Rev Mothers disapproval. I Loved it, and still do. This book has everything mystery, romance, and loads of passion. No wonder the Victorians disapproved."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Yes this book can and is confusing but just like you can't judge a book by it's cover you can't judge a book by it's first five pages. The text is hard and there are confuseing words but the book has such a strong message and good plot that no one should go without reading it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I loved Jane Eyre with all my heart! Jane is such a wonderful person and a great role model. The love between Jane and Rochester surpasses all boundaries, especially the physical, and I only wish that everyone could love and be loved as the two main characters in this novel did. I will always cherish Jane Eyre as the beautiful story that it is."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I was required to read this novel in high school and fell in love with it immediately. The in depth detail and descriptions leave the reader with a great mental image. The emotional descriptions sweep the reader away to feel all of the joy and pain Jane Eyre experiences. It's not just a wonderfully captivating love story; it's a story of an interesting woman's interesting life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte (1816-1855), is a tale of mystery, passion, and perseverence. The novel follows the life of the fictional Jane Eyre, an orphan from birth, as she progresses from a student, teacher, governess, to finally, a wife. Some of the events Jane experiences are based on Bronte's own life. Bronte began writing Jane Eyre in 1846. It was an immediate and thorough success upon publication in 1847. The writing is enthralling, touching, and artful. The reader cannot help but become involved and interested in the compelling story of Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the epitome of independence and success. Living in the nineteenth century was difficult for everyone, especially women. The conformity of their situation is shown by the author, Charlotte Bronte by the school Jane goes to. Despite the rigid life she was forced to endure, Jane started a life of her own. She faced many conflicts and difficulties in life. Fortunately, she fought and won the battle to realease the invisible bonds society placed on her. This was intriguing and well written. Though more applicable to females, both sexes will enjoy the underlying theme."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a romantic and exciting novel. However, charlotte is able to convey the feminist issue that plague all women in the 1800s and for many more centuries to come. Although, i gave this book three stars it was only because after i read the book for the second time did i get the whole idea that charllotte was trying to bring out. I think that if you read this book donot read because it is asigned to in school. Read it because you have some free time to devote to the book and then you will get the idea of the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I love this book. I probably first read it when I was 15. Since then I read it 3 or 4 times and each time I could't put book away until very late at night. Certainly my favorite love story. I would say that this book is more for younger ladies and I am not expecting too many young man to read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"There's no need for me to retell the contents of this book here - it's a classic and most of us have read it before. I'm here to express my admiration and love for this book. I've read it more times than I can possibly remember. It is most definitely one of my favorites. It contains one of the most well-known love stories and one of the most well known coming-of-age stories of all time. Cannot be missed! If you skipped reading this in school or have simply forgotten what the talented miss Bronte wrote then I highly recommend reading this and (re)introducing yourself to the story that has inspired millions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I can't believe how long it took me to pick this book up and read it. It was never on any assigned reading lists and it wasn't until a few years after college, when I had more time for pleasure reading, that I started on the unassigned classics that I had missed by having a science-based major. It is one of my top five favorite books and absolutely my favorite classic, topping even Pride and Prejudice (which I also love). It has rich, well-written characters, terrific heroine and hero, and contains both tragedy and ultimately, happiness.
