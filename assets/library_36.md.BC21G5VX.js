I just need to look at the cover to get shivers down my spine. Lord of the Flies is a horrifying piece of fiction about how cruel, hideous, even, no, especially, murderous a group of boys could become, left deserted on a desert island with no one to trust but each other, no resourses but the island, and no adults in sight. This is not a flurry little kid's book with a morel about a happy band of friends and their adventures on a desert island. It is about young boys with real feelings, real emotions, real fears. It is about a bullying scenario that goes majorly overboard. And it is about choices, which is more important, to be safe or to insure the safety of others, to follow the crowd of bullying, brutal persons, or to stand up, even if standing up could cost you your life.In &lt;Lord of the Flies>, as I've already said, a large number of boys end up on a desert island after a plane crash. You never find out where or why they were going, which leaves it free for you to imagine. Ralf, a determined boy, though by no means perfect as he has the tendensy to bully a fat boy whom he christened 'Piggy', takes leadership. At first all goes well, apart from squabbles over leadership with Jack, a tyranising boy with a thirst to kill. Then the boys decide to light a fire to attract the attention of boats on the ocean that could rescue them and one boy of about five years disapeers. Was he burned to death by the uncontrolable fire? He was never found. It only went down-hill from there. All of the boys but Simon, my favourite character, refused to help make shelters. Jack and his choirboys went on mad hunts in the hopes to catch a wild pig. When they finally did they impaled its head on a stick and began to worship it. Simon could hear it talk to him and slowly began to go insane. The younger children were afraid of a 'monster' which one is lead to believe was really a lost, dying parachuter. That's when the total choas and brutality of the boys imerges. They divide into two groups, Jack's and Ralph's. Jack's group steals Piggie's glasses to create imense fires. They sharpen spears for the kill and create death machines out of boulders. And their target is Ralph.Lord of the Flies will haunt you with its beautiful writing, disturbing plot, and terrible reality until the end. When I finished it I was sobbing. But if you are ready to step into a rolercoaster ride of fear, wildness, and action, step aboard."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We've just recently read this book at my middle school some of my classmates and I found this book to be unappealing. I thought it was actually a boring book even considering all of the violence. In my opinion, Golding picked a subject for each chapter and dwelt on it. I thought that this was a slow-moving book. Also the way he wrote things was kind of \\"beating around the bush.\\" So my advice to you is if you do not have to read this book, don't."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The simple, yet thrilling message of William Golding's epic tale,\\"Lord of the Flies\\" reminds us of the real savages inside all human beings.

Jack, another important character in this book who has lost the election to be leader agrees to meetings notified with the conch shell which now has a hole in in it to blow and make a signal.But as time passes the boys by real instinct kick in to answer the question \\" How and what will you do to survive your stayon the island?\\". By which then the boys split into two groups. Hunters, who live for the excitement in their lives to bring food and feed themselves to survive. Or the cilvilized boys who will keep trying to keep calm with hope of being rescued. Which will you decide to join?Lord of the Flies is a suspensful novel with the reckonization of your real behavior. In this situation, the novel test you with mini- situations the boys go through enough to ask yourself, \\"What would've I done?\\". With an unexpected ending to all events to book also with it's expected events this book is reccommended for ages 12+.

These are just a few thingd those boys had to deal with. Watching them struggle, seeing what they would do just to survive, just reading these words that William Golding wrote with such intentsity,taught me many things about life as well as myself that no one else could.The way the book Lord of the Flies was written is extremely amazing!!! Golding has so much talent, hardly anyone can compete. Out of all his good writting qualities, I believe that allusion and symbolism are the best. It's just how he finds ways to expressthe charectos anger and frustration, relating them to biblical allusions is truly amazing.you just never know what to expect. On page could be filled with life and happinessand the next could be up to the top with death and misery.I believe Golding wrote this novel to warn us that evolution is not what it seems to be. There is some one living in us all, in the deepest, darkest corner of our minds called anger. Otherwise known as the beast. He is trying to tell us that we never what to expect. We don't even know what lies ahead. He is trying to tell us expect to unexpected. The future is a dark and distant thing.In critiquing the book, first I would add a little more detail.Maybe adding a little more conflict between Jack and Ralph might interest the reader to continue,instead of tossing the book aside. Secondly I would change the ending around. Gosh! How could it end that way. Ssssshhhhh, I can't tell you anymore, okay?You will just have to read it to find out what happens.It is byfare the best book I have read in my life!! I give it five flies( flies are equivelent to stars).I would like to congradulate William Golding in writting this book that has touched us and has chnged my life and hopefully yours too forever."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\", is about a group of young children, stranded on an uninhabited island, who are forced to create their own civilization and survive. The novel, while somewhat predictable and easy to understand, is filled with many important uses of symbolism. In the opening, Piggy finds a conch shell, and uses it to bring order to the group, and the conch shell continues to symbolize order throughout the novel. However, when Piggy is killed later on in the novel, the conch shell is destroyed also, symbolizing the end of order. The 'Lord of the Flies', a severed pig's head, symbolizes the cruelty and brutality that the members of Jack's group possess. Throughout the novel, there are many parallels that are made between the boy's civilization on the island, and civilization as a whole. This novel is easy to read right through and not fully understand its entire purpose, but I believe William Golding's purpose for this novel is to provide an understanding of the evils of civilization and government."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the FliesBy: William GoldingReviewed by D. WangP.5Lord of the Flies is a story about of boys who crash on a unhabited island. There are no adults to control the boys, and they are free to do as they please. Ralph emerges as a natural leader, and Piggy is the intellectual with a disdain for physical work. Jack, leader of a choir, is another boy who disputes Ralph's society and becomes leader of the hunters. Slowly, the other boys all join Jack. A conch is found early on and is used to restore order at assemblies, but soon Jack ignores it and all the rules the Ralph has. Jack tribe is also composed of the &quot;littluns&quot; who see a &quot;beast&quot;. Eventually, two will fall forever, and Jack's tribe will degenerate substantially, killing pigs and making offerings to the &quot;beast&quot;.William Golding described this book as attempt to trace the defects of society to the defects of individuals. This book relies heavily on symbolism, and whether likes or not depends on this point. I personally liked this book because of how it shows we degenerate. Jack and his tribe degenerate rapidly into savages. It is ironic when Jack says early in the book, &quot;We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything. So we've got to do the right things.&quot; Later in the book he is sitting on a log like an idol and finds unexplainable pleasure in torturing and killing a pig.The degeneration of the boys can be easily compared to the degeneration of society. As a race, humans have destroyed places, eliminated far more species than any known organism, and spend much time killing each other. Events such as the tortures and procedure of the Inquisition, the Holocaust, the dozens of wars and border skirmishes, and some cultures' entertainment. At times, killing is perfectly acceptable, even encouraged. The degeneration of the boys, at their young age (the oldest is twelve) is unsettling. Their change can be compared to our behavior and defects.My favorite part of the book is chapters three and four, the former being &quot;Huts On the Beach&quot; and the latter &quot;Painted Faces and Long Hair&quot;. You can see the boys reject society, playing and trying to hunt pigs instead of build shelters. In chapter four, a ship passes by, but Jack's tribe lets the fire go out because they are too preocupied with killing a pig. Jack's tribe starts the habit of their violent chant of &quot;Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood.&quot; Jack's savage side can be seen when &quot;He took a step, and able at last to hit someone, stuck his fist into Piggy's stomach.&quot; He continues, striking Piggy's head and breaking half of his spectacles. This book is an attempt to find our faults, and a grim reminder of what &quot;civilized&quot; people can do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I pretty much gave up on becoming a novelist after I read this book, just as I gave up on playing the guitar after listening to Eric Clapton.Golding's microcosm of humanity and its base nature is a far-flung island populated by refugee children. And it's his very use of children as main characters that makes the story so chilling. Their mixture of innocence and brutality proves lethal. The final chapter is as thrilling as anything I've ever seen on a movie screen.Largely thanks to \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" Golding won the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 1983. The only problem I have with the book is that it has obscured Golding's other novels, which confirm him as one of the \\"heavyweights.\\"Kids, you are forced to read this book in school because it is one of true masterpieces of literature, but you probably won't appreciate how great it is until you're my age. So I suggest you come back to it when you're forty-something. Then you'll realize that things like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and the Harry Potter tomes are nice enough but just don't endure."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As I read through the reviews for Lord of the Flies, I noticedthat some people really hated it, but the people whom hated it arealso the ones that read it in school and are very young. The first time I was supposed to read it in school, I did not take it seriously and in fact hated it as well, but later when I had to read it again in another school, I loved it. The difference was I was older and ready to learn and I feel it was a great book.

But I read it and I enjoyed it. It wasn't my favorite book in the world, but it was well worth the read.

If they would be serious about the book whan they read it, they might find a little more meaning."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;'I don't like it.''As true as it may be?''Yes.'&quot;Thus was the course of a &quot;conversation&quot; with a laconic English teacher, Who ended it abruptly with that final &quot;yes.&quot; Why? What is the stigma attached to this book that some many are disturbed to the point that they would shun it as Huckleberry Finn (though that's another story)? It provides perhaps the most verisimilar (and concomitantly terrifying) inscape into the innate nature of human beings. Author of this masterpiece, Richard Golding, a Nobel Laureate, advocates atavism, expounding that people are perhaps intrinsically imperfect and moreover dangerous. The veneer of English etiquette and polite mores eroded in attrition, a group of boys stranded in a plane crash devolve, their true truculence evinced, the primal potential of all manifest in their actions.^M Furthermore Golding masterully implements symbolism on many levels, handling mutliple allegories within the macrocosm of the world and the microcosm of the island, and yet He hews this imminent, immanent, threatening eminent imbroglio into a wonderful web of fantastic connections, so that all is one. There is no superfluity in this work. All is essential, all is exigent, and all is effective, entirely unfettered from tautology, redundance, or any kind of pretention (which is far more than can be said of this deplorable &quot;review&quot;). Rarely live such authors of Golding's caliber. Even less often is such an important, demanding novel produced. Reading it is requisite, particularly if We remain blind enough to ignore its painfully blatant manifestation in reality, today, yesterday, and fearfully tomorrow.

In the story, Ralph, Piggy, Sam n Eric, Simon, and many other boys are stranded on an island by a plane crash during World War III. All adults are killed in the crash, leaving the boys alone, and unsure of what to do. At first, the boys enjoy a seeming utopia in their 'new world' but soon find that the thin veneer of humanity wears away very quickly. Ralph assumes leadership, and struggles to protect his 'tribe' from internal contention and help the younger children of the group to rid their fear of the &quot;beasties&quot; that plauge them. Each boy, from the analogical point of view, plays a part of a miniature world in their new society. Through their interactions and reactions, we see how conformity, complascence, and love work together. Soon though, after the chivalry is quenched with the ritual murdering of the Christ-figure, Simon, dissension occurs that leads the boys to break into two groups. Then the boys engage in fierce battles and huntings of each other to wipe out the other group. More killings ensue, and finally, the appearance of a ship on the island, and the captain on the beach shows what the boys are...merely boys with sticks and stones, as if it was all a game.All in all, Golding uses the microcosm to his advantage by utilizing Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs. That man must first secure food, air, and shelter before he can find safetly and love respectively. Once, however, the availablity of food and shelter declines, Golding shows us how quickly chivalry in society can deteriorate, leaving our bestial selves showing through the translucent outer covering of kindness and unselfishness.

The boys get stranded after their airplane crashed as a result of war-time efforts to bring down European planes during World War II .The struggle for the boy's survival on the island is bound by their friendship and their willingness to work together so that they may make their stay on the island as pleasant as possible. They work together to build shelter and find food. Unfortunately not all of the boys feel that they should cooperate. As soon as the rules were set, a group of rebels took it upon themselves to be outcasts of the group and start up their own clan, which was named the hunters.Although some points of the story are set moderately slow, the storyline is still very good. Most of the adolescents are longing to get off of the island, although some of them like it there. The names of the seven adolescent boys are Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Simon, Sam, Eric, and Roger. Ralph is a twelve year old with blonde hair. Ralph is probably the most charismatic in the group. Another character is Jack who is about Ralph's age, but he has a much skinnier build. Jack is a power-hungry, savage-like, irresponsible child. The next character in the novel is Piggy. He's short and has a high intelligence compared to the other boys. Simon is an intelligent and sensible, and he hopes that he will be rescued off of the island sooner than the other boys. After Simon, there's Roger, a small boy with dirty, shaggy hair. Roger represnts pure evil, even more so even than Jack. Finally, Sam and Eric are two young twins who always travel and do everything together. Without each other, they are incapable of doing very much at all.Although times were hard, the boys pulled through and were rescued off of the island. They were picked up by a Navy cruiser, and brought out to sea with the ship. I feel that the end of the novel shows war on different scales. On the island the boys were battling with the hunters and the beast. On the cruise ship, the boys will see firsthand fighting between soldiers on the Navy cruiser against battling countries during World War ll. I felt that this novel had an excellent story-line with plenty of fun, excitement, and would be an enjoyable reading experience for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think Lord of the Flies has to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life (and i've read quite a few!)

Piggy and Ralph are the two voices of reason. After the brutal death of Piggy, Ralph is isolated and has to use his wits just to survive. The novel can be read on several levels.

He also fails to mention if Sam and Eric are identical twins or not. The first 5 or 6 chapters aren't all that great, and I don't really get why he calls it THE LORD OF THE FLIES, all that much.

After reading this book and then being stranded on an island, the book could be a good source. It could help you out and give you ideas when stranded. There was one part that made the book exciting: this was when the conch was used at the beginning of the book. It had started the group off smoothly and basically ended group stiuations smoothly too. Without the conch, not as much success would have been accomplished. The conch had symbolized teamwork and togetherness.

The story starts out seeming like a story that these kids are just going to live on an island until freed. Things become a lot more different in that the boys seem to be organized into a group that becomes uncivilized. Also shows that some kids do care and want things to be successful like Piggy. Near the end of the book, violence takes place. This point of the stroy I liked, because in a way it turned the story around in that they had more problems then just disorganization. The way this book just all tied together was so great, and was interesting. There aren't many books out there that have an ending so rough and everything else so exciting, but this one did.

This narrative technique is used to give a significance to certain people or objects, which represent some other figure. There are many other aspects in the story that may be considered symbolism, but the several above are probably the most significant. Another good example of symbolism, brought to my attention by a site visitor, is the shape of the island. The boat shape of the island is an ancient symbol of civilization. The water current around the island seems to be &quot;flowing backwards,&quot; giving the subtle impression that civilization may be going backwards for the island or its inhabitants. Additionally, another reader pointed out that Jack could also represent Communism or Fascism.

My critique of this book is also a bit of advice I offer to the teachers of our youth. Don't go half-way with this book. Golding has done an astouding job depicting the seed of evil that has been planted in every human being since the Garden of Eden slip up. Tell the children who the Lord of the Flies is. But, be careful... This is a very serious book that could have a positive or negative impact on a child. I'm sure that the movie KIDS (written by Harmony Korine) would never be shown in a high school classroom, but really, this book and that movie drive at the same ideas. I'm only asking teachers and administrators to keep this in mind when they decide to make Golding a part of their curriculum, because it would be a perversion of classic literature to water down Golding's dark portrayal of human nature...."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a novel that could have only been written in the 20th century, the century of unparalleled horrors in which humanity can no longer delude itself with the optimistic ideas of progress that so entranced the 19th century. As to the young people who are forced to read this for classes I would say please read this book again in twenty years' time; trust me, your opinion will be different then. This is a book about children, but it is not a book for children and your teachers do not seem to grasp the difference."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was required reading for my advanced language arts class.

If you are bored with it then you should stick with it because the ending is fantastic!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is as critically important today as when it was first published. A brilliant novel that deserves to be read as soon as a young adult can comprehend its prose (hopefully, by age 12), the novel commands the attention of readers of all ages. It should be on every student's reading list, and every adult's, as well."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was an excellent book.It was about a group of boys that were stranded on an island after a plane crash.They faced many interesting problems while stranded until one day someone rescued them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We read this book in my seventh grade advanced English class last year, and I hated it. The story is this: a group of English schoolboys get shipwrecked on an island, and eventually go crazy and kill each other. It was just evil. The one boy, Ralph, who is the &quot;main character&quot; of the book, has very few faithful followers. His rival, Jack, has a much larger group of followers - and they think there is a &quot;beast&quot; on the island. To lure it (to try to capture it), they kill a pig and put its head on a stick. This becomes the &quot;Lord&quot; of the flies, because so many flies crawl in and out of its disgusting, dead eyes (or holes where the eyes WERE), nose, and mouth. I couldn't believe this book when I read it, and no one on earth could persuade me to read it again. Ewww."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I believe that the author's purpose in the &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book. I wouldn't have used such large discriptive words But &quot; The Lord of the Flies&quot; was a good book and I would recommend it to my friends or anyone looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the authors purpose for writing this book, was to show that people can't survive in peace without rules. I agree with the message because in the story you see results of rules not properly enforced and broken rules. The literary element the author handled the best was symbolism. I agree because he had so much symbolism and it made the most sense to me. This was and wasn't believable. I would have made the story better by not being so cruel to the boys with good intentions. I probably would have killed Jack and Roger instead of Simon and Piggy. In conclusion, I think the book was good, but I would recommend it to mature readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's message is that with out rules, chaos and savagery would occur. I agree with this message because children left unattended have no one to prevent them from doing wrong, no authority. I like the characters and the plot that the author created. It really helps display the author's message of life without rules: everyone would run wild. The book was believable because the children really acted like children would act with out any adults. Although the novel had an excellent begining and middle, the ending was in one word, stupid. I didn't understand it either. The end seemed like he didn't spend much time on writing it and rushed. If he wouldn't have rushed, the ending would have been clearer."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author's message in this book was to open the eyes, and reveal how evil can appear in anyone. I agree with his message because it's true: evil can appear where ever it wants to. Just look at those school shootings, they unfortunately prove my point. I think he did the characters very descriptively. He is psychoanalyzing every main character in the entire book. It was very believable. I could imagine a news report saying about a couple of boys found on a burning island. About changing the book, I think it should stay the way it is. Some parts are very confusing, but it should stay the way it is. Some parts are important and confusing, but they need to stay because they are important and changing them could change the entire &quot;lot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's purpose for writing Lord Of The Flies was to show mankind at its worst and how human nature can go wrong. Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing that everyone has good in them, too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and each one represented a different aspect of human nature: Ralph was leadership, Piggy was intelligence , Simon was spirituality , Jack was dictatorship , Roger was evil and Samneric represented the fact that everyone needs someone to help them function. Lord of the Flies was a little unbelievable in the plot aspect of the book. Twelve year olds wouldn't believe in democracy. Also the whole island seemed kind of unreal and fake like it was just a backdrop. I think the plot was less than perfect and could have been developed a little more. All in all, I would give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding is an exquisite writer. He uses symbolism to describe the fact that there is evil in everyone. He also uses symbolism to describe fear and anger. He provokes the mind to think that they are in the story by using descriptions. Although some aspects of this book were unbelievable, it could happen. I personally see only two flaws in the book. The first being that everything needs to be more innnocent in the beginning so that when drastic changes come they are extremely drastic. The second being that the book goes very slowly, almost too slowly. However, overall it was an excellent book. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the author's purpose for writing this book was to tell how to survive in the world/forest without adult supervision. I agree, because the boys would have needed to learn how to survive without supervision sooner or later in their lifetime. In this book I think that the author used climax best, because it got extremely intense as it got closer to the end of the book. I liked the intenseness in the book a lot. This book was believable to me. It was believable because the events that took place, really could have happened. The only thing that could not have taken place was that an airplane was attacked, than crashed and no adults survived any of it. I also think that the book was less than perfect. It was good writing and good reading. I rate this book fair."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What my teacher does is she'll have us read a book and then if there's a movie version she allows us to view it. i actually hated until the last page. it was touching though when the soldier came at the end. although people made fine it a boring ang intolerable read, i thought the movie was fabulous, and since i was with two of my friends at the time, i had fun."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is by far one of the most greatest books I have ever read. It starts out fine and dandy, but then some of the boys (such as Jack an co.) start to lose it. In the end, two boys die, very horibbly. This is a gruesome book, as the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a pig's head on a stick. Simon had a very creepy &quot;interview&quot; with the pig's head. The smaller boys (or &quot;littluns&quot; as the big boys say it) keep talking about &quot;the beast&quot;, a gruesome ententity that lurks wherever the boys are not looking. This turns out to be in fact a dead man that floated down with a prachute, hence the name &quot;Beast from air&quot;. I recommend this book for people of horror."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this book in 7th grade, for English class. I don't understand why some other teenagers don't appreciate this book. It really is a great book, with well-established themes. The downward spiral these boys take really draws you into the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A truly revolutionary book for its time. Well written, especially along the lines that the theme forced us to read even when the plot sagged. Not quite on the level of Huxley or Orwell, but could work as a wonderful prelude to those authors. As some of the precedent reviews have noted, it can be at times very dry. I also was forced to read it, but was glad that I was."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a great book. Full of adventure. You will love it.

This book is very original and I recognize other authors who have drawn inspiration off of Golding's book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked this book, however it was confusing to start, I got used to reading it as I went along. I think it explains how society was made, it starts with people, they make rules and form an economy, there are leaders and followers, the ones that think and ones that work, then something happens and society falls apart. It is intersting to see how a group of boys can go from being so orderly to turning so savage. This has a lot of suspense in it, lots of detail, and a feeing of 'this could happen'. A good book no doubt, short, and simple."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is evident that many high school students do not appreciate the artistry and terrible truths that Golding has demonstrated in this Ballatyne novel. I, for one, a normal 13 year old, highly recommend this book for all readers. The story line is intricately weaved together to form a tragic, provocative, yet beautifully written novel. The story revolves around a a group of marooned English schoolboys. It follows their struggle to maintain order and it allows the reader to reflect on the state of man kind. I am a school student and give this compelling novel and thumbs up! Buy this book and you too will be spellbound by one of the most celebrated of all modern novels."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Have you ever wondered how people would behave if they were stranded on an island? Would their personalities and mind-sets change? &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; helps readers see how people change when they have no rules and no structure in life. When a group of boys is stranded on an island, they learn who their friends are and how to survive from those that aren't.William Golding makes readers realize how cruel kids can be to each other and when they are on there own, in a sense, become like animals. The boys start by working together but end up splitting into two groups, therefore becoming enemies. The foil between characters enlightens the reader to realize the difference between the personalities of the boys. The boys' situations connect with their personalities and their sense of friendship and magnify their need for survival."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Rings, Lord of Chaos--two of my favorite fantasy novels. Lord of The Flies--a nigh-perfect book. You can see it on three levels: adventure story, character study, or a political level, and it has something for everybody. It isn't for the faint of heart, definitely, but it is still an incredible book. If you don't read this book, you're missing out on one of the most amazingly symbolic, wonderfully written books of all time--even more so because of the simple narrative. My favorite scene was the part with Simon and the pig's head--but let's not spoil anything for you! Pick it up and read it! It's a quick read and you won't regret it unless you still cringe everytime you see Saving Private Ryan... OK, maybe even then, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Just as Conrad's work &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; does, Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; reveals to the reader the human soul's tendency to change to the primordial or primitive self. I think that Golding's use of children as the main characters in the novel is helpful in conveying this message. The children's refusal to follow Ralph stems from the nature of children, in that they found no excitement or satisfaction from following him and his rules. Ralph's maturity resembled that of grown-ups, which children revolt against. On the other hand, Jack's group offered as an incentive more childish excitement in paiting themselves, hunting and ceremonies. We, as the reader, can see the children's folly in following Jack, but they are unable to think rationally due to their immature natures and new-found freedoms. Using children, Golding tries to symbolize the essential qualities in every human's soul and reveal something to the reader about him or herself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like many readers, I first heard about this book in an L.A course in school. I chose to read it for a novel project. The title of the book made me curious as to what it was really about. The first couple of chapters are boring and confusing, so you'll probably have your doubts about it being a good book. As you read on, you'll begin to understand what has happened and you'll agree how William Golding's symbolic meanings are awesome. The ending of the is best and I'm glad I read it. You'll be too! It's definately a five star book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"one of the all time greats. this book is so haunting, and horribly ugly at times, you will feel filthy reading it. some of the actions that the characters do, are startling, but you will find yourself thinking that if you were in the same situation, what would you do? it will challenge all of your misconceptions about this book and others like it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A group of boys crash onto a deserted island without the supervision of adults. They quickly begin to form their own governments. One of the boys, Jack, represents a tyrannical dictator, who rules by the emotional responses he gets from the other boys. He also rules by charisma and fear. Instead of devoting his energy to attempts of rescue, Jack prefers hunting and killing the wild pigs that also live on the island. Ralph, on the other hand, represents a less effective, yet good-hearted democratic leader. Slowly, his group of boys is swayed away from him by Jack's fun-loving wild clan. The climax of the book begins when Jack feels Ralph is a true threat to him, and orders his boys to hunt, and kill him. Finally, just before he would have been captured, Ralph is rescued by a group of sailors who were attracted to the island by a fire Jack had set to smoke Ralph out of hiding, and he is saved. This book really is interesting if you delve into the proposed psychological implications about our political society that Golding is making. If you just want to read it as an exciting novel it is good too, though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a good and well-written book which I came to know while reading Stephen King's Hearts In Atlantis. The ending was great, not telling us what happened five years later, not too revealing, leaving the story up to ourselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This wonderful description of the real things that kids (any body) will resort to when lost in the world. This truly was a batle for athority over the &quot;flies.&quot; The children in this book tuched me in a way that I felt non other book had. I had to re-read this book several times, the sadness, wildness, freeness, and true compasion expland in this book made me want to reach into the book and help the lost souls rapped in the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I liked the book Lord of the Flies because of everything that went on. The book is very believable in that you can get stranded in an island during the middle of the war. Also because of the different themes in the book. The author handled writing symbolism best, because you can understand each character. For example, Simon is a symbol for spirtuality. And Piggy is a symbol for reason. I think the author's purpose for writing this book is to show how you can lose your innocence. I agree with the authors message. Although the book was great, the book was less than perfect in that it had too much drastic description about the killing of the pigs."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of those books that would have been written whether Golding had done it or not. And it is one of the best books you could ever choose to read. Note what other people on this site are finding wrong with the book: it's boring, it's not exciting until the end--one reviewer hadn't even finished the book. Be advised: thrillers don't win Nobel prizes for literature. Many people fail to understand: this book is not a thriller written before it was cool. People with a grain of human intelligence will see this book for what it really is: a thundering moral masterwork. Golding explains that the sum moral state of any human community cannot exceed the moral state of its weakest member; a bad apple spoils the lot. The symbolism--from the beast to the Lord of the Flies himself--is breathtaking, and the final irony of the ending so perfect that, when you finally understand the significance of it, you'll laugh ruefully. If you like books for the right reasons, you'll love Lord of the Flies.And finally, to clear up a small point, the title doesn't derive from a misinterpretation of the Hebrew word for &quot;devil.&quot; The Hebrew word &quot;Beezlebub,&quot; which occasionally is assigned to the devil, means, literally translated, &quot;the lord of the flies.&quot; There you have it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"There are many things that I liked about this book. First and foremost, it is very well written. Golding can convey the mood of a scene very well. His extensive vocabulary allows each sentence to flow perfectly. It's a quick read, but the message in the book is very profound. Overall, it is a very interesting, powerful story.There are a few things that I did not like about the book. It was very depressing. My favorite character dies a gruesome death. It's basicly a story about children killing each other. The way he wrote it, Golding makes it sound like war is unavoidable. It made me sad.At first, I thought that the ending was completely wierd. I turned the last page in shock, waiting for more, but was dissappointed.Considering the things that I don't like about the book, I would not change a single thing. None of my classmates liked this book, but I actually did. It's not like I am a morbid person; I just think that the message is important. I probaby wouldn't like it if my class didn't force me to see all the symbolism. Now that I understand everything in it, I can appreciate the book. I would reccomend this book to someone who likes reading between the lines. I like symbolism; I think it's interesting."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read Lord of the Flies in my english class, many years ago. I would have to say that this wasn't my favorite book, but it had some interesting outlooks on life. I read it again recently and I noticed it hadn't lost any of its attraction. His bleak view of human nature helps to make sure it's more then just a casual reading book. It is a work of literature that demands analysis and connections."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the most influential and important novels ever penned, \`Lord of the Flies' may be even more poignant today then when it was initially released. Telling a very realistic and moving story set in a very unrealistic backdrop \`Lord of the Flies' works on almost every level of literature to provide the reader with an all around emotionally gripping experience, and one they won't soon forget.As a plane carrying a group of young children is shot down during warfare the valuable cargo is spread out over an uninhabited island. The boys quickly must for their own civilization with only a sliver of hope to ever be found. The story mainly focuses around three very different boys. Ralph is the chosen leader, a boy who possesses common sense and an open mind. Piggy is his self-ordained advisor. He's the smartest of the boys but the most nervous and thus becomes the easiest target for the ruthless. Jack is one of the more ruthless, a born leader mostly because of his strong presence. He immediately attaches himself to the idea of hunting and becomes infatuated with the prospect of spilt blood.There's a scene in the novel where Ralph and Piggy lament over not having any adult supervision, not having a grownup tell them the course in which they should plot. Sitting back after reading this impressive classic and one will realize that adult supervision, or lack there of, was not the problem. The problem was that these boys grew up way too quickly. The problems that ensued were a direct result of their acting as adults, pursuing leadership and power and respect and authority. The clashes between Jack and Ralph and Piggy were all over power, over who had the right to rule and who would follow who.The novel opens with a glimmer of hope, that maybe just maybe with all the innocence in adolescence they may be able to survive in cohabitation without debilitating consequences, but almost immediately those hopes are smashed as the personality traits of the three main characters are uncovered and problems within the group begin to surface. The conclusion, as grim and tragic as it is, is a conclusion that is almost expected and best left to the readers discovery.So, with that in mind, I urge you to refrain from reading the introduction (beautifully written by E.M. Forster) or any of the \`notes on the text' found in the back for they give away too much of the story and or experience that is best left to self discovery. After you've finished the novel though, I encourage you to take a few minutes and read over what others have to say about the brilliance that is \`Lord of the Flies'. It will enlighten you and help you better appreciate and understand this novel as William Golding intended. \`Lord of the Flies' is classic for a reason. It's brilliant literature with meaning for all of us today. As we all may know full well, there's a lot we can learn from our children, but sadly, there's a lot our children learn from us that can be detrimental."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the greatest novels ever written, Lord of the Flies brings into question the very nature of humanity itself. It brings in debate of some of history's most influential philosophers, Rosseau against Hobbes, concerning whether or not humanity is naturally good, or naturally evil. Golding's response and his analysis guarantees to shock the reader.In a WWII backdrop, a group of British boys are stranded on an island after their plane crashes on a beautiful island. Realizing that they would be there for a long time, Ralph, one of the boys, takes charge and attempts to lead the boys during their stay on the island. The story deviates as three perspectives take center stage and rival for humanity's attention. Piggy, the dorky intellectual, is the sole boy trapped on the island that understands the necessities for survival. He is the civilization the boys once knew, and the one that Golding holds with pride. A complete foil of Piggy's ideologies is presented through Jack. Jack is aggressive, cruel, and hungry for power, as he will use any savagery necessary to rise to power. In the middle of this dilemma is the story's protagonist, Ralph. Ralph is torn between using Piggy's wisdom and the allure of Jack's savagery. Through the eyes of Ralph, Golding forces the reader to decide which world humanity is capable of living in.The story is absolutely brilliant and promises to shock to the very last word. It is the perfect response to the total trash represented in the book's \\"inspiration,\\" Coral Island. Lord of the Flies brought back the much needed realism of humanity and its behavior that hadn't been truthfully and meticulously analyzed since Mark Twain. The language is painfully blunt, the images are horrifying, and the ending will leave you questioning even more of what you thought of society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am currently in High School and I was forced to read Lord of the Flies. At first i wasn't impressed but as i progressed through the book i realized how complex and interesting it could be. Key word being could. My best friend read the book a week before i did, we have different teachers, and the only thing she got from the novel was a cute adventure story of boys trapped on an island who go crazy. I couldn't believe she didn't see the significance. I was most interested is Golding characters like Simon who has Epilipsy and is almost a mystical, godly, all knowing character. Ralph represents democracy while Jack represents communism or totaltaliarism. I love how the characters could be fit into Golding's time. My teacher assigned us to write a criticism research paper of Lord of the Flies. The more research i find the more i love Lord of the Flies.If you haven't read the novel try to see the deeper meaning. And if you have, reread it because i bet you can discover something you missed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a truly great book that can be appreciated by teenagers and adults alike, which is no doubt why it is often studied in schools.Golding makes pointed comment on religion, superstition, rituals, society, monarchy, democracy, etc. Coming so soon after WWII, during which he served, Golding has a cynical view of his fellow human beings.This book can be enjoyed on many levels. As a rip-roaring adventure yarn or - as the future Nobel Laureate obviously intended - a dark commentary on humanity.Golding who worked as a school teacher, brilliantly evokes the behaviour of boys running wild on a tropical island. Each boy is a living, breathing character.The book builds to a heart-thumping, unforgettable climax."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think the book wasn't believable enough that it could relate it to any ones life. Yes, it does have its points about life, but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's purpose for writing this book was to state the theme that, there is a need for civilization and rules. I agree with his idea. I made this conclusion when I saw the book's high points, which were the events that happen when there is no civilization or rules and it all led to chaos. Murder, theft, and violence are all products of no civilization, and that is shown in the book. I thought that the way that the author described the characters was amazing. The author described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking when he said something or did something. The good characters were so innocent and pure. While, on the other hand, the evil characters were some of the worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil ones, they do things that get on your last nerve. I don't think this book is believable. In the book, the children have to deal with events and situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve. Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who stole the toy or the video game, not about how they should live or whether or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book was good but has it's flaws."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a fantastic story that i would recommend to anybody. During a holocaustic World War II a plane crashes on a desert island leaving many children stranded. Coming together they find that they are alone with no adults around they celebrate they're new found freedom. Participating in anything they want they have the time of they're lives.Soon though they're order starts to come to a hault and all they're fun has spiraled into a down fall as they try to figure out how to be rescued.

Four Stars to William Golding for this marvelous novel about brotherhood and representation of society at its best."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read in it school last year, as well as this year, and I wish we could read it again and again. I love the symbolism and the messege Golding is trying to portay of evil in all of us.

Well find out in William Golding's book Lord of The Flies. The Lord of The Flies is a gripping book that takes you through the lives of a group of young British school boys whose plane crashes and leaves them fighting with nature and each other to stay alive and make it off of the isolated island. The group of boys try to start their own low class government and constitution, but when one of the young boys can't face this new government he breaks away and starts his own government which throws the island into a form of civil war. One by one each of the boys begin to lose their sanity and began eliminating each other. It shows just how easy it is for a group of normal civilized human beings can drastically change into inhuman and insane human beings when the stress and the extreme possibility of death is near. This book is riveting and emotional that proves that even the most civilized and disciplined people can turn into insane psychopaths. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book is so kwl. iv been addicted to it ever since i bought it. it is so boss.it cant be compared to the harry potter series or the hunger games trilogy because it is so good"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was forced to read this YEARS ago in high school, and I absolutely loved it.

I am so glad I decided to read this again. I see why it is a classic. I just don't understand how people can give this one star...maybe it's just over some people's heads.If you have not read this yet, READ IT--YOU WON'T REGRET IT."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine your life taking a turn for the worst when your plane crashes on a deserted island and all you have is the shirt off your back and a group of boys to trust. This is exactly how a group of British boys became when their plane crashed on to a deserted island during a war. This book explains about the possible nature of humans when they are put in a different habitat and are given a choice between life or death. The Lord of the Flies is a book that keeps you hanging till the end and keeps you guessing on whether or not this is what humans are really capable of. This is one of the most thrilling, suspenseful book that situates you through the eyes of the characters and makes you second guess on whether or not the boys will be saved. If you are looking for a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, Lord of the Flies has it all.This book takes you through the eyes of Ralph, the protagonist, Piggy, the one that is always teased, Simon, the quiet and shy one, Roger, the sadistic boy, and Jack, the antagonist. Throughout the story these 5 boys play a main part to the roles of human nature. The setting takes place during the time of a nuclear war where a plane crashes towards a marooned island and a group of boys find themselves stuck on it. With the pilots dead and no radio signal for help, these boys try to govern themselves to act as a proper \\"community\\". As connections within to group start to become closer, the plan becomes disastrous. The government began to crumble, plans turn into chaos, and the boys are forced to split. As Ralph and Piggy wanted a peaceful, orderly government, Jack thirsted for power and dominance and that was when the other boys were forced to choose between the two.William Golding was a British novelist and Nobel winning author who wrote many novels but he is best known for his novel Lord of the Flies. Golding's unique style of writing has captured a magnificent story that shows what a world could be if it was civilized and what it could be if it was full of chaos and destruction. Apart from his writing, he went around learning and becoming a schoolmaster, lecture, actor, and a musician. His ideas that formed the novel Lord of the Flies came from his own personal experience when he had to migrate out of Britian to an island because there was a D-Day invasion. That was what gave Golding the idea to write the novel where he envisioned the war as Jack where it wasn't civil and peaceful and the life before and after as Ralph, civilized and in order.Lord of the Flies has made many impressions but what made this book stand out from the rest was its theme behind the text. Between humanity and the insight about life without society, Lord of the Flies has it all. William Golding created a book that left me feeling awed in the end and he struck me as an amazing writer. Lord of the Flies will never cease to amaze me, it's a picture perfect book and it will always be the book I will turn to when I'm stuck in a stuffy room with nothing to do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I love how my perception of this book has changed over the course of 15 years. When I first read it, I thought the characters barbaric and unreasonable. At 16 I had never left the United States. After traveling much of the world and seeing the reality of what *jungle* island living is first hand, the actions of the stranded boys feel more justifiable. Perhaps it is one too many viewings of Survivor, but in a stranded situation would you hold your cool? Would Wilson really have made it though Castaway if he had been human instead of volleyball? Maybe if he was family, but starvation causes even the best of us to lose total control of our id. Freud would agree, even a well trained mind gives into instinct."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Long before \\"Survivor\\" or other reality shows that requires the elimination of its \\"contestantants\\", there was a masterful book written- \\"Lord of the Flies\\".More than an interesting book, it provokes thoughts and discussions on an elusive topic of human behavior or misbehavior.

How do you make the spirit of cooperation overcome the dispirit of competition?\\"Lord of the Flies\\" has been required reading for many middle-schoolers and high-schoolers.

What I really like about Lord of the Flies is the psychological aspect of the interaction between the boys and later on the planned and reasoned speeches and conversations of the lead character, Ralph. Golding does a great job of keeping the reader on the edge making this novel one of the best psychological thrillers, in addition to making a statement on the human condition."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book actually came in a day early, which was awesome.

It's a book that requires your full attention and it not something you can just skim over and be done within a day. Everything and everyone in this story is a symbol of a more complex idea. Roger isn't just \\"bad\\" or \\"mean\\", he's sadistic and a representation of evil in its purest form. Take Jack for example: He's a person who uses power for the benefit of himself not the whole community, in other words, a dictator. But on a more serious note, he represents how in the wild, characteristics a person has, are more pure; The rules of society that had tamed and controlled these malicious attributes (Or in Simon's case: Good-natured) are now absent, and that pronounces and extremes these qualities. That is why I like the Lord of the Flies. It makes you mull over every event and pondering on what William Golding is trying to show or tell us. It really is an extraordinary book that captures the essence of after the abandonment of civilization, how sometimes humans' greatest enemy is themselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Omg!!! This book was the best I ever read. It can get you to understand how things can be when you dont have any adult around.This book has a lot of details,and it also has a little of irony.Then it can also relate to many people, like when a person is getting picked on by his name,when people want to fight over being a chief, and when people think they are better then the other kids.

Like many at the time, I hated the fact that I was being FORCED to read a book without so much as a vote on the matter. At the time, in the early 80's, I found a way around in Cliff Notes. Still...I didn't get it. I tried, I think I got a \\"C\\" bs'ing my way through the required paper, but I really didn't get it.30 years later I sat down to actually read the book, and I get it now. The story is a masterful depiction of the collapse of society, expressed in the microcosm of the boy's tiny island world. Many others...see the most helpful positive review...have gone to great lengths to spell it all out here on Amazon reviews, so I won't do it again. I just wanted to cast my vote, assign my rating, and let anyone who might read this know that I get it now. And it's brilliant.Also, from what I can tell, a vast majority of the negative reviews, and nearly all of the 1-star reviews, appear to be from kids who, like me, were forced to read this book for school. Maybe in 30 years they'll get it, too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is a troubling look at humanity and society from the perspective of a group of kids. What makes it all the more troubling is the way it challenges our belief that children are innocent and only adulthood corrupts them. Golding makes it clear that there is something far more sinister, and impossible to describe, that makes civilizations crumble and allows evil to ravage us. Whatever this something is, it's in all of us. Through the eyes of a group of children isolated on a small island, the novel pits the need for civilization against the irrational savagery innate within us all.Lord of the Flies is a symbolic novel, meaning its events aren't meant to be taken literally. The setup, a plane wreck, is barely developed because what's important is to put these children in isolation, not how they got there or how probable it is only they would survive the crash. The pigs are another enigma. They seem to be an odd occupant of the novel, but their presence is symbolic rather than scientific fact. The pigs aren't just pigs, but a representation of flesh: the desire to eat meat and to overpower and slaughter living creatures. This isn't to say the novel is an abstraction. It is very vivid, and the reader can clearly picture the setting and the drama that unfolds.The island society is divided between \\"biguns\\" and \\"littluns.\\" The littluns spend most of their time playing and don't seem to fully comprehend the severity of their situation, and the biguns are the ones responsible for getting things done. A fear spreads amongst the littluns that there's a beast on the island. This beast takes many forms, residing on land, in the sea, and even in the air. The biguns try to shrug these fears off as silly, though in reality they're simply afraid to admit a certain terror at the idea of a beast on the island. This terror helps drive a wedge in Ralph's attempt at civilization, and the littluns are right to be afraid, though the beast turns out to be much closer to home than they realize.The novel is much more mature than today's young adult books. It isn't written in the fast and easy way that teens are accustomed to now, but at a slow, deliberate pace and with lots of description. Of course, it is beautifully written, and this is the benefit of using a more sophisticated, slower-paced writing style. The novel's concluding chapters become much more exciting and action-packed, and there is a lot of dialogue, which is something teens like. Personally I've heard many mixed opinions about the novel, and many are disturbed by the violence, though I think a large part of the dislike of the novel comes from the fact that many readers find symbolism intimidating. The problem is when someone hears a novel is symbolic, they read the book with a different ear than they would otherwise. Though it is a challenging read, I think the best way to enjoy Lord of the Flies is not to analyze it as a configuration of symbols, but to see the story as it is on the surface, in the conflicts between the children and their ideas, and wonder what Golding has to say about society. You may be troubled by his conclusion, but it's important to recognize."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With a palette of earth tones and straightforward sentences, Golding paints a picture of the descent of a microcosm of British society into barbarism. The theme is of a society whose self-identified elite have always feared not that the barbarians are at the gates, but that they were inside all along.This classic book, short and simply phrased, deals with a planeload of children stranded without adults on a tiny, forested island during wartime. The pilot dead and the plane swallowed by the jungle, they must make their own social accommodations without the help of adults or the certainty of rescue. The thoughtful, bookish elements of society typified by the asthmatic and unathletic \\"piggy\\", find themselves rapidly marginalised and persecuted, while a cult of the hunt arises around one manipulative leader not squeamish about violence. The picture of humanity rapidly descending into a wild state is chilling. Facing the fears of a child formulated in its dreams and reified by manifestations of death, such as a perished parachuter in the night and the slaughtered offering, known as the Lord of the Flies, to \\"The Beast\\", the community rapidly turns on itself and extinguishes lives that tread incautiously across its unfamiliar terrain.I just happened to finish this book the same day I watched a David Attenborough sequence on chimps conducting a razzia against a neighbouring troop. The focussed, near-humans expressions of the chimps and the coldness of the violence and subsequent cannibalism brought a resonance that echoes throughout this book. Another strange tremor comes from the boys' barbarian war paint. In a Schwarzenegger film, the actors are shorn of individuality with ski masks so that they can become expendable. In Golding, the actors are freed from human responsibility by concealing their own features, rendering those around them expendable. Shorn of the comforts of civilisation and disindividuated by face painting, this is what we could all too easily become.A chilling and classic work."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"// SPOILER BELOW //Let's start from the end. The rescuing naval officer averts his gaze and gives the boys a few minutes to regroup their emotions and sense of becoming, their understanding in what it is they're doing, and what does he do? He \\"wait(s), allowing his eyes to rest on the trim cruiser in the distance.\\" And that's the final sentence in the book. After all the madness that's taken place on the island we're left with a \\"trim\\" cruiser, a symbol of modern man, modern achievement and modern man's very propensity to conflict; we witness the complex machinery, that ship, used to deter and keep it in check. (for I see the ship as generally good) But how does that ship come about? Throughout the book the boys try to build better things, things like TVs and radios, futile endeavors on an island. The accomplishments to which they strive are inextricably connected with history, with accomplishments that have come before us, with a fire passed down generation to generation. We inherit, we do not continually reinvent the wheel.But what if we had none of that? What if there were no streets beneath our feet and no maps delineating mankind's established purpose and order? -- Here begins Lord of the Flies.Lord of the Flies is a fast paced narrative written with an exacting eye for detail and natural images. The book is filled with a rich symbolic system that does not distract but adds to the pleasure of the read. The characters are depicted vividly and uniquely. And the entire plot and progress of the book runs with a profound momentum that carries you along, barrels out of control and splinters into a multitude of meanings and interpretations and a grand sense of experience.The book exists both on the level of character struggle - especially between Jack and Ralph - and on the level of a continuum of events that lead to situations that offer statements about our true or original nature. Effectively, Jack is subsumed by the island and its primitiveness. He paints his face to resemble another of its brutal and amoral powers. He draws others towards him, first with his charisma then with a more diabolical magnetism, where as Simoneneric say to Ralph as he pleads for their reason: \\"It's a tribe\\" and \\"Never mind what's sense. That's gone.\\" Justice and truth has become ceremony and worship of the chief.When the conch is smashed into a thousand pieces we ask, what is it that exactly has been lost? Something precious and past down through the ages, some force of light for man in the universe's surrounding darkness. Some point of cohesion among men. A reason, a simple reason for we as the human race. Then Ralph panics and runs through thickets and woods and eventually stumbles into a clearing and finds himself face to face with the Lord of the Flies, the bleached skull of a pig - white where before the conch had gleamed white; it's sick face deriding his attempts at escape, a cavity filled with a new amorality that fuels the primitive maw that swallows up these kids until, like Percival Wemys Madison, they forget even their provenances, even their names.One further piece of symbolism. As the fire roars and the savages cry in their chase, it is \\"as though the forest itself were angry with him, a somber noise across which the ululations were scribbled excruciatingly as on slate.\\" On slate? Are these boys creating a new schoolroom, one of fear and brutal reckonings? Developing a new rite of initiation, but something unmastered and unbequeathed, unlike any of the schoolrooms from which they were snatched."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society?

William Golding was one such writer when he wrote the book \\"Lord of the Flies\\". This book takes a deep look at how a group of people would do cut off from society and how they would interact with each other. The book begins when a plane crash strands a large group of young boys on a small island. It doesn't take long to realize that the faults in human nature may threaten their chances of leaving the island alive. The plot is interesting and continues to build up as we see the characters falling apart. Ralph, the group leader, represents the average man; kind, compassionate, and he just wants to get everyone off the island alive. He may not stay in power for long though as his rival, Jack, doubts his leadership abilities and longs to have that power and respect for himself. All of the characters are deeply developed and each represents a different role in our society. This book will pull you in and make you care what happens to the characters, a great read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"How can I even begin to comment on this book? It was wonderful in every way- its symbology, dark undertones of human emotion and archtypes, and murderously well-done plot. One who thinks that this book is about a couple of boys stuck on an island randomly fighting and killing each other is superficial and quite frankly, stupid. This book is riddled with important messages about human nature and society, and much can be learned from the mistakes of these unknowing children. Golding's knowledge of ancient concepts of human nature, and also his accurate use of Freudian archtypes serve to deeply complement and better this wonderful book. I recommend this wonderful novel to any literate human being."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In my view chapter 8 is definitely the central chapter of the novel. In this chapter Jack leaves and the boys split into two camps; Jack and his hunters become increasingly savage; and we finally understand the true nature of the Beast as well as understanding Simon's role in the novel.The chapter begins with every boy on the island finally accepting the existence of a Beast; even Ralph, who was once so sceptical (\\"But there isn't a beastie!\\") believes there is one and convinces Piggy, who also used to be a cynic.Jack calls a meeting amid the growing tensions between himself and Ralph. We also recognise Ralph's growing maturity in the face of Jack's childishness. Jack's language is childish: \\"He isn't a prefect\\". Jack confronts everyone at the last meeting all the boys have together, and criticizes Ralph: ' \\"He just gives orders and expects people to obey.\\" ' At the end he challenges them as to whether they think Ralph ought to be Chief, and is humiliated when none of the boys agree with him: 'The humiliating tears were running from the corner of each eye'. He 'blundered' away and 'dived' into the forest.Simon then makes a suggestion: that they should climb the mountain, where the Beast is, because there seems nothing else to do. Simon is viewed as being 'crackers' by the rest of the group and is not taken seriously, especially by Piggy, in who he had at first trusted. Piggy changes here from being a shy and socially incompetent but intelligent boy, into someone gaining confidence by Jack's absence, but also by scoring points off others.An ominous mood is then set after the choirboys vanish, to go off with Jack. Jack imposes himself as leader and the choirboys accept it: ' \\"I'm going to be chief.\\" They nodded'. This leadership is enforced later in the chapter when Maurice and Robert announce that \\"The Chief has spoken\\" when Jack encourages others to join him after stealing some fire. However, they are reluctant to make this announcement; maybe they still feel that Ralph is the real leader and Jack in the wrong.We are reminded of how much the boys have changed: 'ages ago they had stood in two demure rows and their voices had been the song of angels'. Now they are hunters, dirty and uncivilized, about to kill a pig. We also realise that, for all their tough talk, they are scared of the Beast as well: ' \\"We shan't dream so much down here. This is near the end of the island.\\" They agreed passionately out of the depths of their tormented private lives.' The island also has a psychological landscape: at the end of the island, they are near the 'castle' rock.Kill is ritually left for the Beast, a chilling reminder of their progression towards primitive savagery. The pig's head on the stick represents a manifestation of the Devil; therefore it is significant that Jack and Roger are the boys who put the pig's head on the stick.Roger 'sharpens a stick at both ends' on which to put the pig's head. He sharpens a stick at both ends again when hunting down Ralph at the end of the novel. Roger features more in this chapter and becomes more important throughout the book; in the end he kills Piggy. In this chapter he is the most bloodthirsty of the boys: 'Roger found a lodgement for his point and began to push until he was leaning with his whole weight.'Ralph and Piggy call a meeting; during this, the idea of rescue becomes even fainter. Ralph's hair which falls over his eyes becomes a 'shutter'. Long hair is uncivilized; as Ralph's hair becomes longer so he can't see, the idea of rescue gets fainter as Ralph becomes less civilized.As the novel' title shows, this is the central chapter. Simon is a saintly character; a prophet who sees things. During one of his 'times' (faints, which prophets are meant to have) he sees a pig's head on a stick come alive and turn into the Lord of the Flies, a manifestation of the Devil, hence the 'ancient, inescapable recognition'. Through Simon's confrontations with the Lord of the Flies we come to understand the true nature of the Beast- it is the Lord of the Flies (\\"And I'm the Beast\\") but it is also psychological: \\"I'm part of you? Close, close, close! I'm the reason why it's no go?\\" However, Simon is not allowed to tell the others about his discovery \\"We'll forget the whole thing\\" and is threatened \\"You're not wanted. We are going to have fun on this island!\\" (see pages 45 and 95) and is warned that if he tells the others, and stops them having fun, \\"we shall do you\\". Simon does try to tell the others and is killed; the prophecy comes true.Since it is in his imagination that the Lord of the Flies warns him that he will die if he tells, and the Lord of the Flies is part of him, in effect, like Jesus, he predicts his own death.I had to study this book for school, and unlike other school books, I did not find myself hating it after a couple of days. I'd read it before, but thought no more of it than a sinister boys' adventure story. Studying it (I think it's one of the few books meant to be read into) really made me take an interest and now it's in my top 5 along with \\"Discworld\\", \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"empire of the Sun\\"."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies, is a story of details, adventure, and conflict. William Golding uses his excellent skills of being able to switch looks that he creates on characters by using a hefty amount of details. The details provide readers with the feelings of other characters. When I read books, I enjoy books that have plenty of details that make your reading more vivid in your imagination and allow you to feel as if you are in the story too. I like how Golding creates different adventures inside one big adventure to make the novel have more excitement and more creativity. William Golding is known for his outstanding conflicts in his stories. His books always have more conflicts than others because his are more enjoyable. For instance William has a conflict between the setting and a conflict between the characters. Most authors just have conflict in the characters. I enjoyed this book more than most books and that is why I recommend you to read this. If you enjoy action and like plenty of details then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord Of The Flies is a very dark and unpredictable book that portrays the dissolve of a society in a smaller, more confined way. The way Golding starts the story you can tell that you're going to be for quite a ride, as he places you right in the middle of the action, perhaps to give you the chance to understand the confusion the children faced.This book begins with the children being thrown on an island and having to figure out a way to survive. They eventually seem to get themselves pretty well organized except for a few lazy workers. Then we start to see more and more people neglecting their work and this eventually turns into a small rebellion that continues to grow throughout the book.Since coming to the island the only two people there who had the ability to lead the group was Jack and Ralph. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused ontrying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them.Jack had a strange desire for hunting that slowly grew into a sick obsession by the end of the book. Jack eventually becomes fed up with the way Ralph is running things and branches away from the group. Support for Jack's group slowly grows as the book goes on. Either a desire to hunt or an unwillingness to work eventually causes just about everyone to leave Ralph's group except for Piggy.Piggy seems like a bright boy with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance and the complete disrespect he recieves from the other kids no one ever pays attention to him. The ironic part about it is that the cause of all the chaos on the island was the absence of an adult, which except for his age, was basically Piggy.While the children in the hunters group feared only the beast as they went on their daily hunts, Piggy and Ralph had to contstantly live in fear of the other children, who had become scary and unpredictable. The children in the hunters group revolved their entire world around the beast, who they had all accepted as real at this point. In this world they forgot about ever trying to get back home and seemed out of touch with reality as they casually talked about killing their friends.Another friend of Ralph's on the island was Simon, who never had much to say , but you could tell had a lot on his mind.To emphasize the drastic downward spin the islands tiny society had taken he punished the only two children Ralph could trust and readers had come to know.When the children all finally come back into contact with an adult he acts as an escape back to reality from the strange imaginary world that they had created."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is singularly the most important novel for required reading, whether assigned in school or self-imposed. It regularly appears as number one on my own list of best books.Let's play \\"What if.\\" What if a plane carrying a full load of school boys crashes on a deserted island with no adult survivors? What would happen to those boys? What would you expect to happen?William Golding works with this premise: an idyllic setting, innocent schoolboys. One boy, an older boy just short of teenage years, a boy with fair hair, assumes leadership to stir the others into some semblance of organization and survival mode, much like adults would do if adults were present. He also saw a need to defuse the web of fear of the younger ones. Where are we? How long will we need to wait before someone comes for us? All questions with no answers at this time.Ah, yes, Golding tells us, everything goes well for a while. But remember the \\"scar\\" made by the crashing plane? Something ugly is on this island (but it's not the scar). It's in the bushes, in the dark, in the depths, in the depths of hearts, and it grows like the malignancy it is.A blatant revelation of what is about to come occurs when Roger silently and stealthily watches a young'un, unbeknownst to the little child. All the young'un is doing is running a stick through the sand, disturbing a crab in a tiny pool of water. Even he imposes control and fear on a helpless creature as Roger boldly picks up a couple of rocks and tosses them the youngster's way. He deliberately misses but comes closer with each throw. Next time he will probably hit the young boy, but not yet. This taboo--deliberately and unnecessarily causing pain to one smaller than you--has not been broken--yet.Although the dance of the spears, the primeval chants, the attack and killing of the pig, then feasting on its flesh, their kill, are shocking acts of savagery, this event is foreshadowed by the seemingly innocent lob of the stones. From a casual incident, but one with eventual intentionality, the ritualistic slaughter is not so far-fetched or surprising. Golding prepares his readers. This is how the chaos of society starts. It begins with one simple disconnect from the rules. It begins in the minds and hearts. Will I do what society expects? Will I follow the rules to keep things running and working? Do I break a rule or two for my own enhancement. Will I feel a power surge if my rock hits that young \`un?Ralph would probably speak of the terror of knowing that rules WILL be broken. He would speak of the utter horror that any rule can be and will be broken and he won't live to tell about it. Just ask Piggy.This novel is the only one I taught over and over during the twelve years I worked with high school seniors. My other choices I would switch around those years, drop some, add some. This one I kept. It is that important. I think of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a necessary manual for societal behavior and an effort to keep the chaos of evil at bay.Is it even necessary to ask how many times that rock has been thrown since this novel was published in the 1950's? Or how much chaos has imploded so many lives?Like the way of manuals, some remain in circulation and are deeply read; others fall by the wayside out of disinterest. Some are thrown in the trash. \\"Lord of the Flies\\"--what is its current status? And society--how is it doing? Reader, are you a little bit fearful?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding wrote this book as a response to \\"Coral Island,\\" in which a group of boys shipwrecked on an island make Christians out of cannibals, hunt pigs but do not spill blood, and are cheerfully rescued. Obviously, Lord of the Flies is much more than an adventure story about good little boys. It is an exploration into the darker side of man and the true source of the \\"beast,\\" or Devil.Meet Ralph, who represents sanity, common sense, and the conscience of man; Jack, who loves nothing more than hunting, blood, and power, and who Freudians might say embodies the Id; Piggy, who personifies intelligence, logic, and reason; and Simon, who discovers the true nature of the beast and represents a ray of hope for mankind.I love this book because contained in less than 200 pages is an insight into human nature and the failings of society. When you read this, be prepared not only to examine the book and all its symbolism but yourself and your civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With this his first novel, author William Golding wrote a novel that he could never surpass in greatness. Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding's stand on human nature. \\"His stance is too pessimistic\\" or \\"That books really gross.\\" What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn't making things up, I don't think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It's quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let's start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to \\"well my auntie...\\" and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can't seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: \\"...Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning...\\" Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it's not the thing a proper English boy should do.Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack's status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack's power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of \\"keeping people in check.\\" Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn't want.Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy's part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph's leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it's rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You'll be immersed in the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding's view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he's writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If not for anything else, William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES (1954) is remarkable for having come out at a time when Western society was being bombarded with visions of totalitarian nightmares. The Nazis were gone, but still in modern memory. Russia's totalitarian state was a constant threat. McCarthyism hovered over everyone's privacy, as did J. Edgar Hoover. And recent fiction, like Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and, especially, George Orwell's 1984 presented world views where the human spirit is all but squelched by governments and technologies.LORD OF THE FLIES, in its own way, says, \\"Hold on a second! Humans do need to be regulated. And they do need to protect themselves from each other.\\" His tale is a warning: Humanity, without government, will degenerate into savagery and anarchy. And that is precisely what happens in this book. You know the plot, by now. But what has to be mentioned is that William Golding is a visionary who has the story-telling mastery to convey and do justice to that vision. LORD OF THE FLIES is a remarkable and powerful book, one that should be on everyone's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although I have not quite finished Lord of the Flies, I love the book so far. From my observations, the readers who enjoyed the novel loved the premise and the symbolism. Those who did not really like the book had problems either with having children as characters and carrying out these acts, or that it started out too slow. From where I am at in the book, it has been pretty good.In September 19, 1911 British author William Golding was born in Cornwall, UK. Golding went to Oxford University to study in natural science; he then changed his major to English literature. Golding joined Britain's royal navy and fought in World War2. In September of 1954 he published his first, and most successful book, Lord of the Flies. Golding passed away on June 19, 1993.The idea of these children stranded on this island and trying to survive is a fascinating plotline. The fact that these kids create their own little factions is also quite captivating. If this were to happen in real life, the factioning of the boys would have most likely happened. It would happen because as history can back up, people always separate themselves based on difference, whether it be due to opinions or race, people always segregate. The symbolism is this book is heavily implied. Ralph for instance is the leader, and it is implied that he is the voice of reason. Piggy is the timid follower who is very logical. Then, you have Jack. Jack is meant to represent the devil. He leads the children away from Ralph and teaches them to kill and disobey. People who did not enjoy the book missed all of this. All of this symbolism made the book so much more interesting because it turned a survival story into a story about human nature and the struggle of good vs. evil.I will agree with the critics that the book did start out a little bit slow, but it picked up shortly after. I have enjoyed this book for the most part; that must be why it is on my outside reading list. It may not be one of my favorite books thus far, but it must be a classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It is always with a sense of foreboding that I pick up a book that I loved when I was much younger and read it after several years have passed, my fear being that the book will no longer hold up after the passage of time. Lord of the Flies was a book that I read at least three times a year when I was growing up, starting at about age 12. I eagerly devoured it, grappling with all of its symbolism, and even writing poems about some of the main characters. Fortunately I was never required to read it for school or I likely would not have enjoyed it as much.I was pleased to read it again and find that Golding's novel of World War II era prep school boys surviving on an island after an airplane crash that kills all the adults is just as good as I remember it being. I could go on and on about the various symbolism in the book, and the descent of the boys into savagery, but I don't want to over analyze it.It is a terrific book, with well thought out characters. One cannot help but feel sympathy for Ralph as he tries to keep a semblance of order. Anyone who has ever been terrorized by a school bully will sympathize with Ralph's struggle against Jack; and Piggy is a truly pathetic character. My favorite character has always been Simon, who is just a little off kilter but in the midst of his ramblings speaks a great deal of truth.Kids, don't wait until your teacher makes you read this book. go out and get it and read it for yourself. Unlike most of the books you'll be required to read for school, this one has action, adventure, and enough gore to make it a good read. Later on you can worry about the symbolism and the deeper meanings within the book, but for now, just read it for fun."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If I were scoring the story, it would have 5 stars. Unfortunately this reading by the author isn't all that great. For one, it's dated and the audio quality suffers from that. There is no consistency in the sound so one minute he sounds okay and the next as though he's stepped away from the microphone. Another annoying factor is the breathing and sighing while he's reading making the whole thing sound like a chore. It's a pity because this is an excellent story but the narration could use improvement."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"&quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; was enthralling, terrible, and fascinating. I read it in a day, and it consumed my thoughts. The book starts out quite harmlessly, and I began by almost thinking I was in for a fun adventure story. However, I felt otherwise as I absorbed the dark, gaunt style this book was written in. There was something ancient and evil behind the pages of this book, in the unwritten words, and unuttered dialogue. The line that seemed most significant to me were the words spoken to Ralph by Jack after he has returned from pig hunting. They are discussing the feeling that both of them have had in the jungle, of being followed, and &quot;as if it wasn't a good island.&quot; The Beast is a recurring theme throughout the story, and I don't believe it refers to any one thing. The Beast takes the form that the children want it to, and it begins with their imaginations, but amounts to so much more. The children are the Beast, in a sense, in the aspect that their own selfishness, jealousy, and savageness have awakened this monster."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Can we really &quot;trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature&quot;? This book was written in an attempt to find out. In Lord of the Flies, William Golding shows us, naked and exposed, at once innocent and corrupt, noble and cruel, and all to human. He uses symbols, theories, and ideas to help illustrate his point. For example, the female sow, represents the mother of the boys - the killing of the sow symbolizes the killing of the mother. The roles of the three main characters are different; Ralph being the ego (self knowledge), Piggy being the superego (conflict between thoughts) and Jack being the id (want). Lord of the Flies uses symbolism so well, that it is understandable, interesting to read, and catching. The writing in this book is structured so well. I was able to understand what he wrote, and I was hooked. What I liked best about this book was the clarity of it, the style of his writng and the plot of the story. His writing is also very specific. I was able to put pictures in my mind about what was being said - {Over the Island the build up of clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled up the static until the air was ready to explode}-this is an excerpt from chapter nine. It is obvious that his style of writing is excellent and should be highly acknowledged. It deserves a 5 star rating. Lord of the Flies is a wonderful, symbolic, adventure into ritual, primitivness, death, guilt, innocence, betrayal, and war. Only then, will you find the answer to the question, &quot;can we trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature&quot;?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book many years ago in high school, and found it very philosophical. It isn't conforting in any sense of the word, but it gives a powerful message regarding the nature of humans. The whole conflict between Jack and Ralph is petty, but that was the point. Written during the horrors of WWII, W. Golding wanted to show the readers that the only difference between human beings and beasts is that we are governed by laws and civilization, without which we do become savages. Disturbing, extremely, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book. Someone once told me the purpose of art and literature is to make an audience think through its powerful messages, not to be comfortable to place in a &quot;hospital&quot; setting. Lord of the Flies does exactly that. Through vivid descriptions and masterful symbolism, this book conveys a powerful message regarding human nature. A previous reader claimed, due to the Columbine shootings, this book should not be read in high schools, I couldn't disagree more. It is because of such atrocious acts that the message this book contains is needed more than ever."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you are looking for a heartwarming sappy love story, then...this is not your type of book. Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a book filled with deceit, insanity, and teenage boys trying to survive a deserted island. These civilized boarding school boys are sole survivors of a plane crash. The book takes place during a raging war which is like the atmosphere that accumulates on the island. These once proper boys turn into crazed maniacs after being away from society, adults, and rules.This book may be defined as good literature. If I were to list some of the interesting parts of the book, then I would ruin a rainy day reading! I know that there are questions running through your mind right now, like: \\"Did all the boys survive?\\" \\"Did they get rescued?\\" and \\"How did they react to each other on the island?\\" Well, there is only one way to find out which is to go read the book yourself!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Willam Goldings novel, The Lord Of The Flies is a a intresting, deep novel. It touches on alot of levels about society and how we act as people. The novel is about a group of young boys from Britain who are on a plane on their way to boarding school, when it gets shot down and crashes on a island. There are four main characters, Ralph who is the leader, Piggy who is the smart one, Jack the strong agressive one, And Simon the naturalist, relgious one. Through these boys, you see the diffrent facets of society and how they are suppose to interact. During the time they spend on the island the rules of a civilized society start to fade away and brings out the primal instaincts in our human nature due to survial of the fittest.. I belive that this is a great novel to read and it displays the ideas of what would happen if societys rules were taken away and how we would function. Using children in stead of adults is also a great idea for it shows that even innocents can turn into savage beasts."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Goldings Lord of the Flies is a thrill-seeking book. When reading Lord of the flies you will sit at the edge of your chair with the boys that try to fight for survival as their insanity takes over them. Roger, Ralph, Piggy, Jack, and Simon, the boarding school boys who have just crash-landed on this island; with no parental guidance, no rules, and now have to learn how to get along with each other in order to get off. As Ralph and Jack battle it out for who will be leader, one wants things to be in control and the other thrives to be in control of the others that are stranded too. Just as one-boy stumbles upon a beast we wonder just what could happen next. This is surely a remarkable book for boys to read if they are adventurous them selves. Over SEVEN MILLION copies were sold this book was such a realistic book I could see why.

He shows the basic primal instincts of English boys regressing from society back to basic thoughts -kill or be killed.A slew of boys crashed and stranded on a deserted island, forced to fend for their food, their own Democracy, and their very lives.Jack and Ralph -the oldest boys of the bunch- fight for dominance and leadership of the group throughout the book.The entire book delves into an area never traveled before in the time frame that it was created in. It's something one never thinks about; what happens to prim and proper people when society is no longer around to keep them humane? William Golding has strung together a world of hunters, pigs, deaths, and carnage -all based in the middle of the World War II era.The book brings to light unsettling emotions as you read. William Golding makes you wonder how savage humans truly are, and question whether it would be possible to survive living on an island with a group of boys, no older than the first teenage years and others so young they're barely able to speak properly.The book was artfully written and fast-paced. This startling highlight of Mans carnal instincts has brought to surface the thought-provoking question, \\"Man or beast?\\""},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ok from the begging of this the lord of the flies book it starts out with a wham, bam kind of action letting you the audiecne know whats going on. In the first coulpe of chapters you find out that there is two boys in the beginning are just two really firghtned and scared boys and they remeber what happened to them. As they get more and more into this place they found out that this is an island and there really isnt any possible way for them to get out of this place. The weridest part of this book is the boy piggy and the other boy ralph find this conch shell and when he puts his lips and blows the conch it brings all of these other boys togther. Ok in personal opion when you blow a conch shell it gets loud but it doesn't tell all the other boys to come to this place where they blew.More and more into the book the boys who were like they don't need there parents and start relaizing that there helpless and cant do anything about it. When they realzie they don't have there parewnts to help them that means they cant gget for them selves. They cant find any food or any thing to drink so they going against each other and start getting crazy and start attacking the leader of the group and that's ralph and piggy. Ok I thought that this part of the book gave it some snare and razzle-dazzle and kid of explains what really happens when oyur on island with no food or water. It really helps the readers to explain what reaaly happens to a person or a kid when they have nobody to help them.The ending of this book was really surprising because as soon as ralph runs out of energy and speed he drops and falls and as soon as he was aout to get killed... something out of the blue happens but I cant tell you. But when you read this book you find out about the character and yourself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think this is an outstanding book. Lord of the Flies is written at a highschool level but is able to keep an adults attention throughout the whole book. The book isnt really realistic but its enough to keep your interest. Some books that are out of this world with their plot just arent interesting and get boring at times. But i promise you you will not put this book down. It starts off with a plan crashing from britain. These kids are left on an island and have to form a type of democracy to keep themselves alive. They vote for captains and these captains make decisions throughout the book. Twists are thrown in there. Its a very interesting book and i recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is powerful. The words show the intelectual level of this book.

The classics are always the best."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Not only does this book deserve 5 stars, but it is books like this one that should be the criteria for awarding 5 stars. When I read a book, if it doesn't move me like The Lord of the Flies, I hesitate to give more than 4 stars. However, after reading Golding's novel, I rushed to award top marks. An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. One wishes for 200 more pages as the story climaxes with page-turning exitement. Golding's use of symbolism is genius. This book is on my \\"must reads of a lifetime\\" list.

I would never actually want to read the book again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was one of the worst books I have ever read.

The plot is simple and the characters are presented in a way that makes them difficult to enjoy reading about. The book is around 150 pages, which is strange, seeing that it took me about three weeks to finish because I had to will my eyes to lurch over every page. Other than it being the most uninteresting book one can find, the characters make me equally angry. I realize just as well as the next person that they're stuck on an island and that they're all younger than me, but these children are just unimaginably dense throughout the story. They become so out of touch with reality that they even take to hunting down their leader. What am I supposed to find symbolic and interesting about that? People keep going on about how this book is teaming with symbolism, but I'm just not seeing it, just because you have a bunch of kids stranded on an island doesn't mean that that relates to religion, society, etc. Aside from the characters annoying me at a personal level, the way the author portrays them is even more ridiculous. If William Golding spent half as much time on the plot, and not describing the children and scenery, he may have had a half-decent story on his hands. If someone is looking for a decent book about survival, try &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King, at least he made it interesting to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was disgusted by the grotesque display of savagery in this novel.

I do not reccomend this novel to anyone, especially children."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Oh. My. God. Can we say ATROCIOUS?! One star is too much for this piece of dung. Symbolism is nice and quite beautiful in some places and for certain writers, but this book had WAY too much of it. Golding's novel is very horrendous in the fact his absolutely mind-numbing style immediately drove me away in his tedious and unnecessary description that wasn't even striking in any way. I'll give it a bit for having good description in a few places, but only a miniscule few.But that isn't even the reason for this rating. What I found most unpleasantly apalling was the content of this so-called classic. It completely and utterly disappointed me in its horrific plot that I wouldn't even care to mention. Am I a happy-go-lucky reader? No; In fact, I quite often enjoy the sad and angry scenes in many novels, but an element of this one that I still can't quite name and don't care to that made those scenes so obtuse. This book should be completely wiped off and eradicated from the lists of classics to read and analyze in schools."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Look, I get it. I understand that William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES is an allegorical examination of the inherent depravity of the human condition. I get Golding's depressing message that man is a nihilistic savage, when left to his own devices. I understand that Ralph represents civilization, order, and decency (the alleged \\"grown-up world\\"); Piggy represents common sense and the rule of law; and Jack aggression, chaos. . .evil. I totally get the symbolism of a group of boys (innocence) on a remote island sans adult supervision completely devolving into anarchy.Yet I had several problems with this 20th Century \\"classic.\\" The characters were one-dimensional paper cutouts; the dialogue confusing and hard to follow; the description of the island's terrain downright confusing (creepers?). Yet my biggest problem concerned the fundamental, bottom line question: How did the boys get on the island?Yes, I understand that in order for the story to be told we must have a group of boys dropped randomly on a deserted island. The story, of course, develops from there. We are given vague hints that the boys arrived via plane crash--but that presents even more questions that are never, ever, answered. If Golding is going to ask me, the reader, to suspend disbelief and follow his story, he's got to give me more information; otherwise, I'm already holding his tale at arm's length. (Pardon the pun.) Here are my problems--never addressed:If there was a plane crash, where is the wreckage? The fuselage?As the story progresses, the boys' clothing becomes tattered and torn until all of the children are virtually naked. Was there no luggage on the plane?Other than the pilot, were there no adults on the plane? Were none of the boys injured? Are we being asked to believe there was a plane crash whereby all the adults were killed and all of the boys walked away with nary a scratch?All the boys on the flight were schoolboys, but other than Jack and his choir members the rest of the children were total strangers to one another. How can this be?Alas, all of the above made reading this novel a most difficult and unrewarding experience. Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES examines a titanic issue, to be sure; yet to this reader the message was lost because the mechanics of the story were never developed.--D.

LOF was an excellent novel and allegory. Ralph symbolized law, order, and democracy, Piggy represented knowledge, truth, and morality, Jack symbolized anarchy, brutality, and destruction, and Simon showed spirituality and insight. Everything in the book showed some aspect of society. Even though it was written in 1954, it is still very valid today. I recommend it to anyone who likes adventures but doesn't mind learning important lessons about life at the same time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a high school teacher of British literature, I like to use this novel to represent a different viewpoint from the Romanticists, who believed that man was born essentially born good and innocent but corrupted by society. Golding shows us just the opposite; if we don't have order and rules, as symbolized by the conch and by Ralph's futile attempts to lead the boys, we lapse into a state where the &quot;beast&quot; within can overtake us. The boys gradually descend into this state of wildness and darkness - the shedding of clothes, the face painting, the hunting, the split, and so forth. No, the novel isn't realistic, as many other reviewers have pointed out, but it isn't intended to be. Look at the time period it was written - shortly after WWII. Golding seemed to foresee order dissolving into chaos, and he shows us the consequences. The imagery and symbolism are quite good, as is the touching friendship between Ralph and Piggy. I recommend the novel, even if you only choose to read it on a literal level."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read a lot of novels for entertainment purposes, but I'll start off by saying that those I read for school I usually like less then those I read on my own. It is possible I am biased. This novel seems to invite overanalyzation in the worst way. The flimsiest throwaway line can be sought out and examined for meaning. These meanings often reflect only what the reader wanted to see. I think Golding was trying to make a point and did a passable job at doing it. I think he lacks subtlety, however. The books that carry the most weight in my mind are those which do so in a manner you hardly notice, but at every turn Lord of the Flies screams out, &quot;there is an innate evil in humans!&quot; Its ending seems contrived and somewhere along the line it acquires a nightmarish quality that seems to me to detract from the theme."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Briefly, for those of you that don't know, Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of boys who are stranded on an island. At first they get along but as the book progresses they fight and kill each other.Well, this was a book I had to read for school. I felt that chapters 1-7 were boring, 8-10 were okay, and 11 and 12 were boring. It had some exciting moments, but it had many times more boring moments. There was really no one to root for, no good guy you cared to see to live until the end. In other words, I couldn't have cared less if they all died. There is a whole lot of symbolism. Actually, I am going to have to cut this review short 'caue I have to work on notes about the allusions in it. Its due tommorow ( uh-oh ).Anyway, if you are the type of person who enjoys sitting around reading boring books, this book is for you!Oh- oops. I just read the rules. This nice little review couldn't ever qualify for a prize. I guess I should explain where Golding went wrong. Well, I thought that at points it kind of rambled on. As I said before, there wasn't anyone that you really could root for.

There many messages in this novel for those who seek them but for me the key message was how a group of children organise themselves in order to survive.Resourceful, ruthless and inventive are some of the adjectives that first came to mind. The boys demonstrate the best and then, increasingly, the worst of human behaviour. Jack and Ralph each have strengths and weaknesses: there is no single leadership model which best addresses the situation the boys find themselves in.Whether you read this as an allegory or as a black and bleak adventure story, 'Lord of the Flies' invites you to think about what you might do in similar circumstances.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The cold war era produced a lot of fiction that explored the corrupting influence of power and the rising threat of totalitarian governments, warning us that no society was immune. But while authors like George Orwell were more interested in the machinery of totalitarian governments, how they rise to power and how they maintain control, Golding was more interested in humanity, the flaws of human nature and how quickly we can revert to savagery.Golding wasn't the first author to explore the concept of mob mentality or the savage nature of man, but he was the first to illustrate it so chillingly with a group of British school boys.I have one small complaint about the novel. Golding never offers a satisfactory explanation about how these boys end up on the island. The novel provides only a vague explanation regarding a plane that was shot down. Golding never explains where the boys were going when the plane was attacked, why there were no adults with them except the pilots, why so few of them knew one another, why they were initially scattered all over the island, and so on. The reality is that in order for Golding to conduct his literary social experiment he needed the boys to be on the island with no apparent chance of rescue, and with no adult presence. It was also critical that the majority of boys not know each other, that they be of various ages, and that they initially be separated from one another so that they can come together and form a new society. Because there was no plausible back story to explain all this, I was never fully convinced that Lord of the Flies was something more than a contrived social experiment.That said it's a fascinating social experiment. While contrived, Lord of the Flies is a compelling novel, an exciting adventure story and a powerful morality tale. The novel is extraordinarily well written with descriptive prose that brings the sights, sounds, and smells of the island to life.Lord of the Flies is a disturbing tale that reminds us that civility is an artificial state and very fragile indeed (At least for humans with a Y chromosome). Had the island been inhabited by a group of school girls I don't suppose it would have been necessary for one of the girls to issue the cryptic, sinister warning that someone had \\"sharpened a stick at both ends.\\"I highly recommed this novel. It's worth reading, even if Jr. High School is just a distant memory."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What happens when those raised to be an integral, contributing part of civilization are suddenly set free before their training / acculturation is complete?

Other works of this nature include Robinson Crusoe, Gullivers Travels, and Ulysses. Specifically, how much of the evil in the world (the Western, Anglo-Saxon world) is due to the effects of society restraining the individual, and how much is due to the individual himself? These questions and the related issues of freedom, law and order, respect, competition versus cooperation, are all explored in this book.In short, a plane full of English schoolboys crashes on an island in the Atlantic ocean. Slowly, the various survivors find each other and try to form some semblance of a society from which they came from. Tasks are delegated, and roles taken on as they fight for survival hand-to-mouth. But soon, some of the party discover that life is more fun if tasks are shirked, and they revert to a more primitive state of hunting and killing. The boys divide into two groups; Ralph who tries to keep them in a semblance of civil society, and Jack who leads the downward spiral into primitive fury. Jack's group slowly morphs into a bullyish gang and begin killing the others in a game of predator - prey. The killing comes to a sudden stop when society reimposes itself in the form of a rescue ship.Published at the height of the Cold War, this book is quite complex in its treatment of story and characters. Many themes of both a personal and political nature are included. This reviewer read the book during his early teens, and found it too complex to fully understand at that time. This is probably the youngest age at which this book should be read. The book is considered a classic of English literature; though I believe it should be cited in classes of political theory, sociology, and the other social sciences. Most importantly, I believe this book more than any other, exposes the psychological foundations of Anglo-Saxon culture and society by showing what happens when those raised to be part of it are removed from external controls. The boys' ensuing behavior reflects, to me, an upbringing of rod and beatings, drills and formalities characteristic of the English school system. I dare say that a more enlightened upbringing, along the lines of Rousseau's Emile, would not have created such monsters in disguise... All in all a great book though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Imagine you are trapped on an island with a group of boys. What do you do? How do you survive?William Golding's novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was written in 1954. It is an action/adventure book about a group who suffer a horrific plane crash, and the boys are stranded on an island. It takes place during the World War II era. The tale involves the struggle of power between two boys. One, who's name is Ralph, is just your average male just looking for law and order. Jack on the other hand, is a constant slave to power.Just imagine what boys would do when stranded by themselves. One thing they do is paint their faces, savagely kill pigs through their anuses and turn into savages. The book brings you on a journey of boys trying to survive, or will they just be boys and play, forgetting about the fight for survival.This book is very symbolic in meaning, that everything has a good and evil side. The book does have its twists and turns and some things will surprise you. Despite all of the entertainment, I felt this book was very predictable. What else could you get in a story about people stranded on an island? This does not necessarily mean it is not a good book though. I guess you can only judge it by reading it for your self."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Everyone was saying how good this book was, so I read it.Big mistake.This book may have a lot of in-side meaning, and maybe too much in-side meaning for a high-school student. The message that this is book is trying to get across is too 'in your face' and violent for a high school reading level. It makes it worse that children are doing the killing. I passionatly hated this book the whole way through, and unless you delight in children killing eachother, I don't advise you to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this for a grade in Literature class, as did two of my other friends. Well, we all read the book and we all failed the test. Keep in mind, we are honor students. I would never recommend this book to anyone, especially not if it is crucial to your grade. It is a confusing, negative look at human nature, riddled with dreadful imagery and general savagery. Not exactly top on my list of favorite books, I don't think I could ever bear to read this again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I finished this book I was very depressed and somewhat angry. Most of the characters in this book remind me of the shooters at Littleton, CO. This book would probably disturb someone who had experienced violence at the hands of thier peers.

I thought we were trying to promote good values in school, not total disregard for life!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. It was extremely dull and violent at the same time. I usually read a book this length in three days, but it took me TWO MONTHS to read this book.

I don't care if it was figurative language or not, it was a really below average piece of work. Ugh."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It was so boring i had to induce ain to stay awake while reading i"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book is not really made for young adults. i am in 8th grade and I couldn't bear it. Everyone else hated it, but I believe it is only because we couldn't really understand it. All the symbols Golding used made the image foggy and the only way i got through it was with the symbols teachers gave me, such as Simon being Jesus and other things like that. It's just a little deep for teens my age...."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"With all the different scholastic reading options out there, why is this book still on our kids reading lists? I read it thirty years ago and recently read it again because my kids had too. The language is archaic. The imagery is impossible to grasp.

It impressed me then and I thought I'd read it as a mid-life adult to see what I thought of it this time. I absolutely loved it. What a story! It's not for the squeamish and it can be depressing. But, so creative and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Maybe it's the fact that I am around 40 years old, and I should have read it when I was 15 - but I couldn't really connect with the story. By the time it finished, I did not really care too much about what happened to each of them - Piggy, Ralph, Jack or anyone else.I suspect it is the fact that I could not believe the story as a whole - lots of little kids living on a deserted island surviving on fruit.It is quite well written though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I finally read this for the first time. It is just as good as I'd hoped it would be. This book is a classic because it works on several levels--as allegory, as social commentary, and as just plain good storytelling. What more can I say that hasn't already been said?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I've put off reading this book for awhile. No reason really, I had heard good things about it, that it was full of symbolism, etc. So now, I've finally gotten around to reading it and while I do admit it was chock full of symbolism, I didn't find it particularly engrossing and even a bit dull.After a wreck, a group of boys twelve years and younger are stranded on an island. From the first they are eager to make their own society without the yoke of adults while still secretly yearning to be rescued. A boy named Ralph is made head of this society, with Jack, a leader of a choir group turned hunters as his somewhat second in command. He also has a somewhat adviser dubbed Piggy who owns a pair of glasses that is the main source for creating fire. As the boys live on the island their society starts to deteriorate and fears make the boys do things that no one would have ever thought them capable.Ralph is a weird leader for the group. He seems, in the beginning, to be more along the same lines of personality as Jack. A bully in a way, but really just a normal boy otherwise. Piggy is the typical picked on kid, who has aspects of him that are important to share but are ignored by society based on superficial reasoning. And Jack, well he's the type that's filling up our prisons or operating under camouflage as a socio-path in the normal world. It's just in this world he is allowed to have the savagery come out. Ralph's experience with leading causes him to miss the socio-pathic role, but he could have come very close if he had made a few decisions in a different way. And then there's Simon, who's supposed to be the enigma of the group, but who's really just a sick little boy that is looked at differently because of his issues.Golding uses this book to show a number of things. The bleakness in society, the potential for violence in anyone, and that without consequences to rules, society could fall apart quite easily. But there were a couple things I didn't understand. For one, I never really realized why it was all boys that were stranded on the island, especially since they weren't all traveling as part of the group like the choir was. Why did they go to savagery so quickly? Especially when you consider the amount of younger kids. And what about their feelings of home and wanting to get back there? Surely after a week or so the fun of playing on their own island would have abated and a depression would have set in. And that just seems unaccounted for. While I thought Golding made some good points about society and how it works, I just think it could have been fleshed out more.And the writing itself. For all the violence and gore, I found it dull. Just the style was hard to follow because of the way it jumped about. And while part of that can be attributed to following the actions of young boys, it was just jarring to read and made it easy to lose focus. And I know this book could actually be geared to middle school and high school aged children but I wonder if the majority have the ability to really get at all the symbolism in this book or if they'll be so distracted by the gore that it'll be missed. Certainly there are some very intelligent kids out there that will get it, but not everyone is like that. Heck, I'm an adult and I probably didn't catch half of what Golding put in there.There are some lessons in here, but it just wasn't the right platform for me. I didn't like Golding's writing style and it caused me to hurry through a book that should have time spent on it to get at the detail.Lord of the FliesCopyright 1954182 pagesReview by M.

The book is about a group of boys stranded on an island. The author tries to show how society works, and what would happen if a group of young boys were stranded on an island, but fails miserably. His opinion of what would happen is just wrong. And even if you do agree (once you've read the book) the writing still destroys the book. It is such a slow book! Way too much unnecassary details! When it comes to an actual important part of the book, there is barely any time spent on it. I would not recommend this book to anyone!! (unless you want to see for yourself how bad it is!)"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be, and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: BORING. Don't buy it unless you have to for school, even then I wouldn't open it. Read the cliff notes- it's less painful."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this book in 8th grade. I believe I enjoyed it (which is somewhat of a surprise since I hated reading then) and found it exciting. I re-read it recently, ~20 years later, thinking I'd have a new found appreciation for it or at least better insight into the story. However, the second time around was painful. The story was slow and boring and I just couldn't find anything interesting or redeeming about it. I struggled to even finish and after finishing it I don't understand why I bothered.I've read some of the positive reviews and spoken with people who were both fond and not fond of the book and I certainly did not catch the greater meaning of some events in the book that those who enjoyed it did. While reading I never got a sense of some great symbolism or insight. It just felt like a bunch of kids trying to appear important, running around an island to me.I would consider reading it again because of the extensive positive feedback the book has received through the decades, but I fear I'll come to the same conclusion then hate myself for finishing it in misery a second time. Perhaps, I'll wait until I'm marooned on an island with a bunch of kids and read it as a defense manual."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Unfortunately the copy that I recieved repeats Chapter 5, and is missing Chapters 6 and 7. We know it is a great story. Bought the book for my kid who needed it for for a school assignment. Quality control is unacceptable."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's idea was brilliant. He delved into the true, hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book, a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules, goals, and a leader. Of course, this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared, goals are forgotten, and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.The idea is well thought out and interesting. However, Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end, when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.If you want an examination of human nature, then read this book.If you want an adventure story, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book doesn't deserve a review. With all due respect, Golding couldn't write a good book to save his life. His writing is reminiscent of Tolkien's; he comes up with a great story, and then ruins it with horrible writing. But I suppose I should stop ranting about the book and get on to a summary.A relatively large group of young boys are marooned on an island. One young boy, Ralph, decides he's the leader because has in his possession a conch shell, which most SpongeBob fans will recognize from one of the episodes. In his \\"Inner Circle,\\" there are some other boys: Piggy, an unpleasantly fat asthmatic intellectual; Samaneric, two twins who individually are Sam and Eric, and the \\"littleuns,\\" some of the youngest boys who can't get it through their thick skulls that they're lost on a deserted island. Ralph is encountering problems with Jack, the leader of the boy's choir, who has a rebellious soul. Without spoiling too much of the story, Jack gets mad, runs off with most of the boys, and several other events that fail to stimulate the brain. In the end, they are all rescued by the Royal Navy, (they're British,) and they all live happily ever after, minus a pudgy pain-in-the-rear. If you ask me, I would have been a bit more pleased if they all died.This summary may sound choppy and rushed, because the book is choppy and rushed. The author had several chances to redeem himself, but why only put the book's namesake in a one-and-a-half page segment of the book that has no symbolism, real or otherwise. When you look back at the story, you may think, \\"Wow, that sounds really cool!\\" And the story is, but it makes no sense, and the parts that do are just plain dull. In the hands of a good author, namely Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and especially Orson Scott Card, this book may have been one of my all time favorites. Goodkind and Card would have turned the book into an action-packed book with beautiful internal conflicts, and Jordan would describe the island with such vivid detail I would feel like I wanted to get lost on an island myself. However, as it is, I'm now terminally afraid of anything surrounded by water on all sides.The point I'm trying to get around here is this: Great story, God-awful writing. I'd only give this book a one out of ten, the one only for story. In a videogame, even if the game isn't too pretty, if it has a great core, it's a wonderful experience. With books, however, that's just not true."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" for many things such as its left feeling of shock, and its questioning of mankind's existence or purpose. To begin, when Piggy is killed, it is heart-wrenching, \\"Piggy's arms and legs twitched a bit, like a pig's after it has been killed.\\" (pg. 165) Roger unleashed a gigantic boulder that crushed Piggy. His blood washed away in the ocean. Next, Simon's death was very depressing, \\"The water rose further and dressed Simon's course hair with brightness. The line of his cheek silvered and the turn of his shoulder became sculptured marble.\\" (pg. 140) Simon was gruesomely murdered. He was found at the bottom of the cliff, dead. Last, most of the boys became hunters, \\"Kill the beast! Cut his throat! Spill his blood!\\" (pg. 138) This shows that being a savage is part of mankind. The majority of the people are hunters that just want to cause harm. Therefore, Golding's book should be a \\"classic\\" for its shock, and questioning about mankind.Second, Golding's book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" because it shows insight into mature of human experience, makes a social impact that might change legislation, and the book has unique languages. To start, it is a dog eat dog world, \\"Which is better--to be a pack of painted Indians like you are, or to be sensible like Ralph is?\\" (pg. 164) Ralph won't fight to kill, but the savages have no problem killing Piggy. You either kill or get killed. Then, democracies are better than dictatorships, \\"...Which is better to have laws and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" (pg. 164) Ancient civilizations with dictatorships never lasted as long as democracies like Greece and Rome. Jack and his savages run a dictatorship, while Ralph runs a democracy. Next, all the boys have a British accent, \\"We musn't let anything happen to Piggy, must we?\\" (pg. 106) Musn't is British jargon. Also works like asthma changed into \\"assmar\\" in the book. In all, Golding's book should be a \\"classic\\" for its insights, social impact, and unique language.Again the book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" because it causes the reader to re-think their beliefs, and it questions conventional or standard ideas. First, the book questions evil in boys, \\"Shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy come...\\" (pg. 96) The boys don't even have true enemies, yet they prepare for battle. Evil starts to grow in them. Next, if adults can stop the children's war, \\"I should have thought that a pack of British boys...would have been able to put up a better show then that...\\" (pg. 184) Who is supposed to stop the adults' wars? As soon as an adult showed up the boys ended their fighting. Finally the book questions standard ideas like boys getting along with each other when their lives are on the line, \\"Ralph showed his teeth at the wall of branches...snarled a little and waited.\\" (pg. 177) Jack wanted more power and used it for evil. There are certain people who go against the standard ideas. All in all, Golding's book LOTF should be a \\"classic\\" because it makes you re-think your beliefs, and it questions conventional and standard ideas."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies takes place on a deserted island during World War II. There is a plane carrying a group of school boys to safety from the war zone area. The plane is shot down. The boys find themselves on the island alone with no adult supervision.The major characters in this book are Piggy, Ralph, Simon, Jack, Sam and Eric. The boys elect Ralph as their leader and develop their own form of government. Because Jack is power hungry, Ralph decides to let him and Jack's choir take the role of hunters. It is their job is to hunt and provide food for the rest of the tribe.Now, one of the younger kids on the island thinks he sees a beast at night. The other boys laugh at him and say that there's no such thing as a beast. However, even the older boys become afraid at the possibilty of a beast. Eventually Jack and his hunters find hunting thrilling becoming obsessed with it. As stated in the novel, \\"The two savages raised their spears and spoke in time. The chief has spoken\\", said the savages.(p. 141). This leads to conflict between the two groups. Jack and his hunters value hunting more that Ralph and his tribe.Ralph and his tribe value the signal fire which they decided was key to their survival before rescue. Ralph states, \\"We've got to keep the fire going. There was something good about a fire overwhelmingly good. How else are we going to be rescued?\\" (p. 163). Then one night while the twins are keeping the fire alight, they see a strange object. This object frightens them and tricks them into thinking the fire is the beast. In reality the \\"beast\\" is a dead man moving around in his parachute. They are fooled by the wind blowing the man, thinking it is the man moving on his own. One of the twins reports back to Ralph. Fear strikes the tribe. Jack and his hunters want to kill the beast. Ralph decides to go with them to investigte the beast. The trio of boys are scared off by the same thing that the twins saw.As fear envelopes the tribe, Jack and his hunters break away from Ralph's group. A kind of war is started when Jack and his tribe control a part of the island and Ralph control the other side. While they are hunting, Jack and his hunters kill a pig and cut its head off as an offering for the beast. The pigs head symbolizes savagery. The boy's fear of the beast causes them to do savage acts.Meanwhile, Simon decides to see if the beast is actually real. He climbs up onto the mountain and discovers the dead pilot. Simon realizes that he must tell the other boys about what he has seen. On his way back to the beach he sees the pig's head on the stick.Upon seeing this Simon has a dream and faints. As he reaches the beach to tell the others what he has seen, he is killed by the boys. The other boys from Ralph and Jack's tribes are having a feast, dancing and celebrating their power over the beast.Because all the boys have a type of mob mentality they mistake Simon for the beast and kill him. The next day Piggy and Ralph decide that they have to go and talk to Jack and try and get their fire back. Remember, Jack and his tribe stole Ralph's and Piggy's fire from them during the night. Piggy ends up being killed and Jack and his tribe chase Ralph all over the island. Jack and his tribe end up destroying the island because they lit it on fire.Ralph finds a navel officer who rescues the boys. I think the point that Golding is trying to get across is that mankind is evil. He is letting us know that evil has always existed.I enjoyed the novel . The symbolism made sense to me. Evil really is a fear that we all deal with. To use this language was creative."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's Lord of the Flies is one of the most intense and disturbing novels I've read. Golding truly shows the brutality of human kind in his main themes such as, there is no hope for mankind and, man is the beast. Simon, the Christ figure in this story, is shown the truth about mankind when it reads, \\"However Simon thought of the beast, there rose before his inward sight the picture of a human at once heroic and sick.\\" Who or what brings our inner evil out? In the book Jack is the force that brings out the beast within the boys. This theme is restated to Simon when the Lord of the flies says \\"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you?\\" If Simon is the only one who really knows the truth then, why is he killed? Perhaps the killing of Simon states that, mankind does not want to accept that we are indeed evil. Is there really any hope for us?No hope for mankind is another theme that William Golding states. The naval captain judged the boys as innocent and harmless. The captain said to Ralph \\"Fun and Games,\\" but Ralph informs the captain that two kids were killed. If the captain saved the boys from their supposedly harmless war, will God save mankind as well? Does he also think, that mankind is just having \\"fun and games\\"? Also the conch in this story represents civilization and power, but the conch is destroyed by Roger. The hope of civilization and mankind is crushed by a beast figure. Because we are the beast, there is no hope for mankind."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What a book.This book deserves the 5 stars because it contains everything that a reader could ask for in a true classic.With only 184 pages of simple words, Golding has created for us a book so powerful that seems like the ultimate resolution for every quandary, however trivial. And those chilling themes. Just thinking about them literally makes me shiver.I may not be an 'as-experienced' adult reviewer like some out there, but William Golding and his words, and the truth in them, hit me hard."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book peers into the dark side of human nature in a way that is honest and direct.

Golding has truly crafted a masterpiece here. If you like books that leave you thinking, you will enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the most influential and important novels ever penned, \`Lord of the Flies' may be even more poignant today then when it was initially released. Telling a very realistic and moving story set in a very unrealistic backdrop \`Lord of the Flies' works on almost every level of literature to provide the reader with an all around emotionally gripping experience, and one they won't soon forget.As a plane carrying a group of young children is shot down during warfare the valuable cargo is spread out over an uninhabited island. The boys quickly must for their own civilization with only a sliver of hope to ever be found. The story mainly focuses around three very different boys. Ralph is the chosen leader, a boy who possesses common sense and an open mind. Piggy is his self-ordained advisor. He's the smartest of the boys but the most nervous and thus becomes the easiest target for the ruthless. Jack is one of the more ruthless, a born leader mostly because of his strong presence. He immediately attaches himself to the idea of hunting and becomes infatuated with the prospect of spilt blood.There's a scene in the novel where Ralph and Piggy lament over not having any adult supervision, not having a grownup tell them the course in which they should plot. Sitting back after reading this impressive classic and one will realize that adult supervision, or lack there of, was not the problem. The problem was that these boys grew up way too quickly. The problems that ensued were a direct result of their acting as adults, pursuing leadership and power and respect and authority. The clashes between Jack and Ralph and Piggy were all over power, over who had the right to rule and who would follow who.The novel opens with a glimmer of hope, that maybe just maybe with all the innocence in adolescence they may be able to survive in cohabitation without debilitating consequences, but almost immediately those hopes are smashed as the personality traits of the three main characters are uncovered and problems within the group begin to surface. The conclusion, as grim and tragic as it is, is a conclusion that is almost expected and best left to the readers discovery.\`Lord of the Flies' is classic for a reason. It's brilliant literature with meaning for all of us today. As we all may know full well, there's a lot we can learn from our children, but sadly, there's a lot our children learn from us that can be detrimental."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What would happen it there were no more rules and if there was no one to answer to? Would we remain civilized? Probably not. This is the situation a group of school age boys find themselves in and they soon find themselves resorting to their baser instincts. Some even begin to go a little mad.This was the first book that I read that I actually enjoyed. The scene that sealed it for me was when one of the main characters began to hallucinate that the severed head of a boar was talking to him. That scene was so vivid it felt like I was watching a movie.This book would be great for young boys who don't like reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you see yourself as a kind-hearted person who believes in the good of humanity, reading Lord of the Flies will shock you out of that stance. Golding uses this large analogy of a group of boys stranded on an island to communicate that underlining every human being is a savage beast waiting to emerge. Each main character symbolizes a different aspect of humanity - Ralph: the good leader, the ideal societal figure; Piggy: the intellectual that is not valued among the savage beats; Jack: the epitome of a blood-thirty savage. At first, the boys desperately try to create a secure and functional society, but as hope of rescue fades and the boys start valuing strength over intellect, the innate beast from within quickly takes over the vast majority of the boys, destroying all remnants of society. This book defies the expectations of what people would normally expect from a group of boys alone on an island. Instead of having childish adventures and happy-go-lucky games, the boys become warily hungry, brutally frustrated, and even deadly. This book dives deep into the foundation of human nature and explores the function of society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the very few books I was assigned to read during my school days. A quick read, mostly because it isn't boring so I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The premise of Lord of the Flies is fairly uncomplicated. English schoolboys are stranded after a plane crash and forced to survive on a deserted island. The school bully system slowly turns into pure savagery and as the reader expects someone gets it badly. There's lessons in here for all."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This had to be the best book I ever read, and I would recommend it to everyone! William Golding tells the story wonderfully, and does a great job using symbolism.William Golding presented numerous themes and basic ideas that give the reader something to think about. One of the most basic and obvious themes is that society holds everyone together, and without these conditions, our ideals, values, and the basics of right and wrong are lost. Without society's rigid rules, anarchy and savagery can come to light.This book was indeed a well written masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book many years ago in adolescence. It was a required reading work, a rite of passage work for any young person who wished to know the ' literary conversation- pieces' of the time.And it is a ' gripping narrative' a read that holds the reader's interest, especially as it is written in a clean, spare, very understandable prose.Yet I must admit the violence and cruelty which are the central message of the work in regard to what human nature is in essence, turned me off. As an adolescent dreaming reader I was looking for works which would give hope and faith in life. On the adolescent level 'The Catcher in the Rye' moved me to rereading again. And on the more adult level 'War and Peace' seemed to show the complexity and beauty of life in a way which made ' Lord of the Flies' seem to be a narrow- minded cartoon.We may be bad and evil sometimes, and many of us may be bad and evil all the time, but not all of us are evil all the time.The book to use a Faulkner phrase ' had no redemption in it'. And so while I respected it it fell far short of winning my approval and love."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is, to me, a metaphor of human history. A group of boys ends up in a desert island after a plane crash and they have to struggle to survive. The battle of leadership begins shortly and two styles arrise. One is a symbol of order and civilization. The other is the opposite: anarchy and barbarism. Everything happens through the eyes of these boys, whose hope is to rescued. Highly recommendable if you liked Animal Farm for example."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to \\"drag on\\".I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story. And Golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society. It's well worth the read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This review comes as a response to some of the other reviews on the site. Before I actually review the story, I'd like to respond to several accusations made by others.1) Some say that Golding's writing style is too slow when dealing with the environment, sun setting, etc., but very abrupt when dealing with death. The reason for this abruptness is to underline the character's nonchalance about death and dying. They don't care if Piggy dies, and the book is written to feel the same way. The writing that is long about seemingly unimportant things is only to create a mood, although, to be fair, mood need no be created with such laborious attention to detail.2) Several reviewers made the point to say that most teenagers don't talk the way the characters in the novel do. Well, of course they don't. The teenagers are merely a metaphor for the adult world and all of it's pompousness.3) Lastly, it should be mentioned that the beast is more important as a metaphor than as an actual thing, i.e. the children's irrational fear drives them to madness. But, you do in fact find out what the beast is, in a short passage of the book. If you watch the movie, it will become even more obvious.Now, on with the review.This was William Golding's first novel, and it is a classic. There are some problems with the writing, but the same can be said about most amatuer writers. But writing, in this novel, takes a back seat to Story and Message. Their are several different messages you can take from this, but this edition contains a section called notes on Lord of the Flies if you've read this and want to further your understanding of the novel.In the end, this is a very desparing story of humanity, with a few flickers of hope. This is a good place to start if you're begining to read deep literature. Supplemental works could include 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and A Clockwork Orange, because while this doesn't take place in the future, it might as well be a dystopian novel about the evils of government by tyrants."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this book quite interesting. It portrayed the dark side of human nature very well, showing how a group of boys could transform into monsters. I enjoyed reading this book, and would certainly recommend it. The reason I rate it four stars is that while it was a good book, it just didn't feel engrossing enough to me to receive that last star. Nonetheless, it is a very good book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"if ever you need to rekindle a hatred of mankind, read this book. however, if you work in retail, as i do, chances are you need next to no rekindling.i was one of the high-school kids who somehow got through school without reading this. so i figured i'd brush up on the classics i missed during the summer between high-school and college.i read it in two sittings (interrupted only by said retail) and i find it to be realistic and depressing. dont get me wrong, i love it...but its kind of a smack in the face.seriously, take your office floor, your co-cashiers, your senior class, put them on an island with little chance of rescue, and no repercussions.i dont think that human goodness would withstand."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think Lord of the Flies is a very good book, aside from the parts where kids die(the littlun with the mulberry birthmark, Simon, and Piggy). The book goes really deep, and gets very disturbing when you think that people you know could do the same things the savages do to fellow human beings. You can put yourself and your friends in the characters' places and imagine the same things happening to you. Freaky!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is mostly a good book. I like that Golding made you think about the book and not just tell you everything. It was a very interesting book. I liked Ralph the best because he didn't just give up and join Jack's tribe. I would recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is flippin awesome!!! I loved Simon and everything he stood for. I thought he was one of the most important characters in the book. His death foreshadowed the death of Piggy and the smashing of the conch. And Ralph was awesome! He sounds hott!! The book had a lot of symbolism and that's fun to figure out. Golding didn't just come out and say what was happening. You had to figure out what he was talking about. I loved this book. Thank you and goodnight."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A compelling adventure tale, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" succeeds in telling a story of the dark instincts inherent in the human condition. Although we are conditioned for a civilized society, Golding makes the compelling argument that if left to our own devices, we will revert back to our primitive roots, one where survival and savagery triumph over order and rules.Golding's tale could be described as an allegory of law vs. anarchy, and civilization vs. savagery. After a harrowing escape and crash landing on a deserted Pacific isle, a group of English boys, escaping a cataclysmic atomic war with the Communists, quickly organize into a rudimentary society, with Ralph as their elected leader. Ralph symbolizes the leadership and good of society. Piggy, the corpulent advisor to Ralph, represents the intellect and common sense in society. Jack, Ralph's nemesis, represents the corrupt power-mongers who use fear to rule their minions. Simon, an enigmatic but sensible boy, represents the kind and charitable in society, and proves a martyr in the end. And finally, Roger, sadistic and inhuman, symbolizes the pure evil that plagues society.As the boys descend further into savagery, their desire to be rescued becomes non-existent. Instead, they are content in their animalistic rituals, and become enamored of violence and adrenalin-fueled hunting expeditions. Their concern for others collapses, as Jack becomes the tyrannical leader of a rival tribe, and eventually all succumb to him. Although they arrived on the island as innocent victims of a horrific war, they lose their innocence on the island as evil creeps up from the recesses of their soul. Even if they were to return to society, they will never regain their innocence.Although Golding tells a moral tale, there is no shortage of action. From the chaos of the initial plane crash, to the fear of a \\"beast\\", to the final heart-pounding hunt of Ralph, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" delivers a chilling and exciting tale. I honestly cannot find any downside to this book. This is a superb read and is highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Like many American High Schoolers, this novel was required reading along with various other books. Back then I thought it boring and depressing.Now every time I turn on the news or pick up a newspaper I see this novel in society today.Lord of the Flies is the tale of a group of english school boys stranded on an island much like the Swiss Family Robinson.Here they are, freed from petty western predjudices, religeon and oppressive government rules, left to their own natural nature which liberals tell us is Natural Goodness. One would expect they would readily take advantage of their situation to make themselves into a nice utopian comunity committed to the common good, ebrace and create a new world.They do anything but. Quickly they turn on each other. Quickly they fall apart as a group, reverting to the very worst. Indeed, the Voice of Reason is the end murdered.In an 'enlightened' liberal society which calls for 'Diversity' and 'Tolerance' and has outlawed caning and corperal punishment as means to enforce Order, tries to prevent criminals from being executed, makes morality a relative choice to the individual, Lord of the Flies is the world we live in today. From the Class clown who disrupts classes to the Bullies who stalk the Hallways of our Schools, soccer hooligans and after football riots, modern crudity at every level, the Criminals who contemptfully operate in a society whose penal system is eager to parole them back out but refuses to maintain order in its own ranks expecting utopia to come about from the mess it has made through its own 'elightened' stupidity, these are the those boys in real life. Ordinary people dealing with others in varius rude fashions which is what they do in a society without rules and the will to enforce them, Lord of the Flies lives among our society Today.A relavent though not pleasant book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am a sixth graderI believe Lord of the flies was a great book and was very heart warming the book was a brilliant masterpiece I think William Golding was doing a great job at making this book if you are thinking of reading this booklet me tell you that you will be amazed of this amazing book of courage and bravery this book interested me very much and it will interest you to in the beginning of the book it tells you how they got there and what they are going to do and inn the middle you get to know the characters my favorite character is Ralph because he is the bravest of them all if you like a tale about action and adventure you will like lord of the flies"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of boys, some young , some older, who are trapped on an unchartered island. The boys have to survive and find a way off the island before they all die.My favorite part of the book is when the smarter group, with piggie and such, try to get back the conk from the barbaric group, who thinks they can wade out there lives on the island until someone finds them. This part in the story has alot of action which all goood books should have. Also, this part in the book plays a big part in the plot of the story.Out of the many books i have read, Lord of the flies is one of the good books i have read. I can read this book over many times before i finally understand it, for it is complicated to understand. By seeing characters making mistakes of there own in the book, it has made me see that some decisions in life may ruin it, or they may even kill you, or it might save you. Lord if the Flies has made me apppreciate many things such as fire, and electicity. I would recommend this book to anyone up for the challenge. Though this book was slow in the begginning, it turned out to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book The Lord of the Flies is a very good book to read. It's a story about a dozen boys who are stranded on an island alone after the plane crash kills their parents. Their biggest struggle was finding leadership among a group of immature children. The main characters of this story are Raplh, Jack Merridew, and Piggy. Ralph is the oldest, Jack is the leader of the choir, and Piggy is a fat boy who has no friends. The theme of this story is that everyone should stick together no matter how bad conditions get. As you near the end of the book, the boys begin to spread apart into a group of savages with no rules. Sadly, all the disorder ends in two of the boys deaths. I recommend this book to anyone from the 7th or 8th grade. You should read it sometime. It is a really great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book among many others for my sophomore year in highschool. I thought it was rather boring at first, but after a couple of pages, it became enciteful. Ralph was a brilliant leader who tried to keep the group of English boys alive; I liked the idea of Jack being a rebel against Ralph's wishes. He was a cool part of the book; he added spunk to the whole group of boys. It was also pretty awesome to see how the boys changed from the beginning of the book from sissy boys to savages blood thirsty for pork. If you have a chance to read this book I say &quot; Do it!!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was our last reading assingment in 10th grade English. After plodding throught Frankenstein, I was prepared for another book that English teachers love, but that I would hate. Well, I was very surprised, and would say this book is easily in my top 5. On the surface its a classic tale of adventure. But inside its words, is a very saddening yet uplifting view on humanity. As the boys on the island begin to lose their English schoolboy discipline and revert back to uncivilized savages its hard to see the upside. But when Ralph finally gets rescued by his British Navy Officer you can see how Ralph is changed and ready to contribute greatly to our civilazation. A leader who recognizes his own capacity for evil, but by seeing it can deal with it, and push his good to front. As I read the last few words of the book my final thought was &quot;Can't we all just get along!&quot; And what would we be capable of if we did? If this seems too profound, stay away, but if your looking for a great story, and more read it!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book last year in 8th grade.

This great book was written in 1954. Lord of the Flies is a fiction, adventure, novel.William Golding writes about how the kids on the island face their fears in order to survive. Golding does a great job of painting a visual picture with his detailed descriptions. He describes the emotions and challenges that each individual character is having. William Golding makes Lord of the Flies sound so real that you don&#65533;t know if the two worlds, the fiction and ours are any different from each other. He describes his book so well that the fearful life the kids have might just scare you too.I would recommend this book for anyone especially people who like descriptive, puzzling, nightmarish books. I would give this book a 9 out of 10 on the rating scale. In summary, the book had lots of details, a splendid plot, and a very unexpected ending."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies portrays the wicked, sinful nature of man. In the beggining of the tale the boys are proper and organized. As it progresses however, the boys become blood thirsty murderers. Ralph is the leader of the civilized tribe but later loses control to Jack. Jack's tribe hunts for food and has a fort, while Ralph tries to keep a smoke signal alive. Jack's tribe kills two of Ralph's friends and plans to kill Ralph...This book shows the evil nature of man and how it can easily get out of control."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you have ever read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell,then you will enjoy &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a book that demonstrates how society deals with war, and also serves as a warning bell to society to show people what could happen if they don't react more civilized in a time of crisis. Golding symbolized this situation with children stranded on an island forced to live by themselves and under their own rules. This is a great book if like political/war novels or if like Goerge Orwell since both authors deal with the same topics."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is probably the best book I've ever read. Golding managed to stir feelings no other writer I've read ever has. It is definitely not a fluffy happy book, but deeply dark and disturbing. I shiver at the thought of the savagery that humans, that little boys, can come to without rule and order. Especially, the part they were beating up a fellow friend on the beach...... urgh...stomach churning stuff. Really amazing writing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written. The slow process from civilization to savagery is perfectly structured. The tale of 30-or-so boys on an island, struggling to survive, is a comparison to modern society, some wishing to find food and fight, others wanting to take things one step at a time.This novel is dark, horrific, and ingenious."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book when i was 12 and now im 14 and just recentlly re-read it and this book is awesome its really cool for normal people who just like cool stuff but for all y'all deep-thinkin people who care about a book having some hidden meaning its got that too so pick it up read it like just do it.~rob"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some people were right about how the author tends to go on and on and on, yapping about trees, rocks, sand, etc. on the island. In the novel, the descriptions were too monotonous and I did not notice that i was skipping vital parts of the book that were hidden between tedious plant matter...But once I started re-reading certain parts of the book, I've realized why the book won that prestigious whatever-its-called prize. It really did tell of the horrors of humankind that outweigh the good, and it's symbols were powerful, especially the lord of the flies character.The character I admire the most has to be Simon. Then maybe Piggy or Ralph. But Simon is a symbol of the good of human nature. Simon helps the \\"lilluns\\" reach the fruit, he gives Piggy his meat, and admires nature in his special spot in the island. He represents human instinct, but not the bad kind, not the one of selfishness and savage, but of goodness and kindness to everything as a whole. The sad part is that there aren't many people like Simon, and in the end, he is taken over by the evil, the \\"darkness\\", the \\"beast\\" that exists in the savage kids, and essentially in everyone. And sadly, before he could tell everyone his discoveries.What i find quite strange is that in the end, the savage tribe is saved by their own device. That's funny, and it didn't really seem fitting to the book's nature. But it worked to it's advantage, as it signify's the loss of innocence in the boys.When people say that this book is unrealistic, I ask them, \\"Well have you ever got stuck in an unknown Island with a bunch of kids you don't know for a couple of months?\\"The children in the island represent society. Using children as a symbol only makes the effect of the novel stronger. A society that would rather listen to their instincts than reason (Piggy), the book plainly displays the darkness and evils of mankind in a nightmarish and cruel way, and perhaps that's why some people refuse to accept the main ideas of the book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book shows the inocence of a child and the agreciveness of nature. teaches some people a leason that not all that you see is what it seems.

The tale of a group of boys who are reduced to killing each other is a welcomed change from literary pop culture.

Ralph, the chief, tries to establish a functioning society with rules and laws but his little tribe of boys is corrupted by the dominant, jealous Jack who promises the boys meat, killing and glory. Ralph attempts to bring survival back into perspective but is only taunted and abandoned.This story is a masterpiece and I would recommend this to any daring readers.

This book is by far one of the best books i have ever read. The easy to understand writing made what was going on to these castaways all too clear to miss. But at the same time their fate was intricatly layed in front of me and compeling and made me stop and think, &quot;maybe it could happen that way if...&quot; . Ralph's attempt to make sense of the situation and Piggy's need for structure in order to survive were both brutally beaten down by the harsh reality of the situation that Jack embraced. If there were ever a novel written for Darwin's theory this would be it. children lose touch with civilization and do what they think they must to survive. all around one book that i suggest to anyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I personally disliked the book except for a few parts.

First 1 part of the society is isolated from the rest then that part of society gets violent.Of coarse theres other ways of interpertating this book . But they all come to almost the same conclusion , that people have a violent nature. Realy this book should be read in colleges rather then high schools. When the teachers often misunderstand the depth of this novel how can they explain the symbolism to the students."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book by Golding is a wonderful.I think his purpose for writing this book is to show how horrible and out of control the kids would be on the island with out any adults. I also think he did an excellent job describing each character and giving them their own ways of doing things. This book beleivable because I know if you leave a bunch of children on an island alone, sooner or later they will show their true colors.

This book was not exactly what I would call an adventure but it brought some interesting things to thought. Basically what you have at the beginning is I'd say around maybe 50 kids (no adults) even though only a few of them actually have a part and by the end you've got savages running around killing each other! This book really shows you how screwed up man kind really is- and these were only children. It shows you everything that is wrong with society today by bringing up all the defects in human nature.Many people think it's just our society that has messed the world up but in reality, no matter what we do human nature is going to spoil it in the end. When you read this book you'll become frightened when you finish and piece all of it together and realize exactly what it is showing you. But hey- read it for yourself and find out. It's an interesting story and if you don't like my opinion read the others.......

It's extremely complicated and deep, which makes it some what hard to understand, unless you analize every part of the story.

Through the whole book, I wanted them to do things so they could be saved, but the majority of them didn't care."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Recently I read lord of the Flies it was a very interesting and enjoyable book. The story has timelessness to it. The plots and characters are very entertaining. The first thing I noticed when I read the book was its reference to the atom bomb. This is the author's way of giving a time for when the story occurred. Also people were afraid of a nuclear war during those times so it sheds light on what life was like. The author did an excellent job of describing the atmosphere. He spent lots of time giving details on the characters and the island. I liked this because it helps readers get a better feel for what the author intended them to imagine. Another aspect I liked was how the boys developed into 2 societies showing the break that develops. It was nice to see how the two groups had a difficult time working together. It showed the stubbornness people could have when they feel they are right. Inside the society the characters where very enjoyable with their thoughts and dialogue giving a very realistic sense. Something I thought was unrealistic was the violence some of it seemed pointless. Often I thought that it was not realistic. Another part I hated was the dramatic character change as if the characters were always the same and the way they were. The story started off innocent despite the accident and turned into this is in many ways also comparable to frame story. It had little adventures in side the big story of survival. The thing I liked most in the book was the conflict. The boys who had split into tribes had to deal with and survive each other. But they also had to deal with the conflict between themselves and the environment-facing extreme whether and hunger. I would recommend this book to any one who likes action and lots of sometime over used detail. This is a book that is hard to sit down once you start it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"cast away on a deserted island, a pack of children, unsculpted by civilisation, spurred to act only as they have learnt through observing &quot;grown-ups&quot;, motivated by a will to survive as in their own prespective, the Lord of the Flies is a literary masterpiece that delves into the psyche of &quot;civilisation&quot; and its disposition. Golding is a visionary, as with several of his likes - Huxley and Orwell et al, creating a scenerio that might appear to most, so clich&eacute;, so meaningless, yet undeniably profound. children, indulge in the mundane - play mostly; or so it is thought. Golding uses children, the root and beginning of each human existence to express civil and social evolution, perhaps even communisim and democracy, leftist and rightist attitudes. justice and injustice. his presentation may be basic, but such are our origins. this is a throughly entertaining, thought provoking and undeniable classic of our time."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Though I have always been an avid reader, I didn't ever get a chance to read Lord of the Flies until late in high school. The main reason I read it is because one of my favorite authors, Steven King, praised it in two or three of his books. Though it wasn't quite as thrilling as I was expecting, I still enjoyed it, especially the way the author told the story. Most of all, I enjoyed the way the author explored how violence tennds to become a part of human nature. Also, the books insightful and disturbing points are driven home harder because it's children that are doing all the depraved and evil things that take place in the book. Good job Mr.golding"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I recommend this book for high school students who enjoy to read. It is a good book for a person who likes a little bit of adventure and some excitement. The one thing I did not like about this book is it does get dull during the middle of the book but it picks up a little bit in the end. It should be a book that you would want to read instead of being forced too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was made to read this book this year in school ..., so I assumed that it would be horrible...like most all of the books that we have to read for school. But surprisingly Lord of the Flies was actually pretty good. I think I would've enjoyed it much more if we didn't have to read it so quickly (in about 1 weeks) and have to take so many notes about it and then have a test. The messages in symbols in this book are VERY strong and is a good book that has a lot of meaning in it. I would recomend this to anyone who hasn't read Lord of the Flies but is looking for a fairly short, powerful novel to read"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm a student who was just required to read Lord of the Flies. I personally thought the plot was good. I liked the charaters in the book. I think, though, that maybe the author has a similar problem in writing to myself. I know I get a good idea and cannot write it down the way I want it. I'm sure the original idea was a great one. Maybe if I reread this book at a later time in my life I may be able to like it better. I'm not sure. Over all, I'd tell you to read it, because its a book about survival from the elements, from oneself, and contains a large amount of action within its pages."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies, is a story of details, adventure, and conflict. William Golding uses his excellent skills of being able to switch looks that he creates on characters by using a hefty amount of details. The details provide readers with the feelings of other characters. When I read books, I enjoy books that have plenty of details that make your reading more vivid in your imagination and allow you to feel as if you are in the story too. I like how Golding creates different adventures inside one big adventure to make the novel have more excitement and more creativity. William Golding is known for his outstanding conflicts in his stories. His books always have more conflicts than others because his are more enjoyable. For instance William has a conflict between the setting and a conflict between the characters. Most authors just have conflict in the characters. I enjoyed this book more than most books and that is why I recommend you to read this. If you enjoy action and like plenty of details then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book relates dangerous things about human nature in a very entertaining and shrewd manner. What happens in this book, is something so real, it will crack your head.;)This book might make a great gift to someone who does not like to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The Flies by William Golding was a very well written story. I especially liked the way Golding built up and created the characters in the book. Ralph and Jack were the main characters in his story and also in my review. I felt that I was able to connect to both of them in different ways.Ralph was a very charismatic leader in the way he spoke and the way he carried himself. He was strong and seemed to be the only kid on the island thinking straight. Ralph's thought process was adult like and very advanced for most twelve-year-old kids. Although there isn't much in Ralph's character to pick on, I will say one thing. I felt when he and Piggy were being threatened they should have tried a little harder to stand up for themselves. He was a strongly spoken person but didn't like to be violent in any way and wasn't sure how to take care of threatening situations when all alone. I'm not saying he should have also resorted to killing, as the others did. I feel he should have tried to at least build some sort of shelter in a secluded part of the island to protect he and Piggy from \\"the hunters\\". Even with his faults in my mind he was a much better leader than Jack.Jack was the exact opposite of Ralph in my mind. His character was great and it was interesting to read about both Jack and Ralph in the same novel. When Ralph asked for order Jack would fire back with profanity and defiance of all attempts to be civil on the island. Jack's character is also hard to criticize because I was able to see were he was coming from in his thinking. Yes he did go a little far, but we never knew how we would act when faced with the same situation. If I were to pick at the character of Jack I would have to pick at all the hunters. I can't see how the young kids could have become so violent toward everything and care so little about life. That was a little unbelievable but I still enjoyed the story line.I like the way this book was put together from the beginning to the end. The mounting suspense kept me wanting to read more. The only complaint I have about the structure of the story is the end. It just ended, it wasn't a bad ending, but I felt like I was left with a lot on my plate. In my opinion the end is definitely the most difficult to get down well on paper but I felt that Golding could have done a little better with it.I really enjoyed this story including content and characters. All of my critiques are purely my attempt to find something in this novel to pick on. I felt that the novel was very well written and I liked all the characters to some extent."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What can I say? I LOVED this book!! I read it in my own free time and not for school, perhaps that is why I liked it. But I also found the story line gripping and Golding's style of writing with his descriptions excellent! It seems to be the sort of book that you either hate or like, and I'm sorry that there are people out there who, unlike me, thought the book was awful."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was interesting enough to want to finish it, but it had some room for improvement. The ending was pretty good - if you could understand it. Everyone who said that it was a dumb ending just didn't understand what the author was trying to convey. It was a good way to portray a group of boys who are stranded on an island woth no adult supervision. I'd recommend this book to people in the age group of 12-16."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is rather controversial; it is well-written, so much that people who disagree with Golding's themes loathe it with a passion, and others are entranced with an equal passion -- I was one of the latter. He has a descriptive style, but not long-winded. This a book full of irony, pain, and one that can truly take someone's breath away. It stays a classic for a reason. I loved it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the most detailed and graphically depictive books,as it explores the extreme darkness of the human soul and asks the most common question:&quot;How far will one go to survive?&quot; One of the downsides of this book is that some of the dialogue is confusing and,someties,is annoying. Some of the events,such as the pig hunts,are very descriptive and thought provoking,it makes you feel as though you are there. This book is hard to judge as the quality over all is a little inconsistent,but the book is still enjoyable.And by the don't listen to that &quot;Venezuelan reader&quot;guy,he dosen't even speak correct english."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book was poorly written. The best writing can be found only in the segments discussing the scenery. I thought the idea of the book was great but some of the analagies made are somewhat unrealistic. Although people do become crazy (especially 12 year-old boys) the characters in the novel were extremes of each stereotype. Ralph was far too angry and it is realitively unrealistic to find an utter satist like Roger, going to a private catholic school. I thought the best part of the book was the symbolism. The book is reasonably OK but extremely overated. If anyone is interested in a female and more racy version of the same sort of book I recomend &quot;John Dollar&quot;."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"While reading this book, I found that I couldn't put it down! Even with some of the more descriptive parts, dealing with the killing of the pig, and Simon, ect., I was repulsed, yet at the same time I was captivated. I's definately worth reading, but not if you're sensitive to violence."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that this book is a great example of how corruption can begin and infectiously spread through a seemingly good group of boys. It is great for teenagers and adults to read to see how easy it really is to fall into the bad crowd because you are scared of being a leader of your life and future."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was very well writen and was worth my money.It was an good book about survival and it shows how people really act without rules or laws to live by."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Overall, I liked Lord of the Flies. Golding developed the plot well and there were not any of the dry, boring parts which make me yawn and want to stop reading. I appreciated that the plot didn't make the ending obvious. A weak point of the book which bothered me was that all the dead bodies were conveniently washed out to sea. Reading this book made me think about human nature and the different ways different types of people react. Simon, in my opinion, was the best character since he could step back and look at events and decisions from a different perspective. I believe he was a very crucial character, who was not too wrapped up in himself. Showing him helping the littluns get fruit was good since it points out that there is good in human nature. I found the conflict between Ralph and Jack to be intriguing. I like how Golding showed the struggle between good and evil through out the book. This is an intriguing and thought-provoking book which I recommend to almost everyone."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I was a little worried about what kind of book it was in the beginning, but I am really glad that I stuck with it till the very end. Golding did an excellent job of describing where the boys had landed and what the boys looked like. Golding used the simple technique called description that captivated my attention from the very first chapter. Golding really knows how to right a book to engulf readers who really don't like to read. I would recommend this book to those who like an interesting book that is filled with suspense, the fight between good and evil, and the change from adolescence to adulthood."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book shows people what happens when you face the realities of war. Fear,hope, and courage are all spliced into one which is something that you don't often see in one book. This book shows people how children's fears lead them to fighting. The more they fight the farther and farther they feel from home."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's novel, Lord of the Flies was an intresting novel. At first, it took much time to figure out the symbolism Golding was expressing. In the beginning it was extremely hard to for me to follow. I found myself quite dumbfounded at times when their were hidden meanings behind the plot. Without my teachers explanation I wouldn't have been able to get through the novel and understand it like I should. I enjoyed the characters, the each came to life by Golding's description's, and their actions and behavior. I thought it was intresting, that a &quot;beastie&quot; can be imaginary, and hidden inside one's self. However, even though I was complexed, when reading the novel's resolution it clicked, and I was at once understanding the book. I am enamoured by the novel's theme; at any age, their is always a seed of evil inside of you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We did not think that the book was very good because up unitl the last few chapters it was soooooooo boring. It took a while for the book to get interesting. It was very disturbing to see 11 and 12 year old boys wanting to kill each other and hurt each other. We liked how there was a lot of symbolism in the book and how it related to what was going on in the time period in which the book took place."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We think that the book, Lord of the Flies, was just 'ok'. It was an intense way of looking at a goodlife. We believe that the message of the novel was always have hope. We thought it could have ended better, but it pulled it all together well. Although we were bored at times, we liked the way Golding had items symbolize ideas. The book was different then ones we have read in the past, therefore, it broadened our views of good versus evil."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The novel showed people trying to make a society out of the situation they were in. It also showed, evil, fear, and hope that the boys experience on the island in the form of many symbolic elements in the novel."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The most interesting parts in the book were when the boys saw the parachutist on top of the mountain and thought he was a monster.

It is not a book that is easily accessable. It was hard to understand the symbolism and hidden features. It was hard to grasp some of the themes.

It shows us that no matter how young, or old you may be you still have that seed of evil hidden inside of you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The most interesting parts in the book were when the boys saw the parachutist on top of the mountain and thought he was a monster.

The characters were pretty realistic and related to the people of today."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Everyone who has insulted this book, is a completely unintelligent person. I mean, the way Golding describes the island, and the way that the boys strive to survive is the way any group of 13 year old boys put in that situation would react. This is a great book until the end."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that Golding was trying to tell his readers that there is a need for rules and civilization.I agree with Golding because if there were no rules or guidelines to abide by then people would go crazy and we would end up in total chaos.I think Golding's best literary element in Lord of the Flies was his characters he created. Each person was very different from each other. I think it could be believable because without a set of rules or regulations people would act the way the boy's acted in the book.I think the book was fine.I just would've changed some of the beginning so it wouldn't drag as much as it did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The author wanted to show you the lost of innocence. I agree with the author because the boys were so innocent in the beginning but as time goes bye that soon changes. The author best handled symbolism. For example, the conch represented authority and Piggy's glasses represented nearsightedness. These symbols helped me understand the book. The book wasn't believable because I don't think that a bunch of boys ranging from the ages of 5 and 13 can really survive on an island all by themselves. I think the author shouldn't have Piggy and Simon die in such a cruel way. If I had a choice I would've let them live and I would've had Ralph and Jack become friends again.Overall, I thought the book was good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The sequence of events throughout the story were very well designed through the way of Golding's description abilities. Sure, sometimes it does become annoying and you lose your place a lot, or you can't understand what's going on or who's doing what. Yet, it was still good. The book was, though, within the greater whole, a well written believeable piece. Some of what happened could happen and some of if really isn't that believable. Yet, with how well Golding described it as if he was actually seeing it, that helped get the effect of it being real. Also, none of us really know what would happen if we got stranded on an island. So we don't know how true or untrue the whole actions of the situation are. Some people might agree or not with what all I have said, because everyone interprets things differently, but this is what I think"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is about a group of boys stranded on an island due to a plane wreck. Everything starts out ok with everyone getting along and helping each other survive. But then something goes wrong and everyone turns on Ralph, the designated leader and he becomes the one that is hunted. This book really affected me in that it actually made me feel disgusted. That doesn't mean that it wasn't a good book because I thought this book was great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I really enjoyed William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies. It was adventurous, tragic, and very convincing. If you like novels that start off shaky with a high climax and end not happy but not sad you'll love Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After I read Lord of the Flies I learned the importance of humans in this planet. Lord of the flies is a book that reflects the behavior of humans when trying to adapt into a primordial environment. The main characters in this book are Jack and Ralph, and a group of schoolboys that get stranded on a deserted island after their plane crashes. Ralph takes over and gives rules to the other boys, trying to keep order, sort of like a society created from scratch. Jack, on the other hand, becomes almost caveman-like, trying to impose his own Darwinian rule over the other boys. It seems as though his only rule is that there are no rules, and everyone that wants to survive must learn to fight for everything that they have. I think that one of the biggest fears that humans have in our consumer society today is not really death, but being left to fend for themselves with no televisions, or jobs, or cars, or restaurants. I think that the movie \\"the Blair witch project\\" tries to deliver the same sort of general madness that people experience when they are left out on the fringes of \\"normal\\" society. People go insane when they find themselves in a situation where there is nothing to do but try to survive, pretty much like an animal. It's sort of like a reversion back to our original instincts which couldn't have been all that different from animals: eat, sleep, and procreate. I think that Goldwing developed a good and interesting story showing different aspects of our own personalities exemplified by different characters. Jack is one aspect, of course the side of us that wants calmness and order. Ralph is the opposite side of the coin, while Piggy just wants simple pleasures, without concern for order or for savage instincts. In conclusion I recommend this book to people that are interested on drama and moral complexity. It is not a book for the faint hearted or people looking for a straight forward story of good and bad."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Good read, shows how out of control 'rational' thought can become in the face of mob mentality. A lesson we should learn, but seldom do."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book by Golding is a wonderful.I think his purpose for writing this book is to show how horrible and out of control the kids would be on the island with out any adults. I also think he did an excellent job describing each character and giving them their own ways of doing things. This book beleivable because I know if you leave a bunch of children on an island alone, sooner or later they will show their true colors. There is one part that I did not like and that is when Jack kills the female pig, guts her and puts her head on a stick."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was pretty good.

Although it's been 50 years, his story remains timeless. It deals with the pure essence of what it is to be human, and how it is to loose that humanity. The event begins as a group of boys find themselves alone on a deserted island after a severe plane crash; they are quickly drawn toguether by a conch blown by Ralph. Since the very beggining of the book a conflict of interest is noted between Ralph, the leader; and Jack, the hunter. This conflict does nothing but expand and broaden, until finally all hell breaks loose. Lord of the Flies is more than a story, it's a walking breathing epic of symbolism, as colourfull, lively and destructive as the human race itself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I was in high school a lot of my friends had to read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" for English (like it seems most people do) but for whatever reason my teacher did not have us read it. So, after hearing good and bad about it I decided to give it a try.I am sure everyone reading this is familiar with the story, but even if you already know it, nothing prepares you for actually sitting down and reading it. In fact, I would say that it worse when you knew what would happen. Golden presents an interesting character study that can be taken in numerous directions. As soon as the story opens we see who is who and the individual character traits for the boys and it quickly becomes apparently which boys will turn. This is not to say that the book is predictable- it's just (for lack of a better reference) like watching a car crash in slow motion.I would recommend this to anyone. It's a very easy read and the story is one that you can interpret in all different ways."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this listed when I searched for children's books for 4 - 8 year olds, showing up with things like Good Night Moon. I would not want to discourage anyone from reading this book, because the story is classic, but I simply think it's worth mentioning for any parents who might not know: this is NOT something to read to your 4 year old. As mentioned in other reviews, it is very dark and possibly upsetting. Animal Farm, which comes up along with this is also a wonderful book that is better read in Junior High than First grade."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a poignant, allegorical novel which offers an interesting view on human nature. Something raw and primitive in humans exists, it says. Golding artfully describes the boys' gradual descent from civilization to savagery from the day they arrive on the island.The boys end up on the island in the first place because they were to be evacuated. There is an accident of some sort and they land on the island. So begins the story...things will happen on the island to boys like Ralph, Piggy, Simon, and Jack that are unforgettable and sometimes tragic.One thing I would like to point out: Another reviewer who also used a kid's account says:Everything seems to be going well on the island until they discover the body of a dead pilot and mistake it for a terrible monster.Really, nothing ever went \\"well\\" on the island. From the beginning, there was a loss of life (a littlun with a birthmarked face). There was tension between Ralph and Jack during the election for chief. And even before that, imagery and other literary devices (such as foreshadowing) hinted at darkness which lay ahead. The reviewer is suggesting that had the corpse not been seen, everything would have ended happily. (S)he seems to be forgetting that the reason the corpse was thought of as a beast was because of talk of a beast (as well as shortsightedness). The boys were descending into barbarity; the \\"beast\\" was only one event which catalyzed the transformation.It is also a poignant coming of age story, where the boys understand what being a human can mean. It is a loss of innocence for many of the boys. Ralph's ordeal is followed in particular. The reader also sees the others' struggles. Yes, one ought to feel sorry for Jack as well, who, through bloodshed & other things, has now opened his eyes to the world, which is often ugly.All in all, it's a memorable tale. Some have evidently read it as nothing more than an adventure tale. But, it has much more than a simple chain of events. Golding's book is laden with messages, if one ponders upon his writing."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"Awwwwwww\\" screamed the Littlun, \\"It's a beast\\". The older boys reassure them that it's only their imagination, because that's all the littluns have for comfort. English boys stranded on an island with no first aid kit, nor any food. They have to try and stick it out and build some sort of a community until they get rescued. But along this journey, survival becomes betrayal, and back stabbing. Ralph, the main character, convinces everyone that they all have a part in living, and having some part of getting saved. But the rebel of the island, Jack, has a different plan. Becoming obsessed with killing and ruling above everyone, including the leader Ralph. They try, Ralph's plan but all fails and chaos strikes, with Jack leading the way. Tragedy strikes among the fellow children and death rises of this mysterious island. This book is a great book and is recommended to all ages and genders. Just let your imagination explores and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this microcosmic society created by the mind of Golding, things got too ridiculous too quick. First all the boys crash on this deserted island after being shot down by a bomber. Within a few days they burnt down half the island killing a boy and broke up into groups with a killing machine and a democratic leader. Needless to say they start by killing the weakest and last killing the smartest. The only problem with this is that they are only twelve year old boys who at the very least could have a civil war within a matter of days.I think Golding had a great point of what a society would do to itself and he showed the power children had which was in fact, just a minor display in comparison to the great civil wars within our own countries. The only deal with this is that it wasn't very believable. Aside from that he perfectly displayed his point. He portrayed every character as a crucial member of society. You have Ralph who's the democratic leader believing in order, Jack who was the dictator or person that believed in his own way, Piggy the smart one who had all the right ideas, and Simon who was the more spiritual one who rather would do his own thing and believed in helping others and looking out for the smaller weaker children. You could see this in each person and connect in some way because Golding always displayed them doing the very things you saw them out for. At any rate I would at least say read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book lord of the flies written by William Golding was a very good novel. It was a revelation to the real world. Golding is an awesome writer with a brilliant mind, he uses allegories and everything is a symbol. All of the characters stand for something or a certain group. For instance jack stands for the bully and piggy stands for intelligence and civilization. The conch stands for order and authority and the paint the boys put on their face stands for chaos and savagery. My favorite part of this book was the death of Simon. It was so brutal yet it added so much meaning and mood to this story.In this book the author is showing us how we as humans behave and how our actions affect us. How we are all savages in reality even though some are worse than others. This book shows how the island was like a miniature world and how humans would act. The intresting part about this book was that at the time it took place a war was happening. The events related to what the adults were doing at the same time. I think that you should read this book in order to understand correctly our nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a very interesting book. This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you. If not the I dont think that this book is for you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I, like many people, was forced to read this book for English class. This book became more of a want to read, than a have to read. The symbolism of anarchy and deterioration are developed gracefully throughout this novel. While, it does become a bit crude and a bit morose but that only serves to push foward the message of deterioration under anarchy. This is definitely a great message to get across!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A plane full of schoolkids crashes on an island. At first they get along, but as they attempt to survive, they have to access some of the most primal parts of their soul in order to hunt and stay alive. Whatever fears and beasts they're forced to unleash within themselves soon overpower and posess them, and soon kids are dying left and right, kids are fighting and killing and running and hiding.What a cool book.What a cool book!American high schoolers should consider themselves lucky to be assigned to read a book this fast-paced, this dark, this twisted, and this original. It's certainly not \\"Moby Dick.\\" This book is violent and sudden (and gorgeously written) and asks many deep questions you may not be able to answer.What would you do to survive?What's your breaking point?What are you really like?It's an amazing and terrifying novel about the loss of innocence, about growing up in insane and scary world, and about the darkest parts of all of us.Read it, scare yourself, squirm in fear.Taste the suspense, feel the terror, and try to ignore the author's occasional, almost loving descriptions of the buttocks and body parts of young boys. Some British authors just seem to like to throw those in once in a while. I'm not sure why; it's weird."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Certainly a text of vast philisophical importance, Lord of the Flies is first and foremost a riveting and rapid read. The descent of the unstoppable rollercoaster of terror allows the reader to experience firsthand madness, sadism, torture, survival, and killing. One of my favorite books, and one of the scariest I've ever read. Its all about entertainment, folks."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think this book is easy to read but hard to understand. Though it is hard to understand, it is a good book to read. It's a story about these kids that get stuck on an island and have to survive for a long period of time. They learn to find food, keep warm, and not to go crazy. But after a while, the kids will be separated and do there on things. This book is about survival and how to get along with everybody. Also to keep cool in bad situations.

Ideal for armchair philosophers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding's classic seems to be misunderstood by many readers. I do not feel that The Lord of the Flies was a book advocating atavism (the return to primitive instincts) nor a book about male bonding. The Lord of the Flies deals with &quot;man's essential illness&quot; -- the potential of all human beings to exhibit an evil nature. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is the English equivalent to Beelzebub, another name for the devil. In the book, Simon's obvious similarities to the Christ figure further the validity of an interpretation of this book as a representation of the continous conflict between good and evil within human beings -- &quot;at once heroic and sick&quot; -- and the implication of societal restraints, or a lack thereof. Reading this book will provide valuable insights into human nature as well an engaging story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The main reason why I didn't like this book too much was because I couldn't relate the way that the people lived. The lesson that I got from this book was that real friendships are hard to come by. Real friends are those who cares and treats you for the real you. Even though real friendships are hard to come by, there will be one of them for at least one time of your life. Don't throw that away. After reading this book, I feel lucky for the friends that I have because not everybody will have the same luck that I have had of having them."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this novel a long time ago in its Russiantranslation (a reasonably good one), but it goeswithout saying that the original is vastly superior to any translation.The entire novel is symbolist - from the very firstsentence to the very last, and in this symbolism lie both its strength and its greatest weakness. The problem is: it is *too* neatly symbolic, all symbols fit too perfectly into the author's preconceptions. This book is definitely a fable (as opposed to fiction), but for a fable it is a very good one."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Here is my literal interpretation of Lord of the Flies.It is a novel about children, and one of the few novels ever written about children that does not turn them into creatures of myth. Think about it. In becoming adults, we assume a very distant and elegaic picture of the beings we once were.Happy.Carefree.Innocent.All of which is so much bulldust. Happy? Childhood is a period of time spent in constant waiting for the transformation to adulthood. No, we weren't happy. Carefree? Hardly. Reckless and foolish, perhaps, but every child has its worries: we all remember the monster under the bed. And innocent? A child is innocent up to the period when it encounters other children. Bang - end of innocence. In group formation, we learn the real truth of the world. And that, really, is what happens on Golding's island. There is plenty of analysis to be done on the allegorical nature of the story, and its laid on thick symbolism. But it also succeeds merely as a tale, something that might have happened. And we read on, horrified, ensnared by complete and utter _plausability_. And as a final word, it is not that surprising that Lord of the Flies should remain such a controversial work, school reading assignments notwithstanding. As someone who I've inexcusably forgotten once said, &quot;If you make someone think they're thinking, they'll love you; If you _really_ make someone think, they'll hate you.&quot;"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"When I fisrt heard of the story and of the ideabehind this book, I thought it could really be agreat novel. The main idea is to propose a metaphor of what our societies are like, but from the point of view of children lost on a desert island. They &quot;build&quot; their own little society, with a chief and people who have to do some tasks if they want to survive. Well, the setting sounds really cool, doesn't it?That's why I wanted to read this book, and I was not compelled to read it by one of my teachers. But when I finished it, I was very disappointed. The basic idea is great, but the way it is developed is flawed. You just have kids who go crzay and wild because there are no more adults above them to tell them what to do or not. And moreover, when trying to show us a bit of what is our history, and an insight into the development of our civilizations, Golding forget many very important things along the way.As a matter of fact, there are no women on the island (or, well, no little girl to fall in love with). And thus, no Queen to fight for. Another example : no power behind the throne. It's just a story about survival, fisrt against Nature, and then of course against humankind (here, other children).I think that's why on one hand I loved this book, because of the setting, the ideas, and also the story. But on the other hand, this work is only a draft, not really complete and definitive (ok, no work is definitive, if you see what I mean). Sometimes when I read a book, I feel that it is the _ultimate_ novel about a subject, and I felt that for _The old mand and the sea_ (Hemingway) or _The Plague_ (Camus). This book is a good one, worth reading, but I'm sure someone can write a far better novel on this topic, and that's why I think it only deserves a 6 rating."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"You may be wondering why there are such drastic variations in the reviews of this book. One reason that so many hate it, as another reviewer pointed out, is that many were forced to read it at school which most definately would put a damper on their enthusiasm. Another is the different ways in which people approached it. Some came into it expecting a Swiss Family Robinson or Hatchet type book, in which a group of boys in a plane crash struggle to survive. Many of these readers were probably appalled at much of the symbolism and Golding's strange style of writing. Those of us who came at it expecting this type of literature were drawn into the book. If you are the first type of reader, I would not recommend this book, but if you are the latter and haven't read it yet, read it now! I am not going to go too far into my own interpretations of this book, but I am going to say it is one of the best pices of writing I have ever read. Golding puts you on this island with the boys (in my opinion I don't think you are supposed to question what happened before the plane crash or how they got there. it is irrelevant and the author doesn't give much information on it, much to the frustration of some readers) and they start out much as you would expect them to. One boy takes command and they build their shelters, gather food, all of the things you are supposed to do in this situation. But then things go terribly, terribly wrong and the dark side, the Id as Freud might have called it, comes to the surface and the boys become horrible savages, and you are shocked to see the children's innocent exterior melt away. And then, at the gut-wrenching climax, they are suddenly seen again from an adult's eyes for what they really are.

It's about a vast group of boys who are marooned on an island and forced to create their own society. Without parents to guide them, the boys slowly let go of civilization and their savage nature emerges.My favorite part of the book is where the group of boys are fully consumed by the primal evil that dwells in their hearts. Their feelings of fear and rage rise up and force them over the edge. They snap and kill their friend Piggy by crushing him with a boulder.I recommend this book because it puts you in a state of mind where logic is bent and twisted. It gives you a peek at insanity. This book has non-stop action and it allows you to vividly imagine what is going on. I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This novel is unquestionably my favorite book. I enjoyed every minute of the text, and enjoyed analyzing it even more. With highlighter and marking pen in hand i went page by page and discovered the true depth of William Golding's writing in the tale of a band of young and adolescent boys whose plane crashes onto an uncharted island, and in the absence of adults they create their own world complete with government, conflict, and even bloodshed. In this ultimately dark novel, one witnesses Golding's unparalleled talent in storytelling as a means of intelligent propaganda, the story itself being a microcosm of the world war that was going on at the time. It's a fascinating read, whether you choose to read it for its deepest meaning or its most simple.I highly reccommend reading this book. Though a mere high school senior, as a well-read student/bookworm I have not been met with any classic or modern novel that has captivated me with every word in the way this novel has."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding addresses what happens to society if the norms are broken down and anarchy takes its place. Golding uses English school boys stranded on a remote desert isle for his study of society. At first, the boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as food gathering and keeping a signal fire for search and rescue attempts. Not long afterward, Jack challenges Ralph and lures the boys away to live like savages hunting wild pigs and running around in paint. As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends.Lord of the Flies is an intense look at larger society if the norms are ever overturned. At first it is fun acting any way one wants when there are no adults to oversee. However, the mundane chores stop being done and order breaks down. The young children that were being looked after, just disappear without reason and nobody seems to mind or notice. The savage group reacts alomost with casual abandon when one of the group is accidentally killed by the rest. When order is tried to be reinstated, chaos reacts swiftly and harshly.

This book follows the day to day life on the island, cooking, hunting, and the desperate struggle to keep their smoke signal going. However, as civilized as these children appear at the start of the book, the call of their savage, human, inner soul is too strong for them, and the instinct to survive forces them to undergo a a shocking and terrible change. The book, using dramatic imagery and a disturbing plot drew me into its fast paced world, where I discovered shocking and horrifying secrets about the human spirit let loose. The book was severely disquieting, yet its strong and bewitching plot made me read on. Ending with a roar, this masterpiece alarmed me greatly, yet I still recommend it to a young adult reader who is willing to let a gripping page-turner sweep them away to a land that they have never dreamed of."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although it is a social commentary, similar to &quot;Heart of Darkness,&quot; containing a pessimisstic view of human nature, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is also an adventure novel. A scatter of British schoolboys are stranded on an island paradise, and they form a little ordered assembly, which, according to the rules of Murphy's Law, goes to pi. It is a stark, beautiful book, which near perfect writing. What do I mean by this? It's not just well-written, but it is perfectly focused, perfectly edited. Think of the Western &quot;High Noon.&quot; Every line of dialogue was key in revealing the plot. There was no one standing around and just explaining things, like in &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot; Things are expounded through actions, through thought, so that every word has meaning, and every meaning, entertainment value. I'm surprised at those who found it boring. I can't offer any persuasion -- you have to be willing to read it, and it won't appeal to everyone. But the reason this book is so terribly disturbing is that it is so &gt;realistic&lt;. Not to give away any major plot happenings, but recent (within the last year or so) news events only make some of the more grisly things in the book seem closer to home, and therefore more unsettling, which is maybe why a lot of readers found it too shocking to appreciate. Just try not to think about the symbols when you first read it, and think of it as an adventure book.

Baring in mind that it was written during the time of WW2 and the Nuremburg War Trials it is not surprising that the book discusses the essential evilness of man. It is a harrowing tale of a group of young boys stranded on an island and the slow descention into a savage existence. What makes the book so brilliant yet so disturbing is that it cronicles the feelings each and everyone of us have felt at some stage of our lives. One is prompted to ask the question, &quot; In a world dominated by humans, in a world in which we have progressed so drastically what seperates us from animals?&quot; It is bleak but true and the deep psycological symbolism of the characters and the events make it something special and deserved of its reputation as one of the key books of the 20th century. Like &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot; Heart of Darkness&quot; it make us think about humanity and makes us question our existence.

It must have happened at some point, that a group of people declared themselves worthy to judge for our youth what would teach them to love reading, what made a good story.I love reading. I love a good story. I hate Lord of the Flies.As hard as the educational system tried to force me to read and appreciate their endless list of disturbing books, I still love reading good ones. And when I think back on these school-supported pieces of filth, Lord of the Flies stands out as the top representative of what is awful in a book.I get what the man was going for, what he was trying to say about humanity. I wish I could say he was dead wrong about human nature but indeed I think he accomplished just what he set out to do. That got the novel one extra star. No more. Yes, when left to their own devices, a group of innocents could very well turn savage.And that's exactly what is wrong with making young people read it. Is there no other novel to teach them about human nature? They'll hate whatever we give them, true, and maybe that's why they have been given such vile specimens, to save the good books for them to appreciate later. But it's no excuse...When I read this in school, it was horrible enough in print, but then they saw to it that we watched a dank, dark, desolate motion-picture rendition as well, in order that we might forever have burned into our memories the image of a little boy being speared by bullies and a plump boy being crushed by a boulder shoved by those bullies. All it did was give kids nightmares and serve to punctuate the message they'd been sending us all through school: bullies will have their way and adults will remain absorbed in their own problems and let them.Some people like a book that makes them feel, whether the emotion be good or bad. By all means, if you don't care how you feel so long as you're feeling something, read this book.But if you're a teen who has been depressed, living with harsh conditions, facing problems without seeming to find anyone on your side, lay the book down. Read a nice mystery, Jane Austen, Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams, something that will make life have a little joy in it. Lord of the Flies has been written with the singular ability to suck out whatever joy remains.Shame on anyone who decides this is the sort of book, out of all that were ever written, that young people should read. We are not all stable, healthy, sheltered innocents who need to see the gritty side for our own good.Now bring on the \\"not helpful\\" ratings that will be assigned by all those who have already read it and like it and don't really need to read a review anyway."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a fine piece of literature.

Before long, the boys begin turning theirattention to the leader of the pack and his friend &quot;Piggy&quot;.The book depicts some of the worst human emotions ofchildren . It progresses from an understandablerestlessness to progressive violence and ultimately murder.This is a good rendition of group dynamics includingleadership, role-playing, group cohesiveness, the breakdownof group cohesiveness and the complex dynamicinvolving rewards and punishments in the pursuit ofgroup goals.The work depicts both the positive side and negative sideof group conflict. Its positive side is constructiveargument leading to a successful resolution of a problem.The negative side is violence in the pursuit of groupsurvival goals. In the instant case, the violence is directedtoward &quot;Piggy&quot; whose pleadings to move the group towardconstructive conflict resolution are ignored. Ultimately,the group embraces &quot;the herd mentality&quot; until the consequencesof its murderous actions are irreversible. The chaosseems to halt when an authority figure steps off a searchboat and views the scene for the first time. There aremany lessons to be learned from this work. These range fromgroup cooperation to the negative impact of group deviancyfrom normal modes of civil conduct. The work is appropriate foryoung teenagers, persons studying group dynamics and othersinterested in quality English literature. The work is wellwritten. The sentence construction is good for a book depictingsmall talk between and amongst typical teenage boys in middleschool. The work shows how groups deteriorate into destructivebehavioral modes when logical problem resolution fails toproduce generally acceptable alternatives.A typical assignment might be to read this book and havethe class critique it in small groups of 4-5 students.Participants could discuss control points surrounding thebreakdown of order, as well as alternative negotiationstrategies aimed at enhancing group cooperation/cohesion."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read it on my own, i wasn't forced to, like most people, i like books like this that kind of 'criticize' society.

In Lord of The Flies, these England boys got to experience this first handed. If you like suspense/action stories, this book will be a real page-turner for you. This book shows how young people can also make big mistakes in a time of need. It also shows how having good friends can really make a difference, and how you should never take your friends for granted because there might not ever be another friend as good. After I finished reading this book, I thought about how lucky I was to be here and know that I have friends that care for me. I never took another friend for granted afterwards."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Civilization didn't start off orderly and peaceful.

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 14 or 15. But, it is a great novel for older readers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The symbolization and all of the hidden messages in Golding's work is what makes it such a classic. Golding's work can be viewed from so many different perspectives. Some people see his work as just a fictional story written for pure enjoyment. Others view his work as ridicule to British society and government. Still others see his work as a message of what he believes human nature really is, evil. I believe the latter of the three ideas. Golding was trying to reveal to his readers that he believed a society without rules and regulations would lead to a world of true human nature, in his ideas that would be evil. In the story the deserted boys at first do not know what to do. The two eldest boys Ralph and Jack decide that their needs to be a leader and that leader should be chose by a vote. They also decide their needs to be rules and punishment for when the rules are not followed. The ideas that the boys have prove that Golding's idea that they are still restricted from being their true selves because of society's conditioning. As we proceed we see that the some of the children are less apt to being \\"good\\" because the restraints that society has put on them has been lifted. Some children without society are now running wild and acting like savages; the island is in complete chaos. Some of the boys are still trying to keep order and in turn we get the battle of \\"good versus evil.\\" In the end the boys are rescued because of this battle; the island is set on fire and because of the flames they are noticed and rescued. The book is wonderfully written and has so many more meanings then I have even mentioned. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for either a leisure book or a book that they can analyze. The novel is such a classic because it allows the reader to make his or her own choice about what the book really is about."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As you no doubt know, this book i san attempt to portray the evil throughout history and the fall of innocence. This book does just that perfectly. At the beginning of the book, nearly all as well. The turning point is the slaughter of a pig, an event whose symbolism can become more clear later. The Cliffs Notes available for a low price greatly enhance the reading, and define several British words used. Also, the characters and their allegorical symbolism are explained. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was an extreamly suspenseful book. It is about many boys between the ages of 5-13, who are stranded on an island. They lose control over themselves, and forget what it means to be proper.

William Golding uses a lot of description and created an incrredible book!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A terrifying variation on the traditional boys' adventure story. The book give insight on the duality of human nature - the divide between order and chaos, intellect and instinct, structure and savagery. But however chillingly frigtening Golding's depiction of the dark side of human nature doesnt come across as shocking due to his masterful use of symbolism and foreshadowing. While there's no promise that it'll be enjoable for some readers, it's guaranteed to be unforgettable, which is why i guess, it remains a cult favourite."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was the text book when i was in 12th grade. i didn't read it fully until after my exams.guess what i read the book at least 5 times after that. The story shows how the human society evolves and gets the shades of the good and the evil. Golding makes it a point that it does not depend whether the humans were superior or inferior (he chose a group of well behaved English boys.....supposedly the best in good behaviour, oderliness and intelligence) or the sorroundings are good or bad (a tropical island.......lush green vegetation, beautiful beaches.....a heavenly sorrounding). also the group was cut off from outside influence so that the factor of influence from existing society norms is discounted. but even though the givens were the best, what finally the group of boys turned into is startling. certainly a must read if looking for some serious reading."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by William Golding is one of the best books I have ever read. It shows that the line between civilization and barbarism is narrow. People are capable of doing heroic things and committing horrible acts of cruelty under the right circumstances. Golding has perfectly captured the tensions inherent in human nature.Golding has created a scenario where a group of boys were marooned on an island after a plane accident. No adult survivors were to be found. The boys came together, chose a leader, and created a system to organize life on the island. At first, the boys were enjoying the carefree life. Ralph was the boy who was chosen as the democratically elected leader. Piggy was his intellectual friend who had several physical maladies. The stronger boys on the island resented his presence and did not appreciate the talents he brought to the table.Jack was the antagonist of the story. He wanted to be the leader, but the boys feared him and were more comfortable with Ralph in charge. Ralph called the boys to assembly with a conch shell, a primary symbol in the book. Jack led a group of boys to hunt for meat. He killed a pig and put the head of a swine on a pole. It was surrounded by flies and created a horrible sight.The amiable early days in a tropical paradise soon came to an end. Jack led a mutiny against Ralph. He attracted the boys by asserting his power. The members of his group painted themselves like savages and lost their inhibitions. The group became more and more barbarous. Jack became a dictator who ruled by fear and the other boys fell in line and did his bidding. Jack and his gang killed Piggy, which was metaphorical of the might makes right line of thinking in Social Darwinism. Ralph managed to escape with his life as British troops came to the rescue. The boys contemplated the horror on the island and were moved to tears.This book shows that society can fall apart quickly without safeguards. It shows that all people are capable of evil under certain circumstances. It is a sober warning to protect freedom. Golding fought against the Nazis in World War II and saw people not too different from himself be capable of joining a bandwagon and committing acts of unspeakable cruelty. This book offers the reminder that we should all look at ourselves and keep the beast within under control. The biggest threat to civilization is found within human beings, not from outside entities."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is Nobel Prize winner William Golding's vision of what would happen if a group of schoolboys was marooned on a sub-tropical island. The descent to tribalism and savagery is not reassuring, but Golding may well have been right for all that. He gave them a relatively hospitable environment; not populated with dangerous wild beasts, capable of feeding them and providing fuel, and with a warm sea for swimming. They established a forum, elected a leader, appointed certain boys to particular roles, and set about maintaining a column of rising smoke to draw the attention of any passing ships. The smoke, and the fire generating it, become a major theme of the book. The fire gets out of control and a boy disappears, presumed burned. Serious tension arises when the group assigned to maintaining the fire chooses instead to hunt wild pigs; a ship is briefly seen on the horizon, but at that critical time there is no smoke from the island to attract it. The fire is moved to a more accessible place on the island, but at cost to visibility. Then the hunters, who quickly become a majority of the boys, set themselves up as a separate community on a different part of the island. They lack fire, so set about stealing it. Had they asked, it would have been given to them. Then it occurs to them to take by force the means to make fire.As I read the book I was moved to recall social relationships and conflicts in the classrooms and playgrounds of my own experience, and to reflect on the value to growing children of the oft-resented adult ordering of the world. One could read and enjoy the book at that level and leave it there. But, if we are minded to follow, Golding offers to take us further. It seems the world beyond the island is engaged in nuclear conflict. Can the adults be imagined to have got things right? How did they get themselves into that mutually destructive situation? Has the adult world not also descended into tribalism and savagery?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. I'm not one who enjoys books of this sort and when I began reading the first chapters, I strongly disliked it. The first chapters are slow and hard to follow along and the symbolism can be tiring. However, once you get further into the book, small things happen that leave a reader wondering and you can't help but continue to read on and on. One cannot help but make connections over and over again when reading LotF.LotF really works your mind. Nearly everything in the book is a symbol of something else. This given fact leaves you wondering what everything could represent, from Piggy's glasses to the beast. You'll find yourself cheering on either Ralph or Jack and you will feel like you are fighting to survive with everyone else. The details paint such a vivid image in the reader's mind that you'll feel as if you were there. A reader will be lost in the movie in their head.I do reccomend reading Lord of the Flies & I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although the story of the book was decent, and the symbolism very complex, I did not really agree with the message of the book, and found its theme unrealistic. I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government, such as in the beginning of the book.The desires of the boys to \\"just have fun\\" were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example, not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family, and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English, and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world, the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.Secondly, the overwhelming desire for meat, which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans, is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh, Piggy, Jack, and Simon."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Golding portrays war as a seemingly inescapable and integral aspect of human culture. Humans, in any setting, can default towards their darker nature. Golding concedes that we have this nature but the moral of his story is that we must struggle to overcome it. Analogous to experimental design in a laboratory, Lord of the Flies is Golding's research study. In an effort to control for all variables, the research design encompasses subjects, pre-adolescent males, placed on a deserted island isolated from all societal variables. His hypothesis is that, inherent in human nature, if there are enough people to form groups, they will form factions and go to war. His experiment illustrates the darker side of human nature by controlling for as many factors as possible.Early in the experiment, the subjects attempt to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the political and social order of modern British society. Ralph, the natural leader, and Piggy, the detached intellectual, attempt to hold parliamentary assemblies, build living quarters and schedule common duties. However, as time passes, Jack and his \`tribe' break off from Ralph's chiefdom in order to avoid all forms of thankless toil and drudgery while enjoying superior opportunities for \`fun' lifestyles. Jack is solely interested in hunting which for him encompasses plunder, tribute, and glory. Ultimately, murder, mayhem and debauchery ensue. Through free will, the boys drift towards humanity's darker nature. Golding's experiment demonstrated that evil cannot be blamed on someone else or another culture because we are all inherently capable of evil.Golding wrote Lord of the Flies in the wake of World War II. The cold war was in high gear and people were still wondering about how the Holocaust could have happened. The book represents an effort to answer the question, \\"Why do humans keep doing such awful things to each other?\\" During the story, the reader is reminded of the outside world of adult war. Although not expounded upon, the reason the boys are stranded on the island is due to an atomic war that led to the boys being evacuated on planes. Later in the story, as a sign from the outside world, a pilot is shot down, apparently dies in the crash, and lands on the island. The dead body becomes the unseen mystical \`beastie' that the boys fear in their nightmares. For Golding, war is a societal evil. Golding reduces the greater evil to its lowest common denominator to show that war is not caused by an evil leader or evil country; the enemy is within."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"First off I really want to state how dissapointed I am that I did not enjoy Lord of The Flies more. The concept is one of the best in the history of literature: The balance between democracy and human nature is challenged when a group of upper class school children are stranded on a remote island and must struggle for survival and order. Genius! Golding is a good writer, but there was something missing from his writing that kept it from being as gripping as the works of Orwell, Huxley, and even Joseph Conrad (which this book is often compared to). I read 40 pages of this a day and when I stopped I never had the desire to go on and find out what happens next. Nor did I really care about any of the characters. I'm not sure if it was Golding's intention to make these characters two dimensional, but I honestly couldn't differentiate many of the children from the other: with the exception of Ralph, Jack, and Piggy.Saying that the novel does have alot merits. Golding really takes advantage of this setting, and has a great gift for detail. When I was reading this, I really did feel that I was toughing it out in the jungle. Also The pig head scene and the last 50 pages are fascinating, intense, and classic. The problem is that we have to go through 100 pages of Piggy shouting \\"I've got the conch!\\" and one tedious fire argument after the other to get there. Like I said before, I love the themes to this work, and love books about the dark side of human nature. Which is why I am so saddened that I didn't like this more. I know Lord of the Flies is and will continue to be seen as a classic among numerous literary enthusiasts, and I respect their opinion. I just don't wholeheartedly agree with it. Maybe I should watch the film."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The story of how some kids survive the life on an island is told brilliantly by William Golding.

Buy it and give it a try, you may feel nothing, or you may be moved more than words can describe.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is another one of those classic English novels that I somehow made it through school without ever reading. It was often referenced in other book discussions in classes and I had a very general feel for the overarching plot of the book, but I'd never actually read it. So, I finally did.For those who somehow haven't heard of the book or know anything about the story, it basically involves a bunch of British schoolboys (probably aged 6 or 7 through early/mid-teens). During wartime evacuation, the kids all crash land on a deserted island and are the lone survivors (no adults). Timeframes are somewhat ambiguous but over time, one of the kids, Ralph, becomes a \\"chief\\" of the group and comes up with plans for survival (shelters, food, etc) and escape (keeping a signal fire going with green wood/leaves nearby to send up a flurry of smoke). As time goes on, order is pulled apart either from youthful desire for fun over work or from coercion from Jack Merridew and his group of boys, \\"the choir.\\"The general plot of the story is interesting and reminded me a little bit of Robinson Crusoe and his desire to bring civilization and order to his little island. This book had more psychological themes going on though since there were many people on the island and they were all either very young kids or young teenagers pushing into self-consciousness and evaluation.The book provides interesting insight into the thoughts and desires of kids as they work towards adulthood. These kids are generally younger than what one might consider a \\"young adult\\" but they're forced into a very adult situation. We get to see a number of different reactions. These range from the strong desire to maintain order and civility by creating and enforcing rules based on ideas from the adult world to the youthful desire for fun unbridled now that there are no adults to stifle entertainment to the completely savage nature of play as the kids revert back to their savage natural state in the wild.Most of the people who saw me reading this book were quick to let me know how much they disliked it. I can see the reasons for distaste. The themes are harsh and uncomfortable. The end result of the story, even though it has a \\"happy ending\\", are does not provide a happy, enthusiastic view towards humanity.A lot of the writing style was very descriptive and evocative and just plain lovely to read. A lot of the theme and tone of the book was very unsettling and hard to read. This juxtaposition left me feeling mixed about the book. While I may not like the story or what it proposes to say about humanity, I can certainly appreciate the message it's trying to convey and the way it does it.There's a lot going on in this book and I certainly don't feel like I've unpacked it all. At the same time, I'm not particularly eager to go back and read it again to try and unpack more. I saw some definite commentary on humanity, on \\"civilization\\", on war, on psychology, religion, etc. I can see why it's taught in schools and see how it could provide intense discussions.However, I worry that some of the themes and concepts may be lost on too young a reader. And it may not even be an \\"age\\" thing as is shown by some of the events in the story. Just like some of the kids in the story were not ready for what they were forced to undertake, I would worry that if a child is too young or emotionally/intellectually immature, they may not recognize the message and allegory in the story and will either leave thinking it's just a fun adventure and (who knows) will strive to go out hunting boars themselves, or they could come away emotionally troubled without a good outlet to deal with it.I'm glad I read this. Not one of my favorites, but very thought provoking. I have no intention to hand it to my 11 year old to read (even though he's begged me to let him) but I'll gladly discuss it with him if/when it's assigned to him in High School."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Ever fantasize that you are on an island free from the restraints of society? William Golding has taken that scenario to the nth in this story of a bunch of English boys, plane wrecked on an island during WWII.We see the fabric of society slowly and most assuredly ripping as the rules are discarded one by one. Golding is very graphic in his description of the demise of pigs and plants.One will never look at fun and games in the same way.Lord of the Flies: Essential Art House"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I chose a five star rating because of the wonderful writing, but mostly because of the careful depiction of human depravity.

She enjoyed reading it with a group of friends too they share ideas on the story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, is a story about a group of boys who get stranded on an island in the Pacific Ocean because their plane crashed. The boys have to learn how to make their own food, look after themselves, make shelters, and make fires. They select Ralph to be the leader. Ralph, \\"the boy with fair hair\\", is twelve years old and tries to keep the boys in order by making rules, \\"'We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything'\\", but the boys don't follow the rules. Piggy is Ralph's sidekick who helps him make the rules and think of ways to help them survive longer. Piggy is slightly chubby so the boys make fun of him for that, especially Jack. Jack is the hunter; he finds the pigs and kills them for food. He tries to be just as high up as Ralph, but not as many people like Jack as much as they like Ralph. Soon enough Ralph and Piggy realize that the pigs are not the only ones being hunted, but they are too. The theme of this book is civilization vs. savagery. The boys have to try to keep themselves sane while they are on this deserted island. I liked how the author switched from Ralph, Piggy, and Jack and told from their point of view. It helped me to get a better insight on what was going on. I really liked the book I would give it a 10/10"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is really interesting. It shows a different view of human nature. The author Goulding really did a good job on this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"If you ask ten people who have read William Golding's Lord of the Flies, half of those people will say that they loved it or \\"thought it wasn't that bad\\" and other five will say that they despised it. I am one of those who despised it. There are definitely some good, maybe even great qualities of Lord of the Flies and the allegorical and symbolic meanings that are hidden throughout the book are important and a good thing to study in class yet, if I was given this and say, War and Peace, I would grab War and Peace in a second. The truth to why I dislike LotF so very much is a bit complicated. This book opens on a boy wandering around an island. You are given almost no information on where this boy(or the other boys who show up later) came from. There are little bits of information of their back story stuck in the book almost randomly. Unless you are paying a lot of attention to every word that Golding writes, it is easy to miss these precious details. That is not the only reason that this is not may favorite book in the world. I'm not sure if Golding purposely did this or if this is just the way he happened to write it, but the the majority of the characters seem to be purely evil and it is quite hard to read the book without feeling you have personal grudge against each one. I won't go into intimate details (just so you can read it yourself and understand the disgust I have with these boys) but each boy acts in a certain way that makes you wonder how evil a child can be when not under any kind of adult supervision or guidance. In conclusion, if you would like to buy this book, I warn you. You may be one of the ones who like it and shrug off the savagery of the boy or you could be one who can't even stand to finish it. It is completely up to you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well I was very happy with the exactness of the text of the book just wasn't happy with the page numbers it gave me because I needed page numbers for quotes in the book for an essay I ended up using a friend's book have the page numbers next time for people like me"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had to read this book for my freshmen English class.

Well thats it. thanks William Golding for giving me the opportunity to read this book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Sometimes it's easy to see how a work can be timeless, particularly when it's based on the timeless adage that boys will be boys. Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys marooned by a plane crash on a small deserted island, with the nearest adult supervision lying beyond the vast ocean. The kids try to construct a functional society, while working towards the goal of getting rescued. But personal ambition gets in the way of common sense and everything crumbles. The novel does an excellent job of contrasting certain themes: civilization/savagery, maturity/childishness, collectivism/individualism, and so on. At times, this gets a little heavy, and the novel often reads like it was written to be analyzed by generations of high school students. The reader may also find that the descriptions of the landscape are weak and often repetitive. However, the novel draws out a great story. It is filled with suspense and frustration, and culminates in a heart-thumping climax. Even though the main characters are all boys, it sheds some critical light on human nature and the frequent conflict between the individual and the greater good. I would recommend picking this up at any age, as it is a very entertaining and somewhat frightening read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I was educated at Maidstone Grammar School, the school at which William Golding taught for a brief period in the late 1930s, and although I did not arrive at the school until many years after Golding had left, school legend still had it that the main characters of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" were based upon boys he had taught at Maidstone. A friend of my father even claimed to have been the model for Jack Merridew. (It is, in fact, more likely that Golding was inspired by the boys of Salisbury Cathedral School where he was teaching when he wrote the novel).I won't set out the plot in any detail, as it seems to be well-known to virtually everyone, especially in Britain where it is frequently studied at school. (Oddly enough, despite the school's Golding connection, it was not on the curriculum at MGS and I did not read until my days at university). It concerns a group of British schoolboys, refugees from a war raging in Europe, who gradually revert to barbarism after being marooned on an uninhabited island. Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the \\"desert island\\", the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth. This idea can be found in literature (\\"Coral Island\\"), the cinema (\\"The Blue Lagoon\\"), broadcasting (\\"Desert Island Discs\\") and even in advertising campaigns; the makers of the \\"Bounty\\" chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept. Golding's novel, with its deliberately anti-Utopian theme, can be seen as a reaction against this received idea; the names of the two main characters, Ralph and Jack, were borrowed from Ballantyne's \\"Coral Island\\".The book can be read on a number of levels. On one level it is a political allegory about the relationship between dictatorship and democracy. At first the boys try to organise themselves on a democratic basis, electing Ralph as their chief and setting up a system of assemblies at which they can discuss their concerns. A conch shell, used for summoning assemblies, serves as a symbol of their fragile democracy, but it does not last. Jack, Ralph's only rival in the election for chief, forms a group of his friends into a gang of hunters, with the aim of hunting the wild pigs which inhabit the island. As the novel progresses, more and more boys are won over to Jack's gang, until Jack effectively replaces Ralph as chief without ever being elected to the position, and is able to use his hunters to hunt down Ralph and his few remaining supporters.To readers in 1954, less than a decade after the end of the war, the parallels with the rise of Nazism would have been obvious. A charismatic leader, unable to gain power democratically, does so through force, backed by a private army and leading a movement based upon a \\"them-and-us\\" mentality. The new leader holds the loyalty of his followers by satisfying their material needs, creates a sense of group identity through ritual and violence against a common enemy and uses his power to persecute those defined as falling outside his group. Some who initially oppose him are persuaded to conform to the group identity through fear of the consequences if they refuse.The novel's religious implications are perhaps less obvious, but are none the less present. Golding was brought up in a free-thinking, non-religious family, but appears to have given up his early scientific rationalism in favour of an idiosyncratic version of Christianity. Jack and his original hunters are all choirboys from a Cathedral school like the one at which Golding taught- an obvious irony, given that choirboys are often regarded in Britain as symbols of childish innocence. The scenes in which they kill the pigs and then feast on them are reminiscent of primitive religious rituals; they even place a pig's head on a stick and treat it both as an offering to the \\"Beast\\" which they believe inhabits the island and as a sort of idol, the \\"lord of the flies\\" from which the book takes its name. (The expression is a literal translation of the name Beelzebub, and \\"the Beast\\" can also be a euphemism for the Devil). The boys' descent from innocence into savagery can be seen as symbolic of the Fall of Man, although other, secular interpretations are also possible. One of the boys, the gentle, mystical Simon, has been seen as a Christ-figure. .If the book is read either as a political or as a religious allegory, then it is easy to see Ralph as its hero and Jack as the villain. Read on a psychological level, however, the issue is less clear-cut. Ralph and Jack symbolise two different attitudes to life, and two different styles of leadership. Ralph and his close friend Piggy represent the rational, the harmonious, the logical and the rule-based; in short, they represent the civilisation which the boys have left behind. Jack and his gang represent the irrational, the will to power, the instinctive and the atavistic. Under normal circumstances, it is the first set of principles which would seem preferable to most people, but of course the circumstances in which the boys find themselves are far from normal.Adult civilisation has broken down even more comprehensively than does the boys' attempt to replicate it on the island- we learn that nuclear weapons have been used in the war. The boys, attempting to fell from that breakdown of are confronted not only with their own physical needs but also with all the terrors which assailed their primitive ancestors- terror of the dark, of the unknown, of hunger, of solitude, of dangerous wild beasts. In, these circumstances the irrationality advocated by Jack may answer their emotional needs more adequately than the rationality advocated by Ralph and Piggy, which is why he succeeds and they fail. Seen in this light, the boys' reversion to the more primitive instincts of human nature can be seen as a response to the collapse of civilisation rather than the cause of that collapse, a valuable survival mechanism in extremis rather than pure villainy.There is not enough space in this review to discuss all the many levels of meaning, including Golding's complex and multi-layered use of symbolism and imagery, in the novel, so I will content myself with the three aspects set out above, the political, the religious and the psychological. This is one of those books in which you can find more with each reading- in my view one of the hallmarks of a great work of literature. I was surprised to learn that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was actually the author's first novel- surely one of the best first novels ever published."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book taught: That you cannot socialize savagery out of a person, children are reflection of the adults in their community, laws cannot hold people together, and more."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago for a high school English class.

If you don't like adventurous tales, I don't suggest this book to you."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"during a raging war, a plane evacuating a group of school boys from britain is shot down over a deserted tropical island. Two of these boys ralph and piggy discover a conch shell on the beach, and piggy realizes that it could be used to call everyone one in the island together for meetings. Once everyone is together the boys go about selecting a leader and figure out a way to be rescued. The boys choose ralph as their leader and ralph appoints jack, to be in charge of the boys who will hunt for food for the entire group. As this continues they build a fire to signal for help and they gather wood for building huts and shelters.QUOTES-Ralph \\"This is out island. It is a good island. Untill the grown ups come to fetch us we'll have fun.Piggy \\"How can you expect to be rescued if you dont put first things first and act proper.Golding \\"there was the brillaint world of hunting, tactics, fierce exhileration, skill and there was the world of longing and baffled common-senseMAIN CHARACTER DISCRIPTIONRalph- 12 years old, blonde hair and he is the most charismatic of the group. He is said to be built like \\"one who is to box\\", and is chosen as leader due to his many positive qualities. He has conflict with jack during the whole story, attempting to keep order when jack isnt concerned with it. So ralph and piggy together represent the struggle for order and democracy.JACK- who is skinny, has red hair, and an ugly freckled face. At first he is the leader of his chior group, who became hunters but then his savage personality and ability to tell people what they want to hear allows his to overtake ralph as cheif.PIGGY- who is short,over weight and wears glasses, represents order and democracy. He has asthma and doesnt care to do strenuous work on the island. He is the smartest boy on the island but he lacks social skills, so he usually doesnt fit in. His glassesd are very important, the boys use them over and over to start fires throughout the novel.The Lord of The Flies is set on a deserted tropical island, which is during war time in london in 1963.The genre of this book is fiction.The details in this story were all realistic and for humor everyone made fun of the fat kid \\"piggy\\"The theme is an attempt to take the defects of society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apperantly logical and respectableBasically any high school english teacher would like this bookThis is the only book where a group of boys are on a deserted tropical island that turn to savageryComments the book was dull too much detail \\"not every ones cup of tea\\"Most of the readers read this book in one of their high school english classesConclusion is basically these kids from britain were stuck on a isladn from ages 12 and under some survived but at the end of the novel the boys turned to savagery."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'm convinced that the only people who hate this book are the morons who can't understand it. I think to review on this site you should have to pass an intelligence test. I was reading the one star reviews, and I am absolutely amazed at how stupid some people are. Someone claimed that this book was just \\"An english teacher's sick violent fantasies\\" and someone else called it \\"pointless.\\" If you can read this book and derive no meaning from it, you should probably go back to reading comic books. This is one of the most meaningful books ever written. It teaches such an important lesson about human nature, and the fact that so many people can't understand that is scary.Honestly, yes, the book can be a bit boring at times, but it's prupose isn't to entertain. The book is trying to teach a lesson about society and human nature, and it does this very well. The symbolism used in this book is amazing, and it brilliantly shows the message of the book to the people intelligent enough to understand it. Read this book now!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Although this books title had very little to do about the book it was a thriller!This book is about about 10 English boys who have a problem while being removed from their homeland- the plane that carried them over the Pacific Ocean suddenly crashed. This horrific event left them on a unhabited island with no rules. But, leaders do pop up and soon feuds occur, some resulting in death.I reccomend this book to adults or adventurous kids who are dazzled by a book with a good moral(humanity can be hostile) and a splendid bunch of characters that the author introduces very well.I give Lord of the Flies 4 stars for a few reasons. One reason is that the amount and age of the kids was never mentioned in the book- a tad confusing. Secondley, the ending seemed...runshed.

Some of the boys take charge and their names are Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. They all go to the top of a mountain and light a fire so boats will see them. Later the boys do different things some go hunting, others play on the beach, and two are left building shelters, and one is Ralph. The boys think there is a beast which is proven to the boys when two see something on top of the mountain that moves. They slowly grow to be more and more savage and even leave pigs heads for the beast. Something bad happens one day and the boys split up into a group of savages and one of boys who are normal. They fight over things the four in the normal group go to the savages. One is left after a capture and a hunt is made for him.Some things I liked about the book are how the events are realistic like how the boys grew to be savages. I also liked how some things that happen just appear there unexplained but are easy to guess how they happened. In some parts something that seems like it doesn't even matter and were just added for no reason changed what happened for everyone. I didn't like how some parts were very insightful but not explained so I had to guess and one character is meant to be religious but it is like things that happen in the bible are related to what happens to him.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books with a lot of twists and surprises. Although I would not recommend this to anyone who strongly thinks that the human heart is completely pure and no one could do anything bad to anyone else or be savage."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book, among others, shows the true nature of humanity. though it may not be the most optumistic book in the world, but the book is so realistic about how people act and think that it would make you cry with shame. this book reveals the true cruelity of humanity as we strieve to survive in any way we can."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is William Golding's best-written novels of all times. He captures your mind and attention right from the beginning and keeps you reading till the end. His descriptions and attitude helps you visualize a mental picture of the characters. It is extraordinary how Golding grabs you with his words and makes you feel like you are sucked into the novel. Golding's novel is a combination of horror, drama and adventure all in one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and in suspense on what will happen next. The author makes you firmly hold the book as you read just in case something jumps out at you.It is a brilliant story about young boys stranded on an island after a horrible plane crash. They have to learn to survive on an uninhabited island with no adult supervision. It is left up to a group of boys to establish order and a civilization until they are rescued.Golding shows symbolization of Christianity through his character Simon, a choirboy. Golding moves on to show you evil also exist within the group through Jack and his followers. This group clearly demonstrates cruel and devilish intentions.It is such a descriptive piece that you can visualize and get a scents of feeling about the island and the characters. You feel the events as if they were occurring right before your eyes. It is spectacular how Golding keeps the reader interested until the end and even after that the reader wants more. I recommend every one who loves adventure and a thriller to read Lord of the Flies. It is an interesting novel that sends out messages about human ways to live life, along with the message of evil verses good."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Reading the reviews for this book makes it clear that there are two camps of readers of this book: those who read it in high school and those who read it later in life. Count me among the latter.I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book. I was pleasantly surprised by Golding's depth and sharp insight. Despite the youth of its main characters, Lord of the Flies is not some juvenile adventure novel. Golding's bleak commentary on the absolute evil (the \\"Lord of the Flies\\") that lies in our hearts, waiting for just the slightest opportunity to throw civilization into chaos is chilling and powerful.I hope that those people who read this book in high school go back and read it again later in life, especially those who did not like it. Lord of the Flies is not an exercise in finding symbolism and motifs ... it's about understanding the point that Golding makes through his story. Lord of the Flies is clearly one of the more compelling and intense books I've read in a long time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought this book was very interesting in many ways. It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"i thought this book was very good. It was really interesting. When i first started reading it i was aware of how young the boys were, but as i started getting farther and farther into the book i forgot. Their attitudes had changed majorly and so did their actions. They were basically heartless. At the end when they were rescued and the reality of them being so young hit me again. ALl in all it is a really great book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the numerous required reading for us in school, it is memorable to me for the simple reason that this work, on one level is a semi-adventure but on a deeper level, is a symbolic narrative open to many interpretations--moral, psychological, political, social--which created a lively discussion in class. I can now better appreciate it as an adult. It is about a group of schoolboys, marooned on an island and in due time turns savages. Golding's pessimistic premise was that left to ourselves, mankind would regress to barbarism and savagery--a very grim view of the nature of man. But he didn't want to be realistic about it because Golding calls his books fables. He was a school teacher (that may perhaps serve as another reason why this was required reading for a majority of schools) and his World War II experiences in the Navy and years teaching small boys have helped to shape his philosophical attitudes. It was very much evident in the &quot;Lord&quot; as this was his first symbolic novel.The major idea of the novel is that evil is part of human nature (so forget about the idea of ending all wars) but not of civilization which is an absolute must to restrain humans. He wanted to stress the parallelism between the adult and children's world and that both have the capacity to destroy: the boys the island, the adults nuclear war (remember, this was first published in 1954--when the Cold War was in full swing). Golding criticizes the idea that science can explain everything but Piggy believes that science explains everything, that there is no evil except the ones created by troublemakers. And yet Piggy participates in Simon's murder and was not very convincing when he would not accept his own guilt. As for the 'noble savage' living happily in the wilderness as described by the French writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau, uncorrupted by civilized life--Golding attacks Rousseau's belief that humans in their natural surroundings are rational and good and that society corrupts humans. On the contrary, according to Golding...civilization is needed for saving man from their brutish, destructive instincts.The novel has so many numerous overtones and symbolism, which needs a certain level of maturity in order to be appreciated. And so after many years have elapsed I find it now more engrossing than ever. If you want to be entertained but at the same time challenged...this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is one man's cry to the world, often at times very witty and sarcastic. As the seemingly simple plot advances, many values of the &quot;modern culture&quot; are questioned, exploring how, as a society, we came to accept shocking practises/truths as normal.Most of the negative reviews are the result of NOT understanding the book, and it is very ironic that a book this open in its messages is not understood by the majority of people. This book is a must-read for everybody, especially if they try to understand human nature, the basis of society and action and why people behave the way they do.I highly recommend this ground-shattering book. Everytime you re-reading the book, one finds a new layer of understanding. How the social codes develop, how we are living in the illusion of safety and education and to which degree this is embodied inside us. This book will certainly scare many people by showing them how strong our instincts, and ID are, with a dangerously convincing style."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I seldomly read a book that makes me want to drink my own urine. This book seems to capture every element that I hate.For starters, the book drops you onto this island. They never truly describe what \\"the scar\\" is exactly. Then we watch as Ralph and Jack become bitter enemies. I really hated Ralph and Jack from the beggining mostly because they seem way to immature. Now, if I was 10 or 13 and such... I would not resort to killing people after like the second week. Then there is the fact of Ralph. Ralph is really arrogant of Piggy's feelings and eventually starts becoming annoying. Piggy is the only real character I liked next to Simon. Jack is really arrogant also. He is so immature that it is almost laughable. Didn't these kids come from a private school? My gosh, to think that one week on an island could make some of the worst sins be committed by 10 year old boys....The whole detail of the story becomes a little to fine for its own good. The pictures the author describe have no meaning to me. Apparently there is a square, pink piece of land jutting out of the beach. What? The whole end of chapter 3 was the worst when Simon walks through the forest. I just stopped caring about how that blade of grass was bent at a 76 degree angle.For those who want a great book try Tolkien or R.A. Salvatore. If you hate fantasy then why are you contemplating buying this book? That is all it is. I know I wouldn't kill someone after one week on an island. P.S.

The group is around 15-20 kids. The kids get to choose a leader so they can have everyone in control so nothing can go wrong (even though there is always something that goes wrong).Then later on the book a lot of kids get hurt and there are no adults to help them. Well, I can't say no more because then I will give the end to the story and it wouldn't be interesting anymore, but you will enjoy it.

So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clich&eacute;, either. Kudos to the author.A+"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"\\"The lord of the flies\\" By william Golding, is in my opinion one of the most boring book i have ever read in my whole life. but on the other hand it did have alot to say about our \\"humanly nature\\" most of it was true.This book was like a little summary of our violent nature throughout history.

They truly enjoyed having this book on cds so they can follow the reading in class. It was clear and the narrator was great."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is, simply put, amazingly depictive of the brutality and beauty of human nature. The book begins with British boys all of decent and educated backgrounds stranded on a island with no adults. In the book, the boys are initially led by a sensitive, smart, and logic driven Ralph and a competitive, ambitious, and instinct driven Jack. The group of boys initially all have meetings where their opinions are regulated by a conch found by Ralph and Piggy, Ralph's assistant. Gradually, the delicate friendship between Ralph and Jack breaks, and rivalry, savagery arise. The boys split up into two groups, each an enemy to the other, and conducts actions even to the most brutal degree, murder. As superstitions and fears arouse, the boys created a beast out of their own uneven emotions which became the centerpiece of the story and at the same time an excuse to all actions as more and more, the boys shift their blame to the imaginary beast.Everything in the book possesses great symbolic meaning. Piggy, who throughout the book was Ralph's assistant, represents society's intellituals, who despite their brilliant minds and common sense, are condemned for their lack of expression and appeal. Ralph represents leadership and justice, and the beauty to the human nature while Jack in contrast, shows the instinctive beast that dwells in all humans. The conch, which at first was in effect during meetings, represents democracy and the freedom of speech for only with the possession of it can a boy speak. The beast, the ultimate focus of the book, is a creation of mankind's own fears and insecurities. The book is brutally beautiful; it reveals to us a side of human nature that many thought was nearly impossible and also, the delicate exterior that we call civilization."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is, without doubt, one of the greatest books ever written. If you do not already own this book (presumably why your here) then you should buy it now. That's it. Right now.Still here?Ok. I suppose you probably want my reasons for reccomending this book, before just buying it on my word that it is good. The reasons are as follows:-1: Lord of the flies is original. And I mean actualy, properly original. It does not try to compete against the high tech thrillers such as Jurrassic park, (also an amazing book by the way), or the fast pace thrills of the Da Vinci Code, (amazing again). It is not a horror book, or a romance, or a science fiction book. If I am forced into a situation where I have to classify this book, I call it a very, modern classic. It is one of those books that stays with you for the rest of your life. You will be able to remember every little plot twist for years to come.2: It is a beautifully crafted, highly relevant novel that acts as a window into the emotions of a child, as well as reflecting the behavior of the human race as a whole. In other words, it shows you what would actually happen if you dumped a load of kids onto an island in real life. There are no illogocal leaps here. Everything flows, everythiing works, everything is stunningly real. It is this that makes the book as terrifying, and as haunting as any I have ever read.3: It's good for all ages and all audiences. Well, all ages that can read. Basicaly it is fine for anyone who could read and understand Harry Potter. It is terrifying, but not in the way that induces nightmares. It has action in it, but it is not entirely based around car chases. It is not hugely fast paced, because you will be hooked enough to read it at a slow pace. It will make you think about/complain about/reflect on life.It is not a romance. But I would say that the character relationships in it are the most important part of the book. (In case you're wondering, this is not something I usualy say, and character relationships are not usually what drives me to buy a book. But in this case... just buy the book and see for yourself.)4: It has everything, all written in a style that not so much leaves you wanting more, as leaves you wanting to get other people to read the book, while you read it again. It has a good plot, characters, location, suspence, anything else you can think of.5: If you still don't want to buy it, buy it for a friend, (any friend, it doesn't matter, if they can read it they'll like it), and then take thier word for how good it is. They'll just get to read it before you do, thats all.So, this is one of my favourite books ever, number 1 is possible, and it won a nobel prize for literature. So now that you know my opinion go and buy the book.Bought it yet?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"One of the greatest books I have ever read and the best William Golding has written has to be by far The Lord of The Flies. This superbly written book has an extremely simple basis, which is human nature. William Golding illustrates human nature through words by telling the story of a group of schoolboys who crash land on a deserted island. At first the boys get along electing democratically a leader. The leader being Ralph who symbolizes everything good and righteous. Slowly however things on the island begin changing as human nature and a power hungry boy takes over.The power hungry boy is named Jack who symbolizes evil and in my mind Nazi Germany. He slowly by force takes over Ralph, Piggy, and the rest of the weaker part of the group. This group could possibly symbolize the Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Jack and his band of strong classmates oppress and put down the weaker bunch continually. Slowly they become more and more physical until fights break out and two distinct groups are formed.One group headed by Ralph was the weaker group and the other headed by Jack was the stronger group. Eventually, Simon a boy who was for peace and not dividing was \\"sacrificed\\" by Jack's group and total war broke out until Piggy had been killed and everyone else on Ralph's side fled to Jack's. Ralph alone and scared was hunted like an animal by Jack's band of hunters. The forest catches ablaze and Jack is on Ralph's heels with a spear in hand but what will happen next? You must read the book to find out!This book is one of my personal favorites because of the immense amount of symbolism and hidden meanings. The characters can take on different groups in history and play out exactly what happened in those situations just like the one I provided about Nazi Germany. Another reason I adore this book is because of it's cold and raw reality about human nature and the scary fact that the school boys in the story could one day be anyone of us."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is an incredible journey, that follows a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. All the parents on the plane have died, so this big group of boys has to fend for themselves. A big part of this story is about how the boys still create rules to govern the island. A leader comes around named Ralph, who has continuous argumments with Jack, the oldest, who himelf wants to be in charge.Things start off well, but sitings of a beast on the island scare many. One of the boys named Piggy, a very intelligent, but not liked boy, has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says. One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going. Jack, makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by, but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack. Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack. Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them. The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart, and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast. This book was a very good one to read, it had a an ending that leaves you thinking, and a story that makes you think about your own life, and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves, create rules, and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island. I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read, that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord Of The Flies is without a doubt a classic work of symbolism. William Golding really did do an incredible job of linking every vague detail in his book to the ideas he had about human nature, and the post world war II world in symbolistic forms (The Conch, The Glasses, The Beast). Still, finishing the book leaves one with a rather bitter taste in their mouth. I feel that the extraneous amounts of unnecessary violence Golding included, and the extreme behavior of the characters as the story progressed really kept me from appreciating the true artistic essence, and incredible emotion of this book.The story itself begins with a group of young military-school boys (who are assumed to have suffered a plane crash over the ocean water) landing on a small, uninhabited tropical island. Ralph, the main character, quickly steps up to leading the group, and gets the boys on track to getting rescued. He has them start a signal fire; make shelters, and just generally keeps them in a microcosmic society of the world they once knew.The society quickly breaks down though. Jack (a boy jealous of Ralph's leadership) is overcome by his urge to hunt wild pigs and have fun, and finally leaves the group over a conflict of interest about the signal fire. Gradually everyone who once followed Ralph leave him to join Jack's primordial savage hunting tribe, where they hunt wild pigs and savagely kill them. This in itself is graphically documented throughout the book, and the boys' morals are gradually replaced with more primitive instinct and reasoning.Before you know it, a book that started out fairly boringly is filled with rotting severed pig's heads on sticks talking to characters in the book (in their head, showing their mental stability starting to depart from them, but somewhat disturbing none the less), and Jack's tribe savagely killing some of the boys that didn't join them, for unclear reasons (being overcome by their lust for violence, rebellion from sane society, call it what you will). There is a sporadic parallel story going on, about a \\"Beast,\\" which is nothing more than the boys' respective manifestations of their worst fears (and perhaps the fear of the consequences of their actions catching up with them), and this fear feeds Jack's tribe's ruthlessness towards the end of the book. Quite predictably, the book ends with the boys being rescued, but not before Jack and his tribe almost murders Ralph.I really wish I could have appreciated this book more, but frankly the writer's negative view of the world (which was in turn reflected in his writing) was a little too depressing to be enjoyable. I do recommend the book as a good read at least once, and it is without a doubt a classic work of literature, but when it all comes down to it... I feel it is both a boring, and highly depressing story."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In this book from the astounding mind known as William Golding, a bitter struggle between man and beast lurks in the dense, dark jungles of an uninhabited island in the Pacific Ocean. During World War II, a plane transporting some British children (between the ages 6-14) crashes over an island in which only the children survive to inhabit. In the beginning, all is well until two of the main characters, Ralph and Jack, endure a terrifying power struggle between them. Jack, the villian, wants to rule the other children with tyranny and alongside him are his hunters. Ralph, the chosen chief, believes that keeping a fire ready for rescue is the main and most important thing for their survival. These two boys' ideas soon clash and the many boys are split up into two tribes. This book was so exciting that some of the reading made my heart beat with intensity. It is no wonder that this novel is calssic, and I reccomend this book to anyone willing to read it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"OK, I must be the odd man out here. This book falls into many of the &quot;listmania&quot; lists of other books that I found to be quite good. So, I had it delivered and found it to be the worst book I've read in a few years. What do people see in this?I'll grant the fact that there is some nice symbolism with the conch, the boar head, and such. But that is all it has going for it.Golding attempts to show the reader how easily mankind can become corrupted when left to their own devices, but the story he masked it with is pretty poor. For something written as recent as 1950, I would have expected much better.First off, there is no mention of what happened to the plane. Just some boys on an island and the plane crash just seemed to be a way to get them there. There is no wreckage to deal with, no dead bodies smelling up the island. Secondly, there is no time reference at all. It seems that the kids hair just grew long, magically overnight. Without any mention to a timeframe, it appears they are on the island about a week. I'm sure it was longer, because nobody should have as little faith in humankind to think that we should devolve to savages so quickly. Maybe Golding did think it could happen that fast... I don't know.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who really enjoys reading and likes to see the plot and the characters well developed. This seemed to be thrown together with no regard to the plot whatsoever. If this book comes on a recommended list, but there are other options, AVOID THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is an excellent character study. Shows the well meaning, the wise, the hateful, and the barbaric in different chacters. How civility can disappear when faced with survival and an unruled society. How some of the boys use clay to mask their faces, and in turn mask themselevs and their humanity was well illustrated by William Golding. Not a light book, but an easy read. Not an enjoyable read, but a good reminder of how people could be."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is one of those books that many of us had to read in high school. I didn't, but picked it up anyway-- and it has quickly become one of my favorite books. On the surface, it is a tense, exciting adventure novel, short enough to be read in a single day, but long enough to provide fulfillment.Lord of the Flies can be read, on another level, as a cautionary tale of the true state of human nature-- what Ursula K. LeGuin would call a &quot;thought experiment.&quot; Like LeGuin's Left Hand of Darkness, it is one author's attempt to decipher one facet of human nature by isolating it and stripping it of its support. In this case, a group of children are stranded on a tropical island during what appears to be the Third World War. With no adult authority, the children attempt to fashion their own society based upon the one they left. This quickly breaks down, however, and the true nature of Man emerges. As a thought experiment, this book works wonderfully. Isolated from &quot;civilized&quot; society, they are freed from the bonds and restrictions of it, and as children, are not as inculcated with the lingering values and mores that adults would bring with them. The stage is set for a clear glimpse of true human nature, were it to be freed of the bonds of society. In Golding's view, human nature clearly reflects what Thomas Hobbes called the &quot;state of nature&quot;: the children live in a state of &quot;continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of people, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;The symbolism in this book is clear and precise, without disrupting the realism or flow of the book. Piggy, with his glasses and insistence upon order, represents society's rules and Freud's superego. Ralph, the obsensible leader of the children, tries to balance the wishes of the children to play and the choir to hunt with the need to keep a signal fire going and build shelter, and could easily represent Freud's ego. Jack, the choirmaster, with his anger and eagerness to hunt and gain power, describes the id at its most merciless. Many more symbols abound, but writing of them would ruin what is a fantastic story!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Upon his return from World War II, William Golding wrote the book Lord of the Flies, demonstrating how the war had altered his view of humanity and the evil it was capable of. Borrowed extensively from R. M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island, Lord of the Flies is set on an island that acts a microcosm of WWII. The school boys demonstrate what Golding believes will happen should man be unleashed into the wild with no society to monitor his actions, what will happen when man gets in touch with the primitive evil inside him. Using supposedly innocent children to enact this tragedy, Golding makes his message even more daunting and thought-evoking.In the midst of war, a plane evacuating a group of school boys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island, far off course. The story follows the boys' attempts to survive and to be rescued. It follows their process of electing a leader, the battle between Ralph and Jack, and the island's descent into chaos. This novel is pretty intense. The allegorical struggle between good and evil is suggested in the title of the novel. The title is said to be a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (literally \\"Lord of Flies\\"), a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.The story, which seems to be another survival story, keeps its readers engaged with the tension contained in the calm yet eerie narration. The mystery laced yet seemingly uneventful opening of the novel immediately captures the attention of readers and holds them in a sort of frustrating suspense as they wonder about the meaning and significance behind the introduction. As the story develops and the island is enveloped in madness, the reader wonders in horror at the savagery such young and supposedly innocent children are capable of. Without any sense of morality and other societal influences, children are the perfect subjects in this examination of true human nature.The syntactical structure and the abundant imagery truly make Lord of the Flies a graphic and daunting read. Variations in syntax between long, continuous lines and choppy, rhythmic sentences help readers visualize and relate to the situation in the book. Be it the pounding nervousness as their camp is invaded by children gone wild, or the frightening image of the \\"lord of the flies,\\" each scene is intensified by the author's mastery of language. It helps a reader further delve into Golding's microcosm of humanity as the boys' descent into savagery threatens our faith in the good of humanity.Despite the magnificence of its message and the remarkable skill with which this novel is crafted, I definitely do not count Lord of the Flies as amongst one of my favorite books. I personally felt that Golding was far too pessimistic in his view of humanity. While the story does serve was a frightful caution sign, it does not reflect the whole of humanity. Golding seems to have been greatly affected by his experience in WWII. It is true that war brings out the worst in people, but it is also true that war and savagery do not define our existence. Perhaps I am simply far too optimistic but I feel that just as there is innate evil in the world, so is there innate good. That is why the struggle between good and evil is a ever present theme in both literature and life.Lord of the Flies is a great read if its allegorical message is taken with caution. Its deeply developed characters add complexity to this mind shaking story. The suspenseful plot in addition to Golding's eerie narration makes Lord of the Flies a novel that will leave you shivering. All in all, it is worth the read. That is unless you'd rather go for something less philosophical and more simplistic."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding's view of humanity is needed now more than ever. After watching two world wars in his own lifetime, Golding began to wonder whether man was really good or evil and this is what he explores in the novel. The story is very well paced and there's a lot of symbolism throughout the novel. This is one of those books that I would use sparknotes to find the connections if you're not reading this for a class. The connections are fascinating and really make you think about things that are going on right now in 2009. This is a classic that has stood the test of time and it deserves that distinction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many books try to show the essence of human emotion and feelings. Another common theme is to show the innocence of children in a world of adults. William Golding's Lord of the Flies Golding finds the true balance of the innocence of children with human instinct when it's thrown into the midst of the jungle.In Lord of the Flies, the reader is placed into the world of children as they are stranded on an island. In a world without order, the kids have to rule themselves and make their own law. Soon the strongest of the pack come out and rule the weak-hearted. If a child disobeys the higher power, they get punished the sentence of death.The characters of Piggy, Jack, Ralph, and Simon are characters that everyone can relate to. They all express different human emotions that are inside of all of us. From the strong leader Ralph who leads the children, to Simon who is the boy who could lead the children in a peaceful and productive way of life.Many people say that there is too much symbolism and not enough on the story. I don't agree with this because the symbolism is what makes the book so powerful and lasting. Symbolism is something everyone can relate too and makes the reader think.Golding's goal to show children breaking down into basic human nature works perfectly in this story because all the characters feel real. He makes the characters crash so much that they feel like normal kids but, they still have animal characteristics like the urge to kill that make the kids so complex. He also makes the characters likable and more believable without overdoing it.To Sum it all up, I love the characters and the symbolism in the story. The Characters are well developed and have depth which is nice to get once and a while and the symbolism makes the reader think about human nature and emotions. The weakness I see is that it takes a while to get into but, if the reader continues to go through the story and stick with it, the reader will find the story fun and endearing. Personally, it made me think about life and how at the worst of times people become monsters and do not listen to themselves."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this novel in my Honors English class, my junior year in high school. This book completely changed the way that I read stories.Classic! There is a depth to the book that you have to search for. I have never read another story with so many underlying messages and metaphors. Once you see them, you'll never read the same again!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"LORD OF THE FLIES, by William Golding, is one of the best books to come along in literature since Chaucer and his CANTERBURY TALES. Mr. Golding writes beautifully and poetically of this tragic commentary on humans and our society, making the story of these young boys all the more poignant and thought-provoking.This book is not for the weak of mind, nor the faint of heart. Several high school peers of mine found it \\"boring and stupid,\\" simply because they felt there was not enough adventurous action and \\"too many big words.\\" They did not understand that Golding wrote as many of the time did, with detailed description of the small things, so as to give the reader a better vision of events and enthrall them further with the story. Truly, this may be his greatest strength: his ability to completely captivate the reader by way of giving descriptions so thorough our mind cannot blur it.Many of my peers also would've liked \\"more blood and guts.\\" It's a shame they did not realize that Golding did not write of gruesome things to revel in the macabre. He wrote of these to make stick in our hearts the tragedy that young boys, devoid of civilized society, had no ability to stop themselves from committing atrocities. For one to read this book looking to enjoy an unremarkable fairy tale, where things end as happily as they begin, I'm afraid one would be sorely disappointed.I, however, was not disappointed in the least. I expected great things from this story and I received them: an enthralling plot, sincere characters, vivid descriptions, beautifully tragic writing, a deeply affecting social commentary and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.If anyone is bored with a simple movie, I'd suggest buying a copy of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. This is one adventure that will never disappoint!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well, most people in America have already read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic.

After the crash, a boy named Ralph and a boy named Piggy come together and use a conch shell to send out a noise to alert the other boys to come and meet them. A tribe of mixed ages is formed by their efforts, and the little ones of the tribe starts seeing a beast during the night. Shortly after the sighting of the beast, the tribe kills their first pig. While the tribe is busy killing the pig, however, the signal fire goes out and a ship passes by. Between the pig and the fire and the beast, the tribe has too many disagreements and splits into two clashing tribes.This book is about a test of will and leadership of the boys because there is no guiding or advice for the boys to follow. This is a study of how some people might come together and bond while others will become enemies with no one to rely on for help or friendship. Somehow, against all odds, the boys survive for a period of time. This book is definitely worth reading and would be perfect for kids between the ages of ten and twelve who like adventure stories. The author is very descriptive and uses intimate details to describe the setting, but also writes in a classic style with some words or sentences that are added unnecessarily. The character's emotions and thoughts are described very well and it feels like they have realistic troubles and ideas. The book has a very interesting and exciting plot that incorporates the characters and the setting very well. The dialogue is also very realistic and interesting. This book is a great read that will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This was a great book. I had to read it this semester for my English class and I loved it! The way he describes things are amazing. I couldn't believe what happened to Simon! I was heart broken. This story should be read from High School and up! I was a little nervous at a few parts but Golding really pulls you into the story and makes you feel as if you were there yourself. You can put yourself in the place of his characters and live their lives and see through their eyes. I truly loved this story and i think that you will too."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Unlike most graduates of American primary and secondary schools, I managed to get through high school without reading William Golding's Lord of the Flies. I first read it to familiarize myself with the text in order to better assist a student I was tutoring. Since its publication in 1954 readers and scholars have found it to be a perfect subject for infinite speculation and theorizing as to its philosophical and allegorical underpinnings. But even apart from theory, Lord of the Flies is a marvelous novel for its attention to pure story. My recent re-reading of the text revealed Golding's real gift as a writer is in revealing tone, voice, emotion, and character."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What struck me the most about The Lord of The Flies, was the ease with which Golding conjured up a world of kids: their habits, reactions and responses. The story is about a group of British schoolboys who are, after a plane-crash, left on their own in a lonely tropical island. The story is basically an allegory; and Golding does his work marvellously. The gripping story has a clear, straight-forward narrative, and is certainly one of those books I wouldn't mind re-reading, over and over again."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought the novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding was an exceptional story to read. The book is about how a group of children got deserted on an untrodden island and how they try to survive and get rescued. Children probably would not like the horror, but the book is suitable for teens and adults. Golding used many devices including symbolism and he also didn't finish the book completely, which let the readers choose what will happen to the boys. He ended the book with a guard finding Ralph and a few little ones while Jack and his crew was still missing. I didn't like the end of the book or the symbolism because I don't adjust well with these aspects.Even though it was a fantastic book, I thought some of the scenes were disgusting. For instance, some of the descriptions of the pig, Simon, and Piggy's deaths were gruesome. Golding used descriptive words to make you imagine what was going on. When those events were about to happen, Golding used foreshadowing. The story is so unpredictable and suspenseful that readers are on the edge of their seat. Golding wrote amazingly with not many boring and slow parts. However, there are a few confusing parts in the story that are complicated to understand. Overall, Golding did a great job rewriting the story with a different twist from the book that started it all - Coral Island. In fact, this is one of the best novels that I ever read. I would rate this book 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the FliesEricAt the beginning of the book a plane wrecks on an uncharted island in the middle of an ocean. Two of the survivors meet up at the very beginning. Their names are Ralph and Piggy. Ralph finds a shell like horn called a conch. Ralph blows into it and all the survivors hear it and make a meeting. The middle of the book consists of the kids forming a society, more like a society of dictatorship. They all are anxious for power. All the more stronger kids are taking over. At the end of the book Jack and Ralph are battling for Piggy's glasses and Ralph gets them back.The main character, Ralph, is tall with broad shoulders, brown hair, green eyes, and he looks like he would be a boxer. He is a good leader and is trustworthy. We share the same traits by our broad shoulders and brown hair. I'm not tall but he is.I really liked the book because it explained that it is impossible to run a country without leaders and without rules you should always have a couple leaders and rules."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"What happens when a bunch of civilized schoolboys are castaway on a tropical island with no parental authority or supervision? Without the influence of civilization, what is left but barbarism? Obviously the law of morality is quickly replaced by the law of the jungle. This has to be one of the great novels of the 20th century. And I love the themes explored here. The story premise is great too, and well-executed. What is so original and moving about Golding's work is his profound understanding of the human capacity for evil and guilt."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"After reading this book, I couldn't help but think of the boys whom I know. It made me wonder with which camp they would align themselves: Jack's or Ralph's. The frightening realization is that there are so many bullies out there aged 12 and younger who would probably turn out just like Jack or Roger if left to their own devices. I shudder to think of how right Golding was in his theory that man is easily swayed by fun and immediate gratification, and that remorse and compassion are considered weak and disdainful emotions. This book will be lost on the young reader, who lack the understanding of the use of metaphor and symbolism. Viewing a rendition of the island while reading the story provides a helpful guide through Golding's description of it. A couple Web sites to see maps are homework-online.com and gerenser.com. Don't read the character or story analyses until you've read the book, though, or you'll spoil the impact of the story, but definitely read them after you've finished the book. Lord of the Flies will leave a lasting impression on its readers and, hopefully, will make them realize the importance of belonging to a civilized society."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book was rated number 41 on the Modern Library's top 100 list, though after reading it I felt it should have been rated higher. On the surface, this is a simplistic story and a rather short one at 200 pages. What is brilliant about this book, however, is Golding's ability to craft a powerful and timeless statement about humanity and mankind. His prose is concise and focused, yet his ability to paint a picture of castaway life on a tropical island is every bit as good as much longer tomes. I found the breakdown of civilized values played out on a beautiful tropical island to be a terrific dichotomy. The interplay between the English school boys and the brutal reality of survival on an island provided numerous intersections in a brilliantly interwoven plot. The end result is a rather haunting reminiscence of this story after you've finished reading it. This is similar to Robinson Crusoe or The Count of Monte Cristo in that they are all stories we know. Yet, going back and reading them again as an adult brings new worlds of meaning and perspective along with perhaps a new-found appreciation for why they are timeless stories to begin with."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The first thing that got me was that this is very similar to the Catcher in the Rye when it comes to how fast I was able to read this without getting bored. I think William Golding has created a very distinct book on humanity, as well as an interesting story that I had to read twice before I understood it. ^_^"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Personally, I didn't completely like Lord of the Flies but I still give it thumbs up for the outstanding plot. It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students, I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore, when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies, I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end, if you look at it from another point of view, things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies, I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies by Golding is a perfect novel.It is the story of English School boys during the war times. The boys are on an airplane heading for sanctuary from the war, but their ship crashes and the boys are deserted alone on an island in the middle of nowhere without any adults. The children plan to set up their own government to rule them. They believe they can create the perfect civilized government on their own. One of the boys even comments; &quot;We're not savages, we're British&quot;But the boys soon give into their animalist urges of hunger and fear and turn into reck-looses and savages in the name of survivial.This story is perfect social commentary.Also like the children becoming savages with out parents to guide them; its an example of how humanity becomes animals without a God. As suggested by the very title of the book &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;; which is a biblical name for Satan (Beelzabub -Mt.10:25;12:24,26/Lk. 11:15/ Mk.3:22)This book is a clear example of what happens when people worship the god of the earth by give into their animal instincts and choose to ignore the God the father."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies... boring? Now that's a new one on me. Golding wrote his book with young readers in mind--the very sort that would enjoy action, and adventure. And perhaps more so young male readers as his experiences of children and their behavior are from a boy's school playground.Some reviews have the effrontery to suggest that this Nobel prize winner adjust his style to accomodate their laziness. To that I say... Nuts! The ignorance is in proportion to the self-righteousness of the young critics who are prompted by their teachers to write such tripe. And there is no shortage of opinionated critics who haven't made the least effort to try to understand the book or attempt to read authorially or for that matter examine themselves in a critical light.At least have the curiousity to find out more. There are plenty of smart readers within easy reach. If nothing else, read the Coles Notes, York Notes or any critical guide for that matter to get a sense of how much one can get from reading and re-reading this book. Is it really cheating if you do it responsibly? And by the way, there is a purpose to the book's detailed (what some impatiently call the \\"boring\\" and \\"long-winded\\") scene descriptions. Find out what critics say.The beauty of the novel (the writing, that is) lies in the poetic descriptions that we are offered. Some reviewers talk about the \\"realistic\\" flavor that Golding brings to the story. Far from being \\"realistic\\" I see these scenes as having a dream-like and timelessness about them. When Simon lies in a trance in his hiding place near the clearing, watching the butterflies above the tall grass, there is a sense that time has stopped. Human time has little significance on the island. Watching butterflies may be \\"realistic\\"; but the full value of the scene comes through the words which form the less-real images in our reading minds. They are vivid, but being \\"realistic\\" is hardly the point of the scenes. Experience is. A very new, strange, unusual feel to our lives. Isn't this the value of writing literately? Not to offer realistic images of \\"real\\" life but to offer unspoken, often unthought but very much felt experience and sensation. Anyway, the butterfly scene connects to another one, where some of the littl'uns are playing at the edge of the beach. The narrator offers up images of distant shores and time and the movement of rock and sediment. The sheer scale of cosmic time compared to the puny activities of the children (pooping, hunting, fighting, squabbling) is breathtaking. The narrator treats us to poetic visions--what some reviewers lumpishly call \\"all that long-winded description.\\" To cut scenes like this out would be like reducing a poem to some prosaic \\"message\\" and claiming that it all \\"boils down to the same thing\\". Such nonsense.A teacher's chestnut for this novel (judging from some of the reviews) is to have a trial to wind things up. I cringe when I hear this. What young readers are being asked to do is assign blame and re-establish a moral order that Golding puts precisely in question throughout his novel. The last paragraphs drive the point home."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I know this is a classic but I really had a hard time getting through it.

The plot is quite interesting. It's about 2 planes filled with British kids crashing on a deserted island. First of all, these kids would have died in a few weeks at the most! There is NO way normal men could kill wild boars, let alone young kids. Weapons are hard to make too, I don't know how the older young boys, around the age of 13, can make weapons that is sufficient and adequate enough to use for killing wild boars and other fierce creatures. This book is extremely far-fetched as I see it. But there are interesting elements too, I suppose. It's very symbolical. There's some symbols that I didn't fully interpret until I look into them closer, and I thought that was quite intriguing. It brings a more dark atmopshere into this book. One star for symbolism, and another one is to be respective for the effort of this book being made."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the notes to the copy of the book that I read, Golding said that &quot;The theme of the book is an attempt to trace the defects of Society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.&quot;This seems to me to be profoundly wrong. Ethics and morality are a function of the political system that society's adopt, not vice versa. Golding would have done well to read Hobbes' Leviathan. Hobbes makes the much more convincing case that for man in the state of Nature, life was &quot;Nasty, brutish and short&quot;. So man traded off a certain amount of autonomy to a central authority in exchange for protection from other men. Morality then flows from the political structures that men adopt.Take an example on a smaller scale: the morality of informing. In criminal enterprises the informer (rat, squealer, snitch) is immoral because the enterprise depends on secrecy--i.e., the Mafia , Revolutionary/Terrorist groups, crooked cops, the Clinton White House--and anyone who parts the veil of secrecy is demonized, because informing endangers the entire structure. In the normal run of life we are fairly conflicted about informing, we don't honor the informer (Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, Whittaker Chambers, Frank Serpico, Linda Tripp) but we do seek to protect them from retalliation by their bosses via whistleblower laws. While in totalitarian societies informing against those who oppose the state (even if it's your parents) is a heroic act. Golding would have us believe that these differences are the result of the innate ethical natures of the members of the societies. In fact, it is the agreed upon structure of the societies that determines what behavior is accepted as ethical.GRADE: C"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I found this book offering a somewhat scary look at society.

I really honestly think that a three-year old directed this...P-U."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I somehow graduated from high school -- a boys religious high school, no less -- without being assigned Lord of the Flies. So I decided to read the mother of all high school English books.I came to the text with certain preconceptions and prejudices. Like many high school students, I was force-fed my share of meaningful stories with something to say. I though To Kill a Mockingbird was simple and didactic, and, after two readings, I cannot comprehend what any serious person sees in The Catcher in the Rye. In Cold Blood and The Stranger were more my speed, stories with the confidence to tell their tales and not hit you over the head with life lessons. I approached Lord of the Flies with wariness.The story is well known. A flight filled with English schoolboys crashes on an uninhabited island, killing all of the adults. Ralph, a charismatic but forgetful 12-year-old, is elected the leader of the survivors, who quickly segregate by function. Ralph determines the day's tasks. Fat but smart Piggy counsels. Jack and the members of his boys' choir hunt the island's wild pigs. The \\"littluns,\\" the six- and seven-year-olds, exist in a task-less state of near hysteria.Jack, the warrior prince who provides meat, becomes envious of Ralph's position as leader. The principal arc of the 200-page book is the heightening tension between Ralph, whose priority is to maintain a signal fire and be rescued, and Jack, whose priority is to hunt and lead.Many passages were suprisingly clunky. Dialogue sections repeatedly ignored Strunk and White's admonition to \\"make sure the reader knows who is speaking.\\" Author William Golding devoted substantial space to physical descriptions, but they tended to be vague and confusing. Many of the secondary characters were cardboard, as thinly drawn as in Dickens but without the cartoonish charm. The narration's point of view changed abruptly at certain points.Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel, so imperfections can be forgiven. He was ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize and a Booker so, to paraphrase Shelly Winters, some people thought he could write.But what is it about this book, an almost archetypal \\"promising\\" first novel, that has landed it on so many required reading lists? Lord of the Flies has sold more than 10 million copies, deep into Dan Brown territory, and my raggedy paperback is the 96th Capricorn printing. (Interestingly, the book initially flopped, selling only a few thousand copies.)Much of the success of Lord of the Flies must be due to the fact that it is a useful tool when teaching some of the basics of literary theory.First of all, kids will read it, especially boys who may not be the most avid readers. The idea of a world without grown-ups catches adolescent interest. The book is short. There's a fair amount of action, including a taut climax.Moreover, the Big Themes are laid on with a backhoe. The symbolism is so obvious that the slowest kid in fourth-track English can figure it out. A student can spend hours matching the characters with their analogues in modern society and, judging from some of the web pages devoted to the book, students have spent much more time than that. Every high school English teacher needs to explain that sometimes there's more to a story than what the characters do and say, and Lord of the Flies feels custom-cooked for that effort.I don't think Lord of the Flies has much to offer an adult reader, but it's a pleasant reminder of youthful efforts to learn the rudiments of symbolism and subtext.Now, class, what do Piggy's glasses represent?"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is another classic that relies on a bad outcome in the story to get attention from readers. In a lot of schools it is required reading. I suppose that teachers think that stories with bad outcomes serve as warnings to other people, and the author probably had similar motives. However, there are two important questions to answer. First, does Lord of the Flies meet the criteria to be considered a \\"warning\\" to society? Second, does the content of the novel itself contradict its purpose?Lord of the Flies is a novel about a group of boys who are stranded on an island with no adults present. The boys attempt to form a simple \\"government\\" among themselves. However, their weak sense of order starts out with childish, verbal conflict and eventually turns into violence. Given the novel's summary, one may deduce that the message of the novel is a warning to society of the dangers of anarchy.I dislike the fact that almost all off the characters are boys within seven years of each other's age. Real world societies have a much wider variety of people. When writing a book designed as a warning to society, it is important to make sure that the whole society can relate to the book. In my opinion, the real art of writing a plot in a novel is to create a scenario in which people o many different ages and backgrounds get involved and contribute to the outcome. In Lord of the Flies, the consequence of the lack of diversity among the characterizations is that there are too many pages that rehash childish arguing. Therefore, the novel could have (and probably should have) been reduced to a novelette length.As stated earlier in this review, many literature interpreters believe that the purpose of Lord of the Flies is to demonstrate the dangers of anarchy. A lot of interpreters of literary symbolism consider the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" to be an allegory for the devil. Therefore, the fact that the book is essentially titled \\"the devil\\" seems to indicate that the book focuses on evil acts and events. In my opinion, one major flaw in the novel is that the characters with good intentions fail to have a positive impact on the outcome of the plot or the development of other characters. With that in mind, the problem is that the author condemns anarchy, but fails to tell us what we should do about it, which seems to cause the book to lose its purpose.Due to its monotony and \\"incomplete\\" philosophies, I do not recommend Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many people have read LOTF, often in school, due to its profound but simple style, themes and symbolism (making it ideal to generate essay ideas etc). If you read it then, try it again now that you are all grown up and can view it with an adult mind.If you haven't read it at all, well every thinking homo sapien should read it at least once.If you are interested in the relevant socio-psychological interpretations that abound about it, look at a couple of the other reviews here. I'm not going to go into a deep interpretative analysis of the various themes etc as everyone else is doing a good job of them.All right, one thing they do seem to have missed is that the title is taken from a pigs head on stick, swarming with flies, which is used as a representation of evil and engages in an hallucinatory dialogue with the Simon character (who is a kind of religious entity, almost christ-like).

This classic book explores the events of a group of boys trapped on an island from a plane crash. The story is not only of the struggle to survive in nature but to survive eachother.

But, with further reading and understanding of the book, I really came to love it. I wouldn't hesitate in calling it my all time favorite novel. On the surface, Golding seems to be merely telling a tale of a group of boys stranded on an island. However, a closer look reveals Golding's true intentions of depicting the world and war as depraved and corrupt. He has an extremely pessimistic view of human society and this can be seen through some of the actions of the boys. I would also like to say that Ralph is a great character and the movie is one that should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Two things make this book tough going: its slow start, and its use of flowery language. You just have to plow through the first few chapters to get to anything interesting, and there are times that you just dread the fact that the dialogue is dying down and you're about to be &quot;treated&quot; to one of Golding's run-on descriptive passages. Nevertheless, it is worth it. When things pick up in the middle of the book, it becomes easier to see how the flowery language is there to create mood, and to show us, not what the island is like, but what it is like to a group of lost, scared boys. Once you start to be able to follow the mood Golding is trying to create, that's when this story about the pulling away of the thin veneer of civilization that humans wrap themselves in and the revelation of the savage with-in really unfolds for you. And that's when you realize what makes this book so powerful and enduring."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book has many symbolisim,and it is mainly about human behaviors.

And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race.

Well, life there is not easy. Now try to imagine those participants as kids: how tough would it be to survive? William Golding's Lord of the Flies is exactly that--and maybe even worse. There are no cameras, no doctors, no medicine, no boundaries, no requirements, no rules--no society. In this enticing novel, Golding illustrates the effects of society--or lack of it--on human nature. He argues, through the impetuous decisions of the characters, that, even though our nature is originally pure and chaste, its shape is greatly altered by the lack of collective guidelines.Stranded on an island after a sudden airplane crash, the kids soon realize that creating their own society and set of rules would be essential for order and survival. As the days go by on the island, however, all the boys drift away from their childhood morals and beliefs. While Ralph focuses on being saved, the others solely worry being fed.Many characters, including the commanding Ralph, start showing signs of loss and vacillation. Ralph, for example, regularly has to be reminded of his main goal on the island--namely to be rescued. Jack, who now has formulated his own \\"society,\\" becomes a real savage. The pure and innocent Sam and Eric relinquish their loyalties to Ralph and establish new ties to Jack. The involvement of Piggy and Ralph in their friend's death is a clear example of disorder's exacerbation on moral values and character.Symbolism is a great forte of Golding's writing style. Interestingly, each character or object represents an important concept that is needed for a society to function properly. Ralph, for example is the symbol of powerful leadership. Piggy is the symbol of sanity and intelligence. Jack is the symbol of strength. Sam and Eric symbolize purity and goodness. Simon is the scapegoat. The conch is the power and order that decides who \\"controls\\" the island, but one that proves a problem since all seek it.Through the actions of the characters, Golding successfully asserts that a base, but also a boundary, for human reason is needed for a society to function properly."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A plane crashes and all the adults die, a very likely situation, leaving little boys to survive in an uninhabited island. Other than the fact that every single adult on the plane dies while all the children live, this is an exceptional novel that portrays how powerful society is and what would happen if it disappeared one day, like on an island in the middle of the ocean.The newly stranded boys begin in a somewhat civilized society when they elect a chief and split up duties, but eventually this system is unraveled as one boy's desire to be chief threatens the survival of everyone. Ralph, Piggy, and Simon can be viewed as the protagonists because they are the ones who attempt to produce and imitation of society on the island; however, Jack persuades other to follow him and introduces the wonders of feasting and hunting instead of the arduous shelter building and signal keeping. Jack's desire to hold all the power eventually leads to the island being set on fire. This bold and rash move burns down the island and from that point on survival does not seem like an option.The effects of an uncivilized government is illustrated as these boys, the oldest is twelve, have the capabilities of killing two of their own when they are power hungry. They lack of logic and reason portray that a society holds everyone together and prevents things like a burning island from occurring.Overall this book is well written and its view on the power of society is a strong yet necessary message to express. Despite the young age of the savages, this can depict what irresponsibility and greed can create."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"*Although I do not like Golding's theme of returning to a primeval evil when man is unbound by society, he makes for an effective argument which he establishes through vivid imagery.The story begins with a group of kids that seemingly crashed onto an island isolated. Quickly, there are two leaders that seem to stand out and foil each other, Ralph and Jack. Each represent two different ideals, Ralph is the compassionate leader who is able to reason while Jack is the exact opposite, the two become friends and Jack assumes the position of chief hunter, because the group decided through a democratic vote that Ralph was to be leader. As the story progresses, the children's clothes become tattered and consequently their attitudes begin to change. They are slowly but surely reverting back to primeval instincts, where all they care for is to survive and to avoid the creature that dwells on the island...This total reversion occurs when Simon dies, the Christ figure of the story and also the voice of reason. He is weak and has epilepsies, however, he realizes that the monster is only part of their imagination, but it is too late, when he tries to relay this message to others, the rest of the kids are far too immersed in their barbaric ways. They kill Simon in a frenzy.Golding's barbaric portrayal of humans when unbound by the chains of society is truly cruel. He also assigns the death of Piggy who acts as another voice of reason by crushing him under a boulder, he describes in vivid detail his death. (it is nasty and revolting, the image of a human crushed like a pancake is not very pleasing, but this also attributes to Golding's portrayal of humans, that innately we are all bad and it is society that holds us civilized).The story ends when Ralph is the only rational one left, and the rest of the kids set the island one fire and begin hunting Ralph down. Luckily, before they kill him, people in boats come aboard the island and rescue him. They view the kids as playing, immediately toning down the seriousness of what had just happened. Ralph cries for humanity and the book ends.This book is entirely disturbing, but my morbid curiosity made me read on. I reluctantly turned page by page unable to stop, fueled by his grotesque images. I did not like the idea of humans being innately evil, but I have to admit that Golding is a good writer. He effectively uses our imaginations to get the best of us and figurative language to convey the desperateness of the situation.Try reading this book, it has dark themes, but just because one does not like the idea does not mean that one cannot simply enjoy the book for the sake of enjoying it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Read this as a kid in High School.

The book starts out with a group of innocent schoolboys that crash land on a mysterious island.. The boys begin playing and having excitement all the while loosening themselves from the morals that society has taught them. The choir leader Jack becomes obsessed with hunting and satisfying his immediate wants whereas the chief Ralph becomes focused on the long-term goals of the group. One night while all the boys were chanting to the beast, a boy named Simon stumbled out into the middle of them and was killed in a fit of fear and confusion. Soon afterwards the boys split into two groups, the savages and Ralph's group. The two groups get angry over a conflict involving fire and in the process another boy is killed. The savages embark on a hunt to kill Ralph soon afterwards. The island is set on fire and just when it looks like Ralph will be killed he stumbles into a naval officer.There is one major theme throughout this story that Golding tries to show. It is the question of where the roots of our instinct come from. Throughout the book the question of whether civility, or savagery are more deeply rooted in humans. Golding implies that in certain situations, humans become cruel. They are violent and fearful of things like the beastie. The book points to the conclusion that humans are cruel but society shapes us into being more humane. The civilized Ralph, and the savage, dictator-like Jack represent the two sides of the conflict. They are both in a constant struggle and just like savagery, Jack beats out Ralph in control of the island. The killing of Simon shows the loss of almost all civility on the island.In Lord of the Flies, Golding uses symbolism to show the influence of society and the breakdown of those ideals. Piggy's glasses show the intelligence in society, as seen when they start the fire, \\"His specs-use them as burning glasses!\\" When the glasses are broken, it shows the loss of intelligence and rational thinking among the boys. The fire that is used to attract ships represents what left of civilization that the boys have, for example, \\"Any day there might be a ship out there and if we have a signal they will come and take us off.\\" As the book goes on the boys take less and less care of the fire. Eventually Ralph and Piggy decide not to keep a fire going, showing how even they no longer see society on the island. Finally, the beast represents the evil inside every human being as the Lord of the Flies explains, \\"You knew didn't you? I'm part of you?\\". The only person on the island to realize this is Simon. When he attempts to tell the other boys, he is savagely killed in a bloody dance, only furthering his idea about the cruelty in humans. That is how symbolism is used in Lord of the Flies.The book Lord of the Flies was interesting and would be an excellent book for people to read who realize the problems of society or just want a good book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book \\"Lord of the flies\\" starts out with a group of Brittish boys that are stranded on an uninhabited island. Things start out great and the boys assign eachother jobs and responcibilities. The leader of the tribe is a boy named Ralph. But soon the boys become to interested in hunting and Jack (another boy in the tribe) decides to start his own tribe. Ralph is ok with this move because he thinks that Jack will come back to the group soon. But Jack doesn't ever come back to the group and ends up killing Simon (a member of Ralph's group). Jack's tribe is becoming violent and very savage- like. When Ralph confronts Jack's group about restoring peace and finding ways to get off the island, another member of Ralph's group gets killed (a boy named Piggy). Now Jack's group wants to get Ralph out of the picture and try to kill him, but right before they are going to do him in a Navel officer comes onto the island and stops the madness.I belive that the theme of this novel is evilness in chidren. This is the main because it is stated throughout the entire story. Golding shows and belives that children are born with evil and society makes us nice and polite. Golding also symbolizes this concept in many ways. One of these major symbols is Jack. Jack is relitively nice at first but as the story progressives and more chaos and fear is developed he becomes more agressive and evil. Another symbol is Piggy. Piggy was the symbol of intellagence and knowledge. When he was killed, it was Golding's way of saying that without rules and guildlines evil will always conquere good.

However, as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories, as a critique of democracy, or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious, that young children, especially young boys, must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized), it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats. Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists, Mr. Golding does the opposite. His characters never had a chance. A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne'sThe Coral Island, referred to in the novel, and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.AGE: It is no accident that boys' adventure stories tend to feature teenage protagonists (Ballantyne's were 18, 15, and 14) because a certain amount of maturity is necessary to make them even plausible. It is therefore no accident that Golding's oldest \\"biguns\\" are only 12 while the \\"littluns\\" are as young as 6.TRAINING: It's easy to forget that the concept of \\"childhood\\", the idea that those under the age of majority should be allowed to \\"play\\" and be sent to school rather than being put to work as soon as they're able is a relatively modern idea. Now, no one in his right mind would suggest going back to the old way of raising children, but it did have the singular advantage of better preparing children for being castaways. Ballantyne's protagonists are sailors in training; Golding's are a bunch of schoolboys.NUMBERS: Though the primary reason is probably ease of storytelling, the number of characters in a boys' adventure novel is usually kept to such a manageable number that there is no requirement to establish of any sort of \\"government\\" in order to get things done. Golding has so many characters that they never even manage to count themselves!PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS: Almost invariably boys' adventure story protagonists are close friends before the crisis hits; with the exception of Jack Merridew's choir (and the twins of course) none of Golding's protagonists even knew each other before the plane crash.RELIGION: Karl Marx had it partly right, religion IS the opiate of the masses, if by opiate you mean balm to and healer of the soul. Religion can give you courage and strength where there is none, and it helps you to do the \\"right thing\\" even when no one is looking. This makes it very useful in a crisis where group survival depends on something other than \\"looking out for numero uno\\" though it can lead to sacrificing oneself for others. Ballantyne's protagonists were surprisingly (at least looked at from today) devout Christians. This gave them the courage to face a horrible fate, though said horrible fate was the consequence of risking their lives for someone else. In contrast though all of Golding's protagonists are presumed to be at least nominal believers in SOMETHING, there is no evidence of religious belief in any of their actions, which hastens the death spiral of their little society.CHARACTER: This is the critical matter, as even Mr. Golding would admit, so it comes as no surprise that his protagonists only run the gamut from A to B, from evil to useless. Ralph, the \\"bigun\\" initially chosen chief is all but completely lacking in leadership skills, not to mention being something of a dolt. He is (just barely) capable of grasping what needs to be done, but utterly incapable of convincing anyone, not even himself, to do it. Piggy, the only one who can honestly be called \\"intelligent\\", is also fat, weak, asthmatic, socially inept, whiny, and blind as a bat without his glasses. (Gee, Mr. Golding, why didn't you make him wheelchair bound, too, so he'd have spent the entire novel crawling on his belly?) Samneric, the twins, are utterly incapable of functioning separately. Simon is kind and gentle and helpful, though a little bit balmy, but too young and too inarticulate to have any influence. Jack is a megalomaniac, and Roger is a sadist. The \\"littluns\\" are just barely capable of feeding themselves, which is fortunate because no one else is going to do it. The wonder is not that three boys died, the wonder is that any remained alive! If they'd crash-landed in a temperate climate, no one would have survived the first night below freezing.As a commentary on democracy, Lord of the Flies is of little use because there isn't any democracy in the novel! (Despite what the Colonial Office might claim, \\"one man, one vote, one time\\" is not a democracy!) Though Golding's depression is more understandable when you remember when this was written, the reason he turned out to be so wrong about democracy is that he failed to grasp its strengths: democracy, especially constitutionally limited democracy, is the ONLY Earthly form of government even capable of long term functioning with wicked, sinful citizens because no other form of government has solved the problem of succession. Democracy does not claim to always install the best leaders; it merely offers the only peaceful and practical method for removing the worst. If Jack Merridew had had any prospect of winning some future election for chief, he might not have found it necessary to resort to violence.Finally, in regards to the last page remark, \\"I should have thought that a pack of British boys... would have been able to put up a better show than that...\\", I'd argue that they did better than a similarly handicapped group of primitive tribes-children would have. Sure, the education received by the primitive tribes-children would have prevented many of the bone-headed mistakes committed by our young bulldogs, but the weaker taboo against violence, especially in the area of settling political disputes, would have made the crisis worse when it came and the death toll much higher, if only because primitive tribes-children would be expected to be a lot more competent at killing each other."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Some students, forced to read this book, seem to develop a strong dislike for it and a blindness to its power. Fortunately, I discovered this masterpiece on my own. I loved the sparse, yet effective writing. I was captivated by the struggle of these boys to survive on their own. And, ultimately, I was stunned by the quick spiral into chaos that reflects the heart of mankind.Golding never bought into the idea of humanism. He was courageous enough to face the truth of our own depravity, rather than joining the crowds of his day that shouted \\"man is basically good.\\" Even without a religious compass, Golding accepted that men, left to their own devices, will seek their own satisfaction, egos, and control. His startling use of children stranded on an island demonstrates this theme with brutal power. Even in the end, when adults step in, we see the children's bleak future in the shape of a battleship.You may agree or disagree with Golding's ideas, but few can discredit his ability to challenge our preconceptions in a book half the length of most masterpieces. \\"Lord of the Flies\\" showed me the power of fiction to communicate ideas, and for this reason I've pursued my own career as a novelist. I owe Golding a debt of gratitude."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I am 16 and really picky about books and if you like survival books then this will be great for you but if you also like to just read this will be great for you from BILLY W"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Many of us were forced to read this novel in High School English class. I am glad I had to read this book, it made me think, but I remember it being gruesome as well!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is more of an insight into Mr. Golding's view of humanity than it is an insight into humanity itself. Needless to say, Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people. Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany. Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society. Still, I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us. If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society. In fact, with few exceptions, all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe. Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people. Even there, civilized peoples prevailed. Additionally, I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery. Why couldn't he use another back drop?Technically good writing gets the book three stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Sir William Golding wrote the wonderful novel THE LORD OF THE FLIES in 1954. It is a chillingly true look at the darkest of human nature. To the casual reader, it may seem just to be an adventure of lost boys. However, it has a darker and more sinister commentary on the nature of man. If you enjoy grand and classic literature, buy Sir William Golding's THE LORD OF THE FLIES today.The novel centres around four boys among several stranded on a presumably Pacific island. Each one is symbolic of a different aspect of human nature. In the beginning, each is still bound by societal limits. As time progresses, things turn for the worst as these limits melt away. Golding masterfully shows this waring away of society, one of the novel's finer points. One of the novel's flaws is that is tedious at many points. Otherwise, it is a grand novel.If you enjoy classic literature, you should read this novel. If you enjoy thought-provoking work, read this novel. If you enjoy a highly pessimistic commentary on man's nature, read the book.

A group of young boys left alone on an island must work together to stay alive and possibly be rescued. At first they are successful, but in the end they fail miserably. The group splits into savage vs. civil, and things get crazy. Although I wouldn't consider this book one of my favorites, I liked the way the boys' struggle represents real struggles that go on in the world. There are many themes in this book, and in general the book mirrors human nature and the realities of our civilization today. In the end, everyone in the book did what made them happy, even if it didn't work for the group. Our world today is much like this, people are mostly concerned about themselves. There are many conflicts in this book, between leaders and followers, order and chaos, work and play. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and conflict.

I would describe the plot basically as all about blood nothing much too it just a couple of boys marooned on an island and nothing to do but kill other things, well i won't tell the whole story cause that would just give the book away. Lord Of The Flies is not based on an true story obviously. If there was any other books to come out like Lord Of The Flies I probabaly wouldn't read it just considering it wasn't my type of book to read. I read more of comedy, and ect.When your reading thiis book you can basically look at it as a movie it runs through your head and you can have a clear picture about all of the details and blood.Consider reading the back cover of the book and notice that the author William Sir Golding is writng this book based on the 20th century european fiction."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well, most people in America have already read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding, which is definitely a classic. So I'm not going to give a synopsis, just a general appraisal of the work.The main characters (Ralph, Jack, Piggy, Roger, and many more) are very complex and very riveting. You can clearly observe their distinctive personalities with their actions and their dialogue. And you feel sorry for these characters when something goes horribly wrong.There are many symbolisms in this book (the conch, the pigs, the flies, etc.), and they work very well here. Interpretations are open (except when it comes to the obvious ones). Tensions are high as we slowly move towards the climax. No Hollywood ending here.Golding has created an influential work of art, as highlights in this book are many. This isn't an innocent story, and it's no clich&eacute;, either.

The book was good but even though it is a classic it was not great in my mind. One of the big things that I feel makes this book a classic is that the story is susposed have underlying meanings and what happens on the island is a reflection of human nature with philosophical implications etc. I honestly wouldn't have figured it all out if I hadn't read the notes at the end but after having read these it made since. It didn't take away from the story not having realized the underlying things.The Good: The characters were fairly well defined and even though there were quite a few on the island only the key figures were focused on. You forget how cruel kids can be and are reminded when you read this. Their ignorance is made clear (as is always the case when around kids) which made them real. I would actually find myself getting frustrated along with Ralph while he is trying to manage a group of kids who he cant get to listen.The Bad: Nothing really. At times the story seemed a little slow. It seem kind of hard to believe since it's only about 200 pages but it was.Overall not bad but not great either. I think to much credit is given to the intertwining of his underlying ideals. If a story is trying to prove a point that's fine but you cant take away from a story in order to wrap it around the ideal.

It is worth giving a read though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"We have to read this book in my seventh grade class and although it is interesting I find it way below my reading leel.

And unless I'm forgetting something, there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know, I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions?

Yes, I admit, there is evil lurking inside everyone, I know. But I find it hard to admit that it could be quiet as much as Mister Golding portrays. There are also some nice little descriptions about a bunch of savage boys dying very painful deaths, and I wonder why anyone would title their book after a pig's head speared on a stick. ???????

If so, this is the book for you. Lord of the Flies is not only an adventure but it is also a struggle of life and death at your fingertips. Each page weaves a magnificent story about a group of English school boys and their many struggles as they try to stay alive.The reason I love this book is the beautiful choice of words the author, William Golding, put into the book. The words paint a picture that makes you feel sad when the characters are sad or happy when the characters are happy. Golding's Lord of the Flies is truly a work of art.At the dawn of World War II, a small plane carrying a group of English school boys, all from the age of 6-12, crashes on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. The island is abundant with water, fruit, and wild pigs for meat. With all of these resources, they start to form a microcosm on the island.The character that stands out in the book is Piggy. In the book, Piggy represents common sense. He is a rather large boy, but his brains compensate for his physical appearance. Piggy is the first person Ralph meets on the island and they quickly become friends. Piggy is very supportive and defends Ralph whenever he needs defending. Towards the end of the book, Piggy finds himself in deep trouble with only Ralph as a friend.Lord of the Flies is filled with contrasting characters. For example, Jack is the leader of the gang. He has a posse of followers who will do whatever he says - good or bad. Jack is insecure and thinks that if he can't boss someone around that they are a threat. In the book, Jack is the opposite of Ralph. On the other hand, Ralph, the main character of the story, is a true leader who wants to get everyone's input before he makes a decision that affects everyone. Ralph's only goal is to maintain order on the island while Jack's goal is to do what he wants. Therefore throughout the book, there is a constant rivalry between Jack and Ralph.When civilization rapidly turns to chaos, someone will rise and someone will fall. Is it Jack or Ralph who will take command of the island and lead the boys to safety? If you want to find out what happens to Ralph and all the rest of the boys, read Lord of the Flies."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I'd read this a long time ago and I thought it was good then but I certainly didn't appreciate the complexity of Golding's characters. This succinct book is at the same time childish and grownup, able to marry the two in to a cohesive storyline. I am much more impressed this second time around.The hard part is showing how the children got on to the island because it would be a little hard to show a realistic plane crash on to a deserted island and still have survivors. In fact, where is the plane and what of the other dead children of the plane? This is exactly why this is all left unsaid because it leaves the unknown and mysterious as something that is altogether believable. Instead we start by following two children who find a way to call an assembly and form a somewhat organized society. Yet right away you see the cracks that will form. You see the childishness that is throughout the book. The insanity that could come of isolation from grownups.The accurate portrayal of children is what strikes me. The younguns who play and eat, not really understanding what is going on and yet still scared and frightened. The biguns trying to act grownup and organize everyone into a little society, and yet still frightened. The three most important, of course, are Ralph and Jack (on equal footing) and Piggy, to me the main focus of the whole book. Where Ralph and Jack act the biguns they still represent children, unable to keep their emotions in check. Ralph is the leader who slowly loses his train of thought and his focus the longer they stay on the island. Jack is the hunter who loses his mind as he cracks under the pressure of hunting, only to find that actually succeeding sends his fragile mental state into a much worse situation. Piggy, of course, actually represents the smarts of the group, the one who could have led them to a much more seamless survival if he only had an ounce of leadership. It is ironic, then, that he died at the height of the \\"civilized\\" children turning into savages.All in all a well rounded book that has lasted for over fifty years for a reason. If you've never read it, read it. If you've already read it, read it again. Definitely a fun book to read.4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of The Flies says alot of interesting things, and manages to do so in a concise and compelling manner. It's always a little odd when you re-read books you read as a child, and find you've missed out on a plethora of content. ..At its core, this book is about the struggle within man; to live under the governance of civilization or to follow ones own desires, at any cost, and by any means. It's a question many of us face everyday. Most of us abide by society's rules, because we grasp the immediate benefits of doing so. Civilization guarantees a certain level of saftey, comfort, and happiness - if only at the expense of minor inconveniences. But what if all such guarantees were stripped away? Would we still behave, or would things quickly deteriorate?This book poses that question, and asks it of school-aged boys - people not yet inhibited by a lifetime of authority and rules. The result? A few try to rebuild and a few revert to more \\"primitive\\" states. Power struggles ensue, theologies are constructed, and even taboos like death and murder are demystified. The end of innocence and the thirst for power.The glamour of short term glory is pitted against the promise of a paramount but illusory goal - guess which one wins? This book can be read as a simple narrative, a philosophy, a social-experiment, an adventure story, a psychological treatise, or as a parable. It is intriguing at its least and brilliant at its best. My favorite character is Simon, a boy who tries to warn the others that ultimately, for man, their is no \\"beast\\" to fear - only the beast within."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this is a great book that shows the fallacies of human nature. i really enjoyed it and it has a great ending. everyone should read thsi book"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Categories ossify. Sure, they seem helpful at first. But soon enough they harden, and all you see is the name you've applied instead of the thing itself. Nowhere is this more evident than with literary fiction. To many, it's something with which teachers bore students, a stultifying sort of story that you ought to know about but don't actually need to read. More vexing is that quite a few of these ignored works have genre roots. Take William Golding's Lord of the Flies, a novel whose bloodlines contain post-apocalyptic, war epic, survival story and horror.The Communist assault on England has become so ferocious that Royal forces are evacuating children from the mainland. But soon after a flight of young boys lifts off, a nuclear strike decimates the airport. Then enemy fighters shoot the plane down, and it crash-lands on a deserted island. A tropical storm sweeps the wreckage (and a good number of the passengers) out to sea, and the survivors, a motley crew ranging in age from six to twelve, must fend for themselves in a world newly stripped of adults. They gather tropical fruit and hunt pigs with sharpened sticks. They start a small signal fire in hope of rescue. Soon a rumor begins to spread among the littlest boys about a bloodthirsty beast that slithers through the jungle, looking for what it may devour. The older boys scoff at such tales, though. They have more concrete troubles. Envy, rivalry and conceit have begun to fissure the bedrock of their new society.Literary fiction has earned the reputation of having fascinating characters that do absolutely nothing. But not Lord of the Flies. It moves, constantly and inexorably. Also, repeated readings reveal the delicacy of Golding's composition. He wastes nothing, nearly every sentence playing a needed part. A description of three boys rolling a boulder down a hill foreshadows a cataclysmic future confrontation. An older youth's willingness to pick fruit for the tiniest children reveals his unusual sensitivity, a sensitivity that may save or doom the island's inhabitants. And a fat kid's perpetual complaint of \\"What's grown-ups going to think?\\" over the group's immaturities adds a chilling irony to the novel's main theme, namely that, left to themselves, societies splinter.Though plot, setting and character hardly get short changed, theme really is Golding's primary focus. He wants to explore the problem of evil, the main reason for the world's suffering. It's a lofty goal, an easy one to blunder. Yet the depth of Golding's insight impresses. There is a beast the prowls the earth, but it isn't economic inequality or racism or sexism or any of the other isms. No, the beast is very near to us -- as near as breath itself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a milestone in what I call boy's literature. As a girl reading this novel I was thoroughly unimpressed with the survival skills, war paint, and lords of flies. However, the appeal comes at the end of the book when you realize how innocence is destroyed by evil. My take on this novel: These boys wanted to build a society, \\"make it English\\". However, the innocence of adolescence doesn't prepare them for becoming a man, no matter how much they think so. I think in the end, the idea of being hunters and having \\"fun\\" overcomes the idea of rules and a society. However, you can clearly see how this affects the boy's and turns them into savages, who roam and kill. This book is definitely appealing for young boys. Girls, not as much."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book has been on my must-read list for as long as I can remember, and it IS a must-read. You will either love it or hate, but you must read it. At 24, I was a little ashamed I had not done the reading yet, and so I finally picked it up and told myself I was going to get this book out of the way. However, I realized how profound and real this book was a couple of chapters into it, and I began to enjoy it. I could write several papers on this book discussing it from several hundred angles and perspectives, and I loved that I could.The premise of this story is very simple, but with much underlying depth. It is about a bunch of children whose plane crashes onto a deserted island land and are left completely alone with no adult supervision - pretty much how I'd imagine LOST would turn out if it were based on a bunch of children rather than adults.Protagonist fair-haired Ralph becomes the voice of reason on the island. He is voted \\"chief\\" and takes leadership of the lost boys, by laying down ground rules and taking care of essentials - fire and shelter. On the other hand, antagonist redhead Jack is the wild, untamed boy who does not want to follow the rules. Then there's bespectacled Piggy, who is the wise, intelligent boy, who provides Ralph with advise and sensible suggestions. And last, but definitely not least, is Simon - the sacrificial lamb, almost like a Jesus figure. As one reviewer so aptly put it: \\"I prefer to read him as sympathetic point of view character upon which readers are invited to project themselves. His political disinterest are traits unique to his presentation and establish Simon as somewhat of a blank canvas upon which the reader can paint his own image. Simon's refusal to pick sides and his frequent assertion that he is on the outside give him an outlier identity that correlates him with the reader as an onlooker - present, but separate. Likewise his ability to see the island's beast for what it really is, the depth of his empathy towards the younger children and his clairvoyant understanding of their every need suggests he has access to information that should otherwise only be available to the reader.\\"Everything in this book is symbolic, from the characters mentioned to the conch that was used for order as a symbol of democracy, to the fire that represented adult responsibility, to a beast that pretty much represented fears. And all events are well-prepared for in advance by William Golding, as he gives us as many hints and clues as possible to reveal to us what was about to happen next. A simple, innocent act slowly builds up into a shocking act of savagery. Golding very visually illustrates to us how chaos in society is initiated. One innocent act of rebellion. One simple thought. One small step away from the rules that were set by the chief. Chaos begins in people's minds. It is indeed a novel about our human nature.As I was reading the book, I received several comments from people who saw me reading it and who would say things like \\"Golding has a great imagination\\" or \\"boys will be boys\\" or \\"that's a very disturbing book\\" and so on. However, I don't believe William Golding had to use much imagination - he was probably just recalling all the horrors of his war days. All he needed to do was rely on his own memory of human nature as he had witnessed it during World War II.And this isn't a story for children, or about boys in particular. This is a story about humans in general. We're all capable of savagery, if put in a situation that called for it, and that is a fact."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I had not read this book for about 30 years. Still an impressive book. Loved the introduction by Stephen King. It was interesting about how he came to read this book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My niece needed a book for a report and buying this book for my kindle was fast and easy. Having the book sent to my kindle wirelessly saved me money, gas and time. This service is priceless."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I didn't know anything about LOTF before I read it, except that it was foundational to many other works, controversial, and highly recommended. As far as a story goes, it's engaging. The characters aren't anything special from a literary perspective. I'm not a big person on reading into the symbolism behind everything in a book, so much of the appeal and social critique of LOTF was lost on me. Some parts were confusing, and I'm still trying to figure out why the title is what it is (the pig head on the pole seemed like a minor incident).At the end, I was left with a feeling of 'meh.' But that's just me. If you want fun and adventure, you're probably best to look elsewhere. If you want to read a critique of human nature and the fall of society, you've got it. If you haven't read this 'classic' and need to check it off your list, enjoy."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the flies is an interesting novel to read. It tells the savages of human nature to kill and to vie for power. The novel shows that children are born guilty but are influence by society. Both Jack and Ralph are guilty of human flaw and that leads to the widening gap between them. They are able to get along fine because they are English who shun savagery. As social orders erode with every mention of the beast, Ralph becomes the only person who clings to his pride to be civilized. The shattered conch symbolizes the lack of society on the island as it represents rules and agreement made, but not kept. Jack and the Gang, who never kill anyone before, murder Simon and latter Piggy, proving that human are born with savagery and become civilized under society. Without laws, Jack and his gang revert back to animalism preferring not to be rescue.I recommend this book because it has interesting angle on anarchy. Although I do not believe that boys will kill boys, the relationship between the boys shows the bigger picture on a national scale. The novel is accurate depicting authority, when results are not met dissidents will change the government."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"As an avid reader and a lover of literature, I at last found enough time to pick up what is known as one of the greatest novels of all time. However, I found that it was a rather mundane read, even though it included somephenomenal uses of literary features.I had heard rumors about what themes the novel included before beginning - cannibalism, survival of the fittest, etc. I wasn't disappointed. Although there was no cannibalism, Golding truly exemplifies the deterioration of humankind when faced with anarchy at its finest. Through the medium of young boys, he was able to successfully portray how human nature slowly dissolves into unorganized chaos. Additionally, his use of literary features was clear and added to the plot, such as his choice of symbolism with the conch. With the destruction of the conch leading to the end of Ralph's power, it was clear that the conch represented order and freedom of speech.On the flip side, as someone who's more a fan of action-packed, drama-filled teen reads, Lord of the Flies was pretty low on the entertainment scale. Development was slow in this case, where the first death didn't occur until more than halfway into the book. And even then, I felt like my interest was only piqued in the last quarter of the book or so. Therefore, as a book I was reading for what I intended to be purely enjoyment, I can't exactly say I appreciated the time I spent reading it. However, I do acknowledge its literary merit and the reason as to why it's become one of the most widely read novels of all time.Sure, read it - maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did. But beware; if you're expecting something exciting and page-turning, this may not be the book for you (unless you really enjoy deciphering the meaning behind various symbols)."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Very thought provoking book, especially after the second reading.

She read it quickly and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"My class read this iconic book as a reading assignment. Overall, it was a fairly enjoyable read. I'd recommend it to people above the age of 14 because it's very wordy, and it may take quite some patience to get through it.Golding is a very verbose writer. He can spend an entire page detailing one quality of the island. It gets to be a little annoying sometimes, especially when the sometimes unnecessary details take the reader away from the story, and by the time Golding gets back to the plot, you've forgotten what the characters are doing and why. I will admit that sometimes, the wordiness got to be bad enough so that I'd skip over paragraphs with no dialogue and continue when the first character spoke, and I'd find that I didn't miss anything by not reading three entire pages on how the beaches shimmered under the noontide sun.But the book really picks itself up at the end, when Golding stops using so many details and the book concludes strongly. The last few pages are stronger than every page before it.Plus, Golding tells a great story through the book. No matter how much detail he uses, he is still a great writer, and this book really shows the symbolism he can use to build the settings, quirky and sometimes risky allusions to then-current events, and the ways the characters each served a role in giving the island its personality.A powerful read - definitely great for a class! It requires a lot of thought and even more patience. It's worth it by the end, though."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the flies takes you on a realistic journy. The story starts when a plane full of british school boys chrases on a deserted island. The boys compete for control of the tribe. With out any parents they stuggle inbetween whats right and whats wrong.This is a personal favorite. It challenges you to think about how the boys feel. It makes you wonder what could happend next. I highly recomend this book. Due to the violance I recomend this book to the older kids."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"In the early part of the 20th Century a Englishman called Barry wrote a book called The Coral Island. It involved some children who were cast away in the pacific. Full of British pluck they quickly get organized and build a working civilization on the Island. They are more than equal, the adult natives they meet and have far higher and superior values. They have many adventures and all end in triumph. The book was a hymn to Imperialism and the racist assumptions on which it was based. Pacific Islanders probably still ritually burn it as part of their independence ceremonies.William Golding's book has generally thought to be a response. Golding is apparently a deeply religious man and a number of his later books have religious themes. His theme is probably related his view of the nature of man. Unlike Barry he has a pessimistic view of the nature of man and his tendency for evil. He also starts by having a number of school children marooned on an island. The children are all male and appear to be from wealthy backgrounds. Initially there are attempts to collect food and carry on in a civilized way but things break down. A number of the boys chase pigs and set up a pig's head as a sort of religious shrine in a clearing. Towards the end of the book the group turn violent.Golding's book has been prescribed on school texts for years. Unlike most books set for children to read most of them seem to like it. The imagery is startling and the book is quite short. Golding's other works never quite had the same impact as this one.In retrospect although a readable book it is hard to think that it is really about much at all. The subject of the work is after all just children. It is not surprising that poorly socialized kids placed in a difficult social environment might be at sea. The books main message is probably a historic one putting in context the reality of what people are like and should be read in comparison to Barry's work which suggested a more political view of white people. Despite the fact that the historical impact has declined the book is remarkable easy to read and the imagery is startling. It is probably a good bridge for children to move from kids to adult literature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I read this book in my English class recntly, all I haver to say is that this is a very good book, but just as annoying to read.

If you have a lot of time to reread this book and to think about it all the time, then buy it.

It tells of the gradual destruction of the human nature. I can't tell whether the book is for children or for adults. The plot of the book is simple enough but the message Golding tried to give is very serious.A group of British schoolboys gets marooned on an uninhabited island while they were being transported to a safer place during Second World War. In the course of time the boys gets split amongst themselves and form two groups. Eventually their hostile attitude turns to war.The title \`Lord of the Flies' is very vague. You won't get the meaning of it till you have read the book. In fact you get to know who or what the lord of the flies is after reading more than half of the book.

It made for great debates, numerous conversations, and a laugh for everyone in my small english class. For a mandatory book it was worth my time, obviously, but I did find small inklings of spirituality and realism held within the pages of this book pages. To keep this short and sweet: If its mandatory, read it and then complain. If you're lookin' for a good book: keep lookin', but I will say this, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; allows a very interesting point of view on life and the world. The step from a small world of kids warring against each other, into a larger world of adults doing the same: warring. The loss of innocense could have been portrayed in 5 pages or less, but the author drags it out in a dramatic way making it all the more prone to being criticized."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This wicked parable of society is firmly in the top 10 novels of the 20th century.If you're reading this, I'll assume you're one of the presumably few people that didn't read this at some point for high school or college (by the way - it's definitely not appropriate for ages younger than high school). If so, there's no excuse for not picking it up immediately.It starts, famously, with English schoolboys in an airplane crash on a deserted island in the wake of nuclear war (and - lest we be too hard on the boys - this point is deliberately made to show that adults fared no better than the boys will). The pilot, the only adult on board, is killed - and the boys have to create a civilization from scratch.Eventually factions are formed, and tensions arise between the \\"rescue\\" faction led by a boy named Ralph, which focuses on keeping their shelters in repair and a signal fire burning, and the \\"hunting\\" faction led by a boy named Jack, which becomes less focused on prioritizing rescue and slowly start to like their hunting a little too much...Eventually the rescue faction dwindles to Ralph; Piggy, a stereotypical nerd who nevertheless becomes Ralph's firmest ally in keeping some kind of order; Sam and Eric, two basically decent twins and Simon, a kind, painfully shy epileptic who has the firmest handle on what's really happening to them.With things spinning out of control, Ralph and Piggy confront Jack to try to restore a semblance of sanity, while Simon faces psychic battle with the Lord of the Flies, who represents - depending on the reader - Simon's prodigious understanding of chaos, the evil within not only all the boys but all of us, the devil himself, or all three, which are not mutually exclusive.A dark, disturbing masterpiece."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It was a very hard book to get into, very slow.

I thought it was a very good book. The author did a good job of making you feel like you were actually there with characters. I don't really like to read but with this book I was able to get into it and finish the book.The novel the Lord Of the Flies was about a bunch of kids that are flying across an island during a war. Then the plane had been shot down. The kids end up landing on an abandoned island. As they hit the island they all get separated. Then a little bit in to the book they had all found each other and they decided to make a type of government to keep control on the island. Now as they go on in the book you got to think that they are all kids and they don't want to live under other kids rule. So as the story goes on they all start to turn on each other and start making their own organizations. As the book starts to develop there are a lot of different symbols that you start to realize. The symbols represent a bunch of different things the book and how some of the characters act. Then the book starts to get a little violent as they start to kill each other. Towards the end of the book they have completely all gone wild and turned against each other.I thought that the book was very good. I liked the whole idea of the book. I think that it is a good book and I recommend it to anyone that likes to read. It was a short and easy to read. I liked how the author had described the book in detail. that's what made it a book good.

I am extremely opposed to violence, but, unfortunately, violence is part of our way of life. People, I think, shouldn't reject a book because it is disturbing, especially if it relates the truth! If Golding had written about &quot;lots of happy little bunnies jumping under rainbows and making friends and living in harmony&quot; would this book be as popular as it now is? A good book should have emotional power: it doesn't matter whether it makes you feel happy or sad. Most famous books are tragic anyway! Turning away from Lord of the Flies, is, unfortunately, turning away from the truth. Anyway, this book was excellent and it, in my opinion, was an excellent parody of Swallows and Amazons, Treasure Island and Coral Island. I've read all three, and if you compare any of them with Lord of the Flies, you will see how Golding was tragically mocking (for lack of a better word - I'm only in eighth great and my vocabulary isn't that big!) the scenes of happiness and adventure and social harmony that you find in these books. It is interesting to not that two of the main characters in Coral Island (a horrible book, by the way) are called Jack and Ralph (best of friends in Ballantine's world!), which is crudely compared to Jack and Ralph in Lord of the Flies, where Jack's ungrounded animosity towards Ralph leads him to the point of murder!

It must be taught by a philosopher and an understander of symbolism. It is not just about some boys on an Island, but much much more! I believe that Golding had a great mission in writing this novel. He wanted to let the world see that people need to change their ways or all hope will be lost.

The boys start off well, Ralph is chosen as the leader because the has the conch shell, while Jack is chosen to be lead hunter. However, it is not long before the boys begin to give into their primitive instincts and conflicts develop between Jack and Ralph. Jack is not interested in Ralph's rules or the fire and eventually moves to the other side of the island and creates his own tribe. Things continue to spiral out of control from there, Jack steals fire from Ralph and then their are acts of violence against other boys in the group. The whole adventure comes to an end when the boys are rescued by a Britsh navy ship.Golding has created one of the classic books of modern literature. His characters are sharp and very well done. His descriptions of the boys and island are well done as well. His story-telling is tight and he never looses the thread of his story amongst all of his symbolism. Symbolism is what truly separates Golding's work from other novels. Every character represents part of human nature - Ralph is the ego, the organized part of society that has rules, while Jack is the Id, the part of our brain that wants to give into our base emotions. Piggy represents the superego and his glasses, or specs, intellectual thought. Golding's characters and their actions on the island force the reader to take a hard look at their own nature and how they might react in a similar situation.This book is absolutely one of the classics. I read this book several years ago in high school and enjoyed it. I just read it again and age has given me an entirely new perspective on the characters and what Golding is trying to say. If you have not read this book, I strongly suggest that you do. It is not one to be missed!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this is a good book that shows a struggle of man against evil. yet there is a deeper meaning to it all. very intriguing and overall a good book. easy to read and a significant amount of symbolism add to the depth of this book. a great book to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"this book is a thriller! It is about a boy who was sent to camp and then he was found not guilty and he found much much money!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"A must read book for all ages young and old.\\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a book about a group of boys who were stranded on a remote island during World War II. Jack, Ralph, Simon and Piggy were some of the main characters in the book. Ralph, who is the leader for most of the time in the book, has a strong rivalry with a boy named Jack. Simon is sort of a \\"peace maker\\" in the whole book while Piggy is usually the brains behind everything. Throughout \\"Lord of the Flies\\", the boys will have to face hard obstacles not only phiscally, but mentally and emotionally as well. I feel that I could relate best to Piggy because he at times was very much needed but at other times no none whould care if he was there or not. This book is a book that will captivate you for years to come. I know you will enjoy it just as much as I did. Although the ending was a bit of a disappointment, overall, the book is very good. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes stories that are just great to read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is about an airplane, which crashes on an island, and a group of kids are trapped there. The book is about their time spent on the island. The main characters are Ralph, Piggy, Jack and Simon. As soon as they crash on the island, they start having many problems. At first everyone is good and picks Ralph as chief. Then things slowly start to turn bad when Jack and his hunters let the fire out and a ship went by without seeing the smoke. Jack takes everyone but Piggy, Ralph, Simon and some little ones and goes to the other side of the island and makes his own tribe. My favorite character is Ralph because he seems to be the only smart one with some kind of authority on the island. He is the only adult like figure on the island.Ralph shows the kind of person that will see a problem and try to fix it the right way. Jack sees a problem as an opportunity to take control and start running everything and making the problem worse at the same time. I see this everyday, even when I am in class. You have your kids that are like Jack and want to give the teacher and everyone else a hard time. Then you have people like Ralph. The person in class that sits there and does the work because they know that making things harder for the teacher, will only make things harder for them. I'm like two in one because if I see a chance to make a good joke, I make it. Otherwise I keep my mouth closed.I thought the book was kind of confusing because the author jumped around a lot. And didn't explain things as well as he should. The book went a little slow too. My favorite part in the book is at the end when the navy officer is standing there talking to Ralph. It's a flash back to real life. The only thing I would change in the book is the lack of information.This book is easy to get into in the beginning, but then slows down during the end. I spent a lot of time rereading parts in the book. The only people I think would like this is a younger kid because they don't care about understanding it or an older person because they have the knowledge to understand what is happening."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Its a story of some children standed on a island after their oceanliner sinks. The children are well disciplined upon their arrival on this island. But, that all changes. Its a tale of human nature and how we will revert back to some of the natural instincts that we as humans try hard to ignore. A grim look at our darker side. A excellant read, and a classic book."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is truly a masterpiece, a mesmorizing tale of a group of boys getting stranded on an island. The characters realistic and believable, and extremely endearing. William Golding paints a remarkable picture of the island, and its ihabitants. Some call this book evil, but if it is, its becuase thats exactly what Golding was trying to show what human nature is- evil. This is one of the all-time best books ever written, a frighteningly real work of art. Any intellect owes it to his/herslef to read this tale."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Lord of the Flies, while it may be interpreted as speaking of evil, is a book about how society is based on trust. Without this trust, society falls apart. The story line follows a set of kids stranded on a deserted island; they attempt to organize a society, but the society falls apart when orders are not followed and when leaders are not trusted. This is a great book and should be read."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"English/Casserly/Pd.5/HHS\\"Lord of the Flies\\", by William Golding was a very intriguing novel. It was full of suspense, problems, and super-hit characters. The conflict between the boys and who was going to be the leader was quite alarming. One of the characters most picked on, Ralph was indeed my favorite because he was the smartest and should have been the leader of the group of youngsters. This book was great because it was unique and still mellow enough so the reader does not get confused. I enjoyed the tone of this novel, it seemed very real and calm. I also liked the creativity of the author and how he showed the savageness that can be within every person by the scene when the boys all kill the wild boar and put his head on a stick.... The end was a dynamic ending. I liked reading this book and I deeply recommended it to any none-fiction lovers."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"At first, reading this book made me bored. The plot made no sense and there was nothing to grab onto, just a meaningless story. Sure, it was interesting at first; a group of boys stranded on an island but as the story unfolded, there was nothing new and exciting that made me stay interested in the book.I went along and read the cliff notes to see if it was interesting at all and I realized that there was so much more than just a plot. There was a deeper meaning and symbols for so many things. It brought the mystery back to the story and it was interesting how William Golding put all of these clues inside the blan plot. I found many things for myself about Simon (my favorite), Ralph, Piggy and Jack. I realized what they symbolized and how they brout special meaning to the entire story.This book teaches a great lesson and it really makes you think. It's well worth reading, even if you don't agree on how the story ended or what happened in it. You'llbe satisfied to some point and you will see that HUMANITY CAN BE SAVED."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The Lord of the Flies is a horror novel like no other. You won't find anything plainly terrifying, like monsters or ghosts or aliens. What you find is the human instinct, bared for all to see--perhaps most distubingly--in twelve year-old boys, who have their lives ahead of them and who are tomorrow's society.The critical reading of this novel can identify jabs aimed at every human institution: Morality, Government, Religion, Sociality, every man's internal bloodlust. And nothing is safe from Golding's incriminating finger that accurately points out mankinds failings.Perhaps the most startling aspect of this novel is how TRUE it is. We see as the boys parade around the island, making one mistake after another and then creating more; what hits home is the fact that we can identify. We can look at the jealous pathos of Jack, and we know what he is going through. We might even encourage him, because he isn't acting outside of the average human's desires, though he is acting irresponsibly.Golding's book takes no prisoners, when it comes to his critique of humanity, and you won't finish the novel with a pleasant feeling in your stomach, but that, perhaps, is the intention, to recognize all that is wrong, all that depraves us, all that increases our downword spiral, all that makes our pompous idea of &quot;civilization&quot; appear absurd and completely unfounded. Golding certainly does not think that these inherent problems with humanity can be solved, but his intentions are to help us over our denial.The Lord of the Flies challenges the reader to grasp what he has so long denied, and it does so by showing us the simplest, most allegedly innocent of our species as it tears itself apart without regard to those same &quot;civilized&quot; values that it has so dearly prized for so long. The Lord of the Flies is a must-read, but be prepared for what you might find; the scariest of all stories lies in your own heart."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Read this book. It's one of the best ones out there. The writing is good, which is hard to find in a book that carries so many different meanings. Don't worry, it's all potrayed well. The characters are really people that you grow to either love or hate. There is no way to resist developing a favorite character and following him until the end. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This is a very famous book and so I felt I had to read it to know why. Now I do. It was, to say the least, awesome. It was beautifully structured and outstandingly written from the nobel prize winner for literature, William Gerald Golding. The story was inspirational and categorized by myself to be the greatest book i have ever read along side 'The Island Of Doctor Moreau' written by H.G Wells. The two books concentrate on the humans mind and traits within the stories and therefore they make a great contrast to be noticed by everyone. Read them and see what i mean!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"It was during the war when a group of British boys were transferred to a safer place.

Perhaps some teachers stretch the synbolism too much - many of the issues are kids struggling with are &quot;grownup&quot; problems that grownup can't solve either.For this reason it is actually more frightening and disturbing for an adult than kids."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Well written and visually descriptive novel about the savagery of mankind.

The central question being whether the outcome would have been the same if these had been adults rather than children."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I thought William Golding's Lord of the flies was a great book. It had an original plot and was full of suspense and action. I would have rated it a 5 star book but the ending was terrible. At the climax of the book when Ralph is being hunted the author just decided to cut the story off. All in all I thought the book was pretty good"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"I think that the reason most people don't like the book is that they do not understand the fine symbolism. I mean, some people don't read between the lines, because they still think it is a &quot;boys on an island&quot; story. Let me tell you something right now: this story is about the fact that humanity isn't all that civilized. The theme I got from this story is, &quot;Civilization is the root of all evil. Evil is the root of all civilization. The two are often interchangeable.&quot; Think on it. Then, if you don't agree, mail me and we'll talk it out."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The book speaks for it self its a greatly written book concerning fears and the elements of life.

Despite the book itself being sad and a good read in a literal sense, it has much deeper implecations. Just think: in their tragedy, they resort to their most primal nature. We all share the evil of the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; within us. Golding has shown how easily it can expose itself."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel, I still vividly recall the brave leadership of Ralph, the understanding innocence of Piggy, the thrill of the hunt, the smell of the pigs blood, and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys. The exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated. However, the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard. Truly captivating and dangerously luring!"},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"The major misconception about this book is that it's about a bunch of little boys trapped on a tropical island. The book is one big sybolism. Why can't everyone see that? And talk about dualities! Piggy's glasses are his window to the civilized world, and YET they start the fire that is the cause of most savage conflicts! Golding's a genius. To those who say that the boys degenerated too quickly, would you rather read an 800 page book tracing their degeneration. And chaos comes more quickly to 9 and 10 year olds than older people. Most of the people in my H English 9 class who didn't enjoy it focused on the 'boys on an island' story, and failed to catch on when the army man said it was a game. Maybe the book is a bit bloody, but come on! These are savages, only skeletons of the civilized boys they once were. This book is spectacular! If you can be open-minded, and can get past 'boys on an island', you'll love this classic tale of human nature."},{"Title":"Lord of the flies","review":"This book is about a group of young British boys stranded on an island.

I've noticed that some of the professional reviews tend to dwell on the more salacious parts but the vast majority of the book is about the power politics involved in the struggle between Charles and Parliament. It is a tribute to Mr. Coote that he makes the principles involved interesting and understandable to the modern reader. He throws in just enough information about Charles's personal life to provide a nice breather from all the politics. You learn about all of the mistresses and illegitimate children and how Charles liked to spend his personal time. He was a very physical and fit man who was quite tall for the times (6 foot 2) and liked to hunt and fish and play tennis and was an excellent horseman. The first third or so of the book, when Charles was on the run from Cromwell and the Roundheads and then in exile was also very interesting and even exciting. Charles proved himself to be very brave and resourceful and also intelligent and devious. The book maintains a nice balance between the political and the personal and is a good introduction to the times."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"The Author, Mr. Stephen Coote, handles this biography in a manner that I wish were more prevalent. Rather than writing a three-inch thick, thousand-page work, he states his premise about his subject, and then confines himself to what is appropriate within the context he has outlined. This is not a work that lists every piece of paper the subject ever held, and who was there handing him a pen. Mr. Coote delivers a disciplined, concise narrative, not a leaden overwrought tome that takes two people to carry. He makes his work accessible, readable, and still produces the work of a scholar. Happily more biographers seem to be adopting a more appealing way to enjoy History, the reading is interesting, and the only way it could be otherwise is to write three words where one will suffice.Charles II is a fascinating character that lived through a time of other major historical events that make this book all the more interesting. I have read many references to the infamous Great London Fire of 1666, but this is the first time the extent of the devastation made the impact on this reader that an event of its magnitude should. The better known events are all here, the plague of 1665, members of the Royalty changing, or appearing to change Religions as often as they changed their clothes, the children whose Patrimony was questionable many times, the intrigues at the Court, and the endless maze of deals and deceptions between England, Scotland, France, Spain, and the Low Countries. Family ties were as strong as they were useful, and loyalty to the king, or of his subjects changed with the wind, the latest eclipse, or comet.What is concentrated upon here is the King that Charles II became, and the events in his life that brought him there. The trauma, the defeats, the betrayal, and a young Son forced to cope with the murder of his Father. This was a King who would travel on foot to escape his enemies, who would walk among them if required; this was a man of rare courage. He was also a King caught in the maelstrom that was England continually ripping herself asunder with religion. He was forced to deal with Papists, Anglicans, and a host of other groups that made the already complex political situation in England all the worse. And when not attempting this balancing act, he faced Royalists, Parliamentarians, and a host of individuals with both an axe to grind, and an axe they would happily had cleaved the King's skull with if given half a chance.Oliver Cromwell, Archibald Campbell Earl Of Argyll, Louis XIV of France and the bloodiest Naval Battle with the Dutch in May of 1666, are all just pieces of this wonderful work. I made a comment in another review that if we had more History written this well the demand for fiction would be decreased. I felt that way then, I feel it even more strongly now."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"Stephen Coote's biography on Charles II is an enjoyable story of a man who the author has titled \`Royal Survivor'. This book, which is just under 400 pages (hardback format), takes the reader on a trip with Charles II, through his trials and tribulations, his victories and his defeats. We follow Charles II from boyhood, the death of his father and his attempt to re-claim the throne which met its end at the Battle of Worcester. Then the author takes us along with Charles II as he makes an exciting escape from England back into exile and then his triumphant return to the Throne of England.We then settle into an account of Charles II as the King of England, his conflicts with Parliament and the tales of his many mistresses. We follow the story through the period of the Restoration and other great events that occurred during his reign. After finishing this book I really believed that I had gained a better understanding of the subject and the times. In fact I came away from feeling that the King wasn't all that bad and maybe he did try to do his best for England (within a certain framework).Not only did the book offer an account of Charles II and his private life but we are also provided with accounts of his struggle with the Dutch provinces, France and its King, along with the plague and the Great Fire of London. I would not consider the book to be an in-depth biography but more of a narrative history offering the reader a general overview of the subject. That said, I still found the story interesting and learnt quite a few things along the way.I believe that anyone who enjoys good history without too many dates and names will be quite taken with this account of Charles II. The book provides the reader with a free flowing narrative, holding your interest throughout the whole story. The book is well presented and has a number of black and white photographs of the period. Overall this is an excellent story and well worth the time to read."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"I found Stephen Coote's biography on King Charles II to be quite good. The book proves to be well written and well researched. The author managed to bring out the character and personality of this king in his biography that proves to be both informative and entertaining. I believed that the key element of this biography is the high readability of the book to almost anyone interested in the subject matter. Its a book written for the general masses, not for scholars or footnotes fanatics.If there's a general weakness in the author's approach, it seem like the author appears to excused Charles' many extra-sexual activities. Coote regards Charles' high sexual activities as result of his dire poverty-stricken existence during his long exile. He seem to have more mistresses then most other Kings of England put together. King Charles II that come from this book appears to be a man, highly intelligent, got the \\"common touch\\" and acute in politics but he's also lazy, rash and live for the moment type of individual. He have endured what most Kings of England never had to endured and that created some interesting contradictions in his character which the book goes into very nicely.This biography come highly recommended to anyone interested in this time period."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"An amazing story of a prince gone into exile after his father's execution by parliament and his wanderings through Europe. Then his restoration to his father's throne as Charles II. He had an amazing sexual appetite, which led to all the illegitimate children, including the doomed, Duke of Monmouth. Charles II seemed to enjoy life, dodged parliament to the end and ultimately died a Catholic, and paved the way to his son, Monmouth's demise; his brother, James II's abdication; and his nephew, William III of Orange ascension to the throne. Great book. The house of Stuart could never be called boring."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"Stephen Coote's biography of Charles II, _Royal Survivor_, is a superb story in every respect. It suffers a lack of the kings' portraits, but I suspect this is no fault of Mr. Coote who excels beautifully in bringing a wealth of information to his readers. The biographer's evenhanded approach nicely integrates Charles' personal life with late 17th century politics, economics, science, medicine, social studies and religion. Mr. Coote spends a number of pages discussing Catholic-Anglican antagonism, showing again that moderns have gained little insight from our ancestors' mistakes.The book has very few weaknesses. A royal genealogy diagram would be helpful, but many are available. A few parallels with modern history are neatly if briefly presented. Little is written about those close to Charles who survived his death in 1685, his queen, mistresses and children. And I was curious if those who helped save Charles' life during his flight in 1651 were suitably rewarded once he became king!I very much enjoyed Mr. Coote's style and presentation. He reads well and easily, and I often had trouble setting his book down, wondering what would happen. The author is particularly strong when explaining European politics and religious doctrines, ordinarily dry and difficult topics. His book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"I just finished reading Amanda Foreman's &quot;Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire&quot; and have now picked up Stephen Coote's &quot;Royal Survivor.&quot; This is a great book, very much in the same vein as &quot;Georgiana&quot; and every bit as involving.

This book may have a &quot;lively&quot; style but it is poorly researched. It appears as though the author did no research in archives. The material has all appeared elsewhere. The bulk of the book is based on secondary sources. Fully 85% of the footnotes are from secondary sources. Some quotations are rendered with no footnotes at all. The footnotes aren't even consistent in their form. This a poorly researched &amp; sloppily edited book. There are much better books on Charles that you can get."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"Royal Survivor is great book written about an interesting person with a fascinating life. Born to the ultimate form of privilege Charles was the eldest son of the King. As and heir to the throne of the King of England, Charles spent his boyhood as the Prince of Wales leading a life a wealth and luxury. However as he grew to greater awareness, he observed the country go through the greatest upheaval in its history. The English Civil War was turning the world on its head. His father, King Charles I would be dethroned, tried, and executed. He would spend his young adulthood wandering around Europe, homeless, hoping other charitable monarchs to take him in and feed him. Then he is suddenly restored to his rightful place to begin a very memorable reign.Charles II is most famous for being \`the Merry Monarch' I however found the most interesting parts of the book to be his time in exile. It was not easy for a prince born the heir to the throne believing he was rightful king in a monarchy that had now been abolished, having to now live in state of poverty. For Charles it must have been as if the whole world had turned upside down. Poor, homeless, and impoverished the man who considered himself to be a king was hardly living the life, being tossed back and forth between France, Holland, and Spain. His previous attempts to win back his crown had ended in disaster. However with the self-destruction of the Protectorate government of England a few years following the death of Oliver Cromwell, he was then presented with the opportunity of a lifetime. Parliament invited him back to rule, and Charles was restored in a change of government that almost bloodless! Only the regicides perished when King Charles II was actually able to rule his kingdom. It was an amazing feat that he played well, but it was a victory that he did not earn.\\"There was also a more subtle reasons for irony. It was surely evident to Charles how small a part he had played in his own restoration. On the occasions when he had exerted himself and tried to regain his crown, the result had always been bloodshed, defeat and death. Now he had been bloodlessly willed into power by his own people, his single contribution having been the adroitness with which he had been able to present himself as the only credible alternative to the repeated failures of the Interregnum regimes. Charles had been restored not because of who he was but of what he was: his country's legitimate monarch.\\"p.180The reign of King Charles II was what the previous puritan regime was not: scandalous. The people, who lived under the tyranny of Oliver Cromwell's major generals, were most likely grateful to live under a monarch who paraded his mistresses around with pride. However his reign was more than just about sex, during his kingship England saw great progress in the areas of science. And unlike his personnel restoration, which he played no great role in, he directly contributed to the scientific progress that defined his era. Charles' grandfather, King James I, ruled a nation that took the idea of witches seriously. King James wrote a book about witches complete with flying broomsticks, and he seriously believed that it was a witch's curse that gave him an overly large tongue. The England of King Charles II brought to the Western World Newtonian physics.\\"The Royal Society was incorporated under a charter granted by Charles on 15 July 1662, and his genuine interest in scientific matters led to research and debate becoming fashionable among the nobility and gentry. Charles employed one of his gentlemen ushers to convey his enquiries to the Society and probed the members as to why sensitive plants flinched and contracted when touched, and why ants' eggs were sometimes bigger than the ants themselves. He arranged for a laboratory to be built in his palace at Whitehall where experiments could be conducted before him or he could investigate problems for himself. He took a keen interest in inventions that the society patented, presented it with curiosities, and throughout his life provided members with the venison traditionally eaten at the anniversary dinner. What Charles was encouraging in such ways was a profound change in the manner in which the elite looked at the world.The regular publication of research was a crucial part of the Society's early achievement and, if the initial hopes of its founders were nor immediately realized, the record of its success is remarkable indeed. The group of scholars and gentlemen amateurs incorporated by Charles included Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and above all Sir Isaac Newton. Though the discoveries of these men especially, it became possible to view the universe as acting in all places and at all times according to consistent and verifiable rules or natural laws.\\" p.258-9Throughout his life and reign King Charles II was a brilliant politician in ways his father could have only dreamed of being. Despite his humble method in restoration he would emerge as a very powerful king. He has a troubling legacy in terms of succession. It is still unclear to me why he did not try to legitimize the Duke of Monmouth. King Henry VIII was desperate for an heir and often considered making his illegitimate son that person. Had Henry Fitzroy, the Duke of Richmond lived as long as his father he mostly likely would have been king. Even if Henry VIII held off to the birth of his legitimate son, Edward VI, Richmond still would have been in line in the same manner that his sisters, Mary I and Elizabeth I, were. Yet, Charles, even though Coote writes that the he considered his lawful heir, the Duke of York, to be a moron, he did not chose to support his son. Ultimately, he Duke of Monmouth suffered the same fate as his royal grandfather only it was more gruesome. Nevertheless the Exclusion crisis, which tried to prevent his brother from coming to the throne, allowed Charles to triumph over his political adversaries and emerge supreme.\\"He had emerged from the Exclusion Crisis as an unfettered sovereign, and as such he would remain. He distanced himself from his Tory supporters, refusing them the privileges they might legitimately have expected. Indeed, Charles was determined to lower the levels of political consciousness and excitement in the country as a whole, and to reduce the influence of party activity especially.\\" P.344Royal Survivor is great book. The life of King Charles II is one incredible adventure and Coote creates a great narrative to explain it. I would recommend this book to the historian and non-historian alike."},{"Title":"Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II","review":"This book is excellently researched and well presented. The turbulent times of the reign of Charles II cast a long shadow on the following centuries of English and European history. The author gives us a most valuable guide. The book is easy to read and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"A River Echoes in My Ministry","review":"he river's current runs swiftly on the Mississippi River. Just ask Rosalie Heffelfinger Hall--she experienced it firsthand.In 1984, Rody and Ted Hall boarded the lobster boat Claire and headed out for a voyage down the length of the river. Maybe trying to capture some of the Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn myth, the two readied themselves for adventure. What they discovered was the kindness and mercies of God and His people along the way.Rody searched her life as they trailed the muddy waters and recalled anecdotes which groomed her into the adult she had become. From an alcoholic father to bouts of cancer, God had brought her into a life of significance. She searched for His purpose for the remainder of her days.The autobiographical book recounts the journey as well as the personal spiritual growth that led Mrs. Hall to become an Episcopal priest.Armchair Interviews says: Hall's vivid descriptions and candid comments in A River Echoes in My Ministry give a reader true insight into her soul searching."},{"Title":"Mr. George Baker (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"I loved reading this book about the friendship between a young boy and his 100-year old neighbor, both of whom are learning to read. The prose is rhythmic, jazzy, and fun to read, and the watercolor illustrations display great texture, dimension, and emotion.Although the situation is dramatic, the author and the illustrator take their time telling the story. There are no explosive moments or insights, just the little details of the everyday, set against a larger background of recent American history. Harry notices Mr. Baker's crumpled shoes and how they're always tied, the suspenders of his pants, and how the leaves float and swoop in the chilly morning air (the two sitting on porch, hugging their knees) as they wait for the schoolbus.Mr. Baker's wife comes out, and in two subtle but evocative pages Hest and Muth suggest their relationship. Against a soft as memory background of a New Orleans style jazz band, we discover that George Baker \\"is a drummer man, and some people say he's famous.\\" After the bus delivers them to school, Mr. Baker and the school children sit comfortably together with a common goal:\\"'We can do it,' says George after school...his lips sound out the letters.Real slow. But his fingers fly across his knees. Like a big old drum.\\"Telling a simple but beautiful story with heart and dignity, this book can be appreciated by readers (and almost-readers) of just about any age. Great production values by publisher Candlewick: Thick paper, easily read letters in \\"Integrity\\" font, and big, easy-going pictures. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mr. George Baker (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"I bought this because it was recommended by a book club I'm part of; it turned out to be a great investment. The story is written like music ~ there is a rhythm in it that is just really enjoyable. My son (4.5 y.o.) particularly loves the end -- \\"Tappitty-boom, tappitty-boom...\\" Although the underlying message (you're never too old to learn) is lost on him at his age, I have no doubt that eventually it will stick. For now, he usually just enjoys the beauty of the illustrations and the musical flow of the story's words."},{"Title":"Mr. George Baker (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"This powerful yet gentle picture book tells a marvellously uplifting and hopeful story. Centenarian George Baker is learning to read, just like his much younger neighbor Harry. Their commonality of purpose, along with the innocence of Harry's simple straightforward point of view, speaks volumes for the case of equality of opportunity. George's musical fame is secondary to Harry; he's happy enough knowing he has a friend to ride the bus with and who is tackling the same challenge as he is. Crossing racial and generational lines, this fine story shows that we are all equal before the vast mountain of dreams and ambition, that learning is a laudable goal regardless of one's circumstance or history, and that hope and confidence are universal. George and Harry quietly exude pride and sureness, and we as readers feel moved to cheer them on.This is simply a fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Mr. George Baker (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"Mr. George Baker is a book full of neat illustrations that are different on each page. It is a beautiful story about a young boy and an old man completely different, but alike in that they go to school together to learn how to read. Each illustration is a beautiful watercolor that goes right along with the storyline."},{"Title":"Mr. George Baker (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"In this charming story, a 100-year old man, Mr. George Baker, decides to learn to read alongside his little friend Harry. The road is hard, but the message clear: you're never too old to try.I teach 12th grade literature, and I read this story to my students in the first week of school. My students respond to the sweet and powerful writing with rapt attention and respect. The story never fails to get them talking about the importance of literacy.

I'm happy I ordered two copies because it was a wonderful addition to my children's collection of books."},{"Title":"Mr. George Baker (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"This book is a very great book with deep meaning. It shows the similarities (i.e. they are both learning to read) between a young child and a man who is supposedly 100 years old.

You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Interpretation of Mark (Issues in Religion and Theology)","review":"First off I simply cannot believe that this is the first review here at Amazon for this book. This book is practically a must have for those involved in serious study of the Gospel of Mark, especially those who are not familiar with the history of its interpretation and the issues surrounding Mark. Many serious bibliographies on Mark list this book and for a good reason. Just the copious notes, excellent bibliography, and introduction is worth the price this book is selling for used here at AZ. The notes themselves pose as an additional bibliography as some of the works cited there are not found in the main select bibliography. The book is a bit dated being published in its second edition in 1995, but still there is much to be acquired here. In addition to this, some of the book reads as a history of interpretation. Obviously, the book cannot contain everything about how scholars up to 1995 handled Mark as the editor needed to make choices, and because, since Mark began to be seen as a source for Mathew and Luke (Priority) and written before them, there has been volumes of books and articles written on Mark, but there is still much to be gained here.I am not going to critique the book or the articles in the book. I suppose the bibliography could have been larger. As far as choices the editor made for inclusion, I am no one to argue with an expert like Telford. I will simply list the table of contents and highly recommend this book for those serious students of Mark. I am sure some will find this review helpful, especially since Amazon does not have a \\"Look Inside\\" feature for this book, there is zero information here about this book, and there has yet to be any customer review.Get em while supplies last. These articles are being relatively given away here by third party sellers. If they do not update or reprint this book, one day we will only be able to get (some probably) of these articles by paying much more through online journals.Introduction: The Interpretation of Mark- A History of Development and Issues by William Telford (editor)1.

The powerpoint and overhead slide presentations on the CD give you training programs for two days, one day, half day or one hour. The book itself walks you through step by step on how to design an effective training program. This is simple enough to follow for even the novice trainer, yet it is comprehensive enough to meet a seasoned trainers needs. I plan on incorporating many of the learning activities in our training program."},{"Title":"Communication Skills Training (ASTD Workshop Series)","review":"I was hoping to have an off the shelf option for my communications training program, but alas, this is a real dud. The information is very basic, and unfortunately, the accompanying PPT slides are mediocre at best. Keep looking. This one isn't your answer unless you're working with high schoolers."},{"Title":"Communication Skills Training (ASTD Workshop Series)","review":"Was very disappointed when this arrived from seller and feel fortunate that I checked the contents instead of just filing away for use later. The CD packet was missing upon delivery which makes the book pretty much useless. Very pleased as usual with Amazon for making this right but the seller/shipper should have much better quality control to ensure that this does not happen!! As a result, would never order from this particular seller again."},{"Title":"Communication Skills Training (ASTD Workshop Series)","review":"Communication Skills are behavioral by nature and therefore books often times miss the mark in trying to convey the teaching of such skills. Content organization or creation of PowerPoint presentations lend themselves to the written word very well. But trying to create behavioral skills training through the media of the written word is just not very effective. Overall the book is good as are all the ASTD training books but there is nothing like taking an actual training with video feedback from professionals that model the behavioral to get the biggest bang for your buck. I would buy this book but understand that the content pieces are of most value."},{"Title":"Communication Skills Training (ASTD Workshop Series)","review":"...and not really suitable for experienced Work-Shop leaders. I tried this book to get a sense of the quality of the books in this series. Personally I consider this book as too basic, and I must say that the quality of the provided material, such as for instance the slides, is not the standard I would expect. I would recommend this book for not so experienced trainers or people that would want to run an inhouse workshop for their own team."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Snappy. Fun. Funny. UNIQUE! Finally...something different to read! The dialogue is witty. The characters were amusing. The main character is so very clever; I like the \\"stream of consciousness\\" way about him. I am not one to read \\"long\\" books, however, all the moments in the characters' lives were ironed out in the craziest, most entertaining ways.I want to read more books like this. In fact, I purchased Show World by Barnhardt. I'm looking forward to the read!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I have read this book every year that I have lived in New York, and each time I have a different experience with it. The first time I read it, I had just arrived in NY, fresh out of college, and I agreed with the reviewer who wrote that it's a great book until the end. Then I read it a year later and decided that it could not have ended any other way. This book is about growing up, and it has so mirrored my own experience of this city that I laugh and cry and have a totally different experience of it each time I pick it up. Sort of like looking at an old photo album--where you realize your relationships with the people inside the book have changed, but the feelings evoked by looking at them are just as strong as ever.It's lovely. I can't imagine admiring a book more."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"This is far and away the most enjoyable book I have EVER read. I bought the hardcover in 1989, and over the years have re-read it many, many times. I even named my daughter &quot;Emma&quot;! It is laugh out loud hysterical, and deeply moving. You feel as though you are transported to NYC in the 70s and 80s, sharing experiences with these unbelievable realistic characters. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is, I have yet to find one I like as much, and I read A LOT of books-trust me!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Read this book! If you were in college in the '70s I know you'll agree with me that \\"Emma\\" captured the essence of that time better than anything ever written - ever. This is my favorite novel. It amazes me how often I find people who share the same opinion because Wilton Barnhardt is not so well known. This gifted writer should stop teaching and keep writing! All his novels are terrific, but \\"Emma\\" will always have a special place in my heart"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Emma Who Saved My Life is one of the funniest novels I've ever read, and one of the sharpest memoirs of NYC. I was born and raised in that wonderful city, and lived and worked there during the years covered by the story. Borough by borough, the author has the NYC of that time exactly right. One of the reasons I love this book is that it brings me back to the years I spent there."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Found this book in a discount store, cost $1, decided why not give it a try...surprise discovery: $1 nowadays does indeed buy something worthwhile! Definitely a book to purchase GUILTFREE, even for FULL price (imagine that!), because you'll likely want to hold onto it, given it's the rare book where throughout the reading you're entirely convinced you are peering straight into another person's mind, essentially eavesdropping on his deep-most feelings- Gil, the main character who tells the story, is devoted to expressing his honest reactions (he's not ashamed to reveal to us the times he cried; no false pretensions here- how refreshing!- those of us who have brothers probably don't know them as well as we end up knowing Gil; in this novel Barnhardt displays a special talent for MAIN character development). Barnhardt created this man-boy Gil in such a way that I thoroughly believed that Gil was Barnhardt himself (meaning, an autobiographical work)...and from this false impression arose my only disappointment: at the end of the book, after I read Barnhardt's bio, I had to face the fact that Gil's a fictional character and not a real man! Silly but true! Besides for the joy (and in this novel's case, the sense of relaxation) that comes from feeling as if you're truly inside the main character's brain is Barnhardt's marvelous talent for capturing the pulse of New York City in the 1970's and 1980's. Amazingly delightfully on-target! Do read it for fun...and, as an extra and somewhat unexpected benefit, you may find yourself not only entertained but relishing contemplating this novel's deeper &quot;meanings&quot; about whether the path you've chosen in life is taking you where you REALLY want to go (re: Gil pondering his &quot;ultimate&quot; decision about how to spend his acting career- Those reviewers here who disliked the novel's ending might like to rethink their understanding of it by asking themselves &quot;What does Gil REALLY do next?&quot;)."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I happened to obtain an advance galley of this book in 1989, when it was first published, and something made me sit down with it--I'm convinved that fate exists, as this is definitely among my &quot;Top 5&quot; fiction books of all time, and like other reviewers, I continue to give this hilarious book away as a gift to anyone I consider a good friend!I cannot do the wry and right-on-target observations and humor justice here, but I can *promise* that anyone who reads two chapters of this book will not want to put it down until it's finished, at which point they'll want to go back and read it again!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"This book is great.. i picked it up in a discount store and it would have to be one of my best finds ever! One of the first books i ever read that made me actually laugh out loud while reading it. Definately recommend!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I was absolutely crazy about this book in the late 80's and early 90's and reread it recently to see if it was as good as I remembered. Everything I'd loved about it - Gil's love affair with NYC, his infatuation with Emma, an overall feeling of hopefulness and youth - was as fresh as ever. I'm sure I'll read this book in another five, ten, fifteen years and still feel the same way I did about it when I first read it in 1989."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"In this story we see Gil come to the Big City of New York to find his dreams as an actor on Broadway. But that famous avenue seems a long way off, Gil has to endure many trying situations in the acting profession. He has what would appear to be a dream setup - living with two attractive women - but even in this part of his life, Gil is having less than successful. It is Emma, that crazy would-be poetess who salvages the ten year ordeal for Gil. Emma is Gil's anchor to reality, even when she is at her most manic. It is through Emma's eyes that we see Gil's triumphs and failures. She is the prisim through which everything in this novel becomes real and bareable. The world would be better off if everyone had their own personal Emma. I highly reccommend this novel from Wilton Barnhard, it's definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Didja ever notice that the folks who really love this story don't live in NYC?Will have more to say when I finish the story."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I shelved it after laboring to read the first 200 pages. The main characters are shallow, cardboard-like caricatures. The dialogue is cliche, the characters are cliche and Barnhardt's attempt to capture a period of time in NYC rings so false, you wonder if he ever spent any time in New York. A real bore. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I picked up this book from my local Salvation Army for about 50 cents. I had never heard of the author. After a few pages, I fell in love with the characters. The author presents each chapter as an engaging short story of an average actor wannabe in New York. His characters are so real (yet so larger than life) you want them to keep living after the last chapter ends. I have read it a million times, and believe me, there are only a short list of books I will read over and over: Richard Adam's \\"Watership Down,\\" Elizabeth Ann Scarborough's \\"Songs from the Seashell Archives,\\" Janet Fitch's \\"White Oleander\\" and every Narnia book in print. Just give it a try."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"This is one of the most delightful books I have had the pleasure of reading. Mr. Barnhardt's understanding of the fascination that draws thousands of young people to New York to find fame and fortune in the world of arts, letters and the theatre and the tribulations, heartbreaks, joy, success and failure is uncanny. I am 61 and loved it. I gave it to my daughter who is 29 and she loved it. If you are at all interested in the world of arts and entertainment, try it. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"This book was highly entertaining, but not too much more than that. The way Barnhardt peopled the book reminded me a bit of Dostoevsky's technique--putting so many characters into a novel that it feels almost like a universe. I liked that aspect of the book, as it made the story more interesting and added realism. I also liked the fact that the novel had a comfortable feeling overall, as though you were reading about people you really knew. However, I never saw much character development with most of the people, with the exception of Gil. I know, I know--the whole book was devoted to Emma's character. But when I stop and think about it, Emma was incredibly complex and bizarre and for some reason I feel like I only got the wacky side of her. I guess we're not meant to know why she is still committed to celibacy for ten years (etc.), but there was still a feeling that a lot was missing. I honestly didn't like Emma. And the ending...well, I guess it was consistent with the rest of the book, but it just seemed really gross. I'm not sure what to make of it. At any rate, this is a good book to read if you've got a couple of afternoons to spend, at least for the interesting description of New York in the seventies."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"A beautiful story of coming of age and of the unrequited love that many of us have for close friends. I found the story and the characters to be deeply personal and very real. Barnhardt has a gift for characterization that makes me pray that he will continue to write. The story was brilliantly conceived and the hero, Gill, is truly a Holden Caulfield for the modern reader. The only criticism that I and others have noted is that the book is hard to get into and that the ending was brutal and seemingly out of place. I would counter, I suppose, that this was the only real way for the story to end. Good reading!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"This is a wonderful book, the best I have ever read in fact."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I wish my favorite novel were by a woman. But it's not. It's this one (with Barton's The El Cholo Feeling Passes a close second-- gulp, that one's by a man, too).Emma, who shares her name with Jane Austen's creation, is a wonderful character. This book has stayed with me for years, and although I have given away lots of copies, I always buy another soon after. I haven't gotten through Gospel yet (don't do that epic thang), but I have great hopes for Show World."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"The characters are incredibly well-written. The story is engaging. And Gil, our anti-hero, is the prototypical 80's guy in search of meaning in his life. I absolutely loved every word of this book and can't wait to read Gospel, Barnhardt's next book. I laughed out loud at least 5 times during this book. It left me so warm and happy that my wife, who almost never reads books I recommend, is reading it now and loves it"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"The reason I started my blog, SHELF DISCOVERY, was in the hopes that I could discover some undiscovered gem that could be thoroughly consumed and shared with my brethren. Of course, despite having won the Pulitzer Prize, when A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES was recommended to me I had no idea what it was that it would turn out to be my favorite book. Of course, the older one gets the more difficult it is to find a \\"hidden gem.\\" The TALES OF THE CITY series, Wally Lamb's SHE'S COME UNDONE, Edmund Wilson's trilogy, as well as CITY OF THE NIGHT are just a few of the titles I have discovered in strange and twisting avenues in the past 20 years, so, you will have to indulge me, I just assumed there was nothing old to discover. But thanks to an out-of-left field recommendation, Wilton Barnhardt's EMMA WHO SAVED MY LIFE is just that book, a long, sprawling novel that is the beauty, confusion, danger and joy of coming of age in New York City, 1974-1983. Barnhardt, who thus far has only published three novels, the most recent in 1999, is an author I had never heard of, nor had I heard of this book, so I am thinking, without doing the proper research, that somewhere, in some circles, this book has a cult following that has eluded me. I don't want it to elude you. Our narrator, Gil Freeman, leaves suburban Chicago in 1974 and moves to NYC to live with a former college friend, Lisa, and her roommate Emma, a poetess who is a more realistic depiction of the kooky NYC stereotype that emerged after the creation of Holly Golightly. The book reminded me of one of my favorite books of the 90s, Allan Gurganus' PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS, a book that I still never tire of shameless recommending. EMMA, however, takes a different route, as Freeman is a heterosexual male in a city and time that is constantly changing. The novel, published in 1989, doesn't know the new version of NYC, the clean, Disney-fied city, buts seems like it does - taking a nostalgic tone of the city that current writers do when instilling a time and place for the reader. The book is structured so that each chapter is a different year, sometimes looking at several months and sometimes just one moment that can crystallize the characters evolvement. Suffice it to say that I am not going to give away plot, because in a coming of age novel, even if that age is one's twenties, character is always more important than structural advancements. Barnhardt's sense of character, and time, and place, seems so on target that one wonders if there is a sense of biography at play, and if so, well then, just wow. One review used the term \\"unsentimental,\\" and yes, that is true, but that doesn't mean the book lacks beauty. A 1977 trip to Coney Island: \\"Think of how much life was lived here, how many girls got pregnant under the Boardwalk and had to marry their children's daddy, and how many servicemen came here for a last weekend before going off and...\\" A 1982 view from a window at Bellevue: \\" And I look out the window, beyond the lights, looking out beyond the security fence and the dreary looking park below, and there's a piece of the Queensborough Bridge, and some part of Queens, and the East River before me, a dirty barge floating with the tide.\\" The book is flush with such beautiful writing, giving time and place a noticeable sheen. It will be hard to imagine that I read a better book this year. I would place this novel easily with Richard Price's LADIES' MAN, Ed Wilson's THE BEAUTIFUL ROOM IS EMPTY and Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER as a definitive look at NYC in the 1970s."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"One of the best books I've ever read...and I've read a lot of books! I've lived in New York since '97, I read the book when it came out and just re-read it, and its greatness still stands.Remarkable debut."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Wilton Barnhardt is a wonderful writer. His novel, GOSPEL, is one of the best books I have ever read. EMMA is not as profound as GOSPEL, but it's well-written and engaging. Sounding possibly autobiographical, it tells the story of a young man who comes to New York in the early 1970s to become a stage actor. The novel captures the feeling of that era nicely. Especially to those who, like me, lived through and came of age in that decade, I recommend this book for the nostalgia alone. Barnhardt has a great skill with using language, so there's a recommendation also for other writers to learn from his skills (he's a writing teacher, after all). I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I first read this book when I, like the protagonists, was in my early 20s and just starting out in New York City. I loved the book then-- it's full of hilarious situations, terrific characters, hopes and dreams, etc. Re-reading it in my late 30s, I am also struck by the beautiful sense of melancholy and wistfulness that haunts this book-- the characters know they are having the time of their life, and it may not last forever. It is a beautiful, inspiring, upbeat read."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I don't read a lot of fiction because I tend to prefer biographies and true crime, so when I can find a fiction book that I really enjoy, it stays with me. I bought this book on a total whim some years ago because I was going on vacation and wanted to grab something to read and this paperback was fat, looked humorous, had young characters and was set in NYC. No, I don't live in NYC because my job happens to be located further down the coast, but I do visit there a lot and like to read about it. I also have friends who moved there from the Midwest after college and are still there, so I have some idea of what the place is like.Upon reading the book, it turned out to be about young people pursuing acting and writing careers in New York in the pre-AIDS era of the 70s, when the worst thing that would happen to you from sleeping around would be either herpes (which one character comes down with) or an unwanted pregnancy (which happens to another character). The characters mostly get sidetracked off in other directions before achieving their goals, but the main character, Gil, an aspiring actor, does eventually achieve a measure of success. The story begins when Gil first comes to NYC after college and meets up with his former college crush, who he still has a crush on, and her roommate Emma, who he proceeds to get an even bigger crush on. The book then follows the trio through the ups and downs of jobs, relationships, and in Gil's case, acting gigs, some of which are hilarious. I laughed until I cried at the chapter where Gil finally lands a starring role - as a giant bunny, complete with fur suit, in a children's theater production. Another riotous moment comes when Gil and a friend get a job reading and evaluating mostly awful play scripts sent in by aspiring playwrights, including such gems as a musical based on the life of Anne Frank.Despite most of the book being laugh-out-loud funny, it does have a couple of flaws. Although the book is billed as being about Emma and about New York, this is primarily Gil's story. There are entire sections of the story that are largely devoid of anything Emma or of anything particularly specific to New York (mentioning that the characters ride on subway lines doesn't really make it a \\"New York Story\\"). When Emma is present in the story she's mostly delivering wisecracks or endlessly planning to become a writer without ever actually writing anything. You get the impression that the concepts of \\"Emma\\" and \\"New York\\" are more dreams that Gil has in his head than anything concrete or bearing any resemblance to the real Emma or the real New York. The ending is seemingly designed to show that Gil has matured beyond his carefree days of crushing on Emma and is on to a new, mature (and frankly, boringly yuppiefied) life, but as others have noted it seems at odds with Emma's character up to that point and unfair to her, as if the author wanted to punish her for never returning Gil's feelings adequately in the earlier part of the book. Consequently, Gil's apparent \\"success\\" leaves a bad taste in the reader's mouth. If you can get past that and maybe just re-imagine a new ending for the book that's more positive for Emma (or maybe even has her giving ol' Gil the heave-ho, as she really does seem much more interesting than he is) then the rest of the book is a dern good read."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I am a writer, avid reader and 1st edition book collector. I bought this hefty novel in paperback in '89-'90 when it first came out. Fell absolutely, 'head over heels' IN LOVE with it. I loved everything about it: the characters, the humor, the stories, the setting, the writing. I have never had a book affect me in such a profound, life-altering manner. Once finished, I immediately mailed it off to my best friend/old college roommate, who is a successful actress. She also ADORED it too. (If you've read it, you'd understand why it affected us both, as she was/is an actress, and I, a writer. Both struggling \\"artist types.\\") We made a pact, at the time, that neither of us would name a daughter Emma, (which was not a very popular name in 1990) I then ran to my local collectible bookstore and bought a First Edition hard copy. I was that convinced that EMMA WHO SAVED MY LIFE would become an enormous success and Barnhardt would be hailed as the next John Irving, at the very least. I was certain this was a great investment. Further, I even purchased an \\"uncorrected copy\\" of the book. That is more difficult to find and more lucrative to own -- especially if the author becomes a success, which I was positive would happen. It never happened. Nevertheless, this is my all-time favorite novel. And I did name my dog Emma, in honor of the book. Our pact did not extend to pets! I cannot recommend a book more highly."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I've read this book three times and bought several copies to give as gifts. It is hilarious, touching and unforgettable"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"but that didn't prevent me from loving the book. To call it a &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; for the 70's is to overrate Salinger and underrate Barnhardt.

The pace doesn't skip a beat, the characters are actually interesting, and the book provides an account of a New York City I could only dream of when I was a youngster on the other side of the world. This is definitely a coming-of-age story, and the narrator does some growing up and comes to terms with his place in the world. It's not necessarily all wrapped up neatly at the end, but it doesn't leave you feeling robbed either. The characters are so real I believed in it, and the tone wasn't as arrogant as some other coming-of-age books. Definitely a book that I didn't want to end, and it's not often I'll admit to a cliche like that!"},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Truly one would have to say, nay be forced to admit that Emma Who Saved My Life is simply a classic among novels. forget the disillusioned Holden Caufields, Gil is the true hero. Emma is such a vivid, wonderfully realized character that you can't help but to fall in love with her! I hope someday to buy the film rights to this book and put it on the screen exactly as it is in the novel. The dialogue is perfect! The comedy great and the story the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"It's hard to like any book a teacher assigns you to read but in the case of Emma Who Saved My Life, that antipathy was quite on target. I found this book boring, the people populating it pompous and self-absorbed, and the author lacking in his talents. It's a book that will put you to sleep in the middle of the afternoon. I've heard the people that came of age in the 1970's described as part of the \\"Me Generation\\" and if this book describes their era's selfishness as it really was, then the moniker is fitting. Oh, and the part at the end where Emma wants a baby but not a man in her life, so she plans to get friendly with six strange men in one day...? As written that was just plain gross. As one friend of mine from the class where I encountered this book put it, \\"She wasn't hot enough to get away with that without it being disgusting.\\" I agree.Not just a bad novel, a distressingly icky one."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"I don't understand the enthusiasm for this book. Although we are told ad nauseum how fascinating and edgy Emma is, she -- like the narrator -- is simply a grind, an average girl who works in a pizza parlor, writes bad poetry, and is kitted out with a formulaic mennu of traits that scream Early 70s Youth. The three main characters are shoved from scene to scene like a trio of theater props, which might work if the scenes rose above the level of predictable cliche (Fag Hag Party, Crummy New York Apartment, The Agony and Ecstasy of Off Off Off Broadway, The Drug Scene, etc.) For me, this book held all the sparkle of a rather stale TV sitcom. Whatever impulse I had to laugh (there are two or three genuinely funny observations in the 400 pages)was crushed by the narrator's constant badgering pose -- FIND ME FUNNY! SEE HOW IMPISHILY CLEVER I AM! BET YOU WONDER WHY I'M NOT WRITING FOR LETTERMAN! No, actually, I didn't wonder. Not once."},{"Title":"Emma Who Saved My Life","review":"Oh, how I loved reading this book. Barnhardt's writing is some of the most witty and entertaining I've come across, yet retaining insight and wisdom not usually found in a book this entertaining. Oh, how I hated getting to the end. Not because I wanted it to go on further, but because Barnhardt subverted everything that the book had been leading towards with a hateful, unnecessary and rather unlikely ending that went for shock value, rather than realism and a logical end to the vivid characterizations he has created in the preceding 400+ pages. Gil Freeman is supposedly the hero of this book. Without giving too much away, in the final turn of events, I began to hate Gil Freeman, a feeling that only grew as days passed after I had completed it. His good friend Emma's portrait turns negative, and in the end, the narrative takes a striking and disturbingly misogynistic turn that left a horrible taste in my mouth, and left me wishing we could have had the story from Emma's perspective, rather than that of Gil, who I found to be a coward and a cad in the final analysis. I'm not saying I need a Hollywood happy ending, or even a happy ending period. But to make us like these characters only to pull the rug out and try and make the title character into a scapegoat and inadvertantly make the narrator into a whining and unrealistic pessimist makes me never want to read it again. I realize that reality vs. the ideal is a theme of the book, but there should have at least been one character with a redeeming quality at the end--unfortunately, Barnhardt thought Gil was redeemed at the end, when in fact he was not. I'm sorry to have to speak so negatively of this book. The narrative is beautiful and insightful, and paints a vivid picture of the late 70's and early 80's in New York City. As I said, I loved reading it. But I'll never read it again."},{"Title":"The Matchmakers","review":"I was very pleased with the promptness of the order and the condition of the book.

If you have read her other stories, written later in her career you can see the growth, so that alone, especially if you are a fan of her writing makes this interesting. That also is probably why some would judge this not her best. The plot varies in that the lady, a widow, Dori Robertson is in love but the guy, Gavin doesn't want to be and only realizes at the end that he does indeed care for her. I'm really not giving anything away, because this is the basic plotline of these romances; boy meets girl, they fall in love, have a falling out and reunite for a happy ending. There is also the frequently used plotline of matchmakers putting the couple together, the children as the matchmakers.

The women make choices, sometimes good, sometimes bad but in the end the bonds of their friendship helps them make it through.It is a reminder that your past is behind you, but with renewed hope you can chart your future."},{"Title":"Through the Storm","review":"One key to effective storytelling is being emotionally honest. Showing painful events is the simplest way of doing this.The author creates sympathy for that character, particularly as she struggles to rise above the tragedy. This emotional honesty, which is the core of Through the Storm, however does not excuse mistakes made throughout the narrative.The use of common figures of speech is tricky. On the one hand, it conveys the comfortable feeling of hearing an old friend tell a story. Yet, when those expressions are misused it raises questions about whether this is simply sloppy writing on the author's part, or whether it is intentionally reflecting a common misuse of these expressions.To give a couple of examples, the phrase &quot;window shield&quot; was used instead of the word &quot;windshield&quot; to describe the front window of a car. In addition, when a time is given, the author often says, &quot;the clock struck,&quot; even though the time is nowhere near the time a clock's bell would be striking.This misuse of expressions though is minor compared to the more distracting problem of shifting points of view. A paragraph will start from Mahogany's point of view and shift halfway through to the point of view of whomever she's talking to. Trying to figure out through whose eyes a given paragraph is being told is, at best, disorienting, and at worst, an exercise in frustration.Despite these flaws, Through the Storm, is a powerful story of the discovery of faith. Mahogany's specific struggles are those that anyone who has tried to find their own path alone through life can understand. In the end, it is a message of hope."},{"Title":"Through the Storm","review":"I found myself sometimes laughing, and other times I felt like weeping and felt as if I was in the story right with these wonderful people.

A book that shows you the fragility of our human lives, then gives you a rock solid solution about how to overcome the storms of our lives through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,then this book is for you. If you need a gift to give to someone to change their life, then this is the book to give them!!!!"},{"Title":"Through the Storm","review":"Sometimes we think we know more than we do about people, places, and situations. The reality is we know less and the only one that knows all is God. Through the Storm by Sha' Givens is a novel about two young women who find that the very thing that they are running from is the very thing that they need.Mahogany Malone and Jennifer Jones are best friends. They are bright, young, and beautiful, and think that they have everything under control until life throws a curve ball. Mahogany desperately wants to escape an overbearing religious mother who does everything in her power to protect her. As a teenager, one big mistake sends her on a path that not even her mother can save her from. Jennifer as a teenager has already hardened her heart to love as a result of a horrible incident and pathetic relationship with her mother. The two girls lost contact after Mahogany went to college but a phone call informing Mahogany that Jennifer was in the hospital brought them back together. At this point one begins to change and the other is left standing on the outside looking in. The only link is Mahogany's mother, \\"Momma\\" Malone.This is a story that is full of life's lessons and what God can do. The encounters that each young lady has throughout are situations that anyone reading it could relate to directly or indirectly. Unfortunately the storytelling was deliberate in evoking emotions (I prefer it to be more subtle) and read somewhat like a Christian tract. While as a Christian I have no problem with that, some might find it a bit preachy. Through the Storm would be a great conversation starter for individuals who you know are headed to the land of nowhere because the message is clear: Isaiah 40:31. It was an easy read and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Through the Storm","review":"Mahogany Malone and Jennifer Jones were raised in the same world but by totally different methods.

While it's got good information in it, I found the some of the illustrations and multitudinous typos to be distracting. It's also rather dated -- in their section on corsetry, they advise purchasing a corset or alternative -- such as a longline bra or merry widow. We've come a long way, what with the proliferation of pattern companies specializing in period costume! However, this is a good book for someone who is just starting out in Victorian Costuming. While the illustrations appear to have been done in a hurry, they are quite clear, and they do give a bit of a &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; version of what was going on in the time period and how it related to what you'll be making. The instructions are clear. However, it's not as comprehensive as their Elizabethan book."},{"Title":"Victorian Costuming, Volume 1: 1840 to 1865","review":"This book cuts to the basics of Victorian dress and simplifies the concepts. Since there are a lot of conflicts about who wore what when, depending on the author, I found this book very helpful for the ordinary person who just wants to make a outfit!! If you want to \\"do Dickens\\" this is great.For instance, the progression showing the difference in the woman's basic look between 1840 and 1865 is kinda neat. Then you can go plain or fancy Get it."},{"Title":"Victorian Costuming, Volume 1: 1840 to 1865","review":"This book was written in the 1980s, long before the current wealth of commercial Victorian patterns, Victorian sewing and corset-making manuals and reprinted catalogues of original pattern diagrams, and is mainly geared towards the home seamstress/amateur costumer who is interested in attending Dickens Fair [[...]].The book is black and white, and features hand-drawn illustrations which aren't perfect, but there are a lot of them and they're detailed and decent enough to even be used as pattern diagrams with some tweaking in the mockup phase. I would have loved to have come across this book fifteen years ago when I had no clue about anything Victorian other than I just loved the era. While it only covers the mid-19th century, it does so pretty well for having been published in an era that had few resources on the matter and most of the material has held up over time.There are many things I really like about this book. It's very approachable, and is geared towards walking someone through the basics and making a dense subject appealing without patronizing or overwhelming the reader. It offers many options to suit the reader's time frame, budget and costume requirements, and is very encouraging with a sort of \\"do what works for you\\" message. I also love that it covers the 1840s and doesn't just skip over what seems a very boring decade [but isn't]-- most Victorian costuming materials focus on the more fanciful and 'fun' later hoop and bustle eras. There are also sections with simple hints on how to achieve the appropriate hairstyle of each era, and pattern diagrams for several styles of hats and bonnets.While I'm more of an intermediate sewer and average historian, this book is still an interesting read and the information is surprisingly accurate and detailed for the most part, yet encapsulated into manageable bits for the beginner. It's a great start for someone looking to get into costume/re-enactment but doesn't want to commit to spending a lot of money just to dabble and see if they're interested. It's also a great resource for someone costuming a low-budget theater or film production. As a more serious enthusiast leaning towards historical accuracy, I still love this book because it was way before its time and was done well. Their sort of making-things-over approach really appeals to my crafting nature, like their instructions on how to recut jackets and such to make them suitable."},{"Title":"Dragonball Z : Kikenna Futari!

I simply need to say that this book is excellent. Civil War reading can be very dry, but not this book. Delia Ray takes us on a soldiers journey beginning with enlistment and ending with a soldiers life after the war, using quotes from actual letters and diaries strategically placed throughout the book. She covers such interesting items as what soldiers ate, how they drilled, their various living quarters, what they did for enjoyment, their attitudes toward their commanders, soldiers of other nationalities, and the enemy. She discusses individual battles, medical treatment, hospital and prison life, with such empathy that when you finish this book you will actually feel as if you were there yourself. The photographs in this book each tell a story in themselves, as well. They are some of the most moving photos I've seen of the Civil War. I simply couldn't put this book down onced I picked it up. I highly recommend this book to both children and adults because like my title says, it's not a book... it's a journey.

These things are of value and should not be forgotten. However, I see no need to rub younger children's noses (and minds) in the mire of war. Let the unpleasantries of life unfold at an age where there is more discernment.It is a pity that the words across the top read \\"Young Readers' History of the Civil War\\".

Menezes describes how this simple, illiterate man became the prophet and proponent of a religion currently adhered to by about 20% of the world's population. Of particular interest is how Mohammed's apparent admiration for the faith of the Jews and Christians in Arabia turned to hatred and vengeance; how this once-monogamous man, upon the death of his beloved first wife, proceeded to accumulate an enormous harem which included both a young girl and the wife of his adopted son; and how his \\"revelations\\" from God were used to justify (especially for himself, as God's chosen prophet) such licentiousness, along with brutal killings and the spread of Islam by the sword.The author also describes how Islam was influenced by the pagan religion in Arabia at the time Mohammed lived, but also Judaism and Christianity. It is interesting to note how highly Mohammed spoke of the Jewish and Christian scriptures and yet how, nowadays, Christians and Jews are so often despised by Moslems and distribution of their scriptures are forbidden in many Moslem countries. After several references to Koranic texts on the importance and veracity of the Jewish and Christian scriptures, Menezes writes, \\"These are admirable and indisputable testimonies by which a fair minded man and even a candid Mahommedan can see that the genuineness and authenticity of the Old and New Testaments have been completely attested by the Koran. Furthermore it solemnly adds that his people who have received the Scriptures (Koran) have no solid grounds of faith, their foundation is insecure and insufficient and their religion is futile, unless they observe and follow the Tourat [Pentateuch] and the Gospel.\\"The sections on Islamic beliefs, the Koran itself and the different sects within Islam are also enlightening. I now understand more clearly the tensions between the Shiite and Sunni Moslems in Iraq.I would definitely recommend this book for a clearer understanding of the Islamic faith. I gave it four stars instead of five because the text is replete with annoying mispellings and typographical errors. The punctuation could also be updated to make it easier to read.

Nonetheless, this slim volume is far and away the best inroduction to Muhammed, the Koran and Islam that I have encountered among the several books I have read on the subject. It is surprisingly current and fresh.The Rev. Menezes works straight through the topic in a no nonsense, highly organized, interesting and exceedingly clear manner. The book is a marvel of expository writing, providing a wealth of education in a small space. He does state his opinions, but you know when he is doing so, and he does it only after giving the straight facts.If one wishes to \\"learn all about\\" Muhammed and Islam yet allow himself only one short book, here it is! This little gem will give the reader a very strong working knowledge of Islam, and he will be well equipped to hear Islamic leaders, television talking heads and Islamic terrorists and know what they are talking about - and if they are fudging the truth.The book will also serve as an excellent introduction for anyone intending to study the topic in greater depth. It will give such people an excellent overview and a quick but solid grounding."},{"Title":"The Life And Religion of Mohammed : The Prophet of Arabia","review":"Fr.

I would give the book 10 stars if there would be such a thing. Maybe it's telling that it has been published in 1912 and it seems like it never had been revised and ladden with revisionist imposissions. The author is a former Muslim from India who amongst all things converted to Catholicism and himself became a priest. In my eleven years of reading everything that I could about Israel and the Middle East, one thing that rings true when you have an objective mind is that Islam is riddled with double speak. It is so common that leaders give a message in one language, condemming terrorism, but in their own they call for Jihad, holy war. Not a personal struggle as the revisionists of Islam and non Muslim dhimmis want to make you believe, but the one and only struggle that the Q'uran ever talks about, namely militant war fare for the advancement of Islam and more so for the loot gained through it. This is made evident by the author's notes and it has been confirmed through every source concerned by the progress of Muslims in western country many of which come from the very same countries where Islam is taught and lived and therefore live in danger of loosing there own lives only for speaking the truth."},{"Title":"The Life And Religion of Mohammed : The Prophet of Arabia","review":"If you want to understand the history of Islam before its beginnings, what religions Mohammed borrowed from other faiths, his history of epilepsy which led him to claim \\"visions\\" and \\"callings\\", and his slide into murder, adultery, and eventual mayhem, this is a must read.Very well researched and documented... a book extremist hate because it tells it like it is!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Life And Religion of Mohammed : The Prophet of Arabia","review":"Very good and indepth book on Mohammed.

Mo is exposed in all of his bloodthirsty, power mad, lustful and money-grubbing glory in the most polite way possible. Islam is unveiled as a fabricated quest for power. 1400 + years of horrific bloodshed in the quest for Islamic world domination amply proves the point of Mo's ideology. If Satan existed, then Islam and its Sharia would be his creation: Lying as a virtue, beheadings, amputations, crucifixions, slavery, child brides, polygamy, ransoming prisoners, a whole chapter on dividing up the Spoils of War ( Sura 8), the command to kill all unbelievers and take over the whole world, ad nauseum.The charming personality of the author shines through many times in his gracious compassion for Muslims trapped within a cult that threatens to kill them if they attempt to leave it.The violence in the Old Testament is descriptive, the Koran's is prescriptive: Sura 2::216 - \\"Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. ....:\\" No one shouts \\"Moses Akbar!\\" or \\"Jesus Akbar!\\" while gunning down civilians ... The attempts of moral equivalence by Muslim apologists, their useful idiots and various dim-wits are amusing in their displays of intellectual suicide.Mo is Mo. He said what he said. Devout Muslims take him seriously enough to kill people who disagree that Islam is a religion of peace. 1400 + years of the history of Jihad proves that Mo is the greatest conquerer in history. No one kills for Caesar or Stalin anymore. Islam is not a race, yet Muslims must take Arabic names, recite in Arabic, dress like Mo, and go on the hajj and give big money to Saudi Arabia for the privilege of throwing stones at stones and killing and eating a baby camel and all that the religion of Mo entails. Or else."},{"Title":"The Life And Religion of Mohammed : The Prophet of Arabia","review":"An outstanding book by Rev. J.L. Menezes. The first book I read after 9/11. A book written in 1911 stands alone as a testimony that predates the likes of the Muslim Brotherhood circa 1928. This is a book that is obviously ignored by the intelligentsia of our national government as nazism was ignored in the 1930's.The threat of Islam and its proponents to our Democracy and Constitution is real.

It slams Islam for its violent past while turning a blind eye to Old Testament violence. It condemns Mohammed for not ever performing a miracle (this is for some Muslims one of Islam's selling points), and accepts unquestioningly the miracles of Jesus. If you are looking for an overview of Islam, there are a hundred better books out there, and I am shocked that this outdated book is being reprinted in our times as a scholarly investigation of Mohammed and his religion. I bought it for a quarter at a booksale for a laugh, but if I had known anyone was taking it seriously, I would not have paid so much."},{"Title":"The Life And Religion of Mohammed : The Prophet of Arabia","review":"Book is mixed with Fiction.I am a Christian who has read the Korran and think that this auther may have been on drugs while writing his book.

When Jesus, or any prophet, was around most people did not like him.Think about it. Is a hater of Islam going to write a nice book on Islam than tell people this is a good religion? No! They are going to sound truthful, then mix lies to make the reader hate moslems. He, 1 person, wants us to hate Islam. The real enemy is Satan!!

Her memoirs, first published in 1995 and reprinted in this 10th Anniversary Edition, were actually begun in the late 1970's after she returned from a trip to West Africa, a time when she herself was still very much a \\"work in progress\\" personally and professionally. Then again, Faith Ringgold will always be evolving; this is not a woman content to rest on her many laurels.A memoir is revealing on two levels: since it's selective remembering, what the author chooses to tell us about herself ends up telling us something additional. WE FLEW OVER THE BRIDGE is candid, sometimes humorous, sometimes bordering on bitter, and almost quilt-like as she pieces together a wide range of topics, from the intensely personal to political and professional. Harlem at the close of the Renaissance, the art world's resistance to nonwhite artists, Black Power's resistance to feminism, combining marital life and parenthood with a career - all are viewed through her unique lens. For example, raised in a solidly middle-class environment by a mother who was a fashion designer and who inspired her interests in fabric art (and even collaborated at times), Ringgold seems to have felt overdressed at the revolution. She doesn't quite \\"fit in\\" but then again, I'm not sure she wanted to; she creates her own routes of activism. To any aspiring artist, I'd especially recommend Part III: Making Art, Making Waves, and Making Money.In addition to 40 beautiful color plates illustrating her work (mostly the story quilts), the book has numerous black and white photos of her family, associates, performance art and early paintings.

For a time I even had a copy of the \\"Great Scott\\" but it sat there unused...so I sold it and don't miss it. This one, the \\"Middle Liddell\\" is all, and probably more than, you'll ever need."},{"Title":"An intermediate Greek-English lexicon,: Founded upon the seventh edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek-English lexicon","review":"Dictionaries, however much we feel the need for them, always have to be handled with a certain amount of caution. Anyone involved in the compilation of such a work of reference has to be a jack of rather too many trades for total reliability. In even the best modern English dictionaries the derivation of words can often be seen to be dubious or even plain wrong by someone who has the requisite academic linguistic grounding. Such a grounding is infrequent, those working on the chain-gangs producing the dictionary are often not aware that there is anything lacking, but the general public are prone to believe that everything in so august a publication must flow directly from some fount of all wisdom and knowledge. Lewis and Short's Latin dictionary, the standard work of its kind for English-speaking readers of Latin, exhibits at one point the glaring and elementary error of stating that the feminine adjective Libyssa, Latinised from Greek, has some corresponding masculine formation Libyssus, and when I last saw the book nobody seemed to have picked the error up.Greek itself is a bigger and more complex language than Latin, but the task of the lexicographer with Greek is in some ways easier. Greek is a much more self-contained language, although it was written in antiquity in a large variety of dialects, and the dialect that predominates in its literature, the Attic dialect of Athens, is in many ways idiosyncratic and untypical. In compiling this volume the editors have decided, very reasonably, to include all vocabulary from Homer to the end of the Attic period, and also to include some important extras, notably words used in the Koine of the New Testament. These days it is likely that the proportion of students of Greek who approach it with a view to studying scripture is higher than it was half a century and more ago, in proportion as traditional classical studies have declined. With this in mind I started with a scriptural word, and I got an unpleasant shock. The word \`skarphos', the supposed \`mote' in someone's eye in Matthew, is not even there. I picked this word because skarphos means a stick, not a mote, and I had wished to see how the dictionary dealt with it. Not at all was the answer I got. I had better luck with a dozen or so other words, but even in such a small set of searches I also found that the Grecised equivalent of the Latin coin a \`quadrans' is not there either.The real reason for deficiencies of this kind is that the focus is strongly on Attic, and properly so when this work was put together a century and a quarter ago. They have a brave go at Homer, but some familiar old nonsense is still here in my pristine-quality new volume. Could you be capable of supposing that Homer talked about \`convoluted cows' or \`crumpled cows'? I thought not. Translating \`helikas bous' as \`cows with crumpled horns' may save embarrassment, but the Greek says nothing about horns. The ancient scholars told us that this \`helix' is a word meaning dark or black, coincidental in form with the word for a whorl. They give no further explanation, but it certainly makes better sense to think of \`helikopes' when applied to the Achaeans as meaning \`dark eyed' and not some ludicrous image of them characterised by rolling their eyes, which is what the dictionary would have us believe. If the expression may be forgiven, I consider these poor crumpled cows to be my betes noires. They are just black cows, the poor things. Again, the reader of book IV of the Odyssey is brought up short at the end of the very first line with the adjective \`ketoessan' applied to Lacedaemon. I suppose it has to be translated as something, but in the first place the ancient commentators make no bones about it that the meaning of the word was long lost even in their time, and in the second \`cavernous' is not even true.If I seem to focus overly on shortcomings I would do the same with any other dictionary. Sometimes we know no better and have to trust the dictionary, but when we do know better there is no reason for superstitious awe. This book is an excellent practical solution to the unwieldy 2-volume format of the original Liddell and Scott. Some urges will just not be denied, and I simply have to read Greek again. I am encouraged and not a little excited at how well in general my memory has retained my Greek over nearly half a century, and I have every confidence in the basic work of reference that I have just acquired in this convenient shape and size."},{"Title":"An intermediate Greek-English lexicon,: Founded upon the seventh edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek-English lexicon","review":"Simply put this is THE Lexicon to have if you want to study Greek, sure the Great Scott is more detailed but it is far less usable/transportable/affordable.

As a self teaching student I thought I should obtain this Middle Liddell and leave those opportunities when the Big one is needed to be spent in university library. When I finally received this book I was delighted by its clear printing and solemn binding. The Clarendon press did a prefect job in condensing a formidable dictionary into a moderate stature while retaining its readability. All verbs are given their proper principal forms in all deducible tenses, exceptions are clearly stated. Substantives and adjectives have declensional implications listed. Examples are quoted from Hellenic writers and their names appear subsequently (no names and lines of the work, regretfully).

To be sure,A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literatureis a much more up-to-date and specialized work for New Testament readers, but it is rather large and expensive.

Rarely have I found the Intermediate LSJ insufficient, even for graduate work although the \\"Big LSJ\\" has more examples of useage, and is extremely comprehensive. The newer Big LSJ includes Mycenean forms which is nice. The Intermediate has comprehensive listings of morphological forms. You can give this book hard use over the years and it will hold up well judging by my own copy. The paper cover doesn't last long, but the hard cover underneath is hardy. Exceptional value for money. There are a few pages where the typeset is a little faded but legible. A little weak on proper names although it has most of the most important. A masterpiece.I wore out my wonderful old copy and so bought a new and have new information. My new copy came with creased pages in the binding. I am also developing an allergy to something in the book (sneezing). I suspect that there may be mildew in the book. If so, perhaps either the book has been stored in a damp environment or is made of materials prone to mold (or both). Or possibly some chemical has been used in the ink or paper which is a problem. I am not particularly prone to allergies and do not have this problem with any of my other books - including the Big Liddell (The Great Scott!). In the light of my experience with my second copy, I'd have to reduce my rating of this book to four stars.

I use the version of Liddell-Scott that is found onBibleWorks 7. And it looks to be this \\"Middle Liddell\\" that is the version on BibleWorks. And I would say this size provides sufficient material without being overwhelming.Liddell-Scott gives the basic definition using one word or a short phrase. Shades of meanings are represented by giving more than one word or phrase for the basic meaning. When a word has more than one basic meaning, these are numbered using Roman numerals and listed individually. Reference to classical Greek authors is given for each of the various meanings or shades of meanings.Being based more on classical Greek than NT Greek enables this lexicon to give definitions for words that might not fit with pre-conceived theological ideas. And that is good. Sometimes, a word has been traditionally translated in manner that does not reflect the original meaning of the word. So this lexicon takes one out of preconceived notions and back to how the word was actually used. And that was very helpful in finding exact definitions of words for myAnalytical-Literal Translation of the New Testament: Third Edition(ALT).

It has yet to fail me when looking up words. Numerous definitions exist, and references to any given word's use by a variety of authors is provided. The book itself is a reasonable 900 pages or so, making it not too large to bring it along with me when I go somewhere. However, there are some serious problems in the presentation of this edition, and this is why I am scoring this lexicon so low. The content is great, but this lexicon is difficult to use due to its quality. First off, the printing is both tiny and rather unclear. The text itself is fuzzy, which is a real problem in Greek because it is frequently very difficult to distinguish the accents, most notably, the rough breathing marks. The size of the text is also a real problem, as it is miniscule. I find myself using a magnifying glass to make it easier to read after a few hours of translating simply because this dictionary hurts my eyes. There is no excuse for the text to be this small, either, since at the top of every page it reads \\"AN INTERMEDIATE GREEK-ENGLISH LEXICON\\" in large letters. There is also a rather large blank margin at the bottom of the page. I would estimate that about 30% of the page space is wasted, which is simply not acceptable given how unreadable and tiny the text is.This is a good dictionary, but this edition is a travesty to the magnificent work of Liddell and Scott.

It even tells you how individual sources (such as Xenophon, Herodotus, Plato, etc) use certain words. This is indepsensible, since different authors use the same words to mean different things quite often.

The entries are succinct yet informative, listing numerous uses of prepositions and naming constructions. Furthermore, word entries display where certain words are used in specific Greek texts and gives varying definitions for each different usage. Another nice aspect is that the compilers studied the usage of words all the way from Homeric Greek to New Testament Koine Greek, so you are definitely getting a full range of definitions.

After some deliberation, I decided to purchase this title rather than the Little Liddell. Because I am certainly no doctoral candidate (although I aspire to be), I did not even consider the unabridged Big Liddell. While the Little Liddell is, well, littler and thus would have been a bit more convenient to cram into a bag and lug around, none from this set are exactly a pocket dictionary. Furthermore, I believe the Little only costs seven dollars less than the Middle Liddell. I could not be happier with my decision, and it has turned out that the extra seven dollars was well spent indeed. There have been several times in class in the past few months alone that the students equipped with the Little Liddell have been unable to find a certain word. Obviously I can't speak for them nor can I say for certain that the lexicon, and not laziness, is to blame, but the Little Liddell seeems to have been cut back a bit too far.

His body of work was his philosophical opus, provoked initially by the prodigious philosophical works of Madame Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, in which she introduced the Western world--and Kandinsky--to Eastern philosophies. Kandinsky believed that art had a duty to be spiritual in nature, an expression of &quot;inner need,&quot; as he came to call it. He called &quot;art for art's sake&quot; a &quot;vain squandering of artistic power.&quot; This book was both his call to artists to meet their obligation to humanity and his attempt to define and explain color and form in its relation to expressing the message of the soul."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"All art students are advised to read this short masterpiece but I suspect few young artists take the time to read the book that best explains the concepts that lead to abstract painting in the modern era. I think it would be useful if I pointed out some of the most important and interesting themes and ideas that Kandinsky explains so tht you can see the vast range of this short 80 page book.First, Kandinsky was greatly influenced by music and recognized that music was judged under different standards than was painting. For example, music is not judged by how much the music sounds like noises in nature. We would never go to a symphony to hear the musicians imitate dogs barking, or ambulance sirens, or police whistles. Yet painting is judged by how well the painter reflects the natural world in a realistic style. Thus for Kandinsky, the ability for painting to lose the object, would free painting to pursue the spiritual. However, the ability for the painter to paint without painting the object is very much a challenge. He gives advice to the read on the use of line, form, and color to try to achieve this goal. But Kandinsky recognized how fragile this makes the painting process, for any brush stroke or color or shape can evoke the material world again. Kandinsky wishes the artist to free themselves from the material world so that they can express their inner impulses. Thus the abstract painting requires contemplation to reveal its meaning. Furthermore, the meaning may be a projection of the inner life of the viewer as much as it is the inner life of the artists. This concept is not new to music but it certainly was new to painting in 1911. Now we hear about the Rothko chapel in Fort Worth, where large abstract paintings by Mark Rothko create a meditative space for contemplative viewers. The spiritual aspect of abstract art is now a given in our culture, no longer a radical idea.Second, Kandinsky has very insightful comments regarding his contemporaries. He recognizes Matisse as the 20th century master of color and Picasso as the 20th century master of line but he faults them both for not making the final step toward complete abandonment of the physical world. For example, he points out that even though Picasso developed the collage and Cubism, that Cubism is deconstruction of the physical world but not abandonment of the physical world and thus Picasso remains earth bound.Third, Kandinsky asserts that imitative painting of other eras was a deadly trap for the artist, yet responding to the eternal call of the unconscious forces in an earlier period of art history was a valid area of exploration. His example is Picasso and other artists interest in the primitive. These artists did not wish to copy the primitive works but to respond to the same unconscious content that the primitive artist had tapped.Fourth, Kandinsky believed that art progressed, that artistic concepts built on each other and that there was a triangle of artistic conception that moved forward to some end point, yet to be discovered. This concept of progress in art, similar to the idea of progress in science, and not related to such cultural values as progress in fashion has lead to much debate in the post-modern era. It is interesting to read Kandinski's opinion on this topic and reflect on the last 100 years to see if he could be correct or mistaken. I prefer to think that the progress is the continued exploration of the human unconscious, an infinity of symbols and images connecting us to our spiritual base.Fifth, Kandinsky believed in a conceptual hierarchy in the world of painters and he thought only a few make it to the top of the pyramid where a few create truely unique solutions to visual problems. The others are imitative or formulaic and form the base of the pyramid.Sixth, Kandinsky warns against pattern painting since he thinks this leads to monotany and away from spirituality. In this regard contemporary artists have certainly challenged his conception. In fact, Agnes Martin, the minimalist pattern painter, is regarding as a great spiritual painter. In my opinion, Kandinski would have loved Agnes Martin's paintings. The examples of pattern painting he gives in the book sound more like the patterns on wall paper more than the minimal grids of an Agnes Martin painting.Finally, after all the explanation of why an abstract painting style should evolve and how artists can achieve that style, Kandinsky makes the linkage between the outer world of the painting and the inner world of the viewer with a quote from Meterlinck \\"The soul is curious for beauty.\\"Every artist owes it to themselves to read this short book on which so much art history, philosophy, and practice has been based."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"The 1910s was surely the most exciting, radical, innovative and genuinely NEW period in the history of all the arts, writing, music, painting, cinema, dance. it was also one of the few periods when creative frenzy was escorted by critical might, and is almost as famous for its artistic collectives, its '-isms', its iconoclasms and its spectacularly aggressive, wipe-the-slate-clean manifestoes as it is for any one artwork produced.Today, however, there aren't many of these manifstoes that possess more than quaint historical value. Kandinsky's 'Concerning the Spiritual in Art' is one, and probably to our own shame, speaks as loudly to us today as it did to the artist's contemporaries. A cry against all that is bogus or a dead-end in art - the bourgeois-currying; the trend-following; the excessively materialistic, naturalistic or representational; art in which formal invention is not matched by emotional power - the book demands a return to spirituality in art in an age where a godless faith in science has resulted in a soulless culture.Kandinsky is the artist who said that 'Art was close to religion', and his concept of painting is heavly bound up with his Russian orthodox upbringing (as well as later exposure to theosophy). One does not have to be a card-carrying mystic, however, to recognise the truth of his central argument, that the only art with the power to truly move us is that which is ruthlessly faithful to the artist's inner need, not public taste or contemporary styles.this belief led Kandinsky towards abstraction: he rejected the idea that a painter should draw what was on the surface, instead of its inherent spirit or harmony (if this led to a cul-de-sac in 20th century art, this is because Kandinsky's mimics lacked his moral drive). This book is fascinating as Kandinsky, still creating recognisably (though distorted) representational works, was struggling towards the abstract geomotry for which he is now famous. It is essential for any lover of Kandinsky's work, and modern art in general, with its revealing analyses of colour and form, their 'psychology', and the various effects they can achieve. it is a portrait of modernism from the inside, and it is goosebumping reading a gifted contemporary passing judgement on Picasso and Matisse, although time has parted company with him in his preference for Maeterlinck and Isadora Duncan.In his demand for a total art that would unite theatre, music and painting, he looks forward to the great Ballets Russes happenings, most significantly Nijinsky/Stravinsky/Picasso's 'The Rite of spring'. Throughout, he calls for painting to achieve the non-naturalistic liberation of music.But behind the passion and certainty is an intellectually playful (not always caught by the fusty translation), though deadly earnest artist, who knows that everything he says is provisional and a guide, a record of his own groping, striving, tireless searching."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"Kandinsky throws his ideas out in a slightly esoteric manner. It make take a few rereads to really grasp the quality of discourse he presents. But, in the end, his commentary shines brightly through his comparisons of music to painting. The spiritual triangle is comparable to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It is important to remember that Kandinsky is not using the term \\"spiritual\\" in a religious sense.This book is a very good read for anyone feeling slumped in their art making. And for anyone who wants to expose themselves to ways of thinking about art. By the third time I had read the material I had underlined and highlighted almost every line and filled all the margins with notes. The book is fantastic. It is especially good when paired with Hans Hofmann's essay \\"In Search for the Real.\\" Although the ideas in the two books do not parallel. In fact the lines aren't even on the same page. Kandinksky's critiques of other familiar artists are very interesting too. Names like picasso and Cezanne pop up quite a bit.I'll stop rambling now. Read the book, it is very good."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"[Please note - page numbers in this book and the references to Sadler's introuduction apply to the Dover edition, which is the best-seller on Amazon in the UK but is buried in the depths of the American Amazon at this link:Concerning the Spiritual in Art]This is a fantastic short book. I am amazed I hadn't heard of it before. It only came to my attention recently when one of my students, Nic Green, used it as a basis for her essay at the Centre for Human Ecology: the student teaching the teacher.Kandinsky, who was one of the founders of modern art, sets out to confront the crass materialism of his era and the trite art that it was producing. He understands \\"spirituality\\" as being the interiority of things, their inner source of meaning and life. He attacks artistic narcissism, saying, \\"This neglect of inner meanings, which is the life of colours, this vain squandering of artistic power is called 'art for art's sake'.\\" (p. 3).Consistent with his Russian Orthodox background, Kandinsky says, \\"We are seeking today for the road which is to lead us away from the outer to the inner basis. The spirit, like the body, can be strengthened and developed by frequent exercise. Just as the body, if neglected, grows weaker and finally impotent, so the spirit perishes if untended. And for this reason it is necessary for the artist to know the starting point for the exercise of his spirit. The starting point is the study of colour and its effects on men.\\" (pp. 35-6).And I love his honesty in a footnote where he says, of his colour schema, \\"These statements have no scientific basis, but are founded purely on spiritual experience.\\" (p. 37). If only we saw more awareness in the world of the importance of not confusing categories of thought between scientific evidence and artistic perception.To Kandinsky, Art's function is to reveal the spiritual. It \\"must learn from music that every harmony and every discord which springs from the inner spirit is beautiful, but that it is essential that they spring from the inner spirit and from that alone.\\" (p. 51).This has a social function, for \\"each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated\\". (p. 1) As such, \\"Painting is an art, and art is not vague production, transitory and isolated, but a power which must be directed to the improvement and refinement of the human soul.\\" (p. 54).Ultimately, \\"If the artist be priest of beauty\\", then she has \\"a triple responsibility to the non-artist: (1) He must repay the talent which he has; (2) his deeds, feelings, and thoughts, as those of every man, create a spiritual atmosphere which is either pure or poisonous. (3) These deeds and thoughts are materials for his creations, which themselves exercise influence on the spiritual atmosphere. The artist is not only as king, as Peladan says, because he has great power, but also because he has great duties.\\" (pp. 54-55).And the bottom line? \\"That is beautiful which is produced by the inner need, which springs from the soul.\\" He concludes: \\"this property of the soul is the oil which facilitates the slow, scarcely visible but irresistable movement of [the human condition] onwards and upwards.\\"As will be apparent, this sense of spiritual progress may be modern thinking, but it is decidedly not postmodern. How strange, then, that Kandkindy is seen as a progenitor of \\"modern\\" art and its seamless, to my eye, drift into the incohate abstractions of postmodernity.It is here that my criticism of Kandinsky takes effect. Kandinsky's mindset is, at the same time, premodern in its perception of the spiritual essence, but postmodern deconstructive in its artistic articulation. His spirituality is not an incarnational one, where the Spirit interpenetrates and quickens matter, but a dualistic one, where they can be separated or \\"abstracted\\". His purpose is laudable. It is to reveal the spiritual and make it visible anew \\"towards the close of our already dying epoch\\" (p. 47). But the problem is that he seeks to do this by abstraction, separation.This takes us into a world that predicates the transcendent, but implicitly denigrates the immanent. Thus, \\"The more abstract is form, the more clear and direct its appeal. In any composition the material side may be more or less omitted in proportion as the forms used are more or less material, and for them substituted pure abstractions, or largely dematerialised objects. The more an artist uses these abstracted forms, the deeper and more confidently will he advance into the kingdom of the abstract.\\" (p.32).And for Kandinsky such abstraction becomes a crusading obsession: \\"Taking the work of Henri Rousseau as a starting point, I go on to prove that the new naturalism will not only be equivalent to but even identical with abstraction.\\" (p. 52).In his wonderful Introduction to the text, Michael Sadler suggests that this extreme abandonment of representation of the real world is why, \\"The question most generally asked about Kandinsky's art is: 'What is he trying to do?'\\" Saddler suggests, \\"this book will do something towards answering the question. But it will not do everything.\\" (p. xviii). In contrast, he says, Cezanne \\"saw in a tree, a heap of apples, a human face, a group of bathing men or women, something more abiding than either photography or impressionist painting could present. He painted the 'treeness' of the tree.... But in everything he did he showed the architectural mind of the true Frenchman. His landscape studies were based on a profound sense of the structure of rocks and hills, and being structural, his art depends on reality.... The material of which his art was composed was drawn from the huge stores of actual nature.\\" (p.xvii).Where does all this leave us today, in 2010, 99 years after first publication of Kandinsky's little book in German?When I look at the nihilism of Britart, or the sheer inability to draw and express beauty in what seems to be coming out of some of our contemporary art schools (the students tell me they are discouraged by their tutors from trying to express beauty!), then it is clear that abstraction has gone too far. Like postmodern deconstruction generally, it is all very well to deconstruct, but what about the grace of reconstruction? Kandinsky's aim to reveal the spiritual was laudable. That is the true meaning of the word \\"apocalypse\\" - to unveil and reveal that which has been hidden. But abstraction on its own and as the highest ideal is like pulling up a plant to see how the roots are growing. It causes disincarnation, which is another word for death, and so both the material and the spiritual wither.The art that we need for these our troubled times needs to be an apocalyptic art of incarnation. It needs to reveal the spiritual, but not separate it off from the material world. This will be a new art of the sacred. And here is where we need a debate to start, and artistic action around that debate.A resource that I would suggest is a book by the theologian Walter Wink,Engaging the Powers: Discernment and Resistance in a World of Domination- especially the Introduction on pp. 3 - 10.Wink argues that we must reject the dualistic idea of Heaven being separate from Earth. We need what he calls an \\"integral worldview\\", what is also sometimes called an incarnational spirituality. Here Heaven and Earth are interfused in a single reality (Christians can read Luke 17:20-21; Hindus the Bhagavad Gita; Taoists the Tao te Ching, etc.).And we need art, in the full artistic and theological senses of these words, to \\"magnify\\" and \\"illuminate\\" what incarnational spirituality looks like. To open the mind and the heart, and give fresh hope to the world.Sadler's remarks on Cezanne are a pointer in this direction. Kandinsky's little book provides a crucial intellectual stepping stone. We have lived through a century of dying and dead \\"modern\\" art. We cannot go on like that. It is time to call back the soul."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"This warning has nothing to do with Kandinsky's book but with this computer print-out edition.

Kandinsky and his contemporary compatriot Malevich were fervent revolutionaries. While Marxist Leninism saw all human endeavor in terms of dialectical materialism, the Russian avant garde painters undermined Western Civilization on the spiritual level by attacking the very nature of reality. Abstract art, as explained by Kandinsky, is not, as was generally taught, a simple arrangement of lines shapes and colors in a harmonious pattern on canvas, but an attempt to attain and depict a divine gnosis. Kandinsky sets forth in Concerning the Spiritual in art his Oriental Theosophy based on the writings of occultist Madame Helena Blavatsky rather than Judaism or Christianity, both of which religions he openly dispised. Though the writer of this review disagrees strongly with the author's ideology, Concerning the Spiritual in Art is highly recommended to all serious students of both art and religion. Hamilton Reed Armstrong, AGDEI ART"},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"Kandinsky started a staid, respectable career in law, working his way up through university appointments. Then, a bit like Gaugin, something happened. Whatever it was, it was wonderful.Much of this book is written in a mystical style, in words about something that can only be known through direct experience. Originally, a Russian wrote it in German, and it was translated into English. Again and again, I felt that something must have been lost, most likely in the transition from the inside of Kandinsky's mind to its outside.I am left with more questions than answers. At points, Kandinsky rails against material vs. pure form - he's speaking of vision, but I am a person of my hands. Pure form would be free of the unique character of metal, stone, or wood, physical character that I connect with very deeply. I am left wondering whether some other sense of the word \\"material\\" would have been more informative. He writes at length about the characters of many colors, and develops a color wheel with some significant differences from the one I know. I am sure there is insight there, but it has not opened itself to me. I am curious, however, about some assertions (p.43) about red against blue - I'm sure that parts of his discussion could have been enriched by noting the colors' different indices of refraction at each step in the human eye.He writes about personality, style, and artistry - I just have to listen, I can not claim to have risen to the level he describes. I am especially interested at his predictions about how future man will see and create things, somewhat the way Mondrian made similar predictions. I'm interested because now, most of a century later, I really can't see how people have evolved in the required directions.I respect this writer, and respectfully withold agreement on many matters. That's fine by me. I came to listen, and this speaks in a very clear voice.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"This book destroyed any notion I had as an artist about why I was doing what I was doing, which at the time was surrealism. Not every statment can be agreed with, but if this book is not loaded with quads of relative and relevant directions to a more complete and whole understanding of why one should make art in a more sincere method, then I am not writing this review. Too often over shadowed by the philosophical statements of Duchamp, this book, as much, revolutionized art. If you feel uncertain that the principals by which you make art are honest, read this book, then make your judgement. As did witnessing Ad Reinhardt's black canvases, this book recreated my spirit, unexpectedly."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"Kandinsky had risen to positions of influence in other disciplines (political science/economics and law) before directing his considerable intellect to painting. His insights extended into the historic 'meta' trends of the arts and sciences, including the physical sciences, and had his interests been directed more to the history and philosophy of science instead of the history and philosophy of art, he might have written Kuhn's observations regarding paradigm change a half century before Kuhn did: \\"Here and there are people with eyes which can see, minds which can correlate. They say to themselves: 'If the science of the day before yesterday is rejected by the people of yesterday, and that of yesterday by us of today, is it not possible that what we call science now will be rejected by the men of tomorrow?' And the bravest of them answer, 'It is possible.'\\"Instead, Kandinsky extended the frontiers of painting and authored philosophic writings on the future of art that are among the most important of such works. M.T.H. Sadler, who translated this work into English, was a friend of Kandinsky's and was among his early admirers. The notes he has written in the front of the book (Translator's Introduction) are therefore more helpful than could be the opinions of many other critics, including myself:\\"Anyone who has studied Gauguin will be aware of the intense spiritual value of his work. The man is a preacher and a psychologist, universal by his very unorthodoxy, fundamental because he goes deeper than civilization. In his disciples this great element is wanting.\\"Kandinsky has supplied the need. He is not only on the track of an art more purely spiritual than was conceived even by Gauguin, but he has achieved the final abandonment of all representative intention. In this way he combines in himself the spiritual and technical tendencies of one great branch of Post-Impressionism.\\"The question most generally asked about Kandinsky's art is: 'What is he trying to do?' It is to be hoped that this book will do something towards answering the question. But it will not do everything. This--partly because it is impossible to put into words the whole of Kandinsky's ideal, partly because in his anxiety to state his case, to court criticism, the author has been tempted to formulate more than is wise. His analysis of colours and their effects on the spectator is not the real basis of his art, because, if it were, one could, with the help of a scientific manual, describe one's emotions before his pictures with perfect accuracy. And this is impossible.\\"Kandinsky is painting music. That is to say, he has broken down the barrier between music and painting, and has isolated the pure emotion which, for want of a better name, we call the artistic emotion. Anyone who has listened to good music with any enjoyment will admit to an unmistakable but quite indefinable thrill. He will not be able, with sincerity, to say that such a passage gave him such visual impressions, or such a harmony roused in him such emotions. The effect of music is too subtle for words. And the same with this painting of Kandinsky's. Speaking for myself, to stand in front of some of his drawings or pictures gives a keener and more spiritual pleasure than any other kind of painting. But I could not express in the least what gives the pleasure. Presumably the lines and colours have the same effect as harmony and rhythm in music have on the truly musical. That psychology comes in no one can deny.\\"Some aspects of Kandinsky's color theory are dubious, at best they cannot be universalized, and Kandinsky sees this. But other of his ideas and arguments are widely accepted among artists, even as being self-evident. Stating that \\"there is no 'must' in art, because art is free,\\" that is, free to address external representations OR \\"the inner need,\\" to merely chase after material 'objects' OR to wrestle with the mysteriously spiritual, to somehow meld the two visions OR to stay purely to exploration of the spiritual high ground, Kandinsky absolutely rejects the materialistic expectation of an art \\"explanation\\" that has been articulated by EO Wilson in his unfortunate daydream 'Consilience' (Wilson knows ants better than he knows humans, and is given to understanding humans to be essentially ant equivalents).Anyone interested in art history, painting of the past century, or the relationships/correlations/divergences of the various arts (visual, musical, literary), as well as anyone interested in the meaning and purpose of art, or in the philosophy of aesthetics, should read this important book, perhaps more than once."},{"Title":"Concerning the spiritual in art (The Documents of modern art)","review":"This book was purchased for a college research project and it was just perfect.

It is a very subjective and very compelling view of the direction art should take, avoiding the superficial pitfalls that were all so common. He provides a pithy review of Impressionist art and its role in the modern art movement. He notes the successes and shortcomings of Picasso and Matisse as they pushed the envelope of art but weren't quite sure where they wanted to take it.There is a long chapter on the meaning and importance of color, eschewing the analytical approach. He takes a more subjective approach, noting how color and music can be viewed in similar terms. He talks about the attempt in classical music to create chromatic scales, but Kandinsky prefers to deal with such connections more abstractly, treating color as he would the sounds of instruments, for instance comparing yellow to the blare of the trumpet.There is a short biography of Kandinsky which serves as an introduction and a preface by the translator, placing Kandinsky in the pantheon of modern artists. The book is by no means exhaustive. Kandinsky's writings have been collected into a marvelous book edited by Peter Vergo, which offers the width and breadth of this artist's vision.

Indeed, it is very limited in scope and contains very few entries. The entries that are in fact included in the dictionary are not particularly helpful. In particular, the definitions are not always accurate, although they are concise.The format of the entries can be quite confusing; the presentation of verbs being quite the worse I've seen. For instance, the principal parts of the verb retraho is given as 'retraho, xi, ctum, [3]'. It takes considerable guesswork to realise that the 'xi' and 'ctum' stand for 'retraxi' and 'retractum' respectively. In this aspect, it is not particularly helpful to beginners, who cannot be expected to guess the correct form.Otherwise, the layout of the dictionary is refreshingly well done, partly due to the sparseness of each page. The print is clear and of a good size.All in all, it is suitable only for the beginner in Latin because of the paucity of entries, and, even so, the presentation of verbs might be confusing. It is certainly nowhere near the level of excellence attained by the big Oxford Latin Dictionary.

I was very disappointed to see that for every noun in English there were given a few optional translations, but the dictionary did not break down each Latin example. No way to know what declension it was. It says which gender it each is but the only way to know its declension is to flip back over to the Latin section and look up the word under Latin. Only there will you see the conventional entry used for nouns in a Latin dictionary, i.e. flius, -, m, son.My advice: skip this and find another one, and look more carefully than I did at how the dictionary is organized."},{"Title":"The Pocket Oxford Latin Dictionary","review":"This is a fairly useful Latin Dictionary...

The importance of this work concerns more than half of mankind. Mallory pieces together the still not fully understood puzzle of the early origins of our mysterious Indo-European forebears and has reached the pinacle of his field thus far."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"I love languages but I never had the chance to take a course on the fascinating topic of the Indo-european language family and its early speakers. I think this book is wonderful for those who wants to know more about it, and a good beggining to read more and draw his or her own conclussions."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Linguists define \\"Indo-European\\" as a language entity or unity from which all Indo-european languages derived. By analyzing linguistic patterns of change, scholars can \\"reconstruct\\" the language and situate it in a time period when it was a unified language. The task is then to provide this abstract language entity with a living group of people and a homeland.The first chapters and the last ones, where the author presents the problem, geographically locates where Indo-Europeans are to be found and where he draws some conclusions, are really good. He lost me a bit in the middle, where the book acquires a \\"scholarly\\" taste (by this I do not mean difficult to understand); I mean that the author does not get carried away by his own hypothesis. He explains all the existing ones and then proceeds to present the evidence for and against each, mainly from the linguistic perspective, but also considering evidence from other areas (comparative philology, archeology, comparative mythology, etc.). For each hypothesis, evidence was found that contradicted it and I felt that no matter how many pages I read, we were as far from the \\"promised homeland\\" as in the beginning. In the end, no hypothesis is conclusive, but the one in which the contradictions could be \\"bridged\\" more easily is pesented as the most probable one. In his conclusion, the author himself kind of apologizes for having lead the reader through a lot of \\"cul de sacs\\". I myself prefer when an author writes more like fiction telling a clear and unified story at the expense of maybe drawing conlusions a bit to far. Then you can still read his opponent's book to have a more complete picture and enjoy both.All in all, I learnt a lot from this book, for example, how do you analyze nomadic groups from an archeaological perspective if they left no \\"settlements\\"? Well, the answer is that they might have left some cemeteries or lonely graves and luckily some \\"gifts\\" for the deceased, as well as some ritual places or camps. The maps in the book are very useful."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"The work is intended to be a overview of the theories prevailing among historians (using this term in the looser sense to include historians, archaeologist, linguists, etc.) regarding the origins and outgrowth of the root Indo-European culture that lies in the beginnings of the cultures of most of us of European descent. This it accomplishes quite thoroughly discussing the various Indo-European peoples such as the Phrygians, Armenians, Iranians, Greeks, Germans, Celts and so on. After covering these cultures it branches into discussions of culture, religions, probable points of origin and later expansions.However, the book uses (necessarily, I reluctantly suppose) linguistics as the basis of most of the theories. Not knowing the difference between a glottal and stop, much less what a laryngeal even is, much of the text is mind boggling if you are not a linguist enthusiast yourself. And while I feel I came away with a vague sense of the Indo-European question and at times a sense of awe at the interconnectedness of mankind, I can only recommend this book if you have a good sense of linguistic theory and practice."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"It is a fascinating fact that most Western and some western Asiatic languages are based on the same ancestral tongue. Mallory discusses his linguistic theories while offering archeologic and geographic evidence to support them. He calculates that sometime between 4,000 and 6,000 B.C. a horse people, probably native to the steppe somewhere north of the Black Sea, produced a linguistic revolution destined to swallow ancestral languages from northern India, ancient Hatti [Hittite Empire] and almost all of Europe.Despite the fact that the 'Indoeuropean' language has since morphed into dozens of languages as distinct as Celtic, Russian, Polish, Greek, German, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian and Roumanian, they apparently all started as the same language. Mallory speculates on the reasons for this incredible linguistic phenomenon--peaceful diffusion vs military ocnquest. I rather suspect the later. During late prehistory--before people could write of their experiences--there must have been a military juggernaut. There may have been a military and linguistic steamroller--perhaps similar to that of other Eastern invaders like the later Huns and Mongols, that radiated centifugally to conquer out vast territories. The conquerors would have left their own rulers and occupying nobles behind, although apparently not enough to significantly effect the ethnic composition of peoples as diverse as Indians and Norwegians. Like the Roman Empire, which occupied Gaul [now France], Spain, Roumania and Italy, the Indoeuropeans left the indelible imprint of language.If this is correct it makes us wonder how occasional peoples, like the Basques in the Pyrenees and the Finns in their taiga, could have withstood the linguistic impact of such a tidal wave."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This is the third time that I read this book since I bought it last year. Every time I read it I discover something new. Its an amazing book for anyone interested in the Indo-Europeans.The book is written from the point of view of an archeologist who has knowledge of historical linguistic methods. For dating the author uses dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating. He tells the story of how the Indo-Europeans where discovered, and then takes you on a journey to find out who are they in Asia, and who are they in Europe. The book also discusses an overview of Proto-Indo-European culture and an overview of Indo-European religion. Then the author gives you the theories of the Indo-European homeland and the problems associated with each theory and gives HIS most like homeland based on his thoughts and discussions.What makes this book different is that it is easy to read and the author assumes that you know nothing about the subject and explains things very well. He doesn't only depend on the linguistics but also on the archeology and what is known of the history of Proto-Indo-European culture.Another book that must be read to know about the Indo-Europeans!"},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This book is very scholarly: it gets extremely detailed about comparative linguistics as correlated with the archaeological record. I was looking for exactly that, as I have been curious about this for many years.Unfortunately, the book errs more in the direction of academic rigor and offers far too little as a story-telling experience. As such, while the content is truly fascinating, it get mired in details from the names of obscure archaeological sites that are not on the book's lousy maps to the particular scholars who are advancing certain points of view about a certain common word. Bottom line: it isn't very fun.However, I learned an immense amount and am glad to I read it. The Indo-Europeans emerged in about 4000 BC, a pastoralist \\"people\\" in the Pontic Caspian area. Unlike sedentary agriculturalists, they migrated both to Europe (North and West) and South into India. They had a common vocabulary and language, a mythology with motifs that have survived to present in many cases (like divine twins), horses (a decisive advantage for warriors and nomads), and certain advanced technologies (chariots and agricultural implements and practices). These attributes enabled the Indo-Europeans to absorb an astonishing array of peoples in the areas of their migrations. Then once more sedentary, their languages became the roots of all the modern I-E languages, clearly the most commonly spoken of all the world's languages. The great contribution of this book is the merging of linguistic and archaeological observations, that is, how roots from the original I-E language correlates with objects and the landscapes they encountered.For the curious, there are many many wonderful details. For example, the Persain language group generated quite a diaspora. In addition to the Iranians, you had the Alans (later the Ossetians), Medes, Parthains, and Scythians; they ranged from Aisa minor to Spain and N. Africa. The book follows their migrations and histories quite succinictly. It is very fun, as most of them are mentioned n classical histories but many are never differentiated other than being non-Greek. The book also traces how the Finno-Ubrian and Basque languages remained non-I-E.I would recommend this book, but it is more for students of linguistics and/or archaeology than interested laymen."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This scholarly (upper-undergraduate/graduate level) book is especially strong about the origin of language (which is why I bought it) but I found the entire book very useful for the way in which it condenses what obviously is a huge body of research into a readable text.

I'm neither a philologist nor an anthropologist, but I nevertheless found this book to be a wonderfully enlightening synthesis on a subject that should interest anyone with even moderate intellectual curiosity. Suffice to say that the experts in various pertinent fields continue to credit this very good book, well written for a wide audience. If I were forced to pare down my personal library to a single shelf, this would certainly make the cut."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"I wanted to add a very brief review of this book, which I read many years ago and have returned to now with some new research I am doing on Proto-Indo-Europeans. I was reminded what a great overview of the subject this book is and what a wealth of information it contains. It is one of my favorite books on the topic of Indo-Europeans.Mallory does an excellent job of presenting and condensing a mountain of historical, mythological, archaeological, liguistic, and genetic information, theories, and evidence into a concise relatively easy to read book that stays on topic. He also manages to offer a logical resolution to the Indo-European \\"homeland\\" debate.I would recommend this book to anyone as the perfect starting point in Indo-European studies."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Allow me to first say that as a former researcher in the Anthropology Department of Harvard University (having a close relationship with a famed neuroliguist there), being a collector of ancient antiquities, a history buff and a speaker of numerous languages I am well qualified to review this book.Mallory is no hack, he is a noted scholar of Proto Indo European and an exceptional linguists (among his credentials he is editor of The Journal of Indo-European Studies). In this book takes a multidisciplinary approach in his quest to find the origins of the Indo-Europeans with his main focus on the extrapolated language of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and archeology. It is a must for anyone wishing to gain insight into the subject. Some may find parts of the book slow going while others with an intellectual ax to grind (which unfortunately often occurs in academia) or have just a modicum of knowledge of linguistics may quibble with some points Mallory makes but the book is truly beyond reproach and certainly understandable to the general reader.His theories run counter to Colin Refrew's, while mostly in agreement with Marija Gimbutas who Mallory once studied under.For those looking for concrete answers as to the origins of PIE coming from this book the answer is simple: neither this nor any other piece of scholarship can provide concrete answers on the subject at this time. But in my opinion this book offers the closest thing to it.For those looking for an excellent overview of the topic or just stimulating reading I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"I want to thank \\"incurable bookworm\\" for suggesting this book. Having read Noah's Flood first, I was looking for more. In Search of the Indo-Europeans gives an exhaustive look at all the evidence available at the time it was written (1989). Using the tools of Linguistics and Archaeology, Mallory carefully examines each theory of the Proto-Indo-European homeland. It is a little hard to follow but I was propelled through the text, eager to find out what his solution was.He finally suggests the Pontic-Caspian region. I found myself pulling out my Atlas and finally asking Jeeves what \\"Pontic\\" means. It is the region between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Here, numerous rivers empty into the Black Sea. which was once a fresh water lake. Noah's Flood documents how a cataclysmic flood changed it and drove the people around it away.Even though Mallory wrote before the rich resource of genetic evidence became available, his evidence precludes the theory that the flood was the major reason for the spread of the Indo-Europeans. Such an event would have displaced many people, but they would probably be absorbed into the surrounding populations. The drought that brought people to the drying fresh water lake in the first place would have promoted the development and spread of the mobile pastoral horse-culture that characterized the Indo-Europeans.In historic times whenever the conditions on the steppe became too dry, the nomads literally headed for greener pastures, often coming into conflict with the people who were already there.Archaeologists do not like to infer prehistoric migrations from what little they find in the ground, however it is clear from both cultural and linguistic evidence that they took place. Adding recent genetic data only confirms it. I was compelled to find out more about that evidence and went on to read Mapping Human History which will be the subject of my next review."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"If you are like me you do not want to read a huge review--you just want the essentials. This review is for you.Dr. Mallory's book is very thorough, as can be deduced from the title. In my opinion, the strongest parts are those on mythology, Indo-European origins, simple linguistic comparisons, and the brief overviews of each sub-Indo-European ethnic/linguistic group. Indeed, the book deserves five stars simply for the sheer amount of information.There are a few small issues. Some of the archaeological terms and sub-categories can get a little confusing. In order to follow Dr. Mallory you ought to read a summary of European/Near Eastern Archaeological theory.Nevertheless, this book is definitely a must-have for anyone interested in Indo-European theory or ancient Europe and the ancient Near-East."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This is very good book, with a lot of references to consolidate the author's approach to where really was situated in Europe the homeland of the early Indo-europeans, who lived somewhere in Europe some 4000 years BC and spoke a so-called Proto-Indo-european family language, from where a lot of branch langues (English included) originated.In fact, the task is gigantic, given the few support each one of the approaches he takes (myths, language and archeological analysis) gains from the others. But this is the beauty of it all, seeing a respected scholar paving the path to the truth with sound work and plenty of patience.If you like to know a bit more about the origins of many languages like English, this a good book to buy."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This book is not for the general reader but, for those who love history, it is superb. The author leads you through various arguments for the origin of western languages. I didn't know before that all languages in Europe, except Basque, and even Sanskrit in India come from one mother language. Figuring out where everything began, probably around 4000 BC, is a fascinating process. You will need a good map of Europe that shows rivers and mountains while reading this book; only a geographer could understand the small inset maps. Some of the text is only of academic interest. But overall I loved this book, because it helped me understand when wheels and horses were first used, how people were buried and what was buried with them over several thousand years of prehistory, how farming began and how it evolved into mixed livestock production followed by pastoral living, and how the people who lived on the Eurasian steppes were taller than their European neighbors. I happened upon this terrific book simply by browsing on this website."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"In this book Mallory attempts to cover a great deal of information and does a sterling job. The text begins by looking at all of the serious (and perhaps even the not so serious) ideas on IE origins and then looks at the material used to make these assumptions. Finally, Mallory attempts to use what we know about the Linguistic, Archaeological, religious etc. aspects of the various IE culturial groups to come to a &quot;best guess&quot; resoultion of IE origins. I know of course that mass migration ideas have come under fire in the PC arena that is academics today, however, even in the historic period we see such large movements of people spreading thier language and culture with them. Many will not like the book because they think it is Euro-centric etc. however, facts can not be dismissed and all Mallory does in this book is present facts as best he can and try to produce at least the beginnings of an answer to the IE question. I feel he does a fine job and can only suggest that the nay-sayers be disregarded and this book read with an open mind."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"It is nearly impossible to explain to lay people why this topic is important without them keying onto one particular sub-topic or another.

It explores the general questions relating to the question of who the speakers of Proto-Indo-European were, and when and where they lived. It is a generally interesting and useful book for people who are not well versed on the subject (although Mallory takes a general knowledge of phonemes for granted).This work is a classic for which there is no simple replacement today. However, it was written over 20 years ago, and the fields involved have advanced considerably in that time. New, and better, models of how the Indo-European languages are related to eachother have been developed, and better approaches to the question of archaeological confirmation of specific Indo-European home lands have also been found. Hence while I would highly recommend the world, I must point out that it is still best suited to introducing someone to the field which would then be followed up with later study."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"J.P. Mallory is an Irish-American archaeologist and expert on Indo-European studies. He approaches his subject like a detective, examining the clues to the origins of the Indo-Europeans with precision and dedication. Yet his writing style is straightforward and easy to read. I enjoy reading classic British murder mysteries, and I found this book not unlike the best of those. Dr. Mallory presents the facts in the case and all the arguments, disects the red herrings and brings the case to its inevitable conclusion.If you think this makes the book sound trivial and lacking in scholarship, you'd be wrong. Judging from the number of citations this book has received in other scholarly works, Dr. Mallory is very well respected in his field. For me, the interest in reading this book lay in understanding the history and prehistory of Europe and Asia in preparation for writing on a matter that had its origins in the Eurasian Steppe. I came away from reading /In Search of the Indo-Europeans/ feeling that of all the books I have read on the subject, this one finally afforded me a grasp on the situation."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"It has recently been discovered that the origin of Proto-IndoEuropean (and the people who spoke it) is now 600 feet under water in the Black Sea.In their book Noah's Flood, William Ryan and Walter Pitman describe their discovery that the Black Sea was once a very large freshwater lake that was transformed into the Black Sea when the Medditteranean broke thru the bosporus approximately 7600 years ago (5600 BCE) and flooded the Black Sea basin.This was probably the single largest natural disaster in human history. The people who lived near the Black Sea at the time fled in every direction and displaced (or interbred with) the peoples they encountered and, in the process, spread their language all over eurasia.Read J.P. Mallory's book first to get a good grip on the history of this field of study. Then read Noah's Flood to learn about the newest discovery and where the field is headed. It is also a good idea to subscribe to National Geographic because they are following this closely and are even sponsoring an expedition in the Black Sea."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This is a book tracing the relationships of Indo-European languages to a common ancestral root.Don't be fooled by a general synopsis or the headlining title into thinking it's about people as I had been. Although it does from time to time trace the history and origins of its speakers, the book most focuses on relationships between Latin, Tocharian, Irish, English and so forth. However, I still found it pretty worthwhile, because I do take an interest in language and culture.The book is a bit outdated by now, but has lots of good graphs and illustrations throughout. I was dissappointed, because I was looking for something more anthropological rather than linguistic or archeological.

Most of the negative reviews appear to be the work of revisionists who evidently doubt that folk migrations occurred in prehistoric times, an untenable position. Mallory's work is marred only by his doubtless prudent decision to eschew discussion of the PIE maennerbund."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"The book takes a broad approach to an interesting but difficult subject. It started out strong, but became progressively less interesting. The discussion of language was very good, the discussion of homeland was reasonable, and the archeology section at the end was death. It's as if the author just ran out of excitement.To me, the book seems very uneven. As a layperson, I found the linguistic argument compelling, and the discussion of geography reasonably interesting, albeit a bit long. The discussion of archeological evidence is arcane and just not interesting to someone unfamiliar with the terminology and minutae of pre-historic European burial ritual.This book might not be the ideal introduction to this topic."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"I truly appreciate well reasoned arguments and those few that can still write them. Some developments do not appear as clearly stated as I would find convincing. Nomadic pastoralists only happen after the aridity of a region deposes them from traditional agriculture and forces them to survive on herds navigated over ever greater and greater ranges. The Scythians are one such example. The transition is natural and climatic. While comparative linguistics and reconstructed linguistics are wonderful ideas, and I often follow them myself to see what they might imply *IF*, they have no factual value. This appears to be lost on some who accept the theoretical constructions of this science as if it were chemistry or physics with a certitude of knowledge. We can only say such and such a word existed if we have a written copy of that word, and insinuating a technology or concept to a culture because it is found in cultures of descent 500 or 1,000 years later is invalid science regardless of what we wish to believe. This does not keep the ideas from being worthy of note or interesting to explore, but always reduces my enjoyment in reading works of this type."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"A great deal of recent archaeological evidence has muddied up the picture of the evolution of the Indo-European languages created at the end of the 19th century. This picture was inspired less by good scholarship and more by Eurocentrism and racism. Mallory rehashes old, tired arguments. A lot of the linguistic arguments are based on old, incomplete surveys. For example, on page 114 Mallory mentions that *mori (for sea) is found only in European languages. But it is a common word for a large body of water in Kashmiri. Even Kannada has a cognate.The book is replete with such errors. The PIE proponents must consider the possibility that the evolution of languages is likely to have been a very complex affair and their simplistic model is at variance with the facts."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS is essential reading for those interested in the people who spoke the ancestor of most tongues of Europe and western Asia. While scholars have carefully reconstructed a proto-language, the identity of its speakers and their geographical origin remain a mystery, and J.P. Mallory shows what is currently thought in the field.Mallory begins by tracing the historical development of European comparative linguistics, and then examines the various branches of the Indo-European language family first in Asia, then in Europe. However, the most useful portion of the book begins when Mallory attempts to reconstruct as well as one can the actual cultural and social traits of the Indo-Europeans based on the proto-language they spoke. He shows how horses must have been very important within such a culture, asserts that the people must have lived within certain geographical boundaries based on their common vocabulary, and even postulates Proto-Indo-European religious rituals. Unlike Watkin's HOW TO KILL A DRAGON, Mallory does not give much space to concepts of comparative Indo-European poetics.The last third of Mallory's work is concerned with the Indo-European homeland problem, the eternal conundrum for those who would apply comparative linguistics to actual archaeology. Mallory favours the Russian steppes or Ukraine, as do most scholars, and argues quite well against the usual alternative theory of an Anatolian origin. I felt, however, that his placement of the Indo-Europeans could have been more substantial than it was if he had worked in more evidence of contact with speakers of the Uralic languages.A downside of the book is that, while Mallory's entire topic is based on linguistic reconstruction, there is no passion for linguistics in this book. I was unhappy to see, for example, that while Mallory is well aware of laryngeal discoveries, he has chosen to give the older reconstructions of PIE roots in the interest of pronouncability. I don't think the benefits outweight the appearance of datedness and quaintness.While introductions to comparative Indo-European linguistics abound, there are few volumes like IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS which apply reconstruction to substantial archeological exploration. Mallory's work should certainly be read by anyone interested in larger applications of Indo-European philology. I should note that this book should not be approached by the layman unfamiliar with comparative linguistics, and that a work like Szeremenyi's INTRODUCTION TO INDO-EUROPEAN LINGUISTICS is a necessary prequisite."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Who were the INDO-EUROPEANS? According to British linguist J.P. Mallory, their language was the proto-type of the languages spoken by over 2 billion people today. He also says the Indo-Europeans should not be confused with the \`Aryans' claimed to be the progenitors of the Third Reich. Mallory suggests the Indo-Europeans appear to have been a pastoral nomadic group who lived in the Pontic-Caspian region (Steppes of Mother Russia) sometime between the second and fifth millenium BC from whence they diffused.Mallory employs paleolinguistics to show how several dozen modern languages are descended from a \`Proto Indo-European' mother tongue that came to dominate many other languages (not all) of the European-Asian land mass. He uses the work of archeologists to support of his theory. In a nutshell, he mostly disagrees with Colin Renfrew, while mostly agreeing with Marija Gimbutas. Renfrew apparently has posited the idea that the changes archeologists see in the successive layers of excavated sites are the result of internal innovation and successive technological change (folks keep reinventing the wheel), where Gimbutas seems to subscribe to the notion that hostile horse-riding kurgan-building invaders from the steppes mowed down the peaceful matriarchial civilizations of their neighbors. Mallory suggests paleolinguistics supports the idea that the languages of Europe and Asia which resemble each other did not spring up independently of one another and it is not likely that the civilizations that sustained them did either.Mallory theorizes the diffusion of the proto Indo-Euopean language from a Pontic-Caspian homeland took three paths, one through Anatolia and the Balkans, one through Northern Europe, and one East toward Iran and India ( the case for Anatolia, Greece and parts of Southern Europe appears to be very strong). He also suggests that the diffusion may have in part been the result of internal changes such as excessive population growth and climatic change that made agriculture a losing proposition. The social change resulting from the adaptation of more successful strategies for survival, such as pastoral nomadism may have led to a greater acceptance of the people who brought it about and their language. Whatever brought about the change, Indo-European languages exist from Ireland to India today.Readers of Rian Eisler's CHALICE AND THE BLADE, and Merlin Stone's WHEN GOD WAS A WOMAN, will find their ideas are fairly well supported by Mallory's work.Mallory's arguments on behalf of his thesis are clear and compelling. He methodically builds his case using the work of many scholars from both the East and the West. Perhaps one of the wonderful outcomes from the \`fall of the wall' in 1989, is the reunification of scholars from the old Soviet block with those of the West."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"j p mallory follows the linguistic, archeological and historical trails in a stringently analytical, yet very readable fashion. The evidence is scattered over many languages, but Mallory appears to be very familiar with the Russian, German, French, English, and other monographs and scholarly articles. His erudition wears well, sprinkled with wit and insight over several hundred pages of close reasoning and informed speculation. Although he agrees essentially with the Gimbutas thesis that the kurgan steppe zone was the PIE homeland, he gives other theses a proper hearing. A book to read and re-read. It is on my night-table and very well-thumbed."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Dr. Mallory (who is an Amercan) is the Prof. of Archaeology at Queens University Belfast, and for many seasons has been leading the excavations of Eamhain Macha at Navan, which was the prehistoric capital of the province of Ulster in No. Ireland.This book is a highly readable introduction to a subject that is extremely complex, difficult and controversial (as other reviewers have pointed out below). They have also noted that it is a few years old.I suspect that those who wrote negative reviews may be working in the field and are well abreast of the very latest currents in thinking and &quot;politics&quot; regarding this subject. Such debates are always raging among scholars, and it is important that they do. However, they do not necessarily need to greatly concern the reader who is looking for a general and accessible introduction to the subject which discuses the major finds, the geography involved, and the central debates and problems concerning the subject, etc.This book is a rare and vaulable find for the &quot;educated amateur&quot; who is so often faced with a choice of impossibly esoteric academic books, and works that are more of the coffee-table variety, lacking scholarly &quot;meat&quot;. Prof. Mallory also has a very engaging and lively writing style that is effortless to read. While the author presumes intelligence and a high general level of education, he does not presume that the reader has a subtle and esoteric knowledge of Indo-European archaeology/anthropology.

Although this work was published before human genetic data published by Cavalli-Sforza which tantalizingly suggested an Anatolian origin for the Indo-European peoples, this book is an honest, well-informed introduction to the problem of Indo-European origins. The unfavorable reviews on this page astound me by their pettiness and ignorance, and I have to conclude that they simply have an unscientific, ideological objection to the concept of a Proto-Indo-European language or a people that spoke it, based on the silly notion that such a hypothesis is &quot;racist.&quot;"},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Indo-European studies, like Representation Art, was adversely affected by the Nazi endorsement of Aryan studies. Only recently has this field of study started to truly recover from this setback. It is **not** race-theory, but language theory and related folk-movements that most affect the core of the discipline.This is the best book written on the topic for a general reader. The common origins for the peoples of Europe, Iran, India is something that anyone wishes to have a good understanding of history needs to understand. Many of the particulars of history are still obscure, even to the experts of the field, but the relations between these peoples all go back in the recesses of ancient history.One of the major problems of history is a simple issue, why is it so short? Human history appears to, at best, be about 10,000 years. But the human species has been around for at least ten times that long. Why the great gap there? Indo-European studies can be seen as an attempt to push things back further into the past by studying out languages. Sanskrit and Latin have a common source, that we can see by doing comparisons, so where is the common source? And who were those people that were the common source? People want to understand who they are and this discipline is an attempt to try and understand who we are.Of course, the research and thinking on the subject is very much complicated by the interactions the Indo-European languages has with non-IE languages, and even by those interactions that sub-groups within the IE had with each other. None of these groups existed in a vacuum. Word bowering between speakers has happened throughout history, and this gives rise to many oddities.The author only mentions the concept of Nostratic once. Nostratic linguistics is a theoretical idea that tries to ascribe the arising of, more or less, all language to one development or discovery at some point in the far distant past. It is a much broader approach to the concept of the Proto-Language, in so far as it is looking for a Proto-Proto-Language or a common source to the various Proto-Languages. It has a certain appeal to me because it seems to make sense on a very theoretical level.The reason the good author avoids more than page length of discussion to the idea is that it is very, very, very theoretical. There is very little real evidence going for the Nostratic concept. Of course, science - even social ones like linguistics - must confine themselves to the evidence. Nostratic is thinking of things outside the box though, and can be helpful to think like that at times as long as one sees it as a useful exercise and not as a replacement for real scientific thinking.All in all, this is a good book and I like it."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"I came to this book as a result of reading evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond's book, The Third Chimpanzee. The Horses, Hittites, and History chapter in Diamond's book discusses the several main theories for the origin of the proto-Indo-Europeans, and cites this as a major reference and source for this chapter. Since I like to go to the horse's (or Hittite's) mouth myself, following up on Diamond's dicussion of the importance of the book in his bibliography, I thought I'd check out the original book.For those wanting a more complete exposition of the proto-Indo-European theory, this book is probably still the best one out there on the subject. Although now almost 20 years old, it's still a well-written, detailed account, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone wanting a better understanding of this area of history.Actually, you could just read the 26-page chapter in Diamond's book first, and then see if you want more detailed information. Diamond himself used both the present book and many others to write the chapter in his book, so it represents a good summary of present scholarship in the area. For those of you who want more books on the subject, I mention some of these below, which Diamond also cites in his bibliography.I would follow the above up with Cavalli-Sforza's book discussing his fascinating data showing the relationship between dozens of genetic markers and their current geographical distribution and presence, or lack of them, in the different peoples in Europe, and what this shows about their origins, since this adds a further dimension to the PIE hypothesis. Sforza also discusses the genetic data for peoples outside of Europe, such as Polynesians and Australasians, but I found his conclusions about Europe, since they're relevant to the PIE question, the most interesting.In addition to the above two books, the other most important recent book on this subject is Colin Renfrew's Archaeology and Language; also important are older but still useful books by George Cardona, Indo-European and Indo-Europeans; Indo-European Language and Society, by Emile Benveniste; The Indo-Europeans in the Fourth and Third Millenia, by Edgar Polome; Ancient Indo-European Dialects, by Birnbaum and Puhvel; Indo-European Philology, by W.B. Lockwood, and The Distribution of Indo-European Root Morphemes, by Norman Bird, which also came out somewhat later, around the time of Renfrew and Mallory's books.And for those who really want to go to the horse's mouth, so to speak, there is also the Journal of Indo-European Studies, for those with a true scholarly bent (or masochistic bent, as the case may be, which probably includes me, since I've read a lot of academic journals in my life).Interestingly enough, Cavalli-Sforza's research shows an origin for PIE in Anatolia, or what is modern Turkey. This is not that far off from the supposed origin of the proto-Indo-Europeans in the area north of the Caspian and Black Seas, but does push it further south.Overall, a well-done discussion of a fascinating area of ancient history and archaeology for someone wanting a good introduction and grounding in the subject."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Recent attempts have been made, by researchers such as Colin Renfrew, to push back the date of the Indo-European expansions to the early Neolithic, as early as the seventh millenium BC. This book does a great job of describing precisely why this theory is untenable in light of both linguistic and archaeological evidence. For one thing, Proto-Indo-European has a reconstructed word for wheel, *kwelkwo. As the wheel was not invented until the fifth or fourth millenium BC, one wonders how Renfrew explains this discrepancy. It's not just the wheel, but many other vocabulary items, such as one for metal, that provide a picture of a Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age society far removed from Renfrew's Neolithic farmers. I have noticed that proposing prehistoric migrations has become somewhat taboo, which is why untenable theories such as Renfrew's have become as popular as they are. Often-repeated statements such as \\"There is no evidence for an outside migration into India in the second millenium BC,\\" are simply false, as the Gandhara Grave culture of the Punjab indicates.Archaeological evidence indicates a gradual expansion of steppe cultures from the Ukraine from the fifth millenium BC onward into the areas in which historical Indo-European languages later appear. Mallory does an excellent job of pointing out that the vocabulary of reconstructed PIE matches well what we would expect to be spoken in the Pontic-Caspian region at this time. Overall, a well-reasoned look providing a thorough synthesis of both archaeological and lingusitic data that reaches its conclusion after reviewing the evidence, not the other way around as Renfrew tends to do."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"Mallory impresses me as an objective, thorough, and sensible scholar who has written a good book on the origins of the Indo-European languages. Mallory mixes linguistics and archaeology in coming to his conclusions.Given the tendency of Europeans over the last two centuries to allege racial superiority, the question as to whether there was also an Indo-European, or Aryan, race is also important. Mallory deals with this issue in a post-script in which, among other things, he points out that the modern-day Gypsies (Roma) have a better claim to be \\"Aryan\\" than northern Europeans. Likewise, he debunks the silly notion that languages may be culturally superior or inferior to each other. The subject of the Indo-Europeans is, of course, controversial and over the years an enormous amount of nonsense has been published on the subject.The bulk on the book is devoted to looking at the evidence and attempting to locate the origin of the Indo-Europeans in time and space. Mallory's conclusion is hardly new -- but it is well-reasoned. The proto-Indo-Europeans probably originated between 4500 and 2500 BC in an area roughly centered on the Russian city of Volgograd (Stalingrad). From there they spread in all directions and their language evolved into the dozens of Indo-European tongues spoken today. The author also evaluates alternative theories of Indo-European origins along the way, especially Colin Renfrew's that the Indo-Europeans originated in Anatolia.This is a book that the general reader can understand, but not without careful attention as the author introduces an enormous amount of material in coming up with his conclusions. The topic is fascinating. Where did those of us who speak English, Russian, French, Farsi, Hindi, Greek, Armenian, or many other languages come from at the dawn of history? Mallory expands the frontier of our knowledge with peeks at the lives of our ancestors 6,000 years ago.Smallchief"},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"This is a good, thorough introduction to a complex and difficult subject matter. Dr. Mallory has assembled material from linguistics, archeology, and historical accounts to document the many aspects and issues in this hotly-contested area. While readers searching to fuel political programs will find little fodder here, serious students can trust both the majority of the details and the major conclusions of the author. He also follows the professional custom of summarizing major alternative interpretations when discussing issues still in dispute within the field.Undoubtedly, some will find the entire concept of Indo-European origins offensive; for them the best course might be to look elsewhere. This book is not about polemics, but about rational, careful scholarship; even if the very premise of Indo- European language were called into question, the historical and archeological detail would be fascinating."},{"Title":"in Search of the Indo-Europeans","review":"I wish this book really fulfilled the claim of the title!

In the book Albert and Amanda are invited to a friend's big pary, but before the first glass is drunk there are two deaths. One of them is an old dear friend of Campion's and he's not satisfied the death was natural causes. There isn't much of Campion's underworld in this book, but it's a nice tight little mystery with a lighter touch. Ms. Allingham's writing is as always clear and concise.

From the moment I picked up Palace I was totally absorbed and after searching for 2 years I finally found the sequel and I read it so quickly that I'm going to need to read it again! I'm in awe of Kreighbaum's talent as a writer - Palace is a real place, the map moves, the characters live. Science fiction doesn't get much better...bring on the next book - I need more!"},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"Revisiting the world co-created with Katharine Kerr, Mark Kreighbaum delivers a most stunning story. The story picks up where Palace left off and the pace does not stop untill the very end. The science is well blended with the fiction, giving a thoroughly developed story leaving the reader with a taste for more. Nothing more I can say other than this novel is simply supurb. Buy it now!"},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"Mr. Kreighbaum and Ms. Kerr wove a stunning web with PALACE. In this sequel, parts of the web slowly unravel as other strings become attached.

You will find commentary on metaphysics, social structure and many other issues in THE EYES OF GOD."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"This sequel fulfills the promise of the first novel in the series, PALACE, with nail-biting suspense, intrigue, treachery, and plot twists that kept me hooked througout. Mark Kreighbaum and co-creator Katharine Kerr have created some unforgettable characters in a complex and rich world. I hope we will see more of these characters, and more novels set in the isolated region of the galaxy known as The Pinch."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"After waiting almost two years Mark Kreighbaum's book was finally available in Australia, much to my delight. What a blast! I finished it in one day, then went over my favourites bits to relish and adore the characters, structure and plot. Frankly, it was well worth the wait. Vida, Rico et al were very real. Mr Kreighbaum is on par with William Gibson. The story was alluring and exciting. His explanations of cyberspace and the Map mysteriously exciting, making me wish I had neural jackins and other glorious things that may free the mind and flow - The Map moves. It left me wanting more. I am, however, grateful that Mr Kreighbaum chose to explain the story in two books instead of a long drawn out saga which normally results in a frustrated reader. The book was spellbinding and enthralling. I cannot wait for his next one. Congratulations Mr Kreighbaum"},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"&quot;Eyes of God&quot; is a tightly woven, electrifying book that goes beyond the usual SciFi offerings. The author creates multi-dimensional characters navigating in intricate &amp; harrowing situations. He has crafted societies with past/present/future dimensions which are not only entertaining forays into meta-thought, but challenging mental puzzles. One must have one's wits about them to absorb all this author has to offer. &quot;Palace&quot; was excellent, but this is even better."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"It took me months to find this book. But it was worth the wait. To finally be able to read the conclusion to the whole Rico/Vida love story, the lengths the Lep terrorist Riva would go to to destroy Vida, and the whole swirling sci-fantasy world of Palace, was definitely a story worth waiting for.This book comes alive on every page, as the original did, and completes a well-written, intricately thought out story that grabs your attention and refuses to let go.And to top it all, a signed copy !!! Thanks, Mark."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"After searching for what seemed an age I finally found a copy of the second book in the brilliant \`Pinch' series. To say that it was well worth the wait would be an understatement! The deep, twisting story that Katherine Kerr and Mark Kreighbaum started with \`Palace', Mr Kreighbaum continues with explosive and deadly results. Utterly captivated from the first paragraph, I found myself swept along with the characters in their race to find out the true identity of Riva, the role of the L'Vars and of course, whether all would come good for our two heros, Vida and Rico. I must say that I truely admire the way Mr Kreighbaum weaves and binds many complex plots together successfully to complete what, as far as I am concerned, is only the first arc of the \`Pinch' story. \`The Eyes of God' may have provide us with all the answers to the questions that remained with us after reading \`Palace', but I was definately left wanting more and felt that Vida and Rico's story had only just begun. I hope that someday I will be able to read the books which continue this series and follow them accross the stars.I would recomend this series to anyone with a love of books and I guaranty that they are one hell of a read!"},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"I have to agree with all the other reviewers..... this is a stunning novel. In fact, I don't think I've ever found a sci-fi book so satisfying on every level. Plot, characters, setting.... all lovingly crafted, highly engaging, and utterly believable. It took me a long time to find it though... kept searching under Katharine Kerr when looking for a sequel! Also, I don't think it's ever been published in Britain, which is a great pity."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"What makes great science fiction? To me it's a combination of new ideas, a well told story, and memorable characters. The two books the comprise this series \\"The Pinch\\" are both great, in fact the only complaint I have is that there are only two books.The world created here isn't entirely new, but I have yet to read science fiction that doesn't borrow something from a tale told previously. It does have enough new and unique elements that provoke some thought to be entertaining. The story is definitely well told with pacing and plot well matched.If there is any weak point it might be the characters. They are well enough drawn, but just don't grab attention like a Bilbao Baggins, Vlad Taltos, or Ganoes Paran. Still this book is good enough to deserve a 5, though it isn't quite perfect.It is nearly impossible to understand what is going on without reading \\"Palace\\" the first book of the \\"Pinch\\" world. This isn't a bad thing because \\"Palace is a great book too and you'll be pleased to read both."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"I know it sounds impossible, but The Eyes of God is better than Palace! Againt everything experience taught! Why do I say that?Well, for starters, it took up where Palace left off ( more or less ), and kept right on going! It really is a page turner!There are lots of supprises, especially toward the end.I thought the pace was slightly on the slow side in the beginning, although it really took off during the last few chapters! Mark Kreighbaum didn't focus as much on the characters in this book: understandable, as the events make the story.The style of writing in this book is also different than in Palace, and it suits the story well! The events flow logically and without any jarring contradictions right out of Palace.This book is a masterpiece! Why it is out of print I cannot comprehend! Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"In this sequel to Palace (written jointly by Mark Kreighbaum & Katharine Kerr) Mark Kreighbaum goes solo and brings this tale to it's long awaited conclusion. I definitely recommend your having read Palace prior to starting Eye of God as the book leaps right in where Palace left off and doesn't waste time explaining back story to those who don't know it. In fact, even if you have read it a re-read is a good idea, as you'll find many themes and hints followed up in Eye of God that you may have forgotten.Without spoiling too much of the story and the surprises I'll give you a small overview. Rico and Vida are still in love and struggling to cope with her marriage and Rico's investigations into Riva, which have disastrous consequences with a surprising twist. Cybersorcerers after all? The Peronida family continue their political machinations, against each other and anyone in their way, regardless of the possible consequences. Dukayn's instability, only hinted at in Palace, comes to the fore when Sister Romero discovers Karlo's deceit. Dukayn's obsession will not allow his \`God' to be threatened, by anyone. Jevon's misery is compounded and brought to an ugly conclusion and to top it all off the secret Lep movement guided by Riva achieves it's horrendous goal, bringing the Map to it's knees and endangering the lives of everyone on Palace.Eyes of God has a much faster pace than Palace, it's riveting with so much intensity and build-up putting down the book is something of a struggle! You discover so much more about each character and all the skeletons come tumbling out of those closets! Not a book to pike out with a syrupy ending, Eye of God isn't afraid to kill off characters for realism, even the ones you really liked! I found this added to the drama and enjoyment, nothing like the odd tissue moment in a good story. It becomes a real thriller with a gripping conclusion that satisfies all those hanging ends. I still feel vaguely abandoned though, as while that story is over there's still so much more, the Garang Japat for instance. There's a story there and what happens with the saccules? Mark Kreighbaum may have finished up one great story but he's definitely left the door open for more. I'll be keeping an \`eye' out for future novels from The Pinch."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"This book is superb, it started a little slow the first twenty pages or so then suddenly it picks you up, throws you round a bit and kept me up all night!Palace left me feeling like I had read a very good introduction to the usually good five book sci fi series, I was then astounded to have to wait so long to eventually get a copy of this title and to discover that there are no more books out from this series yet???The plot is excellent with lot's of twists and turns and the characters really grow on you and are, as the best authors make them, very believeable and real, hence my comment of wanting more....To conclude I have read sci fi for the last twenty years and would say this one is up there in my top twenty - Thank you."},{"Title":"The Eyes of God","review":"Mark does a wonderful job in his book &quot;The Eyes of God&quot;. The story continues on from the events of &quot;Palace&quot;, we see Vida and Rico develop a more meaningful relationship. While Vida grows her political powerbase and Rico takes on mastership of his cyber skills the story unravels to expose the secrets behind Riva.The book is well written with respects to both plot and characters. What is surprising though is the amazing improvements in dialog since &quot;Palace&quot;.This book is a must read for anyone who would like to see a well rounded extrapolation of where our current information age will lead us.

So despaired of his son's death, the Emperor falls into a ghastly depression, ignoring matters of state and country, refusing to leave his bed but for the briefest of moments. His lifetime friend, mentor, and slave eunuch, Kao Li- Shih, becomes, at least for me, the hero of our story. He is a character with much sense and sensibility, with a heart that loves the emperor, and a loyalty unsurpassed. It is the age of eunuchs and slaves, of festivals of light, of royalty unbound. The descriptions of the palace itself are breathtaking, and the authors take the surrounding lands and recreate a mystical world that will live in your mind forever, whenever you think of China. Failing to roust the emperor from his depression, Kao Li-Shih watches helplessly as another man takes over, the dreaded Li Lin fu, feared by all, renowned for his complete absence of compassion. Li Lin Fu strikes fear into the hearts of the bravest men, and rules all of China and it's subjects with an iron hand. The man has an uncanny ability to predict the actions of his enemies long before they themselves do, and an even stranger ability to see into the faults of others. Kao Li-Shih realizes this calls for drastic measures. China will fall to evil lest he do something to rouse the great emperor. Having recently lost the empress at his own unwilling command, the Emperor suffers from a sadness and mourning so deep, Kao Li-Shih must act quickly. He does. Remembering a lady the Emperor once took a fancy too, Kao Li-Shih calls upon the powers of love to help the Emperor. He finds the woman, and what follows is a fantasy of delights, both real and imagined, an epic tale of fortune won and fortune lost, of lives interwoven forever in an unending story of magic. You will meet An Lu Shan, a barbarian from the north who manages to worm his way into the Emperor's heart, and the Yang sisters, who are as much rulers of China as the Emperor himself. This story is all story, you will be riveted to each page, and you will never think of China in the same way again."},{"Title":"The Court of the Lion","review":"This novel transports you to 8th century China and fall of T'ang dynasty.This novel has everything: lethal intrigue,murder, erotic sex scenes, and exotic splendour.I especially like the chief enunch who uses his wiles to save his ruler from the ruthless machinations of the prime minister, one of the most sinister villians I've ever read about."},{"Title":"Islam a Challenge to Faith","review":"\\"Islam: A Challenge to Faith - Studies on the Mohammedan religion and the needs and opportunities of the Mohammedan world from the standpoint of Christian missions.\\"Hardback, 1907, published by: Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions, NYC, 295 pgs.

It immediately jumps past the obvious stories of, say, the JFK and MLK assassinations to get into the minutiae, whereas a nice primer would help get why the post-death mysterious killings and events are so mysterious. Each chapter, if it can be called that, tends to run on way too long, and rambles a lot.

But some are pretty convincing.One thing the other reviewers forgot to mention was the guy in the hat, sunglasses, and trenchcoat who explained everything. I found myself referring to him either as the Narrator (definitely capitalized) or the Phantom Stranger (a comic book character who looks like him). The Phantom Narrator's sense of deadpan humor, along with his sense of impartiality, makes him perfect for this book. As far as I can tell, he loses his temper with the conspirators only twice: in the &quot;Lone Nut Family Tree,&quot; and &quot;The Casolaro Conspiracy Maze,&quot; both of which are incredibly tangled up.All in all, a good (if scary) book."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"Once you start to read this book you will have a difficult time putting it down. Very enjoyable! The comic format for this book works better than if it was a text only format. A very emphatic thank you to Doug Moench for writing one hell of a good book."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"This is by far the best book in Paradox Press' Big Book series. Doug Moench, known to comics fans for numerous works including Batman, deftly utilizes his expertise with the medium to give this graphic novel the perfect tone it needs: a combination of offbeat, tongue-in-cheek black humor, and a creeping sense of building dread. The artists (some of the best in comics) are well-suited to the particular vignettes they illustrate in the BBOC, and the constant shift in artistic styles helps reinforce the book's aforementioned mood. Comics fans, conspiracy fans, alien abductees, and political manipulators take note: The Big Book of Conspiracies is among the best ever done on the subject."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"What's great about this is that each story is illustrated by different cartoon and graphic artists. It illustrates everything from alien conspiracies to assassination theories to number theories and secret cults and brotherhoods. Once you own it, you never get tired of it."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"Ten years ago, I used to intern at a PR firm that shared floors with Oliver Stone's production company in Santa Monica. I didn't even need to bring in my Big Book of Conspiracies--I merely mentioned it to the receptionist (who sat at the desk from Wall Street), who told me, \\"Yeah, we all know about that book over here.\\"That copy I lost, and its replacement was loaned and never returned. Hence, copy #3. It's such an entertaining read, and just enough to get you itching to rummage for more conspiracy factoids on your own."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"This is such an incredible book.

Because what better way for the government to control its people than to have them come running to said government in order to protect them from \\"hidden menaces\\" whether they be communists or islamic terrorists? Also, what better way to keep the military-indutstrial complex running than a need to battle these \\"threats to national security\\"?This is a brilliant book, especially in the way it changes its tone; it's dead serious when talking about RFK, JFK, MLK, Malcom X, and Odessa; takes a more humorous tone when discussing NASA, Hemp, and the Masons, and is downright silly when getting into the theory that aliens are our forerunners.But the serious stuff will definitely make you think and maybe even keep you up nights a la Jim Garrison in \\"JFK\\". It's that good. The books it references on conspiracies are highly recommended further reading.I can't believe that this book is out of print -- or that copies now cost upwards of $50!

Fascinating!"},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"This book is an absolute must for anyone even mildly interested in conspiracy theory. You could read a stack of library books and still not get what you'd get out of this. Each &quot;theory&quot; (JFK, RFK, Area 51, Odessa Files, UFO's, etc.) is a legitimate theory which has been proposed elsewhere. The magic here is that the author has prepared, in comic book format, a synopsis of each theory. In ten minutes, you can get a very complete overview of any conspiracy theory out there. If you want more, there's a conveniant bibliography at the end, which I myself have consulted numerous times. I cannot begin to tell you how useful this book is, nor how quickly you can get a clear understanding of what's being said today on almost any conspiracy subject. The comic format is entertaining and very readable.....which is understandable, since the author has also been a top comic book writer for over twenty years now, I think, having authored Batman and some of the other better titles out there. Once again: easy to read, and a fantastic overview of various subjects which you can then find more information on in the bibliography. I STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in conspiracy theory."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"Doug Moench has really produced a very fine, entertaining, thought-provoking, not overly fantastic survey of that hot topic, conspiracy theories. The various artists definitely help out too, providing alternately sinister and amusing visual accompaniment to the narrative. Some of the more off-the-wall entries focus on Jim Morrison's perhaps faked death and his subsequent intelligence activities (!), the supposedly faked moon landing, and Robert Lazar's tall tales about flying saucers at secret air force bases in Nevada. More sinister, and credible, theories focus on various assassinations and government coverups from the Cold War era, including the Kennedy assassinations, CIA ties to former Nazis, and various LSD/mind control experiments. Moench knowingly mixes the outlandish and hilarious with darker stuff that we don't want to believe, but that the reader starts to think after a while could have some truth to it after all. Easily the best entry in the Paradox Press &quot;big book&quot; series in terms of entertainment value, and it also deserves credit for (fairly) seriously surveying this fascinating material, some of which should be more openly discussed. Read it with the lights on."},{"Title":"Big Book of Conspiracies (Factoid Books)","review":"Comic strip depictions of most of the popular fields of debate over what is and isn't real.

An engrossing collection of storytelling that could only be the product of the writers intimacy with place.Says Mowat, &quot;The northern people are happy when snow lies heavy on the land. They welcome the first snow in autumn, and often regret its passing in the spring. Snow is their friend. Without it they would have perished or -- almost worse from their point of view -- they would long since have been driven south to join us in our frenetic rush to wherever it is that we are bound.&quot;"},{"Title":"Snow Walker","review":"I loved this book as much as any that I've ever read.I'm not sure where Mr.Mowat found his ideas for these stories,but it sure seems like they are 'true myths' of the North that he has discov- ered through talking to Arctic/Nordic inhabitants.

McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"Snow Walker","review":"This collection of short stories by the Canadian writer Farley Mowat, is outstanding proof of his versatility. Although many of his best books are almost unplanned, coming to fruition after some sort of initial spontaneous combustion (I'm thinking of \\"People of the Deer\\" especially), the fictional elements in \\"The Snow Walker\\" indicate a methodical mind capable of forming well crafted prose. All these stories take place in the Arctic, or have to do with it. Many are based on people Mowat met on his travels or heard about from others. They contain the grains of ideas and don't attempt to do more than expand that one notion, as I think short stories should. Hence the stories are focussed and the issue at hand is brought into sharp relief, sometimes in only a few pages. Like a number of Mowat's works, this one has been used in schools for many years, and deservedly so, as it is some of the best Canadian short fiction of its kind (i.e., about the Arctic)."},{"Title":"Snow Walker","review":"I am a big fan of Farley Mowat and my favorite works of his are definitely his non-fiction: People of the Deer and The Serpent's Coil come to mind.

Farley Mowat was my father's lieutenant for a portion of WW II; and I always thought of Mowat as an immature, optimistic man. I recently read a couple of his other books \\"And No Birds Sang\\" and \\"Sibir\\". This same feeling still came thru, but it also revealed that he had a conscience.I opened this book and was not able to put it down. It contains a number of his stories; plus some Inuit stories/legends from the Canadian North which had been fleshed out admirely by Farley. It was evident that he had lived in the north and had a good understanding of the native peoples and what it took to survive there. I would reccommend this book to anyone interested about the north.I found the story \\"Dark Odyssey of Soosie\\" very interesting and at same time very disturbing. As a Canadian it made me feel deep shame when I read how the Canadian government bureaucrats mislead and abused these people during their attempt to establish Canadian communities in un-inhabited areas of the Canadian far north. Unfortunately this treatment of native peoples was not only a problem in Canada; but is still a problem in most of the \\"civilized\\" world. It must have taken a lot of courage for a popular Canadian writer to include this story in this book."},{"Title":"The Jailing Of Cecelia Capture -","review":"The Jailing of Cecilia Capture is a well-written novel that addresses the themes of home, purpose, family, struggles, and foremost identity. Hale writes the story without distracting the reader with anything that isn't needed. Of primary interest to native american readers, such as myself, this work looks at a character, who like so many of us, is trying to balance the past with the present, being native with trying to make a living in American society. The way Cecilia Capture stumbles through her identity and difficulties, and somehow manages a precarious balance that works is a valuable lesson in &quot;seeking life&quot;.

Wodehouse's best stories feature what he affectionately called the \\"dumb chums.\\" He was an untiring advocate for the underdog, both four-legged and two-legged, and read that way his stories are delightfully subversive. He and his wife Ethel loved their menagerie of \\"Pekes\\" as he called their brood of Pekinese, and together they created the Bide-a-wee animal shelter.That big-hearted generosity wouldn't necessarily translate into good animal stories, but in Wodehouse it does. This collection is called a Bestiary (Beastiary) after the Medieaval collections of animal fables, and is collected from various volumes of Wodehousiana, including Very Good Jeeves, Mulliner Nights, Blandings Castle, Jeeves, Young Men in Spats, and The Man With Two Left Feet. However, these various stories have been collected in numerous volumes with alternate titles (see the lists in Joseph Connolly's P.G. Wodehouse or Richard Usborne's Plum Sauce or the biography by Donaldson).All of which makes this the perfect place to meet the Master, as numerous other writers have called him. The animal stories are among his absolute best, and they also serve as an introduction to the Jeeves and Wooster adventures, the Drones Club stories, the Blandings Castle saga, Mr. Mulliner tales and the many one-offs, all being reprinted in hardback by Overlook Press and in paperback by Penguin for new readers who will naturally want to pursue more.Although I first read this exact edition, the one I have now is different, although I believe the contents are the same. Mine reads: Unpleasantness at Budleigh Court; Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch; Something Squishy; Pig Hooo-o-o-o-ey!; Comrade Bingo; Monkey Business (not the Marilyn Monroe movie); Jeeves and the Impending Doom; Open House; Ukridge's Dog College; The Story of Webster; The Go-Getter; Jeeves and the Old School Chum; Uncle Fred Flits By; and The Mixer."},{"Title":"Wodehouse Bestiary","review":"From a cat whose haughty opinion counts to a pig that won't eat, these are some wonderful stories.

In the book, he recounts his learning of the trade, the people he met, and the times he had. Extremely humorous, detailed, and interesting, this true story is appealing to any and every kind of reader. I recommend it to everyone..."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"In 1938 Eric Newby was eighteen years old. He left a dead end job with an advertising agency in London and signed as an apprentice seaman on the four-masted sailing ship Moshulu for a trip to bring back a shipload of grain from Australia. Moshulu was one of a dozen sailing ships still engaged in the grain trade and the 1938 trip was destined to be the last of the merchant sailing era.Newby is undeservedly less well known than other writers who have imitated him. His books, \\"A Small Place in Italy, \\"On the Shores of the Mediterranean\\" and \\"The Big Red Train Ride\\" have been imitated by other authors. His writing style is spare and matter-of-fact; he doesn't try to impress the reader with overblown prose instead letting the facts speak for themselves without florid editorial comment.There's a funny account a trick played by the Belfast stevedores on the sailors of Moshulu. Among the tons of rocks loaded into the hold were two dead dogs. The decomposing dog carcasses fill the ship's hold with an overpowering odor that plagues the men as they dump out the ballast and load the grain months later off the shore of Adelaide.The Last Grain Race goes into great detail describing the operation of a sailing ship, complete with obscure jargon names for the sails and rigging. Newby seems to have been working too hard on the trip to completely enjoy and appreciate it. The books gives a glimpse at a lost world of merchant sailing ships and the quiet life of sailors at sea, now exchanged for sparsely manned giant container ships crossing vast oceans in a matter of days.Moshulu returns to Queenstown, Ireland on June 10, 1939 after a pace-setting 91-day passage by war of Cape Horn. It had taken 8 months for a round-trip in which Moshulu brought 4,875 tons of grain from Australia to Ireland. Newby leaves the ship a full-fledged Ordinary Seaman. World War II will start in a few months and obliterate the peaceful world of merchant sailing ships."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"Unfortunately the unappealingly named \\"The Last Great Grain Race\\" might be left on the bookshelf if it were not for its companion volume of photographs more appropriately titled \\"Learning The Ropes; An Apprentice on the Last of the Windjammers,\\" both by Eric Newby. Oddly these volumes were issued over forty years apart, Grain Race in 1956 and Ropes in 1999. (A recent volume of Grain Race was reissued in 1999, possibly to take advantage of the pictorial release.)After a brief stint as an office clerk, Newby at eighteen signed on as an apprentice seaman for an around the world cargo voyage, with no nautical experience or skills other than a careful eye and superb memory for detail. \\"The Last Great Grain Race&quot; is the story of one of the last four-masted barques, which in 1938 sailed from Ireland to Australia to pick up a cargo of grain and return to Ireland, a voyage which would take nine months. Ultimately it was to become the last voyage in such a vessel, as the impending war would change the world forever. We are fortunate that Newby was along to document the voyage. We are equally appreciative of his thoughtfulness in bringing his camera, as \\"Learning the Ropes\\" is the superb photo essay of this journey.Newby apparently was a very skilled photographer. Oddly, he only briefly mentions his possession of a camera in \\"The Last Great Grain Race.\\" He never lets on that his is so actively chronicling events and shipmates throughout the voyage. Though Newby does an excellent job describing what is like to climb aloft in all kinds of weather, the black and white photographs take the reader aloft as well and provide the narrative even with more impact and grace.The crew is as varied and colorful as one might expect the conditions are harsh and oftentimes dangerous; the work is unrelenting, demanding and dangerous in its own right. Newby works alongside seasoned veterans and never shirks.Grain Race however does have its limitations. There is a tremendous amount of technical detail that can often leave the reader literally at sea. For example \\"There were still the sheets of the topmast staysails to be shifted over the stays and sheeted home, the main and mizzen courses to be reset, and the yards trimmed to the Mate's satisfaction with the brace whips.\\" Newby does provide a graphic of the sail plan and running rigging (79 reference points), but these are only of marginal assistance.Another shortcoming is the language barrier Newby faces. This is a Finnish crew and commands are rarely given in English. Newby and the reader often have to work out the language; if the reader misses the first context or explanation then subsequent uses of the terminology will be lost, a glossary might have helped here. Newby does faithfully record dialects especially when he is being spoken to in occasionally recognizable English and these dialogues are often amusingly recounted.Eric Newby should seriously consider issuing both in a single volume and one has to wonder why this wasn't done when Grain Race was first issued or at least when \\"Learning the Ropes\\" was released a couple of years ago. It is interesting to speculate on the length of time between the original release of Grain Race and the very vivid and informative photographs. Regardless it was worth the wait.Grain Race the narrative and Grain Race the photographs make for an enjoyable double read."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"I was ready to drive from Seattle to San Francisco when I stopped at the library for some road music and a book on tape. This particular day, I found a jewel by one of the greats, Eric Newby's \\"The Last Grain Race\\". Eric Newby has done so much, and has been so many places that it boggles the mind. This book chronicles the beginning of his life as a true adventurer, when on the eve of WWII, he shipped out as a complete novice seaman on one of the largest sailing vessels ever built, bound for Australia and back.Though I've been reading his books for 20 years, for some reason I'd never run across \\"The Last Grain Race\\", and for well over 1000 miles I listened to the reading of this book, and when I got to Portland on my return leg, my first stop was at Powell Books to grab a hard copy of the book.This is one of the finest books I've ever read. I was going to say \\"seafaring books\\", but that is too restrictive.Eric Newby's commentary and sense of humor are first-rate, like always. While listening, and while reading, I was transported by this book. The conditions seem indescribable, but Newby succeeds in describing them, and paints cold, wet portraits of the days and nights in the rigging and the foc'sle of the barque \\"Moshulu\\". I subsequently found a book of the photographs of this voyage, Newby's \\"Learning The Ropes\\", which gives us faces to the cast of \\"Great Grain Race\\".Old friends of my youth came to visit while I was engrossed in this book, Sterling Hayden's \\"Voyage\\", the film \\"Windjammer\\", and the loss of the sailing ship \\"Pamir\\" in the late 1950's. The \\"Moshulu\\" survives today, as a restaurant ship in Philadelphia, but she was interned on Lake Union in my hometown of Seattle during WWI, and her consort, the \\"Monongahela\\" was the last tall ship to pass under the George Washington (Aurora) Bridge before it was closed to tall-masted ships.An interesting sidelight: While recently rewatching \\"Godfather II\\", I noticed that in the scene where young Vito Andolini (Corleone) arrives in New York, the ship he's on is the \\"Moshulu\\".Eric Newby is one of a kind. Now that he is gone we'll never see his like again."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"This is a wonderful book. I read it many years ago, in an earlier edition. It is classical Eric Newby, full of his humor and the truth of things in one of the last clippers. It is a hard life, but very rewarding, and he captures so many facets in a book that makes excellent reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"Eric Newby, who died in 2006 at the age of 86, was an adventurer and gifted travel writer who chronicled his experiences in several books that reflect his curiosity and research about the world as well as his shrewd and often very hilarious observations of humans making their way in it. Originally published in 1956, THE LAST GRAIN RACE could be called memoir, but Newby recreates his apprenticeship aboard one of the last mercantile sailboats on the eve of World War II via his diaries, claptrap memory and research, creating an airtight world with immediacy. There is no sense of retrospect, distance of time or hindsight in the narrative.Newby was 18 when he went to sea in 1938 on a barque owned by a Scandinavian shipping firm. Before World War II, it was still economical to deploy a commercial fleet of these behemoths around the world to scoop up grain crops from Australia for the European market. When his job at an advertising agency (hilarious) was threatened by lay-offs, he indulged the youthful romance of life at sea stoked by a girlfriend's naval father and signed up with the Erikson firm's ship, Moshulu. He kitted up grandly, found a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk. Immediately aboard ship, he learned that a lot of the work centered about scaling those tall masts, cleaning the \\"restrooms\\" and repelling off the side to scrape rust. He was the only Englishman among Scandinavians and Germans who were decidedly not of the Louis Vuitton school. Newby's character sketches are priceless and he captures the hybrid vernacular so well that by the end of the book, the reader knows as much as he learned. The book is loaded with technical information about the boat and its mission, but also with accounts of dramatic storms, bedbug plagues or occasional leisurely pursuits like capturing an albatross just to measure its wingspan. I purchased a used original UK Reader's Union edition (think Book of the Month Club) that usefully had a detailed illustration inside the back cover and a world map inside the front, with the journey dated and marked off.Infrequently, news of the outside world drifted to the ship via a radio signal from a distant land. It is not good news, but at sea they can mostly ignore it. Like the Pequod in MOBY DICK, the Moshulu was its own complete world. That's the beauty of this book: it captures a fully evolved culture that would suddenly disappear a year later. When Moshulu unexpectedly returned first among the fleet, Newby packed it in. He had lived a lifetime and grown up in under a year. The next time the boat went out, it returned to the waiting Germans. Afterwards, it turned up in a future where commercial sailing ships were no longer competitive. Sic transit gloria mundi."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"Eric Newby, mired in a dead end ad agency job in 1939, signs on as an ordinary seaman on what turns out to be the last great voyage of the clipper ships. The Moshulu, a four masted barque is docked in Belfast and conditions aboard her are not much different from a hundred years earlier. Added to his difficulties is the lingua franca of the ship (Finnish), his youth and innocence (eighteen years old), and an apparent hatred of Englishmen conceived by almost everyone on board. Needless to say the resulting book is hilarious, wonderfully informative and close to being poetic in places. A word of warning. This edition contains none of the black and white photographs that were included in the original Penguin paperback. Some may be found in the same author's books, What the Traveler Saw and the recent publication, Learning the Ropes (both equally recommended)"},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"&#34;From aloft came the great roaring sound, that I heard now for the first time and will perhaps never hear again, of strong winds in the rigging of a big ship.&#34;This was a great story, written very well and what made it even more riveting is that it's a true story. Eric Newby signed on as an apprentice seaman on the Finnish grain ship Moshulu in the fall of 1938. What's the big deal? The Moshulu was the largest sail-powered vessel in the world, at that time. It was a steel-hulled, ship-rigged grain ship. The masts, yards, and cables were all steel as well, and it had 31 different sails (except for the mizzen stay sails). The outbound voyage began on 18 OCT 1938 and took the ship around the Cape of Good Hope and on to Port Victoria, Australia. Homeward bound, the ship went 'round Cape Horn, and arrived back in Ireland on 10 JUN 1939. That's an around-the-world voyage in a sailing vessel, which stopped for cargo, in 8 months. This was truly the passing of an era, and Eric Newby engagingly writes of life aboard this vessel. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"Along with Elis Karlsson's MOTHER SEA, this is the other must read book about sailing and the sea.

Eric is a strapping eighteen and ... perhaps fearing that his first ship, on a world circumnavigation, in a four masted barque would not be challenging enough ... he joins a Finnish ship with no knowledge of any of the languages the orders were issued in by his Swedish, Finnish and other polyglot officers. He joins with a wildly inappropriate and insecure Louis Vuitton \\"folio\\" sea-chest, is sent immediately up the main-mast to the very truck and trades nicknames as he acquires skills and acceptance, from \\"Kossuri\\" an aristocratic derision to match his trunk, to a respectful Strongbody\\" after the usual first-trip fight, that he won.The trip turns out to be (1938) the last of the \`grain races' from Australia back to Europe and Moshulu sails magnificently enough to actually win - through storms of force 8 and 9 to near hurricanes. He is thrown onto the deck when \\"she ships them green\\" and nearly, more fatally, falls from the top mast when furling.On his first working day he drops a hammer over the side and his pay is docked. I was once washed off the flying bridge and onto the well-deck in a gale, surfacing from the tons of green, cold water to find myself in the scuppers hanging on with everything - teeth included. My pay was subsequently docked too - I had let go the coffee pot I was carrying, and it joined Eric's hammer.Yet the author is wistful in his goodbyes to seamanship, \\"I look back to my time in her with great pleasure\\", perhaps feeling, like me and Conrad, who wrote in Youth - \\"Wasn't that he best time when we were young at sea?\\""},{"Title":"The Last Grain Race","review":"This is one of the best travel/adventure books I have ever read.

I was sure it was one of the barques that took part in this Last Grain Race. Subsequently I found she had indeed taken part in the grain runs (though I have to re-read the book to figure out if she was in that particular Last Grain Race. Her name is \\"Viking\\" and you can look her up on Google).Inspired, I hunted around on Google and found Moshulu; she is moored in Philadelphia and has been converted into a seemingly upmarket restaurant!I cannot recommend this hugely entertaining book too highly for anyone interested in adventure.

Eric Newby was an 18 year old kid who, with family approval, signed on as an appentice before the mast on the Finnish owned barque Moshulu in the fall of 1938 for a nine month sail from Queensown to Port Victoria in Southern Australia and return. The Moshulu was a steel sailing vessel, built in Sweden in 1905, 3,600 gross tons, 360 feet at the waterline, three masted ship-rigged with her main mast topping out at 198 feet at the cap. She could carry 4,800 tons of wheat - and did, setting the record of 92 days for her return voyage eastward round Cape Horn. (Her outbound voyge had beeen around the Cape of Good Hope)Newby went on to become a rather prosperous clothier in London but was better known for his travel writing till his death last year (2006) at the age of 86. I had read his \\"Travels in the Hindu Kush\\" years ago and put him down as a kind of smart alek and I had also read the paperback of this book published by Penguin in 1971 but had not appreciated it till I got it down from my shelf of sea stories last week and read it again. He's a dmaned fine writer here and I take back what I said about him being a smart alek. His description of life at sea and the sea iself is as good as anything I've ever read; and you will enjoy it. For those who like sailing ships there's a lot of technical detail about rigging, watch-standing etc. and you can skip this and read about a storm at sea if you want but if you wade through the technical stuff you will be amazed at what you learn. I strongly recommend the whole thing to you."},{"Title":"Enterprise Application Architecture with VB, ASP and MTS","review":"In a nutshell Moniz puts forth a great concept, but plan on using your own implementation. Read on for the details. When I first read this book I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I was elated that someone had an architecture that supported just about everything my users were asking for. Then we implemented, or tried to anyway. The code generated by his 'Object Factory' was poorly commented and dismally formated. It uses older ODBC, and improperly uses CreateObject() when the components are supposed to be built to take advantage of MTS. (You must use CreateInstance() to keep your components in the same context) He is also passing whole user-defined objects across process boundaries instead of serializing the data. Incredible performance hit! Still enamored with the concept I converted it to ADO and fixed the MTS errors, thinking that I would just copy this cleaned-up project over and over and edit it to support new objects. Man, was that ever complicated! So, now I'm in my third iteration (and last) of trying to implement this architecture by partitioning the functionality into separate components. In theory, this redisign should work better, and be much simpler than his implementation.

I read over half of the book before returning it for a refund. This book is a bad mark in the Wrox name.The book it self is bloated repeating things like \`what we are going to cover in this chapter' multiple times in the chapter. The easy issues are covered in wasteful detail and the difficult issues that you would expect to find in this book are not covered at all. He spent an entire chapter on how to use an object that exposes properties and methods. Hello! VB 101?The technical content also leaves much to be desired. I believe that he must not have spent much time developing in the real world because he suggests functionality like an undelete as part of every object. Most objects I know of rarely use delete let alone a thick client concept like an undelete. I believe that his architecture would not scale and perform like a hog. I think he would hit the ASP threading limit with 50 customers on one of his applications. (Not that I saw that issue mentioned in the book). He uses collections in a distributed application and seems to load all of the data for every search. When he got to the point to explain how to throttle the data for a search he skipped it indicating it was an easy exercise.I am not usually this critical of any book and I respect Mr. Moniz for his work and ideas but I think this one will lead developers astray."},{"Title":"Enterprise Application Architecture with VB, ASP and MTS","review":"This book does a good job in the data layer portion of an N-Tier framework.The author shows how to create classes that can create their own database objects such as the tables, views and stored procedures (although I don't know if I would ever use this technique - our DBAs would have a heart attack).These classes also provide good functionality for Inserting, Updating, Fetching, Deleting, Auditing, and Un-doing changes to a table.However, there are numerous problems with the book that prevent me from using the framework such as:1: Very poor discussion/handling of business logic in the Business Layer. Every application I've written has complex logic that results from interactions between various Objects in the Business Layer. This framework does not discuss how to handle these interactions.2: Non-intuitive way of handling Parent-Child relationships. For example, a Person object and Phone Number object would normally be modelled with a Person table, and a Phone Number table (that has a foreign key to the Person table). The author instead creates a separate join table represented by a &quot;Connector&quot; object.3: Very little discussion of security. The objects in the book all have a Security property that can be set, but the objects don't ever do anything with this value. The author just briefly mentions this property and all the great things you can do with it, but never shows you how.4: Potential performance issues - For functions in the data layer, all the properties are passed as arguments for Saving, Fetching, etc. This will cause a huge overhead hit when your objects have more than the 10-15 properties that the author uses.

Moniz clearly establishes his premise as different than mainstream, and concentrates on the data services layer - an item I've not found much treatment on before this publication. Too many VB \\"coders\\" have embedded their logic within forms and bas modules for way too long. Moniz, with others, is helping break this barrier. For those who feel the GUI is the application, you need this book. If you want to build an extremely scalable, extensible application, and all your clients are - or should be - asking for this, you need this book to bring the application to the client's expectations. If you want the opportunity to invest some time in developing your data layers for reuse, this is an excellent treatise on code reuse.Frankly, I differ in the approach of a single data source, and use replication strategies extensively to get some of the data closer to the user. In a large enterprise, this can be an effective strategy, and using ECDO's will help speed this along for you. Moniz's treatment of horizontal extensibility is right in line with Microsoft's - so if you think the Seattle giant's DNA approach isn't the way to go, you may want another book.

Lewis is a tribute to the ultimate love story depicted in the Bible between Joseph and Mary. It is a fictionalized story of one of the greatest loves known, yet with a twist. Lewis has taken the story and brought it to the 21st Century. As told in the Bible, Mary, a virgin, is carrying the child of God and shares the news with Joseph, the man she plans to marry. He accepts the gift and helps raise Jesus as his own child, yet he has feelings of inadequacy and questions if he can even compare his love to that of God. The story continues through Jesus' life and Joseph's death, with the focus on the love and relationship between Joseph and Mary.This is one of those books that may leave a big question mark once finished. While I knew the story from my teachings of the Bible, I still felt a bit weird reading a fictionalized account, with dialogue to match. It didn't seem quite right in a way, but I did enjoy reading the story for the most part. I would have liked to have seen more interaction between Joseph and Mary.The dialogue, while perhaps close to the story, seemed a bit forced and simplistic at times. The characters were not given the depth needed to fully carry off this revised version of the story. Overall, it was okay, but I think the book would be better served as a teaching aide to those not familiar with the Bible instead of a stand-alone story. To someone who studies the Bible, the story may be viewed as blasphemous.Reviewed by Mz. Melody for Loose Leaves Book Review"},{"Title":"Joseph & Mary, A Love Story","review":"Perhaps one of the most well-known and beautiful of the biblical stories is that of the birth of Jesus. The story as we are told begins with an Angel relaying a message to Mary regarding a miracle that will forever change her, the world and the faith of millions. This blessed event has been read about, celebrated, debated and re-enacted throughout the centuries. Author Nathan A. Lewis has taken on the daunting task of re-telling the story by delving into the relationships between Mary, Joseph and Jesus. In JOSEPH & MARY: A Love Story, Lewis chronicles the courtship of the two from the immaculate conception to the raising of Jesus. Lewis also deviates from the biblical story by setting his novel in the modern world.As with any re-telling of a known story, the present author carries a great burden. Although Lewis does not stray from the original message of love, family, and faith, he does not make the story his own either. It would have been great if there were more in-depth probing of the possible feelings that Joseph and Mary had for one another, their reaction to raising the child of God and the relationship they had with Jesus. As a work of fiction, there was a license to truly do more of a re-telling than to simply re-cast the characters in the 21st century. The scene where Joseph learns that his supposedly virginal fianc&eacute;e is carrying a child that is not his, but also claiming the child to be that of God, could have been dramatic and heartfelt, yet I found it a bit unemotional and flat.I find the biblical version beautiful and heartfelt. I didn't see it here. I do think that JOSEPH & MARY: A Love Story would be a good supplement to the teaching of the biblical story, for it is told in a straightforward manner, and being set in the modern world gives the story a bit of a more personal feel and it is easy to comprehend. However, as a novel, it unfortunately, falls short. The dialogue and interactions between the characters just felt too restricted and unemotional for such a grand story of love and faith.

The stories with which James' regales his reader come alive on the page, with the voice of a real cowboy.Reading Lone Cowboy, is like sitting around a campfire on the range, having a cowboy tell you stories in the firelight. Added to its charm, are Will James' own original pen drawings, which make the tales spring to life, all the more.Although in reality, this is actually a work of fiction--despite what the uninformed will say, it's still well worth reading.Will James isn't the author's real name, he wasn't born in the west, but is French-Canadian, having been born in a small town outside of Montreal, Canada, in 1892. He changed his name and his place of birth (several times over) only when coming to the west. His name became Bill James, when he crossed the border into Montana, later changing it to Will James upon becoming a published author.However, don't let this knowledge put you off: James' was a real cowboy! He jumped off a train and learned his trade at the age of 15, at a working cattle ranch in western Canada. He was always interested in art, and studied at the School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and also, believe it or not, breifly attended Yale University! He also was a rodeo cowboy, a broc buster, a convicted cattle rustler (he served 15 months in a Nevada prison for it), a probable horse theif, movie stuntman, artist-illustrator and a rancher.Two of his books made it into film, including Smokey the Cowhorse, which was filmed three times--last in 1966, starring \\"Daniel Boone\\" and \\"Davy Crockket\\" TV star, Fess Parker. Will James died alone and penniless, of cirrosis of the liver, in a hospital in Hollywood CA, in 1942."},{"Title":"Lone cowboy : my life story,","review":"This is a favorite from childhood. It's a good novel to get a picture of what a cowboy's daily life and background were truly like in the period of U.S.history when ranches were a big part of the western scene. The sketches by James add much charm."},{"Title":"Lone cowboy : my life story,","review":"This is a book I read when I was about 15, and enjoyed reading it again. Basically a book for teens or young adults, the story covers Will James from childhood to adult, written exactly as if he were speaking.

The author, a longtime Cleveland, Ohio, journalist, had many friends in Great Lakes shipping and was able to draw upon his numerous contacts to produce a series of works that carry with them the smell and sight and sound of the Great Lakes.&quot;Ghost Ships&quot; is written as a series of article-length stories about Great Lakes cargo vessels that met disaster - in some cases, disaster so complete that no one was left alive to tell the tale of how the boat went down. Boyer expertly combines contemporary evidence, in many cases gathered from local news stories, to develop believeable theories as to how these &quot;ghost ships&quot; met their end.Some readers may be troubled by Boyer's ability to guess what happened and his ability to blend fact and fiction together to create his tales. However, all of his stories are firmly grounded (if I can use this word when writing about the water) and the man knew more than any living person how these disasters happened. Modern technology has lowered the probability of great disasters on the Great Lakes, and as of the Year 2000 there have been no &quot;ghost ships&quot; for the past 25 years. Long may it so continue. In the meantime, we have Boyer's fine book."},{"Title":"Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes","review":"According to the late reporter and marine historian, Dwight Boyer (True Tales of the Great Lakes,Great Stories of the Great Lakes, etc.), even the plodding ore freighters, limestone haulers, and coal barges of our great inland lakes are referred to as 'she'-- whether her name is 'Frank C. Barnes' or 'James H. Reed,' 'she' could be a sweet-handling lady or a cranky shrew with a tendency to sink at the slightest provocation.In \\"Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes,\\" Boyer reconstructs the last hours of seventeen ships gone missing on the lakes, whether due to mechanical failure, human error, or the inhuman forces of mountainous seas and terrifying winds. Storms can blow up very quickly on our vast inland lakes, and the ships in these tales sank well before the advent of weather satellites or, in many cases, ship-to-shore radios.One of the saddest chapters, for me at least, is \\"Hard Times for the \`Benjamin Noble.'\\" In the spring of 1914 (as is true now) the United States was in the grip of a severe recession, and the owner of the almost new canaller, \\"Benjamin Noble\\" underbid a contract to carry railroad rails from Ashtabula, Ohio to Duluth, Minnesota.

This is one of his best. Boyer's writing style is lucid and entertaining, encompassing not only the vessel(s) involved in each narrative, but also presenting the persons who make each yarn a complete story. Each chapter covers a separate vessel or instance, and each is enormously interesting. A section of black and white photographs or drawings is contained in the center part of the book.The particular volume discussed here contains a series of narratives about vessels that sank, usually with at least some loss of life. A particularly good series of chapters concerns four vessels that sank in the terrible autumn of 1929 in storms, collisions, fog, and other mishaps of fortune. One of these is the Milwaukee, a big Grand Trunk railroad ferry that went out in the face of a storm that kept other vessels in port. The captain, Robert \\"Heavy Weather\\" McKay, was known for his disdain of the elements, and the boat foundered and sank somewhere in Lake Michigan. One lifeboat with four sailors who had perished from exposure, part of the bridge, and a purser's note, telling what had happened were all that were ever found. Also covered is the result of the investigation of the calamity.Other stories include the disappearance of the famous \\"Alpena\\", the loos of the \\"Senator\\" a car hauler, in a fog-occasioned collison and the like. Any fan of Great Lakes history will enormously enjoy this wel-written book, which covers many noted sinkings and disappearances, and which always seems to add a human side that only very careful research discloses.I highly recommend this wonderful book to any student of Great Lakes and Midwest history, as well as to anyone who enjoys a few colorful yarns about boats and those who work on them. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes","review":"I've read a number of Great Lakes shipwreck books, and \\"Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes,\\" by Dwight Boyer is definitely my favorite. He does a fine job of telling the story of each ship clearly and as accurately as possible. He never loses the reader in a maelstrom of technical terms, and he never gets overly editorial or overly preach-y about his own opinions about whose fault the shipwrecks were. He manages to take each chapter and work it into a narrative which is both historically feasible and dramatically compelling at the same time. One can feel the heartbreak at the end of the Benjamin Noble's voyage, or the spine-tingling mystery surrounding the Marquette & Bessemer No. 2, or the piquancy of the Andaste captain's new hat.Also, I wish to mention that the book is well edited. There seems to be a tendency among Great Lakes history publishers to put out sloppily-edited books that abound with misspellings, horrendous punctuation, careless type-size changes for no reason, all to the point where they become distracting to the reader, and should be embarrasssing to the publisher. That is not the case here; Freshwater Press can be proud of an immaculately-edited book."},{"Title":"Ghost Ships of the Great Lakes","review":"It got here real fast, and was exactly in the great condition as advertised. A bargain for only $3.00. I'd buy anything I needed from this seller"},{"Title":"The New Altar Guild Book","review":"This little book is an indispensible resource for any person who serves on an altar guild, the lay ministry in the episcopalian church responsible for making sure that everything on the altar and in the sanctuary is ready for worship.Altar guild ministry isn't for everyone, but it's both absolutely essential for the liturgy and a symbolic reminder of the necessity for conscientious labor in the everyday world. It's the way of Martha, of quiet, unobtrusive household work that goes on in the background. In making sure that vestments are laid out, candle wicks are trimmed, altar clothes ironed, hymn numbers displayed, and so on, the altar guild member serves both God and his or her fellows. It's a ministry of what Henri Nouwen called &quot;downward mobility&quot; that encourages anonymous service, loyalty, and discipline.Barbara Gent and Betty Sturges take the ministry seriously enough to have put together a book that takes altar guild members through the sometimes arcane language of the sacristy (what exactly is the difference between a lavabo and a baptismal towel? where does the word &quot;amice&quot; come from? and what in the world is a cerecloth?!), gives step-by-step instructions on setting up an altar or decorating the church according to the church calendar, and explains how to prepare for special occasions such as funerals. The authors wisely recognize that many procedural details can and should be worked out by individual churches. What's the point of over-regulating? But there still remain many procedures uniform to all congregations, and it's these that they cover in their book.If I have any reservation at all about this useful little guide, it's that I wish there was more of a discussion on the spirituality of altar guilding. But one book can't do everything, and what this one does it does extremely well. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The New Altar Guild Book","review":"I applaud Barbara Gent and Betty Sturges for how seriously they take the role of the Altar Guild. They approach the work of the Altar Guild with devotion and respect while also maintaining a sense of levity and openness about its role in worship. They write to any readers serving in a worship service in an Episcopal/Anglican Church, especially to those in the Altar Guild.They write about the practicalities of the serving in the Altar Guild--from what goes where and when to the history of altar accoutrements. They instruct readers about what is optional and what is required, what is essential to the worship and what is secondary or decorative. The book includes practical guidance and \\"how-to's\\" about washing linens and glassware, silverware, etc. Most importantly, they write throughout the book in a tone that conveys the spirit of the Altar Guild--that it is a ministry of great importance and service within the church. The authors are not nit-picky, just extremely helpful.I cannot recommend this book enough for those involved in Episcopal Church leadership, and I think it would be helpful to any readers wanting to learn more about the aspects of the liturgical service...the why's of what we do throughout the seasons, feasts and worship of our church calendar."},{"Title":"The New Altar Guild Book","review":"Great book for any altar guild member.

I enjoyed the book and look forward to more from the author."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner was the best book I have read in quite awhile. I absolutley loved the friendship between the two main characters, Bonnie and Thora. The book went back and forth between the late 50's and the early 80's. It started off a little slow and then the story was filled with nonstop action and plot twists right up until the end. Bonnie is married to a former Negro League baseball player named Naz and they are struggling because Bonnie is unable to get pregnant. Then there is her outspoken best friend Thora who supports Bonnie through some rough patches just as a friend should do.The story centers around Bonnie and the Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner. The ladies find homes for babies given up by their parents. It all started when a dead baby was found in the creek, which outraged the entire town. After one of the town meetings Bonnie declared that she would rather a woman bring her the child than kill it. She unknowingly set off a set of events that would change her life forever. Babies began to mysteriously appear at her home and she was given the great responsibilty of finding homes for these children. This book is a story of friendship or should I say sisterhood between a group of ladies who banded together to save unwanted children and in return strengthened their lives as well. This is a must read for anyone who wants a good story. Make no mistake it does not have a trully happy ending but a \\"real-life\\" ending and things come full circle. Andrea Smith did an excellent job of bringing the characters and the story to life."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I approached Andrea Smith's \\"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner\\" (2007) thinking it would be a sentimental novel not to my liking, but I found the book endearing. The story is set in a predominantly African American three-county community in South Carolina called the Three Sisters and in a town in the community, Canaan Creek. The community is poor, close-knit and centered around the church. Smith's book focuses upon the lifelong friendship between two women, Bonnie Wilder and Thora Dean. The time of the story alternates between the mid-1950's and the mid-1980's.The book takes time to unfold. It opens in 1985 when Bonnie receives a mysterious letter from a young, pregnant married woman, Augusta, who wants Bonnie to tell her about her birth mother. Bonnie is reluctant to respond to the young woman or to revisit this area of both their lives. The book juxtaposes the relationship between Bonnie and Augusta with events in the Three Sisters area in the 1950's, when the events leading to the relationship began.In the 1950's Bonnie had been married for some years to Naz. For some years, the marriage had been happy. Naz had been a pitcher in Negro baseball with a promising future before he suffered a career-ending injury. Naz missed baseball, but Bonnie missed the inability she and Naz had of having a child even more. On a summer day, Naz and his friends find a dead baby abandoned in the waters of Canaan Creek. This sad, mysterious event ultimately spearheads Bonnie and a small group of women to found a group called \\"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner\\" which, outside established legal channels, places abandoned babies and children in homes where they are wanted. Bonnie's marriage comes apart when she learns that Naz has been having an affair with a woman named Lucinda in a community about an hour's drive away.The novels portrays the tensions and friendships among women in the South Carolina community. The Sisterhood's project, which gives Bonnie, Thora, and several other women an activity that brings renewed meaning to their lives is at the center, but the church, schools, farms, restaurants, and activities of the community are portrayed as well. The book does not have a polemical tone as the male characters are portrayed kindly and with understanding. Bonnie is portrayed sympathetically, with her ambitions and her mistakes, as is Bonnie's eccentric, tough, and flamboyant friend, Thora. I became involved with their lives and cheered for them.The book tells a simple, unpretentious story. It flows smoothly and picks up momentum after a slow beginning. I read the book in a group that focuses on Black literature and would not have found it otherwise. The novel taught me about places and communities that I haven't known directly. I liked reading Andrea Smith's little book, expanding my horizons, and getting to know this small African American community.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"Short and sweet.... visit Blackberry Corner and by the end of the book you won't want to leave.W.

You'll be captured into a spiral of love, lies, deception and redemption in this fast paced novel.Much Respect, JMRC ReviewerLinda Washington-Johnson"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"This story takes place in a small \\"back woods\\" South Carolina community. After some menfolk of their community find the body of an infant floating in the river a town meeting is held to discuss this infant's death and steps to be taken to find the mother who would do such a thing.One woman in the crowd says that rather than or along with finding the guilty woman, they should also be looking into and eliminating the conditions and situations whereby anyone would need to take such a drastic action. She is osticized by the community for her stand, but the following day a mystery mother drops a baby off at her door. She in-turn gives this child [then several others over a period of months] to loving parents desperate for children. When the number of children and the load gets too large to bear, some other respected ladies of the community join her in the clandestine operation. The story then goes on through the placement of several other babies and the shock of finding out who were the culprids in the death of that baby found in the river.The meaning, message, and writing of this story are nothing short of outstanding. It is one of those books that once started one can not put down. It is all at the same time a message, a memories, and a mystery book.A message because of its subject[child abuse and saving children from abuse] and a mystery because of the author's creation of and then solution of a mystery webb through the use of forshadowing, flashbacks, and characterization.It is a memories book for those of us who have lived in \\"small town ...\\", or listened to the talk and talking of our small town parents, grands, and or elders as they were talking and story telling. You will recall, relate, reminice and chuckle as you recall their use of the expressions, dialect, and description and used throughout this book to take us \\"down home\\" or back to the \\"out back\\".This book kept me and will keep you thinking and continuously hunting, guessing, predicting, adjusting, tearing, laughing and smiling. You need to read this book."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"Andrea Smith has quickly become one of my FAVORITE authors. This book is an awesome read. It held my attention with it's unexpected twists and turns. I am anxiously awaiting Ms. Smith's next book."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"The book starts off slow but builds to a climax that will shock those not paying close attention to details. An especially satisfying ending that completed all the storylines (not like some books that leave you wondering and empty)."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I picked this book up from our local library on a whim. It was set out with a variety of books for Black History Month. I am SO glad I got this book... the writing flows beautifully around a story that will touch anyone with a heart. A woman, Bonnie, who can't have children of her own, stands up one day and makes a statement that will change her life forever. Suddenly she finds her home a sanctuary for unwanted babies. Her husband doesn't want her to keep them, even though they haven't had any of their own children, but doesn't stop her from finding them homes. Bonnie is a wonderful character. Not far from the realm of real possibility, I find her a warm compassionate woman written with real honesty where her true emotions lie... and a role model for us all.I look forward to reading more books by Andrea Smith. As a white woman, with a wonder bread background, I find the rich characterizations and life details of early black history intriguing and loveable.

The characters are well-developed and emotionally complicated. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in a tale that captures, shocks and provokes. The women in the Sisterhood are the women we'd all like to know. Throughout their own struggles, their triumphs bear testimony to what we do to survive and despite everything, learn and continue to love."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I just completed Andrea Smith's novel--\\"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner\\" and I feel as satisfied and buzzed as Thora and Bonnie felt sipping their home-brewed blackberry wine on Blackberry Corner. Smith's writing has matured since her first novel, \\"Friday Night at Honeybee's,\\" so much so that I was quickly drawn into the lives of the characters, particularly the women in the novel. \\"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner\\" is a compelling story of love and compassion which led the women of Three Sisters to ACTION. The results of their brave and unselfish actions brought abandoned children to lonely and caring adults to create strong beautiful Black families. Not only does the novel entertain, but it also encourages us to nurture our children and believe in family!"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"This book made me smile. My only qualm, is that it took me a while to get into it, because the beggining dragged for me. I must say though, as the book picked up, I became more in love with the characters.

When I received this book, the cover took me straight to the large, black Baptist churches where women dress to the max--fashion show city! The hat matching the outfit, shoes and purse--you'd be so enamored with the outfit until you'll miss the sermon message. No doubt about it, I absolutely love the cover. Not so much the story though. It was beautifully written but took quite some time before any \\"pageturning\\" action took place. Ordinarily, if a book doesn't send me with the first three or four pages, I usually wouldn't read it, but the book cover stuck in my head and forced me to continue. That's the thing about authors. Some of them know how to immediately pull you right in while others have to build it up to get you there. One thing about these sisters of Blackberry Corner, they came together and got things done.Reviewer SusanBorderline Book Case Review (3.5 stars)"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"By page 30, I just knew that this was another one of those stories where I had the whole plot figured out and I would just continue to read until I finished. NOT! Author Andrea Smith took me on a most enjoyable trip that led me up, down, and through Three Sisters. And when the lights really started going off and I got to the end, I was spent. Even though the plot is pretty far-fetched, don't let that deter you from reading on to see what the end's gonna be. The characters of Bonnie, Thora, Naz, and the Sisterhood will stay with me for a long time. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I listened to this book as an Audible file that I'd bought a year ago and never got around to listening to. After setting out to lose some much UN-needed pounds, I came across this file and began to listen. I have to admit, at first, to listen was a bit of a chore, and my walk seemed to plod along. After a short while, the book got better, and as a result, my walk seemed to fly by. It seemed like as the book went on, it got so much better, and I started checking my ipod and hoping that I had awhile to go in the book because I didn't want it to end. Wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner was very, very slow in the beginning. I was prepared to take the book back to the library but decided to stick with it after reading the reviews. Boy am I glad that I stuck with this book; I would have missed an awesome read! Andrea Smith is a genius! I laughed and cried and laughed some more. This book is full of drama with a capital \\"D\\". Bonnie is the main character that is unable to conceive a child of her own, to make matters worse her loving husband Naz refuses to adopt. He desires his own \\"natural\\" child because he was adopted and feels adopted kids come with issues. Naz finds a dead baby in the river on a fishing trip and this story takes off from there.

I have to say that this story did have a slow start, but once the story picked up I could not put it down. The life of Bonnie & Naz had many twist and turns. But this is so true in \\"LIFE\\" itself. I enjoyed how Andrea Smith took you back with Bonnie and her best friend Thora's journery in the 1950's then right back into the 1980's. The church ladies in the story added much spice,style and pizzazz. Even though Bonnie could not have children with Naz, she had heart that had much love for 1,000 children or more.

I bought 5 books, and The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner was one of the books I chose. I had never heard of Andrea Smith, but she is an excellent writer.The characters were so believable. Sometimes in a group of friends, you'll have a character like Tilde, who wants to be center of attention and in charge, and on the other hand you'll have a friend like Thora, who is out spoken and her exterior seems tough, but she definitely has a heart.It was so hard to put down. There are some twists and turns in the book, and I found myself going back and reading pages I had read before because I had missed one thing that lead up to another. I could relate to the dialect since I was born and raised in the south.I would definitely recommend this book. Excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I thought this book was going to be boring. I attempted to read this book 3 times and now i have finally finished.

In short it showed how a couple of people and then an entire community worked to solve a problem and likewise make a difference. During which, adversity and loss of other sorts came and went. Some folks were bitter, but not for too long. It did hit home for me when you come to think about some of the really bad parents that need to find a better place for themselves and an even better place for their children. Folks have been raising other folks children for years, its time that someone acknowledged that it is for the greater good. I would highly recommend this book for a summer reading list."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I was captured by this story. It is so warm.

This is such a sweet tale of some amazing women.GET THIS BOOK AND SAVOR THE NECTAR OF BLACKBERRY CORNER! (7/8/06)"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"Andrea Smith's latest novel wonderfully tells the tale of two childhood friends which takes you into their life as elderly women and beautifully illustrates how they love, support and fulfill in each other the true meaning of friendship.Set in the 1980's in a set of country towns called Three Sisters, we meet Bonnie and Thora as 80-year old women. In alternating chapters, the author takes us back to the 1950'S in the same town, as we learn about their lives as young, married women, their friend, their trials and what makes them the women they are in the present.The storyline is centered on Bonnie and her husband, Naz, and Bonnie's inability to conceive. Naz, an ex-Negro league baseball player, hence small-town celebrity, is against adopting. Being a former foster child himself, he has seen some of the good and some of the bad of dealing with other folks' children. After a fishing trip one day, Naz and his friends find a baby floating in the creek. Bonnie's outspoken feelings about this incident provoke a new mission for her life.This mission reveals to her who her true friends really are, helps her make a new friend and affirms the friendship that already existed. The author had an amazing ability to make this reader feel as if she was sitting on the porch with the rest of the ladies drinking sweet tea or sitting in Bonnie's living room at one of the Ladies of the Blessed Harvest's meetings. There was vivid detail, no stones left unturned and this reader left feeling as if she knew every character. A fantastic read that I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys an intimate and unique storyline with unforgettable characters.Lena WillisAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"I have to be honest,If my book club wasn't reading this as our monthly selection I would have never read this book.

Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner was recommended to me and since I had previously enjoyed the first book by Andrea Smith, I ordered it and am very happy that I did. It broke the spell for me.A wonderful, heart warming story. Very 'real' characters. Definitely a book that I will distinctly remember years from now. Would love to see it as a 'made for TV movie'. Will definitely be waiting for future releases by Andrea Smith. Refreshing read without all the drama like so much out there these days.........just a great story."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"This is an endearing read about a group of women in \\"the old South\\" that set out to save babies in their community. The book starts really slow but is worth it if you can endure until midway through."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"The Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner is a truly entertaining, delightful read. It allows your mind to explore the possibilities of what a mission and a little spirit will allow a group of determined women to do. It maximizes the idea of what friendship and loyalty can do to inspire others to better days. The Sisterhood examines the idea that we are often torn between what we want to have. and what we have to have. The book shows how trying to have it all has serious consequences. This book is a favorite of mine. I can't wait to read another book by Andrea Smith."},{"Title":"Sisterhood of Blackberry Corner","review":"The book was slow to start but once I got 3 chapters into it I couldn't put it down.

Its a shame to say that the works of his successor to the Op-Center series, Jeff Rovin, does not possess the magic of a true Clancy novel.The first two novels of Rovin already disappointed me because it became more political and less thrilling. No strikes were made, all talk. His third book really let me down because through this book, Op-Centers Strike Team has been permanently dissolved. Yes, a covert non-military team was made to replace it but the Paladin could never measure up to the standards of the elite Striker.Another thing that disappointed me was the fact that Rovin deviated from one of the most popular trademark of a Clancy novel, REALISM. All this about Vodun and its leader doing magic and prophesies just don't cut it.If Clancy wants his and Mr. Pieczenic's creation to retain its good reputation, I suggest they either replace or train Rovin."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"The story starts with Leon Seronga, one of the main characters, telling of his childhood on the then wild plains of Botswana. He is now a grown ex-military man from a group known as the Brush Vipers. This group was formed to aid a group of revolutionists in their successful attempt to overthrow foreign and oppressive rulers, and turn the country into an entirely independent, democratic nation.After the revolution is complete, the new government, who no longer sees a use for them, abandons the group. Several years later, the group is called back together by its commander, Seronga. This time, they aren't aiding a political movement; it's an economic and religious movement being headed by Dhamballa, a man who believes he is the Vodun snake god incarnate. Vodun is the traditional name for what is commonly known as Voodoo.The Brush Vipers are used as a defensive weapon, to aid and protect Dhamballa and the Vodunist movement. Their first move was to kidnap a Catholic priest in an attempt to force the missionaries and the church itself out of Africa in an effort to restore Botswana to its native religious roots.Meanwhile, Op-Center, a group formed within the U.S. Government to intercept messages and thwart plots against the United States and avert international disasters, hears of the growing crisis from Mr. Kline, a Vatican Security Force officer. Mr. Kline calls in an attempt to get Op-Center to help.Back in Botswana, Leon has taken Father Bradbury, his captive, to Dhamballa. The trek took them across the plains and into the swamplands to a compound manned by ex-Brush Vipers, and built to protect Dhamballa.Dhamballa is a relatively young man, and very soft-spoken, but his voice is firm and he has an air of confidence that makes people a little uneasy. Dhamballa deprives Father Bradbury of sleep, food and water to try to get him to send the other field missionaries to Gaborone, Botswana's capitol.Back at Op-Center, the team working there, Hood, Rodgers, Herb, and others, plus Mr. Kline, are trying to solve the problem, either politically or forcefully. They believe Albert Beaduin, a gun manufacturer and suspected international arms dealer, and Henry Genet, a diamond merchant, are funding and are behind the turmoil in Botswana in an effort to get rich. One is suspected of trying to supply arms to both sides, and the other will corner Botswana's diamond market during the infighting. They are both hoping to increase their global influence.Their one minor problem in moving on Dhamballa forcefully, though: Op-Center had their military force cut by a Senate Oversight Committee, after a fiasco during a recent U.N. hostage crisis in NYC.The Vatican has a force on call from the Spanish military, and the group is roughly the equivalent of Army Rangers or Navy SEALS. They're called into action. In a public show of support, the Vatican also sends an American bishop to take over Father Bradbury's position. The bishop is killed upon his arrival, forcing Op-Center to work outside their set parameters. They send in Aideen Marley, an Op-Center operative, to join the Spanish in the hunt to find Dhamballa and Leon. Unfortunately, the Spanish are killed after a botched raid on Dhamballa's compound.Aideen meets Leon and goes with him, after gaining his trust and ensuring him she is their to aid him and his cause. The Botswanan military is going to forcefully put down any uprising that may threaten the new democracy. Aideen meets Dhamballa and tells him of the offensive forces that are pursuing him. Leon orders Dhamballa to leave, in an attempt to keep the religion alive. Father Bradbury, while food and sleep deprived, is able to move and leaves with Aideen while Dhamballa leaves in the opposite direction. Minutes later the Botswanan military arrives and Leon commits suicide, dying for their cause and giving the Botswanans someone to blame the uprising on. Father Bradbury and his missionaries return to their work, and another crisis is averted.I enjoyed this book; but not as much as Tom Clancy's other books. The plot, characters, and settings were all extremely vivid and colorful.If I were to recommend this book to someone, it would be to anyone who has read other Tom Clancy books. It was extremely hard to put down. I would rate this book as a 7 outof 10."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"I found this book a complete waste of my time. I kept wondering when the story would begin. I oftened wondered why I continued turning pages.I'll have to agree with an earlier reviewer (which I wish I had read before reading the book!) that questioned the the merit of this book being a bestseller. Mr. Clancy: quality, not quantity, please!"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"I was disapppointed. It felt like I kept waiting for the action to begin and it almost never did. I have always before been riveted by the action in Op-Center, but this is not up to the usual quality of suspense and &quot;must-keep-reading&quot;. I wish I had saved my money. Maybe killing the Striker Team last time was the end of Op-Center?"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"Wonderful book can always count on Tom Clancy to write an exciting story that keeps you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"I picked up this book for two reasons: Tom Clancy's name was writ large across the cover and the topic dealt with the Vatican in a covert \\"black ops\\" sort of way. On closer inspection this book was written by one Jeff Rovin. I was also intrigued with the setting in Botswana (if you want more on Botswana, read Alexander McCall Smith - different, but enjoyable).The story plodded along and not a whole lot happened. The religious characters were believable - however the voodoo / vodun leader had some really supernatural passages. This is the first (and most likely last) Op-Center book I have read and the American operatives seemed there to have everybody make nice and shake hands. Once the action got started, the next chapter had you back in Washington DC and someone was sorting out their family life and/or troubles with the wife. No thank you.If you want a good political thriller, stick to Tom Clancy proper - not the publisher making money off of Tom Clancy's name."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"I typically love Tom Clancy books.. but this one has been a sleeper since I started it. I don't think I've ever taken this long to read any book, especially not one of his. I've been reading this book for about 9 months now, and my wife keeps asking me why I'm still reading it if it's so boring - my response is that I'm \\"hoping\\" it will redeem itself.. not to mention that I'm committed to finishing it. I am about 80% done with it, and still waiting for it to grab my attention."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"It's probably unreasonable to expect a thriller to be evocative and to have believable characters who you could actually care about, but it surely is not unreasonable to expect it not to be mind-numbingly boring. I read the first 50 pages attentively and then paged through the rest in an effort to salvage my investment in this tedious book. It consists of an accretion of details without resonance and without feeling. Yet it's on the best-seller lists. I wonder why. Is it because the publisher is cynical enough to believe that anything with Tom Clancy's name on it will sell? Or is it because airport bookstores and supermarkets are blanketed with millions of copies, so these &quot;Tom Clancy&quot; books are guaranteed best sellers regardless of their merits? Save your money. Save a tree."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"I'm a Clancy addict. I decided to try one of the op-center series. This was it.

The overlong descriptions of the landscape, the wildlife and the sunrise plus the private thoughts of the characters tend to obscure what could be a good story if written by Clancy himself.I regret to say that advertising this book as a &quot;Tom Clancy &quot; book is, in my view, very misleading. One expects a tautly written action story with many twists in the plot typical of Clancy. Mr Rovin's style is far removed from this."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"Book by book Clancy is slipping away from the \\"soul grabbing\\" action style of \\"The Hunt for Red October\\". Rather than being called a \\"techno thriller\\", it should be labelled a \\"red tape sleeper\\".

Several years later, the group is called back together by its commander, Seronga. This time, they aren't aiding a political movement; it's an economic and religious movement being headed by Dhamballa, a man who believes he is the Vodun snake god incarnate. Vodun is the traditional name for what is commonly known as Voodoo.The Brush Vipers are used as a defensive weapon, to aid and protect Dhamballa and the Vodunist movement. Their first move was to kidnap a Catholic priest in an attempt to force the missionaries and the church itself out of Africa in an effort to restore Botswana to its native religious roots.Meanwhile, Op-Center, a group formed within the U.S. Government to intercept messages and thwart plots against the United States and avert international disasters, hears of the growing crisis from Mr. Kline, a Vatican Security Force officer. Mr. Kline calls in an attempt to get Op-Center to help.Back in Botswana, Leon has taken Father Bradbury, his captive, to Dhamballa. The trek took them across the plains and into the swamplands to a compound manned by ex-Brush Vipers, and built to protect Dhamballa.Dhamballa is a relatively young man, and very soft-spoken, but his voice is firm and he has an air of confidence that makes people a little uneasy. Dhamballa deprives Father Bradbury of sleep, food and water to try to get him to send the other field missionaries to Gaborone, Botswana's capitol.Back at Op-Center, the team working there, Hood, Rodgers, Herb, and others, plus Mr. Kline, are trying to solve the problem, either politically or forcefully. They believe Albert Beaduin, a gun manufacturer and suspected international arms dealer, and Henry Genet, a diamond merchant, are funding and are behind the turmoil in Botswana in an effort to get rich. One is suspected of trying to supply arms to both sides, and the other will corner Botswana's diamond market during the infighting. They are both hoping to increase their global influence.Their one minor problem in moving on Dhamballa forcefully, though: Op-Center had their military force cut by a Senate Oversight Committee, after a fiasco during a recent U.N. hostage crisis in NYC.The Vatican has a force on call from the Spanish military, and the group is roughly the equivalent of Army Rangers or Navy SEALS. They're called into action. In a public show of support, the Vatican also sends an American bishop to take over Father Bradbury's position. The bishop is killed upon his arrival, forcing Op-Center to work outside their set parameters. They send in Aideen Marley, an Op-Center operative, to join the Spanish in the hunt to find Dhamballa and Leon. Unfortunately, the Spanish are killed after a botched raid on Dhamballa's compound.Aideen meets Leon and goes with him, after gaining his trust and ensuring him she is their to aid him and his cause. The Botswanan military is going to forcefully put down any uprising that may threaten the new democracy. Aideen meets Dhamballa and tells him of the offensive forces that are pursuing him. Leon orders Dhamballa to leave, in an attempt to keep the religion alive. Father Bradbury, while food and sleep deprived, is able to move and leaves with Aideen while Dhamballa leaves in the opposite direction. Minutes later the Botswanan military arrives and Leon commits suicide, dying for their cause and giving the Botswanans someone to blame the uprising on. Father Bradbury and his missionaries return to their work, and another crisis is averted.I enjoyed this book; but not as much as Tom Clancy's other books. The plot, characters, and settings were all extremely vivid and colorful.If I were to recommend this book to someone, it would be to anyone who has read other Tom Clancy books. It was extremely hard to put down. I would rate this book as a 7 outof 10."},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","review":"This book is a real stand out in the action/espionage genre because in addition to an exciting plot, it deftly probes the politics and religion of an area largely ignored in the news. The scenario set forth in the book focuses on the tensions between native African traditions on the one hand and western influence and Catholicism on the other. The book takes a very balanced approach in describing the tensions, and does not paint either the Catholic church or the insurgency as unreasonable -- which is refreshing. Because the story is based on the actual history, politics and economics of the region, the possibility of this sort of religious conflageration seems very realistic (and scary, by the way).The gist of the story is that Op Center intelligence teams are sent to monitor an explosive situation created when a Catholic priest is kidnapped in the opening round of an attempt to rid this part of Africa of western influence and religion in particular. The religious leader of the insurgency is a fascinating character, who is not a fanatic but actually a peaceful man seeking to usher in change. But he is also somewhat pragmatic, so he teams up with a former soldier --- himself a honorable man, albeit one who is willing to be ruthless to further what believes is a just cause. The kidnapped priest is an equally compelling character, with a deep love of Africa who relies on his faith to survive a horrible ordeal. The op center agents watch the situation rapidly deteriorate when an unknown third group assinates a Bishop sent to replace the kidnapped priest in an attempt to blame the insurgents. Rather than devolving into a simple commando-raid type of story, the op center intelligence agents are tasked to avert violence by forging unlikely alliances between themselves, the Priest and his kidnappers.The story is really unusual and makes for a great read. I bought this book in an airport and really can't remember the last time I enjoyed a fiction book so much. This is a must read, as it is both exciting and thought provoking.

Perseverance is Tess' strongest trait"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbevilles, by Thomas Hardy, is a wonderful novel, which tragically and poignantly follows the ill-fated life of its heroine, Tess Durbeyfield. Through his exquisite use of imagery, his reflection of Tess in nature, and the continuing thread of tragedy which he weaves throughout the novel, Hardy is able to present to us one of the most memorable figures in English literature. Despite her sincerity and integrity, Tess is forever destined for disappointment, and Hardy's immensely lucid and descriptive writing allows the reader to appreciate this. I would recommend this tremendous piece of fiction to any readers interested in reading the work of a brilliant Victorian author, or for those who appreciate the paradox of sadness and beauty represented in the figure of a strong protagonist."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy employs nature as a tool in helping him depict and develop the tragic nature of his protagonist, Tess. At least two aspects of nature are central to achieving this end: First of all is the establishment of a correlation between Tess's mental state and natural settings. Second, the use of natural phenomena as a prediction of Tess's own fate. Hardy has fully exploited the use of nature to illustrate that Tess is the victim of her uncontrollable and predetermined Fate.Hardy establishes from the beginning the notion that the world is a mere &quot;psychological phenomenon&quot; (Hardy 101). One can, therefore, deduce from this &quot;fact&quot; that nature, as it is seen through Tess's eyes, is only the physical image of Tess's inner emotions during a particular period of time. It is during the intercepting period between her devastating seduction by Alec and her encounter with her future husband, Angel, that Tess feels most deje! cted. &quot;The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary&quot; (Hardy 100). Indeed, Mother Nature is the only place where Tess can attain &quot;absolute mental liberty&quot; from all her worldly troubles (Hardy 100) and where she can find her peace of mind.After her seduction by Alec, Tess gathers her strengths, recollects herself, and starts a new life as a milkmaid in a quiet countryside at a farm called Talbothays. This is a deliberate attempt on Tess's part to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of another event on such a castatrophic scale. Now, working closely with nature (cows to be specific), she has succeeded in &quot;shunning mankind&quot; (Hardy 101), and truly believes that she is laying a new foundation for her future (Hardy 124). Surrounded by serene natural settings, this &quot;fresh and virginal daughter of Nature&quot; (Hardy 137) finds tranquillity in her surroundi! ngs despite the fact that she is in the midst of misery. In! Tess's eyes, nature is beautiful because it brings her joy-- and because it is where she belongs to.Angel comes from a very religious and educated family. Although he would never think of &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity for religion (Hardy 284), he is in actuality a very convention-bound individual. The moral code and the &quot;arbitrary law of society&quot; (Hardy 297) that accompany religion are deeply rooted in Angel's thinking. His presence at Talbothays disturbs the natural settings with the social customs he brings into the village &quot;which had no foundation in nature&quot; (Hardy 297). Hardy introduces Angel into the novel in order to signal a transition in Tess's life. Unfortunately, it is a transition for the worse. From this point on, as Tess' and Angel's relationship grows, Tess's relationship with nature, which has come to symbolize all that is good for her, has declined in proportion. Tess has allowed her relationship with the society (Angel) to take prec! edence over that with nature (by falling in love with and marrying Angel).&quot;Nightfall, which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer, as a lover&quot; (Hardy 368). Angel's passion for Tess in the summer does not carry beyond its boundary. Tess's dream of a happy life is shattered into a thousand pieces when her worst nightmare comes true-- Angel is unable to accept her past. As Tess's mental state changes, so does her perception of nature. The beautiful scenery at her once cherished village of Talbothays is no more. &quot;The gold of the summer picture was now grey, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold&quot; (Hardy 269). In the place which Tess had once thought of as a place of rebirth after her disastrous experience with Alec, she now sees only the dullness and helplessness of a dead winter. Tess's view of nature is purely perceptual. What should have been natural-- fallen leaves and bare tree branches-- have become depre! ssing and unpleasant. These natural phenomena are, in truth! , nothing more than physical manifestations of her sadden and broken heart. Nature has taken on a melancholy outlook not because it is indeed melancholy but because Tess is projecting feelings upon it. This is Hardy's so-called &quot;psychological phenomenon.&quot;Another important method besides relating Tess' feelings with natural phenomena is the use of imagery to mirror Tess's own fate. In two instances, long before the end of the novel, the stage for the final act of Tess's life has already been inauspiciously set up. In the first instance, Tess is symbolized by different animals being hunted down in a field :&quot;[U]naware of the ephemeral nature of their (the animals') refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day, when, their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled together... till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every one put to death by the sticks! and stones of the harvesters&quot; (Hardy 103).Hardy speaks of &quot;doom that awaited them later in the day&quot;; Tess knows exactly what awaits her. &quot;She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little every day&quot; (Hardy 212). Tess, like these animals, is unable to defend herself from the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Tess's attempt to escape her fate in her &quot;refuge&quot; (Talbothays) proves to be futile. Without any question, Angel and Alec are the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Although they do not kill Tess in a physical sense, they must bear the responsibility of forcing her into the &quot;horrible narrowness.&quot; What is this &quot;horrible narrowness&quot;? It is the only option left for Tess to liberate herself once and for all from her past-- the killing of Alec (Hardy 406). Tess has done just that; and this is the fatal act t! hat destroy not only her past, but also her own ephemeral e! xistence.In the second instance, Hardy presents to the readers, in a graver tone, an even gloomier setting in which Tess is symbolized by pheasants-- also being hunted down: &quot;Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some stretched out-- all of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more&quot; (Hardy 296).One must admit that this scene best reflects and symbolizes the horrible experience Tess has gone through in the whole novel-- her struggle for survival, her indescribable agony, and finally, her &quot;luck&quot; that nature is unable to sustain her painful existence any longer. Hardy notes that the hunter of these birds has a &quot;blood-thirsty light in [his] eyes&quot; (Hardy 296). He is, however, civil and gentle for most! of the year-- except in autumn and winter (Hardy 296). This is where the change of seasons takes part in Hardy's shaping of a predetermined fate for Tess. Angel is &quot;civil and gentle&quot; to Tess during summer; but one also must also note that his rejection of her comes during winter. One can fairly say that Hardy leaves his readers no other choice but to convict Angel as the killer of Tess. He presents the end of Tess in his bloody account of the pheasants. In doing so, Hardy has revealed the unshakable destiny of his protagonist.Hardy is able to make use of his materialization of both the mental and fatalistic elements in the novel through his clever descriptions of nature to draw a portrait of a great tragic heroine. In the face of unbearable misery, only nature testifies to the sad story of this simple country girl. The speechless speaks for the inside of Tess. And the readers have been given a chance to realize that what will come is predetermined and inevitable.!Reference: Hardy, Thomas. Tess of the D'Urbervilles. New!

From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

His style of writing is beautiful, but a little drawn out.One theme that can be found throughout the book is that of the hunt. Tess is a hunted animal, pursued by a cruel world and a society that can accept the evil of men, yet rebuke women for their mistakes.Tess (cause and effect):Because of her beauty she is pursued. Because of her sex she is helpless. Because of her helplessness she is captured. Because she is captured she is violated. Because she is violated she is ruined."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbevilles is one of the true literary greats.

It definitely was a well written, very interesting and thought provoking book. I really liked it. Now I can see what my best friend has been raving over for so long.It really gives an in depth portrayal of the character's feelings, thoughts and desires . When Angel finally repents and sees how he is wrong, it is too late. Tess has already fallen back into sin with the man who caused her to fall many years before. Once she finds out Alec has deceived her, she not only despises him, she kills him. I just thought it was a good way to say that there are always consequences for our actions. I kept wishing the whole book that she had told Angel about her past before she married him. It would have spared them a lot of grief. I think he would have handled it better and hopefully been man enough to forgive her. It would have saved a lot of the grief that came later. What was really bad was how hypocritical Angel was when he confessed his own sin, she forgave him; yet when she confesses hers, he cast her out of his life.

It follows the story of a young girl who, in an attempt to help her struggling family, makes a series of mistakes that result in a loveless affair, an unfortunate pregnancy, the loss of a child, an estranged marriage, and ultimately murder. I was so caught up in the injustice of it all, that I scribbled responses to Hardy in the margin. In addition, the beautiful descriptions of 19th century farmlife in Britain are amazing. At times, this book seems hefty and longwinded, yet it is one of those rare gems that you suffer through only to find at the end that you are surprisingly satisfied."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"** Major plot points revealed ahead **Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ and _Jude the Obscure_, both of which featured strong central characters and real pathos, I was somewhat disappointed with _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires \\"cousin\\" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just \\"confessed\\" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a \\"bad woman,\\" but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now \\"impure\\" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess is typical of Hardy heroines, pathetic/victim. She is good and beautiful, but gets raped, rejected, pilloried, and ultimately hanged. With no control or strength of character, she is as helpless as a wet noodle.

I wish he had a written a dozen more novels, even if only half as compelling as this title."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is truly one of Hardy's best books!

I love this story passionatly. It is so easy to identify with Tess, hate Alec and be ashamed of Angel. I only hate that Tess has to pay for her wrong doing as it is so hard to sympathize with Alec or to find anything redeaming in him. I love some of the passages in the book that show Tess's ideals, compassion, and proud nature, like when she takes sympathy on the injured quails by puting them out of their misery. It is odd but it shows part of Tess's selfless nature and endears her to the reader. The story also has much to say about hypocrisy with out being preachy. It is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I love Thomas Hardy's characters because he allows them to be fallible, allows them to be unduly influenced by the rigid thinking of the time in which they live. They make bad decisions, and suffer for them, and we suffer along with them. How refreshing!This book is incredibly rich, and there would be much to discuss in a class or book group. I actually think one of the most interesting characters is Alec d'Urbervilles. He is utterly contemptible, of course, but he goes through such changes in the book that he's fascinating to watch. A great bad guy.Not surprisingly, Tess's and Angel's theme, the Double Standard one, shows up all over the place. I caught 3/4 of Sweet Charity on TV last night, remember that one with Shirley McClaine? Great dance numbers. She confesses her past in a fit of passion, and guess what happens? A scene certainly as heart-wrenching as the one in the crumbling d'Urbervilles mansion.If you love classics, what are you waiting for? It's worth it, as are Hardy's other novels. If you are new to this sort of thing, reading it for a course or a class, you have a treat in store. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel makes a heroine out of a simple girl. Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a nearly extinct noble line, leads a life of heavy responsibility where her impoverished family is concerned. At the behest of her parents, she seeks assistance from the D'Urbervilles who are, supposedly, relatives. This assistance yields disastrous results and Tess feels compelled to find work as a milkmaid where she meets Angel Clare, the son of an evangelical pastor, who is gathering experience in order to become a farmer.Hardy does a splendid job of illustrating Tess's strength as she goes from innocent girl to pure woman. Though she is not as educated as Angel, in terms of theory, her experience with Alec Stokes D'Urberville has given her a deeper knowledge of life and acceptance. Ironically, it is this experience which captivates and, predictably enough, repulses Angel.Hardy's narrative is a powerful one in this particular tale. It is clear that this is Tess's story and we, as readers, witness her painful journey. Through his subtle and understated use of irony, we come to realize the hypocrisy of Angel and wonder about the diabolical nature of Alec.What Hardy does emphasize in this novel is the unwavering hand of Justice which allows the novel to come to a bittersweet end and lets no one escape its strong, yet objective, sense of judgement."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A beaute of a book to read.

The short scene before her death at stonehedge just emphasises this woman's (how do you say) weakness? I can't describe how wonderful this book is.Tess of the Durbervilles is Thomas Hardy's equivalent towards The Ambassadores by Henry James. Both are flooded with metaphores.

The fascinating aspect of Hardy - in this work, as well as in others is the manner that Charaters and setting intertwine. Relationships are seemingly established but what renders Hardy a literary tragedian is his capacity of substantiating the relationships into pre-determined moulds; the ending is somewhat predictable but the psychology leading to it and how it is developed is the interesting part. My only problem with Hardy is how he characterizes Brazil - Curitiba and then follows with him being in Rio de Janeiro. I would have liked to see more written about the actual experience there - but that is a minor complaint. PS - for some of the readers out there: Brazil is NOT just a rainforest.

He sends his older daughter, Tess, to live with the D'Urbervilles, unaware that the current family of D'Urbervilles are imposters.At the home of these imposters, Tess is raped by the eldest D'Urberville son, Alec. She flees and gives birth to a child conceived by the rape. The infant dies and Tess buries him in secret.In an attempt to escape her past and start anew, Tess takes a milkmaid job at Talbothay's Dairy where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Angel is a beautiful man who loves Tess deeply, but when he proposes to her, she is torn between lying to him by omission versus telling him of her past with Alec -- a choice that would likely alienate him in the strict morals of Victorian Britain.After they are married, Tess breaks down and tells Angel of her shameful past. Angel can't cope with it and leaves Tess penniless to travel to Brazil. When both Angel and Alec return to her, she is faced with the choice between them and the disastrous consequences of her decisions.Overall, I was disappointed by the lack of theme. The story is just unrelenting bleak, which wouldn't have bothered me except there didn't really seem to be a point to it. A lot of the text is spent repeating things that really didn't need to be repeated, especially in the entire section devoted to the lead-up to Tess agreeing to marry Angel. We knew it was going to happen, so I quickly lost interest in all tension-building that didn't really build any tension.I guess it might have been about the tragic fate of principled people. Tess is a moral woman, she desires only to be happy -- and both lead her to nothing but tragedy. I realize this was a bit cutting edge in the late 19th century when people wanted their stories to have happy endings no matter what happened in the middle. But explorations on the unfairness of life are only realistic if they rest on the capriciousness of fate. Murphy's Law just doesn't kick the hell out of people like it does to Tess.There is the class confusion element; the \\"what constitutes a true gentleman?\\"; the critique of basing the aristocratic label on either blood or money. But, really, I'm getting burned out on the theme that poor people are just inherently better than everyone else. It's not realistic so it doesn't do much for the development of a class conscience.There isn't even any feminist theme. Men dominate Tess her entire life, but this isn't the factor that leads to any of Tess' problems. Her problems are shown to be entirely the work of cruel fate (who apparently has it in for her to an extreme degree).Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. This is just what really prevented me from really loving it. I did enjoy the story and the writing itself. I just think there are better classics out there."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I did not lose any weight, however. I recommend &quot;The South Beach Diet.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"There are many 1-star reviews for this particular novel and I have to admit that I am rather confused. Many people lament the fact that Tess is somewhat of a weak woman, not a strong woman, defying Victorian convention and fighting for the rights of women. I'm not entirely sure why Tess's tragic and weak personality has people so up in arms enough to say that the book is terrible and unrealistic.Personally, I found this to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. I didn't find the text to be as easy to read as some of the other reviewers, and I was an English Lit major in college! It is difficult to get through in parts, you will yawn every so often, but fight through it-- use your brain and you won't regret it!The story is tragic and offers very little in the way of an explanation for Tess's extreme punishment. So if you are looking for a book about a woman who fights convention and social injustice, go read something else. If you want a story that illustrates the cruelty of fate, comments on the injustices of the world, or a shows how, if one doesn't fight, one can be trapped by the past... read this book.I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This was the first Thomas Hardy novel I read, and it is still one of my favorites. The hypocritical late 19th century society views, and the strains they put on the human spirit. Hardy had a keen eye for what went on around him, and he was aware of how the old ways were being replaced - Edwardian enlightment was on it's way but Tess is the symbol of land of Wessex itself, violated, forsaken, and like the wounded birds she finds, longing to be put out of her suffering, despite how she endures until her situation becomes even more unbearable. Christian versus pagan, rural versus urban, her true love's struggle from his family's religious views and the restrictions of society's rules, end up costing Hardy's herione more than himself. Young Tess Durbeyfield, daughter of a poor farmer, finds herself at the mercy of a ne'er do well scoudrel, Alec d'Urberville, thought to be a wealthy relative. The girls' parents, in their naivete and ignorance, put their eldest child on a disasterous path in an attempt to improve their situation and trade on the ancient and noble family name. Tess's situation makes her an outcast, after giving birth to the cad's baby son who dies not long after birth, but she never asks for pity, and finds work at a dairy farm, only to fall in love with a provinicial minister's son, Angel Clare, who cannot forgive her past. Tragedy ensues at nearly every turn.***some spoilers herein***I think both men were unforgivable, both were terrible to Tess in different ways. Granted, Angel was nowhere near the controlling cad that Alec was, and yes Tess loved Angel. Alec thought his wealth could buy Tess's affection and possession was love. For Angel, since Tess didn't fit his idealized version of her, and that she wasn't a virgin (never mind the fact that she was raped), he couldn't bear that and took to the hills like a coward. His hypocrisy is maddening, especially since he considered himself to be such a free thinker and more open-minded than his pious family. He did see the error of his ways, returned her and they had a few days together before she was executed, but too little, too late. Tess is the most extreme victim in the novel, with Alec next, being the cause of her hardship and downfall, and for being the villain. And yes, I did say that Alec is a victim, a murder victim, but not an innocent victim. He had no qualms about manipulating situations, taking Tess against her will and using her father's death, her family's destituion, her husband's desertion and her hardships to possess her. In a time when women had virtually no rights and the fact that he had taken her virginity and fathered a child with her gave him a totally wrong sense of ownership and his determination to get her any way that he could is what lead to his fate. Both characters are doomed, while Angel must live with the fact that his actions toward the woman that he loved led to this tragedy. Not that Alec had no part in it, if he hadn't violated Tess and impregnanted her, no doubt there would have been a different outcome to her life and to his. But of course, there would have been no story, and no commentary on the standards of the time in the novel if those events had not taken place.There can be no happy ending, as this is a Hardy tale. But it makes its mark, and was immensely popular at the time of its publishing, despite the brutal critical response it received. The aching misunderstanding of longing love, the loss of innocence and a herione victimized by the standards of her era.A timeless masterpiece of literature. Tess lives beyond the pages of the book, as though Hardy knew a girl who embodied his most famous character. Worth adding to your library."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Published in 1891, this book was Thomas Hardy's best seller, and has become a literary classic. This was why I chose to read it, and I must say that I really liked it.When the middle-class Durbeyfield family learns that they are genealogically related to the noble family of d'Urbervilles, they send their beautiful daughter Tess to meet them and possibly receive a fortune from them. Tess discovers the d'Urberville family is actually of no relation to the real d'Urbervilles, and simply bought their prestigious name while they made their fortune. Tess stays and works at the d'Urberville household, and gets to know Alec, their son, who, er, treats her quite badly. I won't give away any details, but Tess has to deal with the results of Alec's treatment, and tries her best, though unsuccessfully, to move on.Though I don't usually go for many of these sappy character dramas, I really like how Hardy brought forth this novel. One develops immediate sympathy for Tess and her plight, yet she can at times be a very strong woman. The character development here is fantastic. I also liked the way Hardy juxtaposes the issue of social class (I think there must have been a law in England that every book in the nineteenth century had to confront social class in some way). Hardy also brings in symbols regarding Christian sin as well as paganism in this novel.I can see why some people would criticize this book as being slow or dull, but those readers would also probably say the same about any piece of 19th century British literature. I didn't find it especially slow, however. If you like books like Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch, and Wuthering Heights, you'll love Tess of the d'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I love the story of Tess.

To readers a century later, the tragic story of Tess is very moving, and the nobel heroine evokes extreme sympathy from us.The novel also artfuly portrays the dynamics of life in 19th century England. We are presented with a crude, colloquial variety of the English language then spoken, in stark contrast to the stuffy, self-satisfied brand of sophisticated English that modern authors and film-makers would have us believe is all- pevasive amongst the English, in contrast to the bland, pedestrian English spoken by their brethren overseas.Hardy artfully portrays the dynamics of rural life on an English dairy farm; life that, despite the industrial revolution, is here probably not so different as it was centuries earlier.His characters are beautifully portrayed, with signicant depth. &quot;Tess&quot;, like the &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;, depicts the thoughts, hopes and dreams of those consigned to a rual existence; those who are peripherally aware that the industrial revolution and the opportunities presented thereby, are radically altering life only a hundred kilometers away.Both 'Tess' and the 'Mayor' are brilliant tragedies. The astute reader knows that tragic events will ultimately prevail, but the dynamics, twists and turns of the plot in 'Tess', make it more of a compelling page turner: an excellent piece of 19-th century British lit. (If I had been forced to read it in high school, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it immeasurably less, so I commisserate with those students who were undderwhelmed by the book- read it again ten years later!).A brilliant story of an admirable, virtuous girl, who can only withstand the castigation visited upon her for the sins of others, for so long.

Hardy's style is not to everyone's taste; some argue that it is laboured and far too flowery, and this may be true in some cases, but the moral message and the profound nature of this novel far outweigh the archaic style of writing that Hardy chooses to adopt.The novel, as the title suggests, focuses on one woman in Victorian England. Her foolish and drunken father finds that he is the descendant of the ancient and landed family of the d'Urbervilles, and Tess is sent by her parents to meet one of her descendants in order to get some help from the family's financial difficulties. Alec d'Urbervilles then seduces Tess, and she is left, with illegitimate child, to deal with the consequences.After her child dies, she finds work on a farm and falls in love with Angel Clare. She feels that she cannot marry him because of her past, and, after his insistence, gives into her heart and marries him, although consumed by guilt. Eventually she confesses her past, and Angel leaves her, travelling to Brazil without her.This is not, as one reviewer described it, \\"like a bad TV movie\\". Hardy's novel is a comment on Victorian society. Tess is the ultimate victim, as many have pointed out, but she is not the victim because she chooses to be, but because society puts her in this position. Those who criticise her for being weak and being unlike any other \\"feisty\\" women in other nineteenth century novels forget that, unlike characters such as Emma Woodhouse and Lizzie Bennet, Tess was poor; and that, unlike Jane Eyre, Tess was raped. Tess is the perfect example of a blameless woman who cannot escape from the confines of society. Arguably the point of the novel is that Tess cannot change how people perceive her, and, because she has no means to support herself, she has to hide the truth and battle on with the terrible injustice that has been done to her. Victorian society would simply have ostracised a woman who had had an illegitimate child and not married the father, no matter the circumstances, so I find it deplorable that people feel that Tess was spineless when she was placed in such an impossible position.Also, any new reader, and, indeed, any old reader who hasn't accepted this point yet, should perhaps try to understand that Tess is suffering, throughout the novel, from terrible grief, guilt and depression, which is surely enough to earn anyone's sympathy, not their scorn. Hardy did not invent a \\"cocker spaniel\\" of a woman; she is a literary construct and is used in a wider sense to illustrate those taken advantage of in Victorian society; and the only reason she comes back \\"for more\\" punishment is because she cannot escape it, no matter how she tries.Additionally, it has been claimed that Hardy's characters are one-dimensional and contradictory. I take issue with this. Alec may be one-dimensional in some senses, but he is an unremittingly unpleasant person; it destroys the comment being making if Alec was an abused child, or in any way a redeemable person. And yes, Alec is turned into a preacher, but anyone who believes that he sincerely let go of his previous persona must not have understood his character properly. It is a perfect way of introducing him again into the story, and a perfect way to illustrate his own falseness, by comparing him with Angel's father, who is the Good Samaritan. It is the contrast between what Tess could have chosen and what she did - in fact, arguably, not meeting Angel's father is the only mistake that SHE makes (opposed to outside forces placing decisions upon her).Angel on the other hand is in no way one-dimensional. Although his opinion of Tess does change rapidly, it is not unbelievable on careful reading. He likes to think of himself as a maverick and someone outside of society's rules, but he is an excellent portrayal of how we all are constructs of our society. Angel, although he loves Tess, keeps referring to the fact that she is \\"pure\\", which she is not (through no fault of her own). This is a clear indication, early on in the novel, that Angel has painted himself a false image of his bride-to-be, and, for all his good qualities, he is as flawed as the next person. I fail to see how this is a shallow portrayal of a character.Tess is also not a nonsensical, weak being, but a beautiful, sad creation of Hardy's used to show injustices, and highlight practises that should be stopped. Besides that, in her own right, she is a clever, melancholy character who really should inspire the reader's pity.I have no objections with people who dislike this novel because they dislike the style or because they dislike some character development for sensible reason; but when people decide to abuse a novel because they don't seem to have bothered to read into it properly, I find it irritating to say the least. This novel requires people to put themselves in the place of another and feel sympathy with another person.One reviewer commented that the novel was ill-received when it came out, and should have stayed that way. The novel was considered offensive because of the implied sexual context and because of its criticisms of Victorian morals, but this does not make it a bad novel; this means that it encourages people to think, to question and to re-evaluate. Any novel that is so brave as to find an injustice in society and write a whole novel criticising it deserves our praise; and Hardy's writing, far from doing the idea down, only helps to elevate the moral: that society can be wrong."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Having just finished this book a mere few hours ago the pain of it is fresh in my mind, but I'm sure it will distract me for weeks, such is the intensity of this tragedy. The only other novel of Hardy's I have ever read - Jude the Obscure - was a good book, stable and interesting, though not compelling until it's heart-wrenching twist three quarters of the way through the book. It was, in essence, more a social commentary, so it was with some surprise that I absorbed the constant emotion and passion that was this book. The basic storyline is as follows: Tess Durbeyfield, a young woman of a poor country family, is sent to visit her rich cousin, Alec d'Urbeville, after learning of her (perhaps mythical) relation to the ancient family which bears his name. In the obscure randomness that fate casts over life, innocent Tess is then pursued by perhaps the only man she could never tolerate (Alec), who is as his most evil in the early parts of the book. At Alec's house Tess works as a keeper to the poultry and is assaulted by Alec's constant sexual attentions until finally (and this is suggested rather than explained), exhausted and numb, she submits to intercourse with him. She later gives birth to a baby, whom she names Sorrow, who soon dies; and then meets a man she had glimpsed once years before at a dance: Angel Clare. Working together at a milking farm, they become drawn to each other despite Tess's unwillingness to incite the attentions of any man. Their love for each other grows but Tess knows that she dare not enter into marriage considering her past and a society that is both ludcrously religious and prejudiced. The strength of her love finally wears her down and they wed. However, on that very night she confesses her past, and is cruelly thrown aside by Clare, who now begins to view her as an impure woman separate to the Tess he had always loved (despite his past containing a similar history). After suffering years of solitutde and hardship, Tess finally gives up on Clare and falls in the way of Alec d'Urbeville again, relying upon him for the care of herself and her family. Sick and wasted, Clare eventually realizes the mistake he has made in casting Tess aside and finds her at d'Urbeville's mansion: too late. This brings the story to its close where greater tragedy ensues.The book was brilliant in its emotive persuasion and its depiction of Tess, who is impossible to not feel for, and, indeed, love. The misfortunes of her life are never self-inflicted, and we are left to wonder at the end at the awful nature of a world that would bring such sorrow upon one person. Tess is wonderful, stoic, and pure in her unyielding love for Clare; d'Urbeville is horrible in his initial portrayal as the villain who will singlehandedly destroy Tess's life, though is perhaps a little less repulsive at the end as one understand's the depths of his feeling for her; and Clare is the one who holds in his hands the ability to restore all past wrongness and find joy himself, but tragically fails to do so because of pride and convention.Overall, there were only two problems I had with the storyline: the first being Tess's succumbing to Alec's sexual persuasion in the beginning - if we are to believe that she is repulsed so many times by Alec's advances so completely and bodily, how are we to believe that she so easily concedes in one (unmentioned) incident? Her strength is greater than that. And the second is one which has been mentioned by another reviewer here: the ending, where a minor, unimportant character is introduced as a means through which to resolve everything, where in fact she is incapable of doing so, since we know nothing about this character, and can therefore put no faith in her.Despite these minor quibbles the whole of the book, with its engaging plot and brilliant prose, is worth more than the sum of its parts, with the pain of lost love being the principle effect one experiences long after the reading is over. Tess is beautiful."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This novel, contrary to some of the other comments, is a wonderful piece of literature. Although not the most uplifting, it is a great example of Hardy and Deterministic and Naturalistic fiction.

Although somewhat lengthy, the novel is one of the better pieces of British fiction to come out of the period."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is an intensely depressing but brilliant depiction of the connections between love, fear, and guilt.

Her parents (and especially her father) are greatly heartened by the news that they are, however distantly, nobility. Tess is therefore sent to her richer relations, the d'Urbervilles of Trantridge, to claim kinship and benefit from their superior finances.Upon taking her position as a bird-tender, Alec D'Urberville is captivated by Tess's natural country beauty and seduces her. Tess is an innocent, and she returns home to bear her child. After bringing shame upon her family, Tess must attempt to build a respectable life out of a situation that denies her every particle of respectability she once had.Hardy writes in a rather long-winded, flowery style. His vocabulary is rich, but it can become tediously melodramatic at times. The plot of this novel is full of coincidences that seem rather implausible, but it is a wonderful portrayal of the prejudices of society. Tess is an absolutely heartbreaking character, enduring trial after trial silently, feeling it is her due.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is a solid read, but be prepared to be thoroughly depressed and disillusioned with society at its finish."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"One of my friends recommended that I read Thomas Hardy, but she cautioned me: &quot;Thomas Hardy isn't for everyone.&quot; I discovered while reading &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; that what she may have meant is that Thomas Hardy didn't write light works to be read and then forgotten about. Through this book, Hardy addresses issues that society in his day didn't want to face: the fate of the farm worker in the increasingly industrialized society, predjudices held against minority groups, and the inequality of women. All of this is not to say that this is a dry or boring work -- &quot;Tess&quot; is gripping, riveting, and almost overpowering in its emotional appeal. One cannot read this book without becoming involved in Tess's situation. I have never been so angry with a character in a book as I was with Angel Clare at a certain point in the novel. So, in conclusion, &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; isn't for everyone. . . but it should be for every thinking person, everyone who isn't afraid to face issues, think deeply about them, and apply them to life."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Some great discussions come out of this book. Thomas Hardy has a very distinct style, and uses the environment essentially as another character, so it may be beneficial to at least have some familiarity with England before reading. No one can read this book without having strong opinions about the characters, especially the two main men. This is one of the standout pieces of literature of its time and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\" describes the experiences of a woman who, through no fault of her own, falls outside of the moral code of the Victorian era in which she lives and suffers long-reaching consequences as a social outcast. Hardy's novel is carefully well-drawn, but the novel's content demands far more than Hardy could acceptably give it in the nineteenth century. For example, the rape scene is only is carefully stepped around, inferrable only from the fact that Tess subsequently has a child; Hardy also has to carefully frame some of the scenes, such as that of Alec d'Urberville's murder, in order to avoid too closely examining the psyche of the criminal. Hardy's writing is at its best in the scenes surrounding Angel and Tess's estrangement - a safe enough environment - when he can freely move within the minds of his characters. In short, \\"Tess\\" is the stuff of a twentieth-century novel written in the nineteenth, which leaves some of the emotion that modern readers are accustomed to lacking."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Even reviewing Tess makes me choke back tears. Hardy develops one of the most truely beautiful female characters in all of English literature; then, like an evil wizzard, slowly tears her to shreds and finally grounds her into dust.A modern young woman growing up now might find it hard to identify with Tess. She is a poor farm worker and a product of the cultural changes at the beginning of the industrial revolution in England. But there is enough of a study of basic human nature here to make her story valuable to just about any reader.Hardy's prose is gifted, deep descriptive narative and character development. You may end up loving Tess; it's hard not to hate Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Morality is subject to some rolling blackouts in this book. At the end, the law stepped in and made sure that the destruction was mutual. Law seems to be particularly inept in situations where a book is this hard on the reader, and those critics in the Norton Critical Edition who consider this novel almost a crime against literature have a point. If all the characters were being put on trial, instead of merely trying to live, the law would allow each of them to be tried separately because of the doctrine of mutually antagonistic defenses. There were parts of this book I enjoyed: Angel Clare sorting the cows for milking made a lovely theme. Hardy kept referring to the barnyard as a &quot;barton,&quot; but I'm sure he wasn't directing that jibe at me, personally, because this book was written long before I was born. I've been to barnyards that were as full of &quot;mulch&quot; as the &quot;barton&quot; described in this book, and Hardy is putting things mildly. I liked the part when Alec had been reformed and Tess discovered him preaching to the Methodists without thinking that he was any better for all the things he was trying to say. Somehow Alec getting on the other side of things was still Alec, and he would have preferred to be happy than to preach all the time. For me, the plot revolved around Angel Clare's need to find a place where he could get money without shame. Alec had as much money as Tess would ever need, and he wanted to give it to her in his own way. There is an early baby problem that Tess didn't tell Alec about until they had more problems than any novelist could make disappear. D. H. Lawrence tried to understand this book in unfulfilled male and female principles, and aristocratic principles which isolated Tess and Alec d'Uberville. I'm glad this book has been appreciated so long that I finally read it. It was an involvement that went further than just feeling like a barnyard."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this.

This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary.

I'm sure I could spend years dissecting this book and finding new allusions, hidden references, and coincidental parallels. In fact, I found myself forced to re-read and, in some cases, grammatically deconstruct such large portions of this book to \\"get\\" it that I could probably claim to have read the book twice with a pretty straight face.If the book had been just a little worse, I would have been spared a lot of effort because I could have just written it off as being bad. Unfortunately, every time I was ready to throw in the towel, Thomas Hardy would throw in a turn of phrase or new way of seeing something that made me decide to ride along just a little longer to see where this was headed.In the end though, I have to cast my vote with many of the low star reviews here. Thomas Hardy's characterization of the landscape, farms, and villages beats his character development hands down. The plot moves like a fault line (millimeters per year followed by sudden jumps) and, frankly, by the end I felt more sense of elation at having reached the last page than a sense of regret that \\"the President of Immortals had ended his sport with Tess.\\" For once, I'm guessing that the Cliff's notes would be a better read than the actual book."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text?

Thus, like many other of the reviewers on this page, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read. I must admit that at first the reading was quite tedious. It must have taken me two months to read through the novel. If I had written a review after this first encounter with Tess I might well have given the novel a two star (**) rating. I believe one of the explanations for this lack of enthusiasm is that I did not get along well with my English teacher and I felt that I could not allow myself to enjoy Tess, lest I let my teacher score an important victory.As the exam period itself approached I read Tess four more times with increasing enjoyment. The last few readings were truly enlightening. I knew exactly what I would encounter on the next page and yet I shuddered with anticipation, reacting to the words even before my eyes caught them.It seems clear to me now that the reason I enjoyed Tess so much was not only the familiarity bred by multiple readings but also the dissection of the novel in the classroom. I must confess that although we had problems getting along, my English teacher was excellent.The only advice I can give those of you who doubt Tess' greatness is to muster some courage and give the novel another chance. Tess is on my all time Top 10 list along with The Grapes of Wrath, which, incidentally, I was &quot;forced &quot; to read in my high school English class."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result. While not a ground breaking novel, it's eloquence and true to life appeal allows it to become part of you.

This story was attacking so many different subjects in the time it was first published, which makes it all the better to read. I wouldn't recommend this book to just anyone, only people who can appreciate how the text of this book was written and how the Hardy wove many different ideas together to create a tragic life and ending for such a young girl.

It is a beautifully written novel about one wopman and her struggle to find love and her duty to her family.Tess was a child who sought to right her wrong by working for her &quot;cousins&quot; she hoped that by doing this she could become a productive member of the family particularly as the eldest child. She was required to take care pof most of the chores as her siblings were too young to help the family. As a daughter she was taught that it was her duty to marry wealth so that her family would not have to live in squallor. In her attempt to do this she was taken advantage of, but not raped, and she was made pregnant. She could not abort the child, and she could not properly carry the child to term without being married. She did the latter of these because she hated the childs father. Many times she wished that the child would die so that it would not have to live with the bastard lable. She felt that it was best that the child be taken from the earth to make her and her child's life easier.Tess soon finds that there is a doiuble standard for pre-marital sex in Victorian England. Her husband, on there wedding night admits that he has been promiscuous, Tess is greatly relieved by this because she thinks that he will be more accepting of her situation when she tells him, this is not so. Angel, her husband, walk out on tess and leaves her to fend for herself, an unloved and un cared for woman. This novel ends sadly with Tess' death after Angel comes back to her and they live happily for a number of days.This novel is an excellent example of social commentary in the form of literary art. This novel is a poinient dipiction of the life of a young woman in Victorian England. A well written novel with excellent character development one of the best book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Timeless story of a woman and her struggle to care for those she loved. Fighting against the male dominated society of her time, Tess sacrifices her own interests to provide for her family and attempt to stay true to the man she loves. Hardy does a wonderful job of painting the landscape and using it to enhance Tess's physical struggles. His portrait of Tess as a strong woman is balanced with her vulnerability, pure heart and hope for a better future.Norton's version includes insight into Hardy's background and the writing of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Very helpful towards understanding the dynamics of the story."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is one of the greatest novels ever written.

It is the story of a tragic heroine whose life is shaped by events beyond her control.I purchased the book for a college class and hope to read more by the author.The descriptions of life in rural 19th century England are superb."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"By today's standards certain passages of this book may seem rather vague and subtle, but they were shocking when first written--enough that the book was subject to heavy censorship--vital passages from it were removed. And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy is an extraordinary writer; though his writing is poetic, and includes on point historical references, he is an imaginative and thoughtful storyteller. Hardy reveals Tess's soul with such care and regard that she is irresistibly complex; delicate and strong willed, deeply loyal and obstinately independent, yet submissive and capable of extreme violence. So well did I come to understand her that, over time, I could predict her reactions and decisions -- though I hoped she would decide otherwise. Once a preacher reveals to Tess's father his connection to a long lost prominent family, Tess's is life is set on a seemingly unalterable path. Used, manipulated, misjudged and shamed, she struggles on, grinding out a living in unspeakably harsh conditions, while resisting with all her might a man who had already stolen her innocence and would shamelessly destroy her soul as she waiting for the man who had abandoned her. I found myself wincing at her pain, hoping she would receive what she deserved rather than what life seemed intent on doling out to her. Perhaps the best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" is, well, the story about Tess of the D'Urbervilles, a \\"simple,sensuous and passionate\\" peasant girl whose maturation into a woman has tremendous antipathy to its brim. The transfiguration of \\"a fine and handsome\\" country lass into a blooming woman with hapless consequences is the theme of this the most ambitious tragic Hardyan novel and the artistic flair of the late Victorian novelist blended with the subtle craftsmanship transcends the individual concern into one of the society.The proposition involved in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" first published in 1891 in three volumes has a tragic enough diction as we get it so clearly throughout the 550 or so odd pages of the book. It is to contract the unending horizon of the human life into a miniscule and apparently insignificant domain of an individual, who's inexperienced, unsophisticated, candid and uncanny. Tess Durbeyfield is a meek, submissive sixteen-and-a-half year old country girl with several siblings, a dissipated father and an illusioned mother living in the village of Marlott in the county of 19th. century fictitious Wessex,Hardy's eternal refuge from the real world outside. The chance discovery of John Durbeyfield from Parson Tringham, the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane, of his ancestral line of D'Urbervilles and a freak accidnt culminating in the death of one of his horses for which Tess herself shouldrs the blame sends the eponymous protagonist of this darkly compelling drama to find monetary solace in the wealthy Mrs. D'Urberville. As if the exploitation of the have nots in terms of financial issues weren't enough, the poor peasant girl from the poor \\"blighted\\" Durbeyfield family is seduced by Mrs. D'Urberville's sensual and lustful son Alec. Alec shuns her, Tess becomes pregnant, the child passes away in infancy, the unmarried mother mother starts working as a diarymaid in a farm, the Talbothays, falls in love with Angel Clare, the rector's son.....the whole flow of the tyde has a strangely familiar suspicion about itself and it's actually Thomas Hardy's exceptional gift for exploring a relatively small setting to compile a general drama of human life that transpires real tragic proportions from a fictitious figure.Art is indeed often illusory, sometimes it's even a whisper of the urge of reformation; but in more probabilities than one, art is symbolic, a sign of much deep-seated intent. The genuine accomplishment of all forms of art---be it literature, painting,sculpture,music or much else---is to portray the vastness of the human expanse in the most trimmed space and geniuses of all ages in all spheres of art have managed to do just that. Van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers\\" and \\"The Starry Night\\" are more symbolic than cliches, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" is the depiction of social turmoil in 19th. century Russia, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" is a journey through a distorted and divided soul's mind and Eric Clapton's song \\"Tears of Heaven\\" is the ultimate homage to our passed away beloved ones. \\"Tess of the D'Urbevilles\\" too is a metaphor for agonies, humiliations, inward and outward strifes, twists and turns in life and the ultimatum. The unprecedented and nihilistically conspiring turn of events that Tess encounters in her hard and lonely life could've been thrown to anyone in general and any woman of any age in particular and through Tess's character as well as through the brilliant evocation of the fictional Wessex landscape and people, Hardy stags \\"the ache of modernism\\"in the novel.This abyss of \\"the ache of modernism\\" is aptly poured into the images of the rustic realm and the ascend of the morally and spiritually corrupt. Nowhere in the book is this concept clearer than in the nature of the shrewd and machiavellian Alec D'Urberville. A sinful man come to no good by demolishing an unsuspecting girl's life, Alec is also a preacher of the Gospels in his so-called reformed stage. But all his baser passions are aroused on seeing Tess after four years and he turns into a wolf once more: \\"Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife, you are mine!\\" This to a Tess whose innocent flaw of revealing her horrendous past to Angel on their weddind night had caused their subsequent separation and 'the deserted wife\\"-'s struggle in sustaining hr livelihood. The typical male sexual desires and possessive phyche is symbolized in Angel Clare whose own sinful past is acceptable but not Tess's unconditioned misery.Throughout the novel, the bounteous description of the landscape, the environment and Nature keeps the reader spell-bound at the author's immense imaginative power, marvellous visualisation skill and abundant choice of similes and metaphors and aptly used words. Yet the language and mood always maintain a touch of pessimism and not even spares the simple, unrestrained and self-sacrificing friendship of Marian,Retty Priddle,Izz Huett and Tess.Hardy is barely good at analysing characters and that is vividly exposed towards the end of the novel. Angel returns from Brazil and scampers to rejoin with \\"a cottage-girl, his young wife\\" only to find her with Alec D'Urberville once again. In utter desperation of realising that she was taken in by Alec with morbid promises about her dishevelled family, Tess kills him and then elopes with Angel nly to be caught within a short span of time and be hanged. Such a sudden turnaround of events is too confusing and leaves one wondering whether more words and pages should've been devoted to such critical situations. The reader rues too the missingdescription of Tess's and Angel's marriage as much as the incomplete pictored characters' change of notions.That the end of the novel is a befitting tribute, be it poetically just, tragic or sarcastic, to the three major characters is a Jack jumping out of the box. Alec's sin is too much for this world to bear and so he dies; Tess's life is too inundated with misery, despair, responsibility and uncertainty and so she meets with a tragic end; Angel's puritan perspective finds him a pure, genteel partner in the shape of Tess's younger sister Liza-Lu.What adds jewels to the crown are the dramatic effects installed into the novel to make the reader approach the chain of events with a sigh and regret. What if Tess's written confession pushed under Angel's door hadn't gone under the carpet? Surely the tragic aftermath could've been bypassed. Again, had Tess not overheard her husband's brothers' critical approach to her, she would've surely met with her in-laws and her life would've turned over a new leaf. But tragedy is always concentrated on inevitability and waivering of the obvious and so it is in the case of Tess, the \\"little fool\\".The fate of an unassuming girl \\"put to by an Enemy in the shape of a friend' and played from one court to another and back again like a shuttlecock isn't rare enough but what's rare is the quality of Hardy to paint a solemn picture about the essence of the issue. True, the book does often become a laboured read and provokes a deep pang of pain, anger, frustration, resentment, resentment and a rebellious intent,but the reader cannot help but fel that \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is \\"a new kind of beauty, a beauty of tragic tone\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Probably Hardy's most famous work and definitely containing his most sympathetic heroine. Takes direct aim at the class system and gender roles and forces the reader to see stark differences between what is socially acceptable and what is socially ridiculed. Note how Tess is blamed for her past more than Alec is, when it's Alec's fault Tess ends up as she does. A final ultimate retribution does surface but of course, at the expense of Tess's future. She's heartbreaking here, especially when she writes to Angel, pleading for his love and forgiveness. You can feel every second of her plight , right down to the harsh outdoor work she's forced to endure in order to stay alive. All dust, sweat and fatigue...

Whilst reading the 50 Shades Trilogy recently, I noted the references to Tess in that book and it perked my interest in this book. I decided to re-read it as I really couldn't remember it much and wondered how I would interpret it now being more mature and experienced. Well suffice it to say that this book is devastatingly excellent! The language is hard to get at first (having not read a Thomas Hardy in a long time!).... it's a Thomas Hardy novel so you know he's very detailed and it's going to be tragic as he doesn't do happy ever after! The novel is set in Victorian England and features its heroine Tess a very poor country girl. It details her journey from innocent young girl on the cusp of womanhood to womanhood. It is essentially a love tragedy but not in the manner of Romeo and Juliett, its more, more real, more realistic. Its speaks to just how tragic life can be when the right man doesn't meet the right woman at the right time, about missed opportunities, and, depicts how the biggest of injustice and violation often happens to the most vulnerable and undeserving of persons. It speaks to how morals and society's beliefs can cause us pain and sorrow and often to punish those undeserving of same. But that was life then and its still so today. Suffice it to say that this book is 100 times better than the 50 Shades Trilogy and has impacted me so profoundly, I just can't understand how I didn't see the monumental tragedy it is when I was 17 years old. As a result I've taken to re-reading most of my literature books. This book is a must read for those who can manage."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Absolutely loved the story it's definitely worth reading through.

The way hardy described some scenes left me in awe.

Descriptive words and never a boring section. I truly loved this book and would recommend it to others, expecially if you are a lover of language."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the first Kindle book that I have read and I must say that the Kindle experience is better than I have thought - I read in the bright sunlight without getting tired.I first have heard of Tess in high school, but I didn't have the time or the mood to read it until now.Why I wanted to so much read it? Besides the fact that it is a classic - and I think that every teenager or young person in one's twenties must read it - I learned that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a pretty controversial novel when Thomas Hardy first released it. As we know from history and from literature courses, the Victorians considered themes such as sex, religion, the condition of women or the lives of the peasants taboo subjects. Fortunately we are more open-minded today and we don't make a big fuss of what's moral or not in books such as this one. I guess that Thomas Hardy had the intention to open the peoples' eyes - though it is a fictional story - that unfortunate things were happening to innocent girls during that time.The story is very realistic and the characters are complex.Tess is a free-spirited girl until her destiny changes and becomes more difficult. Tess swings between strength and weakness, between reason and her heart. I admire her capacity of dusting herself off and decide to find another place to work, in order to help her poor family. Although Angel is far away, her hope that he will come back someday does not leave her. I didn't like the fact that she constantly blamed herself for the first bad episode of her life which led her to other complicated situations. She felt guilty for something she wasn't aware of or she wasn't taught to avoid.The book also gives us a glimpse of how were the lives of peasants, and the depiction of the landscapes will appeal to those how love nature.I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin your reading.Therefore read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because you can enter in Tess' world and learn more about her troubles."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I must admit that this is one of the few classics that I have not read, so when I found a free copy for my Kindle, I immediately downloaded it. And the story does not disappoint. Hardy is a master of taking you to a time in place in the past and uses verbage and setting descriptions that put you right in the story. Hardy's characters are brought to life and you feel as if you could know someone with these same characteristics in the here and now. The ending of this story, for me personally left something to be desired, but I really could not put it down. If you have not read this story, yet, please do!On a side note, I would love to see a contemporary adaptation of this story and see how the characters would interact with each other, as social standing, money, love, and betrayal are certainly themes worth examining in this day and age."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Should not be made into an afterschool special. Thomas Hardy is an excellent and verbose writer. Why use a few words to describe something when a whole page is more deft? Sometimes. Sometimes it is just a bit over the top. Good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic tragedy. Tess is so sweet you want to know her more and more, which led to shock after shock. I appreciated the footnotes and explanations at the end of the book. I also enjoyed Hardy's colorful descriptions. I was surprised at how similar life in thenineteenth century was to today's life."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The writing here is truly captivating. Hardy presents his principal characters in much the same way as other famous writers of his day; that is, the once nobled family,having fallen on hard times, now needs to be brought from the brink of disaster by marrying off one its daughters to someone of status. Tess does not dissapoint, in that she has spunk, principles, and a sense of duty. This story is filled with intrigue, unlikely loyalties, and an ending that will reward you for picking up this book.The bonus here is that I read the book for free on my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Okay...I had to read this book as summer reading...I must say I was actually looking foward to reading it...I thought it would be good...I thought wrong. Tess is one of the most awful books I have ever read...Tess is a sap with no spine and an insult to all women. I understand this book was written in an era when women were not strong but still...couldn't Hardy have given Tess some common sense?? This book put me to sleep more than once with its long descriptions of the same valley...and can anything else happen to Tess at the end of this novel? I think every bad thing that could happen to a woman happened to Tess...a bit melodramatic, maybe? I don't know how this book became a classic...was it classic for its ability to put somebody to sleep...or how about sending someone into a depression or fits of anger because Tess is a moron? If you want to read classics read Crime and Punishment or even Madame Bovary...I also had to read those this summer and I actually enjoyed them...so don't go saying to yourself the only reason I don't like this book is because I was forced to read it...I was forced to read those other books and I liked them. In short, I pity anybody who has to read this book...and I don't know how anybody in their right minds could have given this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A few years back I was forced to read &quot;Tess&quot; for my English class. Nobody in my class could ever finish reading the book... only a few of us could ever even finish the Cliff Notes for it. Our Professor tried solving the situation by renting us the video, but all of us were fast asleep half an hour into it.Tess is a bimbo with no brain and an insult to women, yes, even at that time! This book is over-rated and should not be called a classic. If you really want to read good literature, read D.H.Lawrence, read Tolstoy, read evn modern classical writers like Achebe, but for crying out loud, do NOT waste your time and money on &quot;Tess..&quot;"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The whole tragedy is in the fact that I was NOT forced to read this book but actually picked it up because I WANTED to read it (or so I thought at the time). I have read many books in my life, quite a lot of them classics, but I have to say that this book just about drove me bananas. I think there is a general misapprehension in thinking that a classic must be good.I dare not even think of how many times I probably came close to being committed to an asylum for acting suspiciously on the train while reading \\"Tess\\" (every two seconds I would sigh, roll my eyes, scoff or just plain throw my hands in the air from frustration). Many reviewers had rightly pointed out that the character of Tess is the shubbiest excuse of a woman in the whole Solar System. How can anybody, in any age, on any continent, be as spineless and masochistic as she is? This woman is more of a martyr that Joan of Arc, for crying out loud.The excuse that this book takes place in Victorian England doesn't quite cut it. I saw more strength and backbone in Hester of The Scarlet Letter (which story took place in a much more prudish and puritanical setting than England of 1800's).I think Thomas Hardy invented himself a woman who would act like his cocker spaniel; no matter how much he beat the crap out of that 'faithfull friend' the poor dog would always come crawling back and lick his boots, which is pretty much how Tess acts throughout the book. The whole scenario smacks a lot of a perverted male fantasy. Maybe Hardy had a nasty mother, who knows. I bet psychiatrists would have a field day with the author.I am disappointed and feel cheated of the time that I could have used to read something else; Dickens, for example. Or just Maeve Binchy, if I wanted female driven narrative. \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" would have been a much better book if that idiot-of-a-husband and Tess herself would fall into that bloody river in the middle of the book (exactly as Tess wanted it) and have done with it. I know I would applaud such a great ending!In short: steer way clear of this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"fascinating story of an ancient civilization"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It goes on way to long with a lot of filler which seems out of place."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Having a degree in English Lit., it seems sinful for me to accuse Thomas Hardy of being a terrible writer, but there it is. Any writer today submitting a manuscript like this would have it rejected out of hand. This is not a book for an audience seeking a good, fast-paced story that speaks for itself. If you read this book, you will have to interpret every word, description, and action, try to guess what universal message the author is attempting to convey and what the characters are thinking and feeling at any given time. In short, the kind of book that college English professors love, and try to emulate, and remain college English professors because they will never get such a thing published.First of all, character development is not only lacking, it is absent altogether. It might be assumed that the book's title character, at least, would be strongly drawn, someone we could sympathize with, empathize with, or relate to in some way. Not the case. While Hardy expounds upon Tess' physical appearance ad nauseum throughout, never did I gain any real insight into her thoughts and feelings, her motivation. Maybe the insight is hidden in these endless physical descriptions or her inane actions, but frankly, if I'm reading for pleasure I don't want to take the time to search. Sorry. And it follows that if Hardy failed in his title character, forget about all the others.Secondly, his wordiness is irritating. One paragraph of half-way interesting action is followed by a full page of useless description and genuflecting. Perhaps essential to hidden meanings and motives and social commentary, but again, I'm not taking the time to search. I found myself skipping over these, the result being my finishing the book in two evenings.Conversely, Hardy seems to gloss over the most important event in the book, cloaking it in overly subtle tones. Granted, this was written during the sexually-repressed Victorian Era, for an audience with \\"delicate sensibilites\\", but come on. Something as traumatic and life-shattering as rape, in fact the event that is supposed to drive the entire novel, deserves more than an allusion to medieval knights taking advantage of peasant girls. Not that I want graphic details, on the contrary. But please, give me a break; even if her society deems she take it as a matter of course, let us see, clearly, her inward rage, hurt, bafflement at what has happened to her. Something. Anything. Make her human, in other words.If you really must read this, a synopsis would be enough. The novel's idea is a good one, and could have probably been done brilliantly by someone else. Hardy fails it miserably."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A great windbag of a novel, Hardy seems to think that not only does a grassy meadow take half a chapter to describe, he thinks that everyone else agrees with him. Please. Not the largest complaint I have, but surely the first, is that Hardy's style is like looking up looking up &quot;stone pillar&quot; in a thesaurus, then two others, and then writing down every single synonym. It takes pages for him to describe a dairy farm, and at some point you wonder if he's introducing the farm as a character, it gets so much time.Not that he seems to spend that much time on his characters; they are created with little that interests, and contain less development that a homeless shelter under President Bush.Tess is described, at great length, and quite often, as a beautiful woman. Okay, so what? Her personality is so weak I wonder if he even thought about what she would do in a situation, or just had her do whatever the other characters wanted her to do, until the very end, when she makes an out of character action that is supposed to be shocking, but is more perplexing; the character described in the rest of the book wouldn't do that, and there is nothing to indicate why she has a sudden change of being.Angel is built up as the &quot;perfect prince in shining armor&quot; until he finds out about Tess's secret, when he suddenly acts like a selfish and snotty child that is the very opposite of what he has been in the rest of the book. Then he switches back at the end, with little thought as to why by Hardy, at least not much that is apparent in the book.Let's see, boring writing style and poorly done characters, what else is there? Ah, plot. The only way to describe plot is that it made the description seem riveting and his characters thought out. He's spend the time to talk about Tess getting a job, then the next chapter she is suddenly running away from it; I felt robbed of the time spent in the build up, and knowing more in detail of what happened in the intervening time from when she got the job to when she quit would have helped with her character. And when you think there is no need for detail, Hardy's got more than enough. He spends ages talking about Tess and Angel's time together at the dairy farm, but none of their actions change the way they feel about each other. He could have cut our some of their horse riding, and no one would complain.In short, Hardy's the kind of writer who is analogous to a storyteller that likes the sound of his voice; just because he can say something, he does. And in his endless drivel, what might be interesting is skipper over. This guy could have used and editor.When it first came out, this book was ill received, and I see no reason for anything to have changed since."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too! I have only read one of the books (Wuthering Heights) and I liked it. I was planning on giving these as gifts, but now I am going to keep them!

But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The time spent on reading this book could have been spent on someting worth while and interesting such as watching the grass grow, or picking my teeth. It was a real disappointment and the reading of this book by anyone with a life should by outlawed."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, is truly a classic. Hardy's use of vivid imagery to evoke emotion was magnificent. His ability to bring life to the scenes of the novel made the comprehension of the story much easier. The sad story of Tess' demise was provided with a great deal of emotion, which made the novel incredible to read.We follow Tess throughout her life, experiencing all the emotions associated with her horrific teenage years. We are able to see the progression of her character and the emotions that drove her all the way towards the end of novel. It was evident that Hardy used his keen ability to address his opinion of the imminent will.Hardy has done an outstanding job, and though Tess' story, he has addressed serious problems with society that have transcended to even this era. An outstanding job! To see that the only a few people have given this novel five stars amazes me! Tess was an extraordinary novel; the power of this work of literature is unlike any other. It is unique and a must read for any high school student. I'm proud to say that this novel was enjoyable and an interesting read. From start to miserable finish, Hardy kept my eyes glued. His vivid imagery and interesting diction proved to be a great addition to an already interesting plot."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A must read. Thomas Hardy's diction is unforgettable. Just like a Shakespeare play, every sentence must be savored. Despite the seemingly overwhelming amount of detail included, the novel is extremely readable. All this detail allows the reader to have vivid pictures of each and every scene painted in their minds. From the action filled beginning to the somewhat predictable but nevertheless fantastic ending, the reader will be on the edge of his or her seat, wondering what misadventure Tess will fall into next. The protagonist, Tess, can easily be classified as a heroine of the Victorian era. Her character is impossible not to love, tragically selfless, humble, and beautiful inside and out. The events of the novel make one feel an anger towards not only some of the characters, but towards what they represent and the society which they live in. From the misogynistic, deceitful character of Alec to the well-intentioned but foolish character of Tess's mother, even to our main character, the wide eyed, innocent, ever altruistic character of Tess, every character has a statement to make about the world that Hardy places them in. And with Tess's fatal flaw, one can't help but think of how applicable it is even in today's time. Making bold statements on gender lines, social status lines, and the inevitability of fate, this novel transcends time. A quick recommendation-though at times the book may seem to drag out, it is certainly worth it to continue reading and finish the novel. Also, as the novel progresses, the wording certainly gets easier to understand."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The stories and the characters may seem simple and dramatic, however, of the classic nature of Greek mythology, consistent with other books by the author, such as The Return of the Native, and the Mayor of Casterbridge. The essence of the book seems to me, is about the tragedies humans suffer, caught in the conflicts between nature and culture. The nature is harsh but straightforward as love is, but the culture presents hypocrisies and judgment, separating people between splendid star and blighted one. Whether to worship the sun, or to worship the standards of Judeo Christianity? There are different judgments in wealth vs. poverty, religion vs. spirituality, men's honor vs. women's purity. And there is plenty of ambiguity in all of them but ultimately, the \\"anachronism of love and chance\\" leads the characters to classic tragedies in the end. Beautiful writing."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The title character Tess journeys across the rural English countryside amidst a stark voyage of discovering exactly who she is. Her story is one filled with various sorrows, cathartic or otherwise, punctuated by only fleeting amounts of peace and happiness tossed somewhere in-between. It's not an easy read--nor is it meant to be--for a few reasons. Hardy thrives on description, some of which might seem unnecessary to the modern-day reader (particularly the extended glimpses of the dairy farms), though we do need to understand the Victorian world we're in. Consequently, the author wants to garner as much support as he can for his protagonist, who loses her innocence quickly and spends most of the book scraping up the pieces of a wreckage that was never her fault in the first place. And these glimpses into her troubled consciousness ache and resonate with us a century on. So if we understand the atmosphere she has to contend with, we begin to understand Tess--and sympathize with her plight and misfortune along the way.When the meat is torn off the skeleton, it's a solid (albeit lengthy) read about the meshing and clashing of various characters in nineteenth-century England. The choices of some of the characters throughout, some of which might be construed as twists, are not entirely believable though add definite color to the work, especially the last two \\"phases.\\" These culminate in a conclusive ending that is both haunting and beautiful. This won't be for everyone, though if you can withstand some archaic language here and there, you might enjoy this tragic tale about love, loss, and a stringent society that tried so desperately to dictate both."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is a great book. The desriptions are beautiful. I was shocked to see how many people trashed it.Look, Thomas Hardy was portraying the tragic struggle of a simple country girl living in the 19th century. Women weren't treated well, let alone poor women. In my opinion, he spoke of Tess with tenderness and compassion. He was not trying to say she deserved all that anguish, but the reality is that that's the way it was. If anything I think he was trying to advocate respectful treatment of women."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I first read this book as a teenager. It has been a few years since I was a teenager, to say the least, but it will always stay with me as one of the \\"best books I have ever read\\" that is for sure. Among many wonderful attributes Hardy brings alive the English countryside so incredibly well. Tess struggles and loves so deeply and I wanted so much for her to be happy. I understand why and how she came to do what she did."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This review is for Amazon.com - don't read if you don't want a spoiler for the ending. I loved this book - it had great character development, a truly elegant writing style, and a plotline that kept me enraptured right up to the end. Hardy's forte was capturing the irresistability of temptation even with the most staunch of intentions. However, I'm quite irritated at the amazon.com editorial review that gives away the entire ending. What's up with that? Thinking that Amazon of all places wouldn't be so daft as to give away the ending in the review, I was expecting the ending in the middle of the book and was sorely disappointed to learn that WAS the ending and that I had known it all along. Please update the editorial review and remove the details of the story ending.As for the ending itself, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending wasn't quite as expected. While the plot of the ending wasn't unexpected (especially having read the editorial review), the turn of events and seemly strong character traits of Angel and Tess appear to have evaporated in an instant. While Angel had to spend a year away from Tess to work up to his acceptance of her prior transgression, he doesn't seem to think more than a blink of her having killed a man. And Tess holds such a strong belief in her own low self worth, that she is unwilling to marry the man she loves for disgracing him. And then, kills a man without as much thought as deciding to boil a cup of tea. So, even though the writing style and the majority of the book were fantastic, the ending is the spoiler and the reason for only 4 stars. This book is still very much worth a read simply for the enjoyment of the journey."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Just a fantastic novel. The larger issues it addresses, as is the case with Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, are the very largest that we face. But the detail is also there, all the way down to every scent, sound, and emotion of the daily commute of a young milkmaid in Victorian England. That such strikingly detailed imagery sits easily atop the largest issues of our existence is a marvel. An amazing, important novel. One of the best."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite novels.

Readers who like Tom Clancy will probably find Hardy too slow. Readers who like James Joyce will probably find Hardy too old-fashioned. The more time I spend in Hardy's world, the happier I am, even when the outcome is unhappy, as it is with Tess. It's hard to pick a favorite of his books; they're all so wonderful, but if I had to choose only one to take to a desert island, this would probably be it (though a tough choice between this and \\"Far From the Madding Crowd\\"). My husband and I dream of going to Dorset because of Hardy. I hope one day we make it. You simply can't do better than Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

It's a love triangle with serious characters and story line. Sometimes I make the mistake of thinking people were not sophisticated 2 hundred years ago, but they were and had difficult issues in which to deal within their cultures. As the author was an Englishman, there were loads of vocabulary learned with reading this book, but it was fun because it's so easy with the Kindle to look up a word.

Tess is a tragic story about a tragic young female, who at glance may seen mentally insane/disturbed, but if you read deeply enough, feel her emotions, you'll know that she's just as sane as any one of us, she's a pure woman."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"A compeling and creepy classical fiction to read. It felt like I was doing something wrong by reading Tess, even though I did not have a reason to believe why. But the bottom line's that, from the first chapter until the last, you'll feel as if there's someone standing behind you, ready to hurt you. Your spirit feels free, that's what Thomas Hardy can do to you as a person."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Ok, the first time I too this book out of the library, I got halfway through it before I hurled it at the wall. I couldn't stand the characters and I was so mad and frustrated with them I returned it without finishing it. A month later, it was drivng me crazy not knowing how the characters fared, and I took it out and finished it. But this time, I knew how to read it: I didn't try so hard to relate to the characters, I just read their story. And I found if a fascinating study of suffering and sorrow and love and all that good stuff. So just get throught the very frustrating middle and it's good, really. Strange, gothic ending, but good. And check out the A&amp;E movie, because it's excellent - better thatn the book, and that's weird. Perfect casting and adaptation. Ok, that's all."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This is one of the most emotionally powerful books I have ever read. It's long and the writing style is a bit wordy by today's standards, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. The story centers on poor, innocent, good-hearted, beautiful Tess who, at age sixteen, is persuaded by her parents to visit their wealthier relatives in hopes that they will help Them out financially. Tess gets taken advantage of by her sleazy \\"cousin\\", Alec d'Urberville, and returns home pregnant, her reputation ruined. Thus begins Tess's sad, sad tale. Tess eventually marries Angel Clare, a man she idolizes, but on their wedding night.... Well, I'll let you read it for yourself and find out what happen. The story really picks up in the second half, so don't give up on it.Tess, Alec, and Angel are all complex and fascinating characters. The story deals with issues of religion, morality, class differences, the changing English economy, and the double standard that pertains to men and women. It never loses its focus on Tess and her incredibly moving story. It builds to a devastating conclusion that I never saw coming. Have a box of tissues and a carton of ice cream at the ready when you finish this book. You'll need them!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Absolutely so amazing, fun, exciting, emotional, drama, love, erotic, romantic, passionate, sexy book!! I Love the whole series of books!!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This book was a true tragedy between two social classes and a girl who tried helping her family and herself at the same time, and yet she suffered for it in the end."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This year I decided to reread some classics, and read some I never had read. This one was a little tough for me. I'd be reading and have to backtrack few pages for the first time ever."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"i'm not in love with this book. as classic i thought it'd be better but it drags and drags and drags and there's not much to keep your attention. its very vaguely written and i can tell already i'm not a fan of Thomas Hardy"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"did it for o level and at tertiary and still love the plot and thought put into this. a good book for the ages"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"We all trudged through this book in middle school and had to use a dictionary every three pages or so. I thought that it would be more interesting as I am now over 40. It still escapes me.meesher@pacbell.net"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"Poor Tess! Life is hard from beginning to end for this poor girl.Ikept hoping something would work out for her but alas it never did.Still a great read another Hardy classic I really enjoyed!"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"I have a hard time trying to get into the time frame of this, and other Hardy books. In the context, Tess seems to be the victim of an unreasonable expectation of purity, but it is her own actions and evasions that lead inevitably to catastrophe.Damn, Girl, whatever happened to the weekend hookup, and club sex???Only say &#34; yeah, I did him, get out or get over it.&#34; and all the troubles go away.Love her nonetheless."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"WONDERFUL DISCRIPTIVE NOVEL. HEARTWARMING & HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. HARD TO PUT IN DOWN. WOULD READ IT AGAIN. CREATIVE WRITING BY AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"This was the first book of Thomas Hardy's, and I read it in my English class. The book is, at times, difficult to read, and it is filled with Biblical allusions that the average reader may not comprehend. Nevertheless, it is a powerful story, one that I would highly recommend. Beyond the story is Hardy's description of the English countryside, which, in themselves, are masterpieces. Granted, it is not an idealistic in tone, but still, it is an astounding novel. Anyone who does not read Thomas Hardy is doing themselves a disservice."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"The classic tale of Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a deceptivly simple story. What at first appears to be a story of a young woman becomes a symbol of nature versus the mechanical world, love and hate, and good versus evil.The pure, sweet, young Tess is at odds against the world and in seeking to aide her family in their struggle to survive she becomes entrapped in a new world of deciet, betrayal and pain. Her quest to ask the aide of recently discovered, distant kin leads Tess unwillingly into the arms of Alec her &quot;cousin&quot; and from this action her life falls into a spiral of difficulties. Her misdeeds and those of others lead again and again to trials in her life. Hardy creates wonderful full-bodied characters and sets into motion one of the greatest stories of a woman of all time. Ideas of love, hate, betrayal and the nature of the world all mingle to make a superb novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","review":"&quot;Tess of the d'Ubervilles&quot; is the story of a young and innocent woman who wants nothing more than to live a happy life. Every time Tess comes close to happiness something goes wrong.
