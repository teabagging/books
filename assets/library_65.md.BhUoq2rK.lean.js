He argues for a non-dogmatic approach to the very difficult questions that epistemology, brain research and artificial life have put in the last twenty years. His position is with those who are not trying to explain everything from a single source or with single set of tools. Not reductionism, not holism or not only emergence or cognitivism or connectionism. Still, he sees the advantages of each theory and he gives a very subtle and insightful overview of what each strand has to contribute. I have read maybe twenty books on the subject in the past few months, from Varela to Jackendorf and from Minsky to Harr&eacute;, but only Clark seems to be able to make the field transparent and coherent. If he sometimes loses in boldness, he certainly wins in promise. A book that should become a compulsary reading for anyone who wants to be introduced in the field."},{"Title":"Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again","review":"Andy Clark provides us with a new framework for thinking about the mind. Gone are the old notions of a clean boundary between the thinker and the world. Clark does a great job of making the point that our brains are essentially embodied agents that profit profoundly from the local environmental structure. He introduces this new movement in cognitive science to study the brain, body, and world together as a complex system of interactions and dependencies and calls for a cognitive science of the embodied mind.Clark is not proposing a radical idea. In fact, he defends at some length that his work is in fact a solution to the radical ideas that currently dominate the field. Clark suggests refining the tools of study used, and finding a middle ground between competing theories. I personally question whether a middle ground is appropriate in science. When anomalies exist in current models, does it serve us well to take the best of all available theories and smooth them together as Clark does? Perhaps in the case of the brain, this is a good idea, even though many other sciences (like physics) fair better with simpler one-size-fits-all solutions. Due to the brain's complexity unmatched anywhere in the known universe, maybe a simple (radical) way of studying it isn't possible (or at least within human capabilities).Clark certainly builds a strong case, particularly by applying examples and comparisons throughout the book. His ideas are well thought out, his writing is clear (though perhaps a little repetitive), and the book as a whole is well worth reading.Being There definitely gets you thinking."},{"Title":"Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again","review":"For those dissatisfied with both dualism and West Coast eliminative materialism, Andy Clark's philosophy of mind offers readers an alternative: an embodied mind.

I am learning a lot from it. Being There clarifies several complex issues by, among other things, providing vivid examples.My only criticisms are minor:- About halfway through the book, it started to get a bit repetitive. I didn't need to be told again and again that perception and cognition are active and use the world as its own memory.- There are a few errors. E.g., page 29 puts the area of high visual resolution (i.e., the fovea) at \\"0.01 percent\\" of the retina. It's 1 percent (0.01) of the retina, not 0.01 percent."},{"Title":"Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again","review":"Besides this being a very creative and unique home-work assignment, the point of this review is to help you decide if this book is what you want to read for your neuroscience assignment in the upcoming semesters. Plenty of authors have tried to give rational explanations for the ideas behind recent research. Clark is no different. He lays down the foundation of the phenomena in the field of \\"Artificial Intelligence.\\" At first a person may wonder how robotics ties into neuroscience, but it becomes clear as we reason and look at the way this field of research was carried out that it has everything to do with neuroscience. In fact the whole purpose of \\"artificial intelligence\\"(AI) is to get the product, whichever form the robot takes, to perform, react, and control itself just like a human being. But just how easy is that to do? Well first, it's important to understand how the human brain performs, reacts and controls itself in various scenarios. And then understand how it responds to new scenarios it has never encountered before. And not to forget to understand how the brain responds when a particular reaction is not working out so well and when it is working well. All this would need to be the basis for building a machine that could think like a human. So Clark delves into the complex human brain and then does a fantastic job of linking it to the research field. He starts by underlying the pattern of cognition that the human brain exhibits. He describes the brain as \\"controllers for embodied activity\\". In context with this book it means that the brain is very flexible in its controlling the many activities or scenarios that come its way. And he cites some great research examples in which controlling the embodiment of activity was implemented.Personally I feel that Clark is a great writer. His style is very conversational, which is always a plus for an easily bored reader like me. As you read Clarks' book you ask yourself questions and he eventually answers them in upcoming paragraphs. However he does like to go into too much detail on a matter. This may not be an issue for readers who enjoy knowing the fine details of certain mechanisms and thoughts. However, keep in mind that this is just my personal opinion, not every bored reader is in opposition to great detail.A great job is done in mixing exciting research into this book. But I particularly enjoyed Clark's analysis of how the mind works when planning and problem solving. When faced with a problem Clark describes the old fashioned AI method to planning as a \\"very disembodied phenomenon\\", meaning that generally when researchers want to make a machine that plans and solves, they have the mindset that it takes information, processes and reacts. This is of course accurate. But according to Clark, the human brain does so much more than that when faced with a problem to solve. When the desired result to solving a problem is not met, the human brain works on re-thinking another plan to solve the issue. \\"In many cases, however, the plan turns out to be something much more partial, and much more intimately dependent on properties of the local environment.\\" In other words, depending on what we want to accomplish, our brains will re-work another plan, but based off of clues in the environment or setting we are in. Using these clues makes re-working the problem less difficult than it was to begin with. Clark elaborates on this point for the reason that AI machines need to be programmed to be able to re-plan, \\"re-think\\" and reorganize themselves in order to achieve a problem solving status similar to that of humans. So sensing and working with the environment is so crucial to humans and should be also to these types of machines. Another chapter I really enjoyed was \\"collective wisdom, slime-mode style\\". He introduces the Dictyostelium discoideum a species of slime mold. This is a rather unique organism that starts its life as an amoeba type of cell. Until the food runs out in its environment and is forced to change shape to a ball of slime. The ball of slime (in response to cues from the environment) chases food and light so it can reach and develop into the next phase. When the right amount of nutrients is found in its environment the slime ball stops moving, sets up and grows into a stem to reproduce another generation of cells. How is this knowledge useful to understanding the brain and ultimately making machines modeled after the brain? Well the human brain acts in a slime-mold fashion. When we have a purpose or agenda (like the slime mold trying to reach the reproduction phase) we look for changes in the environment to help us. I love this analogy Clark uses: \\"you have to remember to buy a case of beer for a party. To jog your memory, you place an empty beer can on your front doormat. When next you leave the house, you trip over the can and recall your mission.\\" Environmental activities are used to shape our problem solving skills or reach our goal. Similar to the slime-mold using environmental stimuli, like light and food, to reach its goal.So the application to robots and their design. Out of the many postulates he lists for the design of these human like robots a few are; real-world, real-time focus where a machine takes data and creates output based on time frames; extended vision of cognition and computation is the machines act of using other objects around itself to create output options; constraint satisfaction networks in which an artificial machine would take pieces of info from its environment and deduce what is around by eliminating what it knows is not around. To do this requires flexible sensory mechanisms. Andy Clark shows those in the field of AI research just how they should be designing their machines by looking at the brain in the right way, as a flexible cognitive controller, that can still function when the environment changes."},{"Title":"Being There: Putting Brain, Body, and World Together Again","review":"I found this book very interesting and exciting.

That should be a really special book! It turns out to be not that special IMHO and I will start with some general remarks. 1.) The style of writing is extremely verbose and repetitive. 2.) Occasional math is used to explain a system of (partial) differential equations (with awe Von Bertalanffy references Volterra). However, there is no math backing up anything worth the term \\"general system theory\\". 3.) A lot of awkward sentences about German (open systems) versus American (cybernetic systems) science, the latter being inferior. E.g. \\"I have looked in vain into leading American texts even to find the terms \\"open system\\", \\"steady state\\" and \\"irreversible thermodynamics\\".\\" 4.) Old ideas about terms like \\"mechanism\\", \\"robot\\", etc. Do not read this book if you are a roboticist or an artificial intelligence researcher...Chapters. Usual intro, then: chapter 2. \\"The meaning of general systems theory.\\" The author describes how this theory of \\"wholeness\\" is not vague... It is beyond conventional, mechanistic physics in being an open system and beyond cybernetics with their homeostatic (not open...) stimulus-response / feedback systems. General systems theory allows - instead - for equifinality (Ashby's homeostat), organization, and unity of science. Chapter 3. \\"Some system concepts [...]\\". Here the allometric equation is introduced, apparently the most significant contribution of the author to science. It means that some characteristic, say the length of an organ, can be expressed as a power function of another characteristic, say the weight of the entire organism. I am still in shock that that was considered science. Of course such correlations exist, but does these teach us anything about the systems under investigation? Chapter 4. \\"Advanced in general systems theory\\". No equations here. It briefly lists what were at the time new areas of research, like systems engineering, personality theory, and theoretical history (mainly that). Chapter 5. \\"The organism considered as a physical system\\". One or two equations describing the influx and spending of energy in an organism. Equifinality corresponds to organisms reaching the same weight after different growth trajectories (thanks to being an open system). Chapter 6. \\"The model of open system\\". Some tables with turnover rates of cellular metabolism.Chapter 7. \\"Some aspects of system theory in biology\\". One of the more thorough parts in the book. Open systems are contrasted with feedback systems. Closed systems generally tend toward equilibrium states in an asymptotic approach. In contrast, in open systems, phenomena of false start and overshoot may occur, but they may attain a time-independent (steady, equifinal) state, 'Fliessgleichgewicht'. Realize that this book is written many years after PID control (from the 40s), the author has no excuse for not knowing that overshoot in PID controllers (feedback systems) is absolutely possible. Here, again some tables are shown with regression factors of e.g. \\"intake of water\\" (ml/hr) versus body weight, or \\"breath duration\\" (hr) versus body weight, or \\"sulphur output (g/hr) versus body weight (for mammals). Chapter 8. \\"The system concept in the sciences of man.\\" No comments. Chapter 9. \\"General systems theory in psychology and psychiatry.\\" I quote: \\"American psychology in the first half of the 20th century was dominated by the concept of the reactive organism, or, more dramatically, by the model of man as a robot.\\" The author tells how homeostasis does not complain mental illnesses (duh!) and wanders off into symbolism as a.) being unique for mankind (as opposed to animals), b.) going beyond the predominant robot philosophy (of reactive systems). 10.) \\"The relativity of categories\\". This is not about category theory. It's about Whorf and that our (mathematical) concepts might be colored by our type of language (Hopi). The author concludes with the idea of \\"progressive de-anthropomorphization\\" in which we gradually get rid of the human perspective on biology and culture.I would recommend instead:A.) \\"Life Itself\\" by Rosen if you like an old book like this with a general story about what it means to be an \\"organism\\" or \\"system\\",B.) Scientific papers (Slotine) on (partial) contraction theory if you want to know more about \\"equilibrium\\" (chapter 7).C.) Papers on symbol grounding, language grounding (Steels, Vogt), or embodiment (Bongard). Science had to rediscover that symbolic systems need to be reactive and have feedback loops through the environment (anti-thesis of chapter 9).D.) Physics. A random current book on modern physics will tell you more about \\"irreversible thermodynamics\\" then Von Bertalanffy does.This book I can only recommend for people interested in history."},{"Title":"General System Theory: Foundations, Development Applications","review":"Before Von Bertanalfy: closed systems only;After Von Bertanalfy: Open systems, interfaces, interactions, systems engineering, system thinking, system integration, ecology, complexity theory, more.You should buy it, read it, enjoy it."},{"Title":"General System Theory: Foundations, Development Applications","review":"The world is filled with books (and numerous other products) that claim they will change the way you view the world.

It is like a time machine to allow a look through the eyes of Bertalanffy to the 1960's and the prevailing scientific views at that time.

With 'special' I mean, that Bertalanffy does not write completely factual and impersonal but more emotional.All in all, this book does not provide you with solutions to problems but gives you the ability after reading to ask questions you could not ask before because you did not know the problem at all. For me, it was really interesting to contrast the ideas discussed in the book with our current state of knowlegde over 50 years later (the book covers the work of Bertalanffy from 1930's - 1960's).

So we find a clear turn in books about complexity and administration trying to learn from the lesson of life...this is the only way to enter the age of adaptation as Thomas Petzinger calls it. Our time owes to GST a great deal, and as so, GST stands as a monument to that whole movement toward the global nature of our civilization of the same kind of The Phenomenon of Man and Creative Evolution."},{"Title":"General System Theory: Foundations, Development Applications","review":"Sometime in the mid-1990's I was appointed to lead the hardware portion of an engineering project, and a much senior colleague was appointed the software lead. At our first meeting I presented a brilliantly overwrought integration plan, and then asked him what he thought. \\"I don't know,\\" he replied, \\"I'm still groping.\\"You get the sense that Ludwig von Bertalanffy also was groping as he wrote General Systems Theory. Between pages 1 and 259 you read many interesting things, but if asked at the end to articulate the fundamental principles of general systems theory, you might be embarrassed. There is nothing here for the mind to take firm hold of, no basic insight from which to build a theory--no universal law of gravitation, no axioms of probability, no fundamental theorem of algebra, not even a grand hypothesis, like random-mutation/natural-selection. A \\"general theory\\" of anything is difficult to imagine without such a foundation, which is perhaps why General Systems Theory in the end leaves you feeling undernourished.Even the mathematical part is unsatisfying. Chapter 3, \\"Some System Concepts in Elementary Mathematical Consideration,\\" purports to present quantitative tools. \\"For illustration, we choose a system of simultaneous differential equations,\\" explains the author. But the equations are written in an entirely abstract and thoroughly general fashion, to the point that, if you're familiar with systems of differential equations, the presentation is pat; if not, it's opaque. And once the general solutions are presented, there is no attempt to solidify understanding through examples. This is an exposition for the mathematically conversant in whom intuition is already well developed. There is no attempt to edify the layman.Even when an opportunity to edify presents itself, the author abandons it. For example, in asserting the similarity of \\"system laws\\" in different sciences, he cites (p. 81) what must be a fascinating case were it explained. \\"[T]here are hardly processes more unlike phenomenologically and in their intrinsic mechanisms than the formation of a whole animal out of a divided sea-urchin...and gestalt perception in psychology. Nevertheless, the principles governing these different phenomena show striking similarities.\\" Indeed, the reader anticipates being struck, looks forward to it even. Alas, in vain: the very next sentence moves on to an example concerning the evolution of Germanic languages, equally curious, equally unelaborated.It doesn't take long, in fact, to figure out that von Bertalanffy isn't writing to you, the reasonably intelligent and interested non-specialist. He is writing to a particularly rarified stratum of humanity, rare even in the halls of elite universities. He is writing as a Renaissance Man to other Renaissance Men, those to whom neither systems of differential equations, nor corporal regeneration of sea-urchins, nor gestalt psychology, nor linguistics need be explained. This is apparent from the examples cited above, from von Bertalanffy's habit of referring to scientific results merely by citing an author (e.g., \\"the machine concept of Ashby\\"), and from his occasional use of German, French, and Latin with neither translation nor apology.But one has to wonder: If the intended audience was a bunch of academics for whom explanations are unnecessary, why write the book? At the time of his writing (late 1960's) von Bertalanffy seemed to be looking for a science that could deconstruct biological, behavioral, and social systems--he mentions these three repeatedly--the way Newton deconstructed the mechanical universe. The motivation for this seemed to be, at least in part, a desire to transcend the seemingly heartless rationality of the mechanical view, a view that (p. 49) \\"found its expression in a civilization which glorifies physical technology that has led eventually to the catastrophes of our time.\\"\\"What is lacking...is knowledge of the laws of human society, and consequently a sociological technology. So the achievements of physics are put to use for ever more efficient destruction; we have famines in vast parts of the world while harvests rot or are destroyed in other parts; war and indiscriminate annihilation of human life, culture, and means of sustenance are the only way out of uncontrolled fertility and consequent overpopulation. They are the outcome of the fact that we know and control physical forces only too well, biological forces tolerably well, and social forces not at all.\\"Von Bertalanffy did not articulate anything like the foundations of a \\"sociological technology\\" in General Systems Theory, and, unless I am very much behind times, I don't think anyone has done so since. Instead he seems to have accepted that the best he could do at the time was to lay down an historical marker reporting the state of things as he approached the end of his career, to provide an \\"unpretentious survey,\\" and \\"a sort of guide to research done in the field and to areas that are promising for future work.\\" General systems theory was then, and remains, \\"a field...which is still groping to find its correct foundations.\\""},{"Title":"General System Theory: Foundations, Development Applications","review":"This book is quite old now and shows some of its age. At the time the idea of system theory was new and invigorating although it still appears that the theory was not radically new by any means even then.Bertalanffy discusses the idea of a system mainly through dynamical systems in his early chapters but also discusses important issues such as open systems, teleology and the organism considered as a system. By no means does this remove the dogma of the reductionists but the whole idea can be incorporated within it by some adjustments and expansions of the original concept. In that sense it is still possible for a biologist to consider animals and plants as complex machines. Nothing in this book really forces anyone to onsider an alternative.On the other hand his later chapters from chapter 8 onwards discuss truly fascinating questions in psychology and the study of language especially noting the work of Whorf. It is these last chapters which make the book interesting. In its day it would have been something that evoked interest and fascination but now its the as yet unexplord aspects of the study of man which remain as they have always been an enigma and a source of endless wonder.A book for the development of system ideas."},{"Title":"General System Theory: Foundations, Development Applications","review":"Biology rather than physics should be the basis for linking all the scienes together, seems to be to be the main message in this book.

The models we have to use are system models. Processes linked together in systems and sub-systems.

Needless to say, when I was in Ireland last (sadly, without my fridge), went into a bookstore and found this, Hawks' latest book, I bought it immediately. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a letdown. While I liked the book, I found that it drags and is much more directionless than his earlier books, although the reappearance of a lost love at the very end does provide the book with a convenient conclusion.The book essentially showcases Hawks' impracticality in purchasing a house in France with no preparation, and the subsequent adventures of getting it arranged as he would like. I did enjoy his adventures with the white vans of doom, but found the endless pontification on building his swimming pool to be decidedly tedious. The book comes in at 307 pages long, far longer than \\"Round Ireland With a Fridge,\\" and demonstrates a need for editing. The book wants to be about a man's search for significance in middle age, but the important messages the book delivers (and to Hawks' credit, the messages are in there) are buried under layers of minutiae that are neither particularly interesting or amusing.I did like the book, but not nearly as much as Hawks' earlier, more focused, books. I would recommend this book to fans of the earlier works, but I would recommend all of Hawks' earlier books first."},{"Title":"A Piano in the Pyrenees: A Coming-of-Age Adventure in the South of France","review":"Fantastic book, very well written & entertaining.But be careful, if you have a sensitive disposition & want to avoid making any kind of public scene - make sure you read it in private. This book is laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"A Piano in the Pyrenees: A Coming-of-Age Adventure in the South of France","review":"Normally when I say I'm looking for a book by Tony Hawks, sales clerks usually assume I mean the skateboarder. Ever since reading \\"Round Ireland With a Fridge\\" several years ago, I have looked forward to Hawks' continued forays into weird and irreverent travel schemes. So I was pleasantly surprised to find \\"A Piano in the Pyrenees\\" recently. While not as travel-based (and therefore contest-driven) as his previous works, it is a pleasing and funny read, especially since fans can witness the maturation process of this creative jack of all trades (well, at least a little bit).Never the one to do things that others would consider sane or to make great deliberations about important decisions, \\"A Piano in the Pyrenees\\" finds Hawks spontaneously buying a house in a small town in the French mountains where he can practice the piano and escape from the rat race of London life. His friends think it an ill-advised purchase, especially when confronted with the prospect of moving his piano from one country to another. However, luck (at least in terms of the house) seems to be in Hawks' cards and he quickly finds himself accepted as the odd, slightly famous English bachelor in the neighborhood. Now if only he could find the woman of his dreams.For fans of his other works, \\"A Piano in the Pyrenees\\" has Hawks' trademark wry humor and effervescent writing. There is much more soul-searching and philosophizing than there has been in his previous books as Tony confronts what it is he truly wants out of life. Therefore, while highlighting several aspects of the French Pyrenees and the surrounding area, this is truly not a travel book nor even what one could rightfully consider travel writing. But for those of us not lucky enough to have a house in the French mountains in which to tinker at the piano, we can live vicariously through Tony's unique, funny, and sometimes ill-advised experiences."},{"Title":"A Piano in the Pyrenees: A Coming-of-Age Adventure in the South of France","review":"From reading Tony's previous work i had expected something funny, clever andentertaining but it was not any of these. Perhaps he's taking a new direction into light, unfunny travelogues. If so i would recommend he not do so."},{"Title":"A Piano in the Pyrenees: A Coming-of-Age Adventure in the South of France","review":"I liked Tony Hawk's Round Ireland with a fridge and often burst out laughing reading that. But I could hardly raise a titter with this one. I've read better blogs, which this reads rather like. The funniest para is one in which he describes a form from the local French Mayor which is an application for permission not to need permission to build a swimming pool - &lt;smirk> I like Hawks as a racantoer and personality but if this was his first book I doubt it would have got anywhere."},{"Title":"A Piano in the Pyrenees: A Coming-of-Age Adventure in the South of France","review":"This is his best book yet. Finally, one of his adventures turned into a true human adventure. He actually touches on the deeper side of life - culture, friendship, love, loneliness and the importance of each to our true selves. I laughed, I teared up and I felt pure jealousy. In his former books I felt nothing more than, \\"when will this book end?\\" I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story with real character yet wants to be entertained at the same time. Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"enemy in the promised land: an egyptian woman's journey into israel","review":"I have so thoroughly enjoyed reading this book it was difficult to put it down until the very last word.This is the story of a young Egyptian Moslem woman, from a very wealthy family who became obsessed with Israel. She left her postgraduate studies at Harvard and went to Israel for a six-week visit that lasted three years. This all happened in the mid 70's before Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and Egypt's peace with Israel.Sana Hassan delved into numerous aspects of Israeli society. She lived on traditional Kibbutz and on \\"progressive\\" Kibbutz; she lived amongst new immigrants from the former Soviet Union and elsewhere learning Hebrew, Judaism and life in Israel, she went through the process of how Israel receive new arrivals. She lived in ordinary apartments in Tel Aviv and amongst the cultural elites in Jerusalem. She also managed to pass herself as a Jew and worked in Israeli factories and restaurants and allowed herself to be recruited into religious orthodox ways. Sana Hassan managed to get herself everywhere imaginable in Israel and the occupied territories.Sana succeeded in interacting with every possible segment of Israeli Society, politically, culturally, religiously and ethnically. From tea with Golda Meir at her house, lunch with Begin at the Knesset, and dinner with The Sharons all the way to meetings with pimps and prostitute as part of her volunteer work as a social worker. She managed to see more of Israel, perhaps than the vast majority of Israelis ever will.The portrayal of the Israeli society is that of a country full of contradictions and racist attitudes. We see the lowly state of Eastern Jews and an almost pervasive hierarchy based solely on racial origin and beliefs. She portrays the \\"subhuman\\" untouchable type status of the vast majority of the Israeli Arabs and the West Bank Palestinians. She portrays an Israel full of push and shove, of vulgar, inconsiderate people with unabashed racism.Sana Hassan also portrays an idealism, work ethic, warmth of ordinary people, capacity to love and learn and so much generosity. And yet, we see this hug mental barrier against admission or acceptance of the injustice befallen the Palestinians.We are also treated to two love affairs of Sana Hassan, one with a married Israeli army officer and a very passionate affair with another young woman who was her roommate at the progressive Kibbutz. I puzzled for days over Sana Hassan's inclusion of these two stories, which undoubtedly would have been very controversial in her conservative home country. An affair with a married officer and a Lesbian episode would undoubtedly dilute Sana Hassan's message of peace. After years of condemnation in Egypt, Sana Hassan was finally rehabilitated, why did she choose to shock again and upset sensibilities?Sana Hassan quest for peace was always personal, coming out of her inquisitive nature about Israel and things Jewish. From the days of her childhood when she was told off playing with an Israeli boy while on an Austrian holiday, from the unquestioning one sided media of Egypt, it was always a personal endeavor, she never pretended it to be on behalf of anyone else. I suspect for Sana Hassan, her on honesty and integrity were more important than acceptance and continued rehabilitation in conservative Egypt. She must have felt that she could not write about her experience in Israel without her affairs. Her recount of these stories certainly enriches the book and helps us understand her degree of assimilation and acceptance of the unthinkable.Sana Hassan developed an in-depth understanding of Zionism, history, thought and present day attitudes. She presented the process with which she seemed apparently unable to reconcile her acceptance of Israel's right to exist, with Israel's \\"right\\" to be Zionist. She presented herself throughout the book as an unwavering supporter of Palestinian rights. Yet, she admitted to being more troubled by her army officer connections to racist South Africa than his career as an IDF officer. She also seemed throughout the book willing to accept the possibility that her lover was planted by the intelligence service.With so much going on in her three years of Israel, you would expect a book written in simple straight forward story telling or even text style. That is not the case at all, Enemy In The Promised Land is so beautifully written. Sana Hassan is capable of great prose and lyrical descriptions of scenery, experiences and emotions, and most of all, of people. Her style comes across similar to the early work of Virginia Wolf, at times it seemed like she is even using similar words and phrases.This is not a straight forward book. It is the sort of book that will truly makes no one happy. It is a confusing book. If you allow yourself the benefit of \\"learning\\" while reading it, it may shake many established beliefs and strongly held opinions.Having read this book, I am absolutely certain of one thing. I will never never eat at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, the standards of hygiene at the restaurant were appallingly low. On most other issues, I am a lot less certain."},{"Title":"enemy in the promised land: an egyptian woman's journey into israel","review":"While the book contains many biographical and historical information, the book i s centered around three years the author, daughter of an Egyptian career diplomat, spent in Israel, long before Israel and Egypt established diplomatic relations. Israel, Hebrew and things Jewish have always held a fascination for the author, and she decided to visit Israel and see for herself what the country and its people are like. Ms. Hasan's visit to Israel met with family disaproval, a hostile Arab press and thr eats of imprisonment by her own government. Having withstood all these, the author's courage and strong will are even more note worthy.Right from the start, Ms. Hassan, the daughter of an Egyptian diplomat, impresse d me with her sincerity, humanity and powers of observation. Ms. Hassan encounters a very different reality from what she's read about Israel in the Arab media. \\"Ver y different\\" doesn't always mean better as it doesn't always mean worse. With envi able sensitivity, humour and humanity, Ms. Hassan is shares and disects her experienc es in the \\"promissed land\\".Ms. Hassan didn't enter Israel tabula rasa; She has many preconceived notions ab out the Arab-Israeli conflict, and those may or may not be different from those of h er readers. But she's very open and forthcoming in stating her views up front, and she's sincerely interested in opposing views. Her style of writing is neither preachy nor dogmatic, and so I think the book can be enjoyed by people with views different from her's.Her insights about life in Israel, the Israeli-Zionist ethos, and the various so cial strata she encounters are breath-taking. It's difficult to see how someone could acquir e such a profound understanding of Israel after such a short stay (3 years) in the country.During the three years the author spent in Israel, she underwent many experience s, some positive, some negative, some sad, and some just plainly bizzare. During th ose three years, the author has occassion to discover what Israel is really like -- to a celebrity, to an annonymous tourist, to a newly immigrated Jew, etc. She meets w ith people, is exposed to their views and feelings and fears. She finds friendship i n Israel, and love. She's also exposed to the uglier sides of life in Israel -- to the rac ism and the poverty, to the facist-militarist mind-set so many people here seem to hold, she meets, lives and works with the underprivilages -- people working in factories, a hotel kitchen, kids in a reform school. The author, Ms. Hassan, has been exposed both to the touristy side of the promissed land as well as to the less flashy, more mund ane sides.Throughout the book, Ms. Hassan retains her curiousity and optimism and most importantly -- her sense of humour. She's very self-critical throughout the book , demonstrating again and again how her own premises about Israel are undergoing constant revision and change.Her basic attitude is intellectual, positively generous and humane. This doesn't mean that she changes all her views by the end of the book, nor does it mean that she converts everyone to her side. It does mean, however, that while she's an intens ly political and intensly intellectual person, she's also able to relate to people, to see their side (even if she disagrees with it), to show ampathy and compassion for o thers, and to see their needs and fears and motives.As an Israeli, I found that Ms. Hassan's book certainly held a mirror up to my f ace, to let me see Israeli existance from a different angle. Unlike the other reviewer, I don't think that this mirror is the least bit distorted. I found the book inspiring, a nd I think that it's important reading material for Israelis at home and abroad, Jews every where interested in Israel or contemplating aliyah, and all others that would like to see Israel-as-it-is -- de-mystified, cleared of any romanticism, but still -- comple x, tricky, sometimes ugly and sometimes very beautiful.All in all, the book was a delight to read, and I'm sure I'll re-read it again."},{"Title":"enemy in the promised land: an egyptian woman's journey into israel","review":"First of all, I am a high school student who is extremely pro-Israel. I spend most of my free time writing to people about Israel.Ok, I picked up this book in my school library while looking for books on Israeli politics. I expected her to come into it hating Jews/Israel and coming out of it loving Israel. Boy was I wrong.What amazed me was that, despite her hating Zionists and Israelis, she went to Israel and managed to live there for an extremely long period of time.For any pro-Israel person, read this book. It really allows you to walk a mile in the other persons shoes. I had always seen Israel as a place where everything was happy and good. But, this showed me how Israel is just like any other country. Danny also amazes me, as some people say that Israel is worse then South Africa was during apartheid. Here is a South African in Israel. I LOVED THE BOOK!!!

I can sum this book in a single word.Megan Diamond was a shy little girl, who was working on becoming invisible. No one really noticed her until the day a new girl transferred into Megan's grade one classroom and smiled at her. That smile changed her life.Jen Lovett was everything Megan wasn't. Outgoing, reckless and confident, but when the two girls met, there was an instant connection.When Jen is abducted off her bike right in front of her, Megan's whole life changes.This story is about the aftermath of tragedy and how people cope with pain in their lives.Oddly enough, this book isn't at all depressing, and I should know. I \`m incredibly affected by what I read, and I try to avoid depressing books(or what I call Oprah books). I absorb mood and tension through the pages and I just don't have time to spend three days in bed, depressed, after reading a book. So, after reading the back cover of \`A Window to the World', I wondered if I'd spend three or five days locked in my room with kleenex.When I finished the last page, all I could think was, WOW. The book was beautiful. I think the reason it worked so well for me, was that it dealt with pain as a part of life, just like happiness is only one part. It wasn't a mellow-dramatic recounting of a tragedy, designed to manipulate emotions, it was a clear, overhead view of how pain and tragedy fit into life. It's seamless. The threads of happiness and joy blend with the threads of sorrow to make something that is stronger than either could be alone.I was talking to a friend of mine a few days ago. She just finished her last round of chemo and radiation for breast cancer. We sat there and we talked about how her life has changed in the year since discovering she had cancer. It did change her life, no doubt about that. I hesitated before asking her what I really wanted to know, but finally I just blurted it out. \`If you could change this past year, and make it so that none of this had ever happened, would you do it?' That sounds like a silly question to some, the obvious answer being yes, of course, who wants cancer, but she thought about it carefully for a moment before she answered.\`We spend our entire lives trying to avoid pain, but pain, and how we deal with it, is what makes us who we are. If nothing bad ever happened, there would be no reason to thank God for our blessings, or cling to him in our weakness. So no, I wouldn't change a thing.'That's the same thing I took away from this book. Pain is a part of the world we live in and of who we are, as much as happiness and love are.I highly recommend this book, and applaud Susan Meissner for writing so eloquently what is almost impossible to put into words."},{"Title":"A Window to the World","review":"Susan Meissner's newest book has followed suit with the first-Excellent. She makes it so easy to connect with the characters. Even if you haven't had the exact experience as Megan had when she was little, we all have things in our past that changed our lives forever and affect who we are today. Written with such compassion, emotion, and down to earth reality, it's an easy read that you won't want to put down. I've lost a lot of sleep staying up to read yet another great book by Susan Meissner."},{"Title":"A Window to the World","review":"Women's fiction isn't my usual read but this book kept me just as riveted as the suspense novels I love so well.I would say Ms. Meissner's strong suit is story and characters.

Through her pen, Susan made them live and breathe.Read this with a warning: Tears will be shed, (yes, that means yours.)A Window to the World is an emotional story of love, loss and hope. An ideal book for best-friends or sisters to read together."},{"Title":"A Window to the World","review":"Susan Meissner brings sense into a senseless world in this beautiful book. After Megan, the main character, witnesses her best friend being kidnapped, she becomes strongly attached to her best friend's brother, even though his values are very different from her own. There are many twists and turns and little surprises that make it almost impossible to set the book down. I look forward to sharing it with my daughter."},{"Title":"A Window to the World","review":"A Window to the World by Susan Meissner tells the story of a young girl, Megan Diamond, who begins as a shy, insecure, friendless youngster until she discovers a friend, Jen Lovett, who possesses her exact opposite characteristics. However, tragedy strikes, and Megan finds herself wondering how she should cope. Although she is a Christian, her faith is challenged and then strengthened as she learns to release the pain of the tragic event and to focus her life, not on the past, but on God.The novel is written in a simple style, making it easy to read. Yet, although the book can be read in a short time, the characters are effectively described so that they appear to be real, not merely flat and two-dimensional. They act, and react, in very realistic ways.The main character Megan only comes out of her shell after she meets Jen Lovett. Megan is timid, quiet, and attends Sunday school regularly, whereas Jen is vocal, confident and often questions God and how He works. Nevertheless, when Jen is kidnapped, Megan becomes lost in a swirl of fear, confusion, and a faint hope that Jen will return. She once again withdraws into her shell, opening up only to Jen's brother and an elderly woman, Adele. As she grows older, Megan finally stops behaving as if the kidnapping occurred only moments ago, as opposed to years ago, and moves on, allowing God to lead her life instead of being dominated by the memories of Jen. As time passes, she finally recognizes all of the blessings that she received because of the tragedy; blessings she would never have experienced without Jen's disappearance.I enjoyed A Window to the World, not only for its plot, but also because it was easy for me to identify with the characters. At times, one can be as uncertain as Megan and begin to doubt the actions of God. All people can understand the trials of being an indirect victim of a tragedy and feeling at a loss as to how to cope. But this novel also gives a sense of hope, a sense that God is in complete control of every situation, but that He requires our trust and faith. I would recommend this novel to Christian readers, especially those who may struggle with allowing God to take control of troubles in life. -- Naomi Sloan, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"A Window to the World","review":"This was a powerful book.

This pretty much follows the formula in that book.Here, young, reasonably healthy adults enter the hospital for seemingly routine minor surgery and end up dying while hospitalized. Our intrepid medical examiner senses that there is something wrong afoot, as she takes notice of this but cannot initially ascertain what the problem is. As the death toll mounts up, Laurie knows that the law of probability is against these deaths being accidental. She thinks that there is a serial killer afoot, but she does not know how or why. More galling to her is the fact that no one seems to share her concerns initially, although she does confide her concerns to Detective Saldano. Unfortunately, his hands are tied, because the medical examiner's office is not classifying these deaths as homicides.Set against the backdrop of this medical conundrum is the personal angst Laurie is suffering because of the reluctance of Jack Stapleton, her long term significant other and fellow medical examiner, to commit to marrying her and having children. Since Laurie is forty three and her biological clock is in countdown mode, she won't take no for an answer this time. Consequently, she and Jack seem to be going their separate ways, and Laurie meets up with a another doctor, one who is in a successful private practice and seems smitten by Laurie.The author weaves a fine plot, even though the author's cookie-cutter characters and limp dialogue leave something to be desired.

I got the audio book from the library, and found the suspenseful story of two New York medical examiners fresh meat, since I can't remember reading any other novel with that kind of backdrop before.

Jazz, the attractive villain, was interesting and colorful as well.Overall I felt it could've been shorter and some of the dialogue seemed a little \\"too written\\", but George Guidall's keen audio book reading kept things from getting too bogged down.

Suddenly, they are inundated with young bodies that die for no apparent reason at Manhattan General Hospital. No matter how hard they try to find a reason, there is none whatsoever. This is because a serial killer, who is a nurse is within the hospital walls, and knows just how to kill patients with potassium injections, which is not traceable in the blood. Her name is Jazz. And she is hired by a no good orginization to kill these patients.If someone stands in her way, she kills them too, and both a head nurse and the chief administrator were on to her.

Dr. Laurie Montgomery, with the Coroner's office, has a hunch that these apparently random deaths are connected somehow, and are intentional. The readers are given the proof early from the viewpoint of the antagonist as each kill is anticipated, portrayed in detail, and relished, while Laurie works to discover the reason behind the unexplained deaths and the ultimate perpetrators behind the scheme. A few red herrings are tossed in to distract her as well as the reader.The author also brings back Dr. Jack Stapleton (from his book Vector) as her love interest and co-worker. Complicating Laurie's search for answers to the unexplained cardiac deaths are her relationship with Jack regarding commitment and children, with her parents, and coming to terms with personal medical issues.Dr. Cook provides detailed descriptions of hospital procedures and does not dumb-down terminology. His views about managed care, hospital politics, and the shortage of nurses are obvious as he repeatedly makes reference to them throughout the book.I found Marker to be a fast thrill ride; the conclusion thought provoking and ominous. It makes me want to opt for outpatient anything whenever possible, as did Coma."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I finally made it through the hold list at the library for Robin Cook's latest novel Marker. I'm never quite sure if I'm going to like or hate each of his novels, as the story lines seem to hit me as varying in quality. Marker is better than some of his other ones, and I enjoyed it. It's not without some nits in my opinion, however...Laurie Montgomery is a medical examiner at the city morgue. She starts running across a number of deaths that are unexpected and have no pathology to indicate their cause. Just perfectly healthy people dropping dead after routine procedures. Her suspicions start to move towards a serial killer loose in one of the local hospitals, but of course no one wants to hear or believe that. Amidst all of this turmoil, she's also got a number of personal crises issues to deal with, including a troubling genetic test and a relationship that's not going where she wants it to end up. As she slowly starts getting people to buy into her killer scenario, she ends up in a situation that just might make her the next victim...Overall, the story wasn't bad. It seemed to be a bit long in the middle, and I felt like we went through a few iterations of events that didn't advance the story at all. It was just activity for the sake of activity. The ending was great, in that I had to pick up my reading pace because I needed to find out how it all ended. My biggest problem was the agenda that Cook is pushing in the book. I'm not one much for personal crusades wrapped in popular fiction, and Cook seems to excel in that. In this story, he paints the managed care industry as the evil boogieman, with genetic testing being the final invasion of our personal privacies. While there are issues there to be sure, the \\"insurance is evil, doctors are good\\" theme got to be much too heavy for my likings.Fun read, and perhaps the underlying theme will resonate more with you than it did for me.

Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton. Their romance is on the rocks but their professional lives are still entwined through the chief medical examiner's office. Laurie is suspicious when she is charged with performing autopsies on the bodies of these two healthy young people who died at the same hospital. It takes Jack a bit longer to acknowledge that something may be terribly amiss.When it becomes obvious that the deaths were carefully planned there can be little doubt that a knowledgeable, clever serial killer stalks hospital corridors. Although she may be seen as indefatigable, the tide turns when Laurie realizes that she may be the next victim.Leave it to Robin Cook to weave an absorbing story carrying rapt listeners to a totally unexpected closer.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I was apprehensive before reading this because of his recent novels, which were rather lackluster, but as it turns out this one wasn't so bad. Yes, it was definitely predictable. It was also a little too long (wordy?).It wasn't a struggle to get through because it was still fairly good entertainment."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This was an AWESOME Book/CD. It was long, but well worth the detail. Once again, Robin Cook pulls you into a book, gets your attention early and keeps it. I HIGHLY recommend it to add to your collection. Great writing, great reader of the book on CD and everything flows very well!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I've enjoyed several of Robin Cooks' previous medical thrillers, but Marker is a medical yawn. The dialogue is ridiculous and almost embarrassing to read. The plot is even worse and everything about it is entirely predictable.Cook, for example, gives a coy leadup to an important development in the life of the protagonist. Or I guess he probably thought it was coy, but the development is entirely obvious from the beginning. And when a character (a trained medical professional, presumably) develops sharp abdominal pains in the \\"lower right quadrant\\" I immediately thought \\"ectopic pregancy,\\" and I'm just a computer programmer.At the climax, a character falls victim to the Bad Guys although this character doesn't fit the profile of the other victims -- and this profile is central to the plot's development. The whole premise underlying the story falls way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief for the novel -- there simply is no way to predict the costs that can be recovered by eliminating the risks, because the risks still can't be measured in spite of what Cook attempts to explain. I don't doubt there can be evil actuaries involved in health care, but I don't see how they can gain with the methods described in Marker."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I picked this book up because it was a guaranteed read. I figured that if the publisher was going to guarantee it, it must be good. They were wrong!! It was too long & too predictable. If you've read all or most of Robin Cook's novels as I have, you'll know what I mean. He has written too many novels where the managed care, insurance companies, or else the pharmaceutical companies are the bad guys. It's time for some new subject matter. I also had a hard time believing that a medical examiner could figure out that there was a serial killer on the loose after only doing two victim's autopsies and seeing that there was a pattern. I love the early Robin Cook novels, and everytime a new one comes out I buy it hoping that his writing has gotten back to like it used to be, and then I'm disappointed that it's not. Maybe in the future I need to just save my money."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Here's a snippet of dialog from the African-American Warren character, who is \\"a powerfully built, gifted athlete as well as the de facto leader of the local gang.\\" (p 91) The main character asked who might be expected to show up for a neighborhood basketball game. Warren replied:\\"We got rained out last night, so thewhole gang is going to show up. So getyour kicks and get that white XXX ofyours out here on the double. Otherwise,you'll be standing around holding yourXXXX. Catch my drift?\\"\\"Get your kicks\\"? \\"On the double\\"? \\"Catch my drift\\"? \\"The gang\\"? Is this Happy Days or McHale's Navy? The Jack character answers that in the next line; \\"Jack flashed back a thumbs-up.\\""},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Terrible, terrible book. Awful writing; stilted dialogue, descriptions that emphasize absurd unneccesary details. As another reviewer said, if you notice the writing you know it's bad. So many examples to choose from....\\" 'That one,' he said, using his index finger to point to the item in question.\\"(that's a paraphrase; as I'm listening to the audiobook, I don't have the text.) Using his index finger? As opposed to what, his knee? Who cares? Or a description of a detective putting on his tie by putting the loop on over his head, since \\"he hadn't untied it before when he undressed.\\" No point, has nothing to do with anything, goes nowhere, just breaks the (not very smooth anyway) flow of the story. Or characters saying \\"My word!\\" Do you know anyone who says that?? There's more than one in this book. These are minor examples, but are characteristic of the awful, amateurish writing. And since Robin Cook is anything but an amateur, surprising! The audio version is read by George Guidall; I know that he is a popular reader, but not with me. He makes the characters even more unbelievable than they would be anyway, and often sounds rather condescending. Particularly the way he reads women's voices, with a kind of simper. Predictable but unbelievable story, badly written, badly read."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"We know the \\"who.\\" We know the \\"how.\\" The mystery in this medical detective story is in the \\"why.\\" Unfortunately, when that answer is revealed near the closing pages of this otherwise compelling \\"read,\\" the answer is so implausible as to amount to a small betrayal of the reader's time and trust. That is unfortunate, since \\"Marker\\" has much going for it, including plausible and likeable characters, believable human situations, and a fast-moving narrative that keeps the pages turning.The story involves a series of sudden, unexpected deaths of young, healthy, post-surgical patients at a New York City teaching hospital. These capture the attention of Dr. Laurie Montgomery, a forensic pathologist working in the medical examiner's office, who tries to piece together an understanding of the forces at work in this series of cases. The reader knows, as Laurie comes to suspect, that the deaths are homicides. Of course no one believes her; the casualties continue to mount, and she is unable to explain the sinister mechanism or reasons for them. As the puzzle continues to occupy her professional attention, Laurie also must cope with a series of troublesome and believable personal problems that inevitably place her squarely within the killer's gunsights. The climax of the story is well-told, riveting and satisfying.The novel has some significant flaws. First and foremost, it is polemical. The author explains in an afterword that his story was conceived to address the dangers that he perceives in the dual ascendance of managed care and genomics. The latter holds infinite promise. The former is profit-seeking and pernicious. As the saying goes, if you buy the premise, you buy the bit. If you don't, the book turns preachy despite itself.Secondly, the novel requires the willingness to believe that a modern healthcare facility would ignore a series of unexplained deaths. As a physician, the author knows better; he knows that governmental agencies and accrediting organizations require a probing and thorough root cause analysis of any individual \\"sentinel event\\" such as the several deaths portrayed in this novel. He either assumes that he can ignore this fact because the general public is unaware of it, or he believes somewhat more cynically that his readers would not expect it or believe it. The true manner that such deaths would be handled unfortunately gets in the way of a good yarn, and so the facts must be overlooked. This is a disservice to the reader.The third area of criticism is the writing. The author has mastered plotting and is very good at maintaining the narrative flow. However, it becomes apparent from time to time that he learned to dictate like a doctor before he learned to write like a novelist. When jargon intrudes, which it does with some frequency, it tends to have a hollow clinking sound. The characters exsanguinate and become moribund a bit too often for my taste. The dialogue frequently seems a bit wooden, as though it is just a bridge between plot points rather people speaking to one another. From time to time the exposition of the plot is telescoped into discursive prose where a more polished and confident writer might use more imaginative means of expression.These criticism aside, this is a good summer reading book with lots of action, and it is a (surgical) cut above most of the rest."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This book was very predictable if you have read Coma. Nothing new. I cannot imagine how the heroes did not suspect Potassium in the deaths.What medical examiners office would not notice a pattern in so many deaths?What physician would ignore the classic signs of ectopic pregnancy?How stupid did the Hero have to be to leave the Heroine alone in a suspect murder hospital?I know people need to make these decisions so an actual story can exist but please do not insult your readers this way.Sometimes I like it when an author lets me figure out who did it way before the Hero figures it out but this time it was too predictable and 300 pages too long."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"although quite lengthy in his descriptions, the premise for this novel is quite intriguing and certainly not beyond the capabilities of those involved in running the HMOs presently in existence. worth the read to see what you think!!!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I like Robin Cook but I'm sure I've read this story (or something similar) before. I found myself reading the copyright page a few times to be sure that it wasn't a re-release of an older book. It was so predictable that the insurance company was the culprit. Where did I read this subplot in the past?I also noticed a few mistakes that I found a bit bothersome. On page 214 was Lou's response \\"That just shows to go you...\\" a mistake or an inside joke? I thought it might have been a joke until I got to page 258 and read \\"Not once has there been any hesitation and excuses like we've had to put up with with all the others.\\" I again had to wonder if the double \\"with\\" was printed on purpose. However on page 400 I found a definite mistake. \\"They described prepping the operative site, prescribing anything by mouth after midnight...\\" \\"ANYTHING\\" No, no, no...it should be NOTHING by mouth after midnight.There were a few other incidents that I wondered about such as Jack donating his blood and rather or not NPO meant ice chips or not. All in all an interesting, if not predictable book. Plus it is still driving me crazy trying to remember where I read this plot before."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Once upon a time, I was a HUGE fan of Cook's medical thrillers. But how thrilling can a book be when 50 pages in you can figure out every detail of who dunnit and why? The characterizations in this story are ultra-thin stereotypes as well. Formula writing doesn't work. Mr. Cook needs to take a breather and write something completely different, as have James Patterson and John Grisham. Heck...*I* could have written this book, it's so predictable!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Well, I'm off of Cook permanently I think. I adored his earlier books-Coma was a benchmark for medical thrillers. But I can't possibly imagine anyone talking as his characters (Jack, Laurie and all the rest) do. His characters, while likable, are totally one dimensional. It falls into the thriller category only because we knew who the murder was, but not sure of how the individual would be caught. Otherwise I'd just consider it dull."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Surprisingly, I love this book. Robbin Cook's became my favorite author !

For a medical \\"thriller\\" this book was almost devoid of any suspense.The book is almost 500 pages long, but by page 60 I had already worked out the entire plot, except for a few minor uninteresting details.As soon as the reader is told that the main protaganist has a certain \\"marker\\" and you realise that young, otherwise healthy people are dying under a new healthcare programme, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the plot.I was hoping against hope that there was some sort of twist towards the end, sadly it never came.Add to that some very one-dimensional characters who take forever to spring into action, stilted dialogue and a strangely dated feel, and \\"Marker\\" becomes a very tedious read.And one more thing, did we have to be told about Laurie Stapledon's issues with male authority figures every 3 pages?"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"The author is pushing Hillarycare (government controlled health care) solution. He absolutely makes no sense. Here are the reasons: (1) It is impossible to have a top-down wide conspiracy described in the book and maintain a secrecy at the same time. (2) Only total idiots would even try. Obviously, the author thinks that the people that manage hospitals are idiots. It only proves that he is. (3) The author (as all liberals) thinks that he has a monopoly on morality. He, therefore, describes all the opponents of Hillarycare as immoral. (4) Most importantly, the alleged villains (at the very top) simply have no motivation to do what they allegedly did - risk their life and reputation for no gain at all. The alleged gain is to reduce the premiums for all the subscribers by killing the subscribers with genetic diseases. It would take on average 10-30 years for these diseases to develop. Why would anybody at the top of hospital organization care about the increased operating costs 10--30 years from now?"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Will Robin Cook ever run out of ideas? His latest, Marker, is typical Cook. Fast paced, lots of twists and false leads, passion, love, and danger. Yup, Cook at his best.In Marker, mysterious deaths follow routine and not very serious surgeries even though the victims are young and healthy. In fact, enough of these deaths occur to attract the attention of Laurie Montgomery, a New York City medical examiner. Laurie becomes convinced that something is amiss and does her best to enlist the help of Jack Stapleton, who she has a bit of a relationship with.With the medical mystery as the primary focus, Cook also manages to further develop the love affair between Laurie and Jack who is, if anything, luke warm about a full blown relationship.Since reading Coma, I have been an avid Cook fan. Lets face it, Cook gives us what we read fiction for...a good yarn, believable characters, intelligent plots, and enough twists to keep a taffy factory going for years.You'll love this book."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"\\"Marker\\" sees the return of two medical examiners from a previous Robin Cook novel. Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton's personal relationship is on the rocks because Jack is afraid to commit to marriage with Laurie, whose biological clock is ticking and who wants to start a family. To add to her stress, Laurie discovers that she has a genetic marker that significantly raises the probability she will eventually have breast cancer. As a distraction from their personal problems, Laurie and Jack become involved in a series of autopsies on surgical patients who died of cardiac failure in spite of being young and relatively healthy. Laurie learns of a similar series of deaths in another hospital. She suspects they are all related, but is unable to convince anyone else that these may be homicide cases.Robin Cook became a pioneer in the medical thriller genre with his book \\"Coma.\\" Since then he has written many other medical thrillers, most of which follow a plot formula that ensures lots of suspense and a bit of medical education thrown in as a bonus. \\"Marker\\" follows the typical Cook formula: an enthusiastic medical professional is a witness to a series of mysterious deaths in a medical environment, suspects foul play, and in the pursuit of the perpetrators, is put in jeopardy him/herself. The medical lesson here is about the DNA markers in our genetic makeup that control not only the functioning of our physiological processes, but also their malfunction. In an afterword, Cook discusses the mapping of the human genome, and then presents the uses, both good and bad, that could arise from knowledge of the genetic markers that predict our future health. This is a fast-paced, suspenseful novel with two likable characters and some romantic interest thrown into the mix. Recommended.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Robin Cook, the reigning king of the medical thriller, returns New York City medical examiners, Laurie Montgomery and her lover, Jack Stapleton (previously seen in his earlier novel \\"Vector\\") to centre stage. Montgomery autopsies a mysterious string of unwarranted post-surgical cardiac arrests for which she is unable to formulate any reasonable explanation. Her fertile imagination makes the leap to hypothesizing a demented serial killer stalking the halls of Manhattan General, a well respected tertiary care teaching hospital recently taken over by the HMO giant, AmeriCare. At every turn, despite an obviously rising death toll, Laurie is met with skepticism, institutional political resistance and even direct orders to keep her unsubstantiated and possibly libelous speculations to herself.Cook's continuing mastery of the ability to create suspense and to convey the complexity and urgency of the daily running of a major metropolitan hospital, the medical examiner's office, an autopsy, a surgery, a \\"code blue\\" and emergency room trauma provide more than enough reasons to keep the pages turning smartly into the wee hours.But there were definitely cracks in the wall that made \\"Marker\\" a much less satisfying novel than Cook's earliest works such as \\"Coma\\" or \\"Blindsight\\".The identity of the killer, nurse Jasmine \\"Jazz\\" Rakoczi, is known almost from the opening pages. It was never a matter of \\"who\\", only a question of \\"why\\"! While the characters of Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton are developed in depth with care and a completely believable and quite moving pathos, Rakoczi is a stereotypical cardboard villain - a cartoon caricature of the nasty bad guy that is at best weak and at worst almost laughable. As a cautionary tale against a possible macabre result of the continuing business takeover of the US medical health care system, \\"Marker\\" is left frustratingly open ended.Robin Cook's fans will still enjoy this one but it's probably not the best place for a potential new reader to take the first dip into the pool.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"If you're a fan of medical mysteries, this is a must read. Robin Cook is on top of his game as he brings back the Pathology team of Jack Stapleton and Laurie Montgomery to solve the cases of mysterious deaths of apparently healthy patients (sound familiar, doesn't it). That's not to say Cook resurrects old material - sinister health insurance companies and medical procedures are a big part of this novel, but the author has the talent to breathe new life into old plot lines. The sub plots of Laurie's medical problems and the \\"bad guy\\" (one hell of a nasty nurse) are anything but distracting. Not wanting to spoil the ending for anyone, but chapter 24 has got to be one of the most exhilarating pages Cook has ever written. Perfect summer time entertainment."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This is yet another high impact medical thriller from the master Robin Cook. As always, he grabs readers right from the start and doesn't let go until you are begging for more. This book was especially interesting to me as I am a Nurse and the afterword he wrote really touched my heart. Cook knows how it is in the medical field and is true to the life in his writing of how stressful and chaotic it is. His characters are well rounded and you really feel you know them. The only complaint I have about the book is I felt the ending was abrupt and he could have expanded his options with the characters a bit more, but all in all, this book is highly recommended, especially to those of you who work in a medical setting. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"i read marker. i enjoy robin cooks writing very much. he keeps me turning the pages till i am done. also, he writes in a way to make you think about what your reading. this book is about hmo's and how they affect the medical field. it also makes you WONDER and THINK...is this actually happening. can this actually happen. i would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about suspense and the medical field."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I picked this book up because the cover claimed that this author was \\"the master of the medical thriller.\\" He may have been the master at one time but this is CLEARLY no longer the case.I am a board-certified genetic counselor and have seen hundreds of patients for cancer risk counseling and testing. Dr. Cook's portrayal of this process in this book is horribly inaccurate and patronizing to boot. He makes no mention of genetic counseling and his portrayal of the process of counseling and testing is inaccurate as is his description of the lab test (no one uses a microarray or SNPs for BRCA testing). When I find obvious mistakes in a book, I always wonder what other inaccuracies the book contains.In addition to the inaccuracies, this book is simply too long. The editor could easily have chopped off one hundred pages. I would suggest that they start chopping the seriously ridiculous dialogue! THe characters are trite and self-absorbed and some of the subplotting is absurd (a medical doctor abdominal pain wouldn't think of an ectopic pregnancy?!?).All in all, I found this book a huge disappointment and won't be buying any other books by this author."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I was really excited when I picked up this book, as I've enjoyed his books in the past, and really like medical thrillers.

When it didn't, I skipped to the end, hoping to entice myself into keep reading. No such luck.Maybe when I finish the book I'm currently reading & can't put down, I'll try this one again.

You can skip this one."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Seemingly healthy patients are dying after routine surgery at Manhattan General hospital and the only person who seems to think it is a problem is Medical Examiner Dr. Laurie Montgomery. The reader is forced to suspend belief pretty quickly in this book-- why is it that the six mysterious deaths do not cause a blip on the hospital's weekly mortality conference- which I presume they have. And why didn't the six similar deaths that occurred earlier at another hospital become a blip in the radar of that hospital?Okay, leaving that aside, why didn't anybody notice that all of the victims had the same health insurance? That is something that should have been glaringly obvious since Laurie was desperately looking for something in common between them.Okay, I'll leave that aside too. Is this a good mystery? Not particularly. The reason for the mysterious deaths was fairly predictable, although the murderess was certainly an interesting character. I still have to wonder why nobody ever made the connection that all the victims died on her shift in places and why, with her prickly personality, she managed to last as long as she did in the hospital without being fired.There is also a back story going on in this book in which the relaitonship between Dr. Laurie Montgomery and her lover, Dr. Jack Stapleton, deteriorates because of Jack's refusal to discuss or even consider the possibility of marriage. Laurie's biological clock is ticking and she wants a baby NOW. Things get further complicated when she discovers that she carries a genetic marker for a high risk of breast and uterine cancer. And once again, I am forced to suspend belief when Laurie gets pregnant because she \\"miscounted\\" her days. What? No birth control?The silent argument between Jack and Laurie continues throughout most of the book with each of them taking easy umbrage at anything the other says and with Laurie indulging in a fling with a doctor at Manhattan General. Several times during the book I just wanted to smack both of them and tell them to grow up!However, interspersed between the non-mystery and the soap opera relationship of Jack and Laurie, are some interesting autopsies of sudden deaths that initially look as though they were murders, but each ends up haviing a very unique, and natural cause. This leads me to think that if Robin Cook would get off his high horse about Managed Care (Okay, we get it, HMO's are BAD) and get back to the medical mysteries that he started with, then I could really get to enjoy this series again. As it is, this book is an okay diversion. I do appreciate that Laurie does not perform any of the stupid stunts that got her in trouble in previous books, and I think Cook's writing skills have improved over the years. Now if he could just get a new plot instead of repeating the same old one, I think we could have a book that would be truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I like the main character Laurie and I can empathize with her. I was thrown out of the story repeatedly though because of Dr. Cook's misinformation regarding fertility. Google fertility statistics for 43 year olds to see how improbable it is to conceive at this age without the help of fertility treatments and donor eggs. SPOILER ALERT: Laurie would have thoroughly researched this and concluded at the end to go ahead with some sort of fertility treatments or at least forced a conclusion to the romance one way or the other. Leaving them in a tentative truce re marriage and kids was lame. What's next? Laurie spontaneously conceiving at age 48 in the next book? That book would need to be titled \\"Miracle\\"."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Dr. Laurie Montgomery and Dr. Jack Stapleton (see VECTOR) both work for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and off duty they are lovers living together although each has kept their own apartment.

One morning Laurie wakes up and realizes that at forty three she has very few child bearing years left and breaks it off with Jack.She throws herself into her work and she finds the case of a twenty-eight year old man very puzzling. He had a foot injury and died but there is no evidence what caused his death. When a woman who has had knee surgery dies for no apparent reason, Laurie begins to think that the two cases are related. When two more exact cases come in, Laurie begins to believe there is a serial killer operating in Manhattan General. As more cases pile up, the only thing the victims have in common is they were young, healthy and new subscribers to AmeriCare Health Insurance. Laurie investigates off the radar because the powers that be don't want to believe her and order her to keep her findings in house.Robin Cook has written another exciting trademark medical thriller that includes his opinion on the state of medical care in this country, the nursing shortage and the faults of the health care system which are all woven into a mesmerizing storyline. The heroine feels like the Lone Ranger as she struggles to get someone to listen to her and believe what she is saying. MARKER is another triumph for the grandmaster of medical thrillers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Marker is perhaps best measured against the 1993 Cook novel entitled \\"Fatal Cure.\\" I read them in reverse chronological order, and kept thinking Fatal Cure was awfully similar to another book I had read. It took awhile to think of the title of the other book (Marker) and then I had to look up the author here in Amazon. I was shocked that both were by Cook, as the theme is nearly identical. (Big Bad HMO builds profits by taking out potentially expensive patients.)All in all, Marker was the better book. I like the Jack & Laura story and relationship, and Marker was a twist in that we did always know \\"whodunit,\\" but we didn't know who was behind it or why. In Fatal Cure, we weren't even sure anybody was doing it until it all became clear in the last 50 or 70 pages.I like medical fiction. I like Robin Cook. And I liked Marker a lot. I guess I am just disappointed that he revisited this \\"Profit drives corporate murder\\" theme that I find pretty far-fetched in the first place. Let's be done with that one now. Perhaps we can move on to \\"Death Panels conspire to terminate seniors under Obamacare.\\" It would be a great read."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Laurie and Jack are forensic pathologists as well as a couple with a relationship on the rocks.

The rude dominating boss is a stock character along with the hard-drinking detective.Clearly, Cook writes popular, fast moving stories. This one is also enjoyable."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This is the first book I read by R. Cook. A compelling read, full of twists & turns when the two main characters, Laurie and Jack, come across a series of inexplicable deaths of healthy young people who just had successful, often minor, surgery.

Meanwhile, their personal life and realtionship are also at stake for a variety of reasons, mainly because Jack is hesitant to fully commit and start a family. At the same time, Laurie has a few nasty surprises regarding her health and it is at this point that she risks to become the next victim herself.....I liked this book and think it is a page turner. Some medical language is reported in an easy to read form and, coming from the author who's a doctor himself, I believe that it carries, beyond the fiction, a message for the public to look into certain issues about the present medical private insurance in the USA and not only."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"The book matched the description given and I received it in a timely manner. Thank you."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I used to really enjoy reading Robin Cook's novels. That said, this novel was horribly disappointing.The characters are decently developed, but the dialog is downright laughable.The author gives away too much of the plot. There is absolutely no build-up of suspense. We know from the beginning who is killing patients, you can roughly figure out why, and the fact that Cook is setting up the main female lead to get caught up in the middle of it is something my 16 month old nephew could have figured out.Overall, the book is a fun beach read, but definitely not up to the level of Cook's first medical suspense novels."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I used to think all those 1 sentence blurbs you find on bestsellers were put out by random word generators, but in the case of this book, they are all the truth. After so many years, Robin Cook has put out another bestseller worth the name.Spoilers ahead!OK, OK, there's only a finite number of ways patients can be killed, maimed, chased, terrified, cut, dissected, etc. in a hospital setting and they must have all been done already, e.g. illegal organ harvesting, corporate greed, etc. etc., and I am sure that this one (Marker) has been done before by some author in some book. Having said that Marker is still a great read. The book flowed so fast and easily that I was literally unable to put it down and was compelled to read it until I was done.Some random thoughts:1) Kudos to Robin Cook for writing so realistically from a female protagonist's point of view. I don't think that can be easily done. Of course he did it right from the beginning with Coma, and for the longest time I never knew if Robin Cook was a Mr. or Ms.2) Robin Cook shows himself once again to be a good writer. Marker is easy to read, the characters are well developed, and the book does not suffer from logical lapses. It's not til the very end that I wondered why the book was called Marker.3) For most of the book, what I thought was an irritating subplot turned out to be central to the story. I thought that was very neat.4) I have no idea why the author chose to let us see from JR's point of view. It didn't really add to the book, and it would have been much, much more suspensful and thrilling if he didn't. In fact, the story was made for it, because at one point you had all these suspects and all the main characters looked like they were going to be in danger from each one of them in turn. And if you didn't know who the bad guy was it would have been much more interesting. As it was we knew who it was and it was just a matter of when.5) The part at the end where the 2 guys were hauling the body and how the NewYawkers were responding was hilarious. Nice.6) There's what I'll call an editorial at the end of the book. After all these bestsellers, I guess he's entitled to it. I think Michael Crichton did one in one of his books too. Is this going to become a trend?Overall, after so many years Robin Cook shows us he can still put out a very, very good book.7) My personal rant. I refuse to buy any of these new tallback books which the publisher tells us are for easier reading. How? The print size is the same, you are just paying more for a bigger top and bottom margin. And the tallback is more difficult to keep open with one hand. It makes for harder reading, but it's an extra $2 in the publisher's pockets, so I refuse to buy any of them and just borrow them from the library or a friend, just like this one, sorry Robin.Afterward: I make it a point not to read other reviews until I've done mine, and I was shocked to see so many negative ones. I will concede one point. The ending isn't too believable. LOL, there is no need to kill patients to improve the bottom line. Health\\"Care\\" organisations have evolved 10,000 ways to deny or delay your claim. We never recieved your claim; it's a pre-existing condition; it's not covered; you're not covered; not medically necessary; not pre-authorized; not allowed on Mondays; needs referral from PCP; condition not recognized; coverage lapsed yesterday. Killing is just so lame."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Cook is a masterful writer that makes anyone very afraid to ever check into a hospital! In this one seemingly healthy young patients are dying of heart attacks after undergoing minor surgery. The only person who suspects they may be indicative of foul play is Laurie Montgomery in the coroner's office, who happens to be a favorite character of the author. We soon learn that a misfit hospital nurse is acting on the orders of a mysterious Mr. Bob and using a potassium solution to cause the patients to go into cardiac arrest.While Laurie is trying to unravel the mystery before more patients die, she is undergoing her own personal (problems with Jack Stapleton) as well as physical problems. Why I didn't give the book 5 stars is because you can figure out that Laurie's physical problems will lead to her having to have surgery in the hospital where the killer is working. On top of that a character that gets close to learning about the killer is killed through his own stupidity when he is supposed to be highly intelligent. Not to give anything away but when Jack is stupid just like that guy, he happens to escape the fate he should have gotten."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I've enjoyed quite a few of Cook's novels, primarily his earlier works, which were tight, inventive, and original medical thrillers. None of those adjectives define this book. First of all, the mechanism which drives the final plot twists is so very easy to figure out very early in the book. So, there's no surprising denoument in the end. This story is 538 pages in the hardcover edition (not including his Afterword). Easily a hundred of these pages, and probably more, should have been edited out of this book. I found myself skimming pages at a time as I was looking for the story to pick back up again after wading through the interminable (and boring) angst of the two lead characters plumbing their relationship in excruciatingly mind-numbing and repetitive detail. And every plot twist is depicted repetitively as each of three or four characters try to deduce the nature of the goings-on at a hospital stalked by a serial killer. In all honesty, I was barely able to finish this book. It was more out of curiousity about whether I'd correctly predicted the ending - which I had. It's almost literally a no-brainer. I simply can't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Why every book he wrote has to be with a Medicare problem? Maybe RC had some problems with them and stopped practicing and started writing. But reading too many books with Medicare problems is boring. Mind that I had read all of his books."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This was a pretty slow read ~ maybe it failed to hold my attention because the essentials of the plot have already been used as a story line by other writers. There were also just too many words that did little beyond fill space...tighter writing and editing would have improved the punch."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Complacent with the wealth engendered by his early and generally good novels, Robin Cook has contented himself with turning out some real duds. This one fits the pattern of his last dozen or so stories and is a most careless and tiresome effort. One has the impression that Dr. Cook simply started typing aimlessly and continued until an idea ocurred to him. Indeed, it takes nearly a hundred pages for something resembling a plot to emerge. However, the faint flicker of a story line is quickly extinguised by plodding prose, banal, ridiculous dialogue and largely irrelevant action which speeds along at a glacial pace culminating in a childishly predictable conclusion.This novel is not worth the effort it takes to lift it."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I usually like a book to start out with something that makes me want to turn the page....to continue reading. This book almost gets your interest, but is just too easy to put down. So if you like a thrilling read, turn to The Innocent by Harlan Coben, and put this book down."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"It's ok but I knew the outcome 100 pages in. Everything was too predictable. Also, as someone pointed out, why would an insurance company risk disolution to kill someone over the fact they have increased disease risk decades later when the individual wouldn't likely have the same HMO then anyway. I just expected more plot twist and surprises from Robin Cook. I was also disappointed when NYC doctors in 2006, who earlier in the book had access to the internet, couldn't figure out the meaning of MASNP or MEF2A. Jack had to go around to hospitals to find the definitions. This seems ridiculous. The book is worth reading but not great."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I would've asked for a refund, if that had been the case.I've read a couple of Cook's works before, and I enjoyed them enough to trust that I'd have a good time when I picked up Marker. Unfortunately, between now and the last time I read something of his, he'd apparently been crippled of his ability to write a page worth reading.I read this book from cover to cover, and the long and insipid ride from front to back was one filled with redundancy, tedium, a dearth of emotionally-gripping scenes, a predictable plot line, and, most annoying of all, having characterization shoved into my face and up my nose every other paragraph, to the point that I'll probably be sneezing poorly-written, tell-don't-show prose for about a month after having finished the bloody thing.Cook has the amazing power to repeat characterization information about a page after you'd already read it, to the point where it's just a daisy-chain of redundancy that drills soullesslly into your skull. I've read a lot of books, and this happens to be the only one that I can say I actively despise.The plot was dragging, the characters were paper-thin, and the plot twist? Predictable. I got the whole thing pieced out by page three hundred, and was rolling my eyes and bitter satisfaction when it was so thoroughly confirmed in the last five or six pages (which is another point of contention: I hate it when authors clear up their plot threads in such a last-minute affair, it's such awful storytelling). Any and all attempts to elicit sympathy or generate true depth for characters was foiled by the simple fact that the writing is too shallow and bland to carry the weight of true characterization; anything of value simply flops off the words like a limp slug.Do not waste your time with this. Robin Cook seems to have become Michael Crichton's dull doppelganger, and there's no need to encourage such drivel any further."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"[CAUTION--arguably a spoiler in this review] This could have been a really enjoyable book, but instead it was maddening to me. Why would an author title the book \\"Marker\\" and then not expect the readers to figure out from first chapter that the mysterious deaths were because of markers?? This entirely ruined the aura of mystery to me and made the book frustrating to read. And, as if we're not already unable to put one and one together, the author also begins the very first page with a description of the fertilization of the egg of the heroine, and then drags out her \\"revelation\\" to herself and the readers that she...hold on to your hats...is pregnant! Who would have guessed! I don't get it. Why would the author pretend to hold out events in this book as mysteries to be solved when he tells the reader right out front what's going on?Had this not ruined the book for me, it would have gotten 4 stars."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I just completed listening to the unabridged version of Marker and I would give it an above average review. The book is about the rocky relationship between two medical examiners, Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton while Laurie is investigation a series of suspicious deaths occurring at a local hospital. As with many murder mysteries, the book starts slow while setting up some of the details for the plot but once you get past that, it grabs your attention. I did, however, feel that the book ended rather abruptly. The author spends a large amount of time building you up in the book and basically takes care of answering a lot of questions in the epilogue. This is my first book that I've read by the author so I'm not able to comment how this is like or dislike his other works but it had a decent and captivating storyline and I would recommend it to any murder mystery fan."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I've read all of Robin Cook's books over the years. Each new novel gets more and more tedious and difficult to make my way through. Too much descriptive prose, not enough action. Dr. Cook has lost his way and his cutting-edge talent.I stopped reading this one after the first hundred pages. What a waste of time and effort!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I did not know until a minute ago when I checked out the appropriate place to write the review that this is one of eight books Cook has written about the couple featured in Marker. Over the years I have occasionally picked up one of his books to read, there are over forty of them, but not another in this series. Simply means I cannot judge how this stands in an ongoing saga.I suppose a hit author has to fill a certain number of pages to justify the prices charged for the hard cover edition. However, I did not read but rather listened to the performance in the audio book by one of the stars of the genre, George Guidall. He does a good job with a book that, from my point of view, could have done with a good deal less of he-she stuff, which would have brought it down to a reasonable length. I also could have done without the rather lengthy \\"solution\\" which, as usual, is a platform for one or another of Cook's takes on contemporary medical practice, public health or some similar topic.Despite these reservations, I believe Guidall's performance and the action features of the book, will prove entertaining to the average reader, who will find interest in the world of medical practice and malpractice. Some will undoubtedly be drawn by the dilemma of conflicting desires for career and family; and for the man's hesitation for a second time, to take on responsibility for home and family after an unhappy ending to his first effort in that direction.As for the underlying rationale for the action; one can take it or leave it since it is laid out in an easily forgotten tag end."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I love Robin Cook's ability to create characters which feel like friends. Laurie Montgomery is one of those characters. As the heroine of this little story Laurie employs intelligence, science, and unfaltering compassion and dedication to her work and her life. Then she falls under the crosshairs of a ruthless serial killer.A series of questionable deaths catches her attention from the morgue where she begins an independent investigation. Victims of varying ages admitted to hospitals for routine procedures are appearing in the city morgue much earlier than they should be. Her list of suspects grows much longer when she discovers the series of murders spans two hospitals instead of one.Jack Stapleton, her confidant, lover, and coworker is left to piece together her clues and discover the meaning behind the murders. Will he be in time to save her though?Balancing the mystery with the Manhattan Medical Examiner's world is the tenuous relationship Jack and Laurie share. Forced to accept Jack's reluctance to commit to a permanent relationship, Laurie also discovers a frightning medical condition of her own. Cook even sets the story in the real life horror of medical coverage and insurace rates.As with all of Cook's novels there is unusual coincidence and circumstance that makes the outcome a little extraordinary. Still with the characters, setting, and plot, Cook's writing serves his fans well. I definitely enjoyed this book. Robin Cook's readers will too."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I love it, when at the end of a day's work, on my way back home I have pleasant thoughts of a good book that awaits for me back at home (beside my the dear wife) .This book is a good example of such pleasure."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"THE SETUPMedical examiner Lori Montogomery observes the unexplained death of a number of healthy young patients and suspects a serial killer. In a converging storyline, Lori breaks up with fellow medical examiner Jack Stapleton over his inability to commit to the relationship. That's the setup.COMMENTS--contains spoilersThe premise that a for-profit medical company is behind the deaths to reduce costs is implausible--mostly because such savings would be hypothetical and in the distant future. Such a scheme might be plausible if the cost savings was assured and in the immediate future.THE VERDICTThis is one of the best Cook novels. The characters are few, and the \\"good guys\\" are appealing, and well characterized. The plot is fast-paced, captivating, relatively straightforward, albeit predictable. The resolution is satisfying."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"OK, OK, there are only a finite number of ways patients can be killed, maimed, chased, terrified, cut, dissected, etc. in a hospital setting and they must have all been done already, e.g. illegal organ harvesting, corporate greed, etc. etc., and I am sure that this one (Marker) has been done before by some author in some book. Having said that Marker is still a great read. The book flowed so fast and easily that I was literally unable to put it down and was compelled to read it until I was done.Some random thoughts:1) Kudos to Robin Cook for writing so realistically from a female protagonist's point of view. I don't think that can be easily done. Of course he did it right from the beginning with Coma, and for the longest time I never knew if Robin Cook was a Mr. or Ms.2) Robin Cook shows himself once again to be a good writer. Marker is easy to read, the characters are well developed, and the book does not suffer from logic lapses. It's not til the very end that I wondered why the book was called Marker.3) For most of the book, what I thought was an irritating subplot turned out to be central to the story. I thought that was very neat.4) I have no idea why the author chose to let us see from JR's point of view. It didn't really add to the book, and it would have been much, much more suspenseful and thrilling if he didn't. In fact, the story was made for it, because at one point you had all these suspects and all the main characters looked like they were going to be in danger from each one of them in turn. And if you didn't know who the bad guy was it would have been much more interesting. As it was we knew who it was and it was just a matter of when.5) The part at the end where the 2 guys were hauling the body and how the NewYawkers were responding was hilarious. Nice.6) There's what I'll call an editorial at the end of the book. After all these bestsellers, I guess he's entitled to it. I think Michael Crichton did one in one of his books too.

Jack Stapleton and Laurie Montgomery are medical examiners for the city of New York. They are also lovers, but Laurie starts questioning their relationship when she verbalizes a desire to start a family and Jack, who lost his first wife and their daughter, isn't excited about trying again. Their relationship is hanging in the balance but will have to take a back seat when Laurie suspects that a string of deaths at a local hospital are not of the \\"natural variety\\". People who are young, seemingly healthy and undergoing routine, minor surgical procedures are ending up dead just hours post-op. Everyone around Laurie, including Jack and their boss Calvin, believe Laurie is making a mountain out of a mole hill. Laurie persists in her conviction and uncovers a shocking plot that will rock the medical foundation. To make matters worse, an unplanned surgery puts Laurie in the same hospital, under the same circumstances as those who have already mysteriously died. Will Jack come around to Laurie's way of thinking in time to save her?Marker is a story within a story. This keeps the reader engrossed and engaged. Cook is a master at medical thrillers and has a way of \\"dumbing down\\" all the medical jargon so that anyone can understand and enjoy his books. This story is so intriguing because like most of his other novels, it is plausible, which makes it frightening. This is a must read for Cook fans and anyone who enjoys exciting medical thrillers."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This novel sees the return of New York City medical examiner, Laurie Montgomery, and NYPD homicide detective, Lou Saldano, to whom I was first introduced in the author's medical mystery thriller, \\"Blindsight\\". This pretty much follows the formula in that book.Here, young, reasonably healthy adults enter the hospital for seemingly routine minor surgery and end up dying while hospitalized. Our intrepid medical examiner senses that there is something wrong afoot, as she takes notice of this but cannot initially ascertain what the problem is. As the death toll mounts up, Laurie knows that the law of probability is against these deaths being accidental. She thinks that there is a serial killer afoot, but she does not know how or why. More galling to her is the fact that no one seems to share her concerns initially, although she does confide her concerns to Detective Saldano. Unfortunately, his hands are tied, because the medical examiner's office is not classifying these deaths as homicides.Set against the backdrop of this medical conundrum is the personal angst Laurie is suffering because of the reluctance of Jack Stapleton, her long term significant other and fellow medical examiner, to commit to marrying her and having children. Since Laurie is forty three and her biological clock is in countdown mode, she won't take no for an answer this time. Consequently, she and Jack seem to be going their separate ways, and Laurie meets up with a another doctor, one who is in a successful private practice and seems smitten by Laurie.The author weaves a fine plot, even though the author's cookie-cutter characters and limp dialogue leave something to be desired. The reader will know who the killer is relatively early, but why the killings are taking place is what is at the heart of this book. Still, the clever plot will keep the reader eagerly turning the pages of this book. Although though the discerning reader will probably solve the mystery long before Laurie and Lou do so, the plot will still keep the reader turning the pages of this entertaining, quick read. The book is also a social commentary on the evils inherent in managed health care."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This book descends from the school of Michael Crichton and Tom Wolfe, who try to wrap contemporary issues in what would be luridly excessive plots in the hands of others. The theme of the book is how genetics is revealing what our future diseases will be, and how that not only stresses us as people but makes us potential victims at the hands of a profit-driven industry. Cook gives us two-dimensional characters, and a plot that is less mystery that a thriller as two investigators pursue a suspicious series of events that others won't recognize. It reminds me in many ways of Steven King horror novels, where characters take into their own hands the pursuit of an evil. In this case, the evil is mundane. We all fear and loathe our health plans to some degree, and the fear is amplified by the notion that health care providers might someday look over our DNA charts and cut us out of the system for having genes which give us a high chance of disease. Cook approaches it from an ethicist's point of view, and doesn't give us the grim counterargument, which is that disease could almost be eliminated by taking a look at our genetic markers, and someday a government may choose to do that. However, I don't see this as a failing, because he is addressing issues that are here and now in an entertaining fashion. Because this book has so much meat to it, it is more compelling than its text alone, and is one of my favorite recent reads."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Very Good (as always) Robin Cook is one of the finest writers of medical mysteries. I would highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I have to say I was excited when I found this book in the library, Dr. Cook had fallen off my reading radar and this on-going series of medical examiners Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton were my favorite of the author's works.Needless to say, I was disappointed in this novel. The plot was too predictable and the characters and villians one dimensional."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I've read all of Robin Cook's books and usually enjoy them but this one drug on for FOREVER. I just wanted to get to the end to confirm what I already knew halfway through the book. It seems like he layed out all of the information that would keep you interested pretty early on. The he must have just kept writing and relized 200 pages later that the story had ended some time ago so he writes a lame ending and calls it a day. The most excitement happens in the last 10 pages. This book was a big dissapointment."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This book is a improvement over Cook's two previous novels (\\"Shock\\" and \\"Seizure\\"), but that isn't saying much. Cook brings back two interesting characters from \\"Vector\\" and places them in a straightforward medical thriller plot about patients dying under mysterious circumstances. Unfortunately, Cook fans will find this premise overly familiar (it's those evil HMOs again!) and the novel is far too long. I hope Cook comes up with a truly original idea for his next novel."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I am a Robin Cook fan and own all of his books in hard cover. But this last book may turn me away for good.I agree with other reviewers that the book was way too long and it was hard to slug through it to the end. But what bothers me the most was the terrible dialog between the characters. I don't know where he lives but in my 50 years I have never heard people actually talk to each other in such an unrealistic way. I think that even Shakespeare would have thought the dialog to be pretentious and unbelievable.I'm sorry Dr. Cook but I think you need to listen to REAL people converse before you publish your next book."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Other reviewers have noted the frequent editing mistakes and unnecessary length of Marker, both of which are very valid concerns about this book. But the most disappointing aspect of Cook's latest is that the book was a protracted political statement about genomics, managed care and nursing shortages. It's fine, even encouraged, for a novel to touch on political and social issues of our time, but not in such a transparent and predictable way, just like Clancy's and Crichton's latest novels. Cook even thought to add an author's note explaining his views on genomics and managed care, just like Crichton did about global warming in \\"State of Fear\\".You could tell about 100 pages into the book who was going to end up facing the killer, how they would end up in the situation, who would save the day, and that everyone would end up living happily ever after. Hardly a thriller in the spirit of his earlier novels in that you could see where he was going from the start, yet you had to endure an extra 100-200 pages of character-building romance writing to make us feel for Jack and Laurie. And the discovery of who was ultimately behind the killings was far-fetched and poorly explained."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"We're obviously fans of Dr. Robin Cook, having read all two dozen entries in his medical thriller bibliography. Cook has a knack for creating a premise with a hook, then employing a variety of doctors and nurses (et al) to roll out the plot, often with the goal of educating or evangelizing about a current issue along the way. \\"Marker\\" is not really a sequel to \\"Vector\\", but herein the author reprises the roles of NYC Medical Examiners Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton, who start out the book shacked up. But soon Laurie moves out, frustrated by Jack's lack of commitment and worried her biological clock has just about given up on pregnancy and kids at age 43.At work, Montgomery gets involved in a number of hospital deaths of yuppies in mostly great health who die due to unknown causes within 24 hours of routine surgery. When neither her careful autopsies nor pathology tests yield a clue, she suspects something sinister afoot given that all the deaths are at the same hospital. When the caseload grows to four, she starts making noises about a potential serial killer situation, but her superiors and anybody else who will listen, including Jack, oddly get on her case and dismiss such a wild idea. Three more deaths later, and having discovered six earlier examples, all from one other hospital, coincidentally with common ownership to the other, the fires start burning brighter.Early on, meanwhile, we readers get to meet the actual sociopath nurse committing the deeds on a contract basis for \\"Mr. Bob.\\" While we have no clue to the ultimate motive, we get suspicious when managed care and the potential misuse of blood tests for genetic markers (predictive of genetic flaws) seem to have our author on his pulpit. Will they catch the perp and discover the reasoning behind these dark deeds? Well of course, but getting there is a lot of fun!Our only gripe with this otherwise intriguing novel was that the 520-page tome could have been benefit of a editor's sharper pencil! In the middle, 100 pages of Laurie's frustrations with life, of her getting pregnant without realizing what we readers did long before her, of her dating a new doc, and other such goings-on hardly necessary to the storyline, could easily have hit the dustbin, leaving us a cleaner cut to the chase that becomes the fabulous last part of the book. But otherwise, we have here Cook at his finest: a compelling story, mystery and suspense, and a riveting climax! No need to save for the beach!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Not quite sure how so many positive reviews came about for this book. It took me about two weeks to slug through this snooze-fest! With the title called Marker anyone who couldn't figure out that the plot was going to be based on something found in genetics and that somehow insurance companies were going to turn around and use this against us must be asleep at the wheel. How could anyone say this book had any suspense??? I could have easily read Robin Cooks commentary at the end to figure out the entire plot. He basically wrote a 500 page cure for insomniacs.Needless to say this is one author I have officially given up on."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Strange things are happening at Manhattan General Hospital and Dr. Laurie Montgomery is the only one who seems to notice. Laurie is a medical examiner with the Coroner's office. She has become concerned about four seemingly healthy young adults, in the hospital for unrelated procedures, that have suddenly, with no previous warning, had massive heart attacks. Neither the autopsies, nor the associated tests, have given any reason for these incidents. As far as Laurie is concerned, this is a mystery and she suspects foul play. As for her co-workers and superior, they are unconcerned, believing it is a co-incidence, well within the statistical margins for fatalities, in a large, busy hospital.Then two more similar cases appear, again with no perceptible pathology. Then through Laurie's efforts, it is discovered that six similar cases happened previously, at St Francis hospital in Queens, stopping just prior to the incidents at Manhattan General. Now, Laurie's somewhat estranged love interest, Dr. Jack Stapleton, whose interest was slowly being peaked, is solidly in Laurie's camp. She has also gained the interest of a doctor at Manhattan General as well. In the meantime Laurie finds out she is both pregnant and positive for a marker, inherited from her mother which could lead to breast cancer. As I understand it a marker is a defective link in the DNA makeup. Late in the book they (Jack and Laurie) discover the victims, they're investigating also had markers.When the interested doctor, who was interested in Laurie as well and a head nurse get murdered, Laurie and Jack are now positive it was connected, even though there is no discernable relationship. Another suspicious heart attack and then another, then Laurie herself is put in mortal danger as she is rushed to Manhattan General Hospital for emergency surgery.ConclusionIt seems the favorite subject of medical doctor/writers these days are the maleficent health management organizations - HMOs. Marker is yet another story involving these nefarious institutions. In this case the culprit is the large fast growing company, Ameri-care, which happens to own both Manhattan General and St Francis hospitals.The setting for Marker, the Manhattan Medical Examiners Office, was used at least once before, in the book - Vectors. It had the same characters including Jack Stapleton and Laurie Montgomery, who had yet to become an item. Vectors was a pretty good book, so I was happy to see Cook reprise them and their supporting cast for this book. Perhaps because they were in a previous book(s), the author did not feel the need to develop the characters as extensively as he would have otherwise. This would be understandable if it was a series, i.e. Vectors II but it was obviously not. This may be a small thing, but still it would be advantageous to read Vectors first, though certainly not necessary.Doctors obviously have a problem with HMOs as this is the second medical thriller in a row I've read dealing with them. Obviously many in the public sector have problems with them as well as they're (HMOs) on the news quite often, but it seems like these doctors go to extreme lengths to paint the HMOs as evil conniving monsters, which is alluded to in this and the other book I mentioned - The Society.As far as the story is concerned, it was concise and well written. It was written in easily understood language, something doctors have trouble doing sometimes, and in a fluid manner. I consider Cook to be among my favorite authors, but I have read books by him, that I didn't care for. Marker was neither one of his worst, nor his best. Although the end was quite exciting, the story as a whole, never captured my imagination. I give Marker 3 stars."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I've enjoyed quite a few of Cook's novels, but primarily his earlier works, which were tight, inventive, and original medical thrillers. None of those adjectives define this book.First of all, the mechanism which drives the final plot twists is so very easy to figure out very, very early in the book, with about thirty seconds of thought. So, there's no surprising denoument in the end.This story is 538 pages in the hardcover edition (not including his Afterword). Easily a hundred of these pages, and probably more, should have been edited out of this book. I found myself skimming pages at a time as I was looking for the story to pick back up again after wading through the interminable (and boring) angst of the two lead characters plumbing their relationship in excruciatingly mind-numbing and repetitive detail.And every plot twist is depicted repetitively as each of three or four characters try to deduce the nature of the goings-on at a hospital stalked by a serial killer.In all honesty, I was barely able to finish this book. It was more out of curiousity about whether I'd correctly predicted the ending - which I had. It's almost literally a no-brainer.I simply can't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Another medical thriller involving the Office of the City Medical Examiner (OCME) of New York. This time Dr. Laurie Montgomery & Dr. Jack Stapleton assemble the pieces left by a serial killer in a Manhattan hospital. This book also takes a rightfully critical look at managed care in America today and how managed care is nothing more than big, powerful, greedy business, not healthcare in any shape or form. The serial killer in this book is so sociopathic, he/she will rattle your nerves & your bones. An excellent thrill ride, although a bit verbose at times. This book ranks near the top of my list of favorite Robin Cook thrillers!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Robin Cook's \\"Marker\\" is another entry in his series featuring two New York City medical examiners, Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton.

All of the victims were recovering from routine elective surgery and none was particularly sick. The autopsies and toxicological screens reveal nothing. Laurie instinctively suspects foul play, but she cannot convince her supervisors that she is right. Therefore, she takes matters into her own hands. She tries to figure out what all of the victims had in common, as well as who might have had both the motive and the opportunity to commit murder.\\"Marker\\" is Robin Cook's twenty-fifth novel and it follows a familiar formula. Jack and Laurie are attractive, brilliant, and dedicated physicians. There is a large managed care health company that may be up to no good. Cook throws in a psychotic killer, as well as a few soap opera elements involving a love triangle and a possible pregnancy.Cook's writing style is pedestrian. His characters are one-dimensional and his dialogue is stilted and, at times, laughable. Since he eschews profanity, Cook frequently has his characters uttering such exclamations as \\"My word!\\" \\"Good grief!\\" and \\"Shucks!\\" Since Cook lets us know the killer's identity early on, there is little suspense on that score.Cook explains arcane medical details clearly. Unfortunately, his depiction of romantic relationships is forced and his action sequences are both strained and artificial. This five hundred plus page novel moves along quickly enough and there are a few tense moments. However, only an incredibly undemanding reader would liken \\"Marker\\" to the best of Cook's earlier books, such as \\"Coma\\" and \\"Sphinx,\\" which were genuinely scary and engrossing."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I am a huge fan of Cook and his ability to combine good modern science with thrilling suspense Acceptable Risk and Chromosome 6 are two of my favorite medical thrillers of all time. This said Marker did not do it for me- the underlying comspiracy behind a series of unexplained deaths at two hospitals run by the big manager care group / insurance company we are supposed to believe are the insurance company killing off young new subscribers who have bad genes that may lead to disease down the road that costs them money to cure. This is ridiculous! How many people have the same insurance company for 20 years or so? That is the time period to develop long term disease. Americans through changing jobs and employers changing programs change insurance carriers on a regular basis so I see no reason a single company would risk this type of action. This problem slanted my reading and scepticism on my part made the whole book play out as flat. More interesting than our suspicios deaths at the hospital were the ancillary cases that our intrepid medical examiners Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton worked on through the book- the prominent pop psychologist whose supposed rape homicide is something else and the two boys who die on the A Train tracks being my ironic favorites. Read Marker to catch up on Jack and Laurie but don't expect too much. The science Cook provides on SNPs and markers is easy to understand for a layman and presented well as always. The ethical issues of genetic testing are handled responsibly by him- it is his shadow organizations use of this testing I call into question."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I haven't read a Robin Cook novel for some time, although I did enjoy many of his early works. Marker disappointed me.Good writers show you their characters -- like peeling an onion. Cook cheats by telling you. For example, rather than show you a character's cynicism through actions or dialogue, Cook will simply say, \\"Mary was always cynical.\\" Great. So interesting.In addition to lack of characterization, the dialogue is stilted. Cook too often refuses to use contractions. Thus, \\"I'll\\" comes out \\"I will.\\" And his characters simply don't talk like normal humans. My view on dialogue is that, if you stop to notice it, it's probably bad. And his is.The plot is okay. However, managed care as bad guys has been done (by him) over & over. It would be refreshing to see a book that looks at both sides of the health care cost dilemma rather than always demonizing one side.The book isn't a total wash -- it was enjoyable in spurts. However, overall, it was too long, not very well written, and entirely predictable. Get it at the library or a rummage sale -- don't pay full price."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"The story is scarily believable in today's healthcare environment where actuaries and bottom line results rule over patient care.

I must admit, as a true Cook fan, that I feel his last couple of books haven't been up to the standard that we have come to expect from him. In &quot;Marker&quot;, however, he gives us a compelling story, with just enough scientific information, to keep us turning the pages well into the night. His characters come to life from page one and we actually feel we know these people as the &quot;plot thickens&quot;. I would recommend this book - reminds me of his books about 10 or 15 years ago when you couldn't stop reading or felt you couldn't read fast enough to know what was going on. A very good summer read."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"After being disappointed by Cook's last two novels, Shock and Seizure, I picked up Marker with some trepidation. However, my doubt soon disappeared, and I read the book well into the wee hours of the morning -- I was completely engrossed! It was nice to see Jack and Laurie back on the case, and as usual, Cook tells their story in a humorous yet suspenseful manner while delivering the completely unbelievable twist ending that leaves you saying, \\"Oh! Now I understand what happened on page 352!\\" The book offers some neat clues if you have a science background, but it in no way ruins the plot of the story.True, there are some (huge) typos and editing errors throughout the book, but it doesn't really take away from the action.Bottom line -- buy the book! -- but only if you can afford to stay up until 5 AM finishing it!"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This is a super summer read!

It's just that:(1) It's at least 100 pages longer than it needs to be. Arguably 200. I gave up around page 250 and skimmed the rest, encountering no surprises.(2) The dialogue is atrocious.(3) The murder weapon, which is revealed early on to be the same substance that is used to stop hearts in state-sanctioned lethal injections, would in real life have been considered immediately by any medical examiner worth her, um, salt, once she were as convinced as our heroine that things just didn't add up.Cook's concerns are socially relevant, to be sure, but he simply isn't a good enough writer to drive the point home."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I almost always like his books, the medical aspect of it, and this is no exception.

I cannot stop wondering 'where is the REAL Robin Cook!?!?'"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Picked up an old copy during a hurricane power failure. The power wasn't the only thing that failed. Clumsy exposition, unbelievable dialog and characters that simply do not ring true. Next blackout, I look for a deck of cards."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"The plotting is fast and furious in Robin Cook's Marker. While in the past his plot elements have bordered on the absurd, in this effort it keeps it pretty tame. This is probably the most fleshing out the characters of Laurie Montgomery and Jack Stapleton have gotten as well. The two medical examiners again discover that big medicine can be deadly long before everyone else catches on and almost wind up becoming corpses themselves. This is one of the best of Cook's efforts and one I recommend."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"When a couple of seemingly healthy patients die after surgery, M.E's Dr.Laurie Montgomery and her lover Dr.Jack Stapleton are naturally concerned, but when this statistic becomes a flood of deaths, Lauries tries to convince the office of Medical Examiners that something very sinister is happening. She is virtually told to keep her imagination in check and to just attend to her own job. At the same time, Laurie is trying to convince her less than enthusiastic lover that it's time for marriage and children, but Jack is still fearful of making a commitment, with the memory of the hurt he suffered when his family was destroyed, holding him back. The really alarming premise made in this story is that the huge health insurance company which has taken over two of the city's major hospitals, has found a way to use the most up to date DNA information to weed out insurees who have the DNA marker for illnesses which would be costly to correct and treat, so consequently, they are being disposed of before the illnesses actually surface. It's a long bow to draw but one which is enough to put shivers up the spines of anyone about to be hospitalised. It's an exciting but ultimately chilling read."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"This is one of, if not the best of the Laurie Montgomery, Jack Stapleton and Lou Soldano books.From the very beginning, Cook sucks the reader in with what promises and ultimately delivers what he's best known for; great paced, character driven, medical mysteries.Laurie, Jack and Lou are written superbly once again with fantastic character moments. You really get a feel for the weird dynamic of their three way friendship.Cases comming across Laurie's desk are dying mysteriously. The deceased are all healthy, young, no history of disease, within 24 hours of routine surgery. No cause of death can be ascertained. Laurie starts to get suspicious and goes on a lone crusade to discover the true nature of these deaths and she suspects foul play.All the while, Laurie's got some personal issues that she's got to deal with which makes for a great subplot. The story within a story of Jack and Laurie's relationship is also great reading in addition to the medical mystery brain twister that Robin Cook sets up.With lots of twists and turns and some pretty shockign revelations, the book, the mystery and the culprits don't get revealed until the very end and it makes for a great read.Definetly worth checking out for any Robin Cook fan without a doubt."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"While MARKER may not be Cook's greatest, it still held up to my expectations and thrilled me to the end. I was intrigued by the plot and engaged by the dynamic characters. Some other reviewers complained of medical jargon, but I think it adds to the authenticity of the story. As a huge fan of medical thrillers, I would still recommend Cook as a staple of the genre. I've also recently read newcomer Patricia Gussin's book, SHADOW OF DEATH, and would highly recommend it. Her main character is a medical student caught in a series of tragic events and cover-ups, putting an interesting twist on the idea of \\"medical thriller.\\""},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I have read all of Robin Cook's books through Marker. I like the way the books often grab the reader. I find the subject matter interesting. The books are a quick read. My main complaint with Marker is the incorrect medical information (which I also noticed in the book previous to this one). I know the author is a writer now and not currently in practice, however, he probably has numerous contacts and resources to help get the current facts.A few examples are p.169 when he talks about HIPA. I think he must mean HIPAA. On p.208 it is mentioned that \\"...most people who've had surgery keep an IV for at least twenty-four hours.\\" That's hardly true for elective surgeries nowadays. Routine knee scopes and foot surgeries often go straight home from the recovery room. Another is on p.140 \\"...Jazz pinched Rowena's nostrils shut and placed her mouth over Rowena's.\\" I can't imagine this happening today with the concern about infectious diseases. The nurse would have used an ambu bag. Also, p.367 \\"...she inserted the needle deep into the IV port.\\" Most hospitals and clinics have enforced the needleless system.There were other simple mistakes I noted while reading the book. If you are a lay person you could probably care less. As a medical professional, I would like the book to be as realistic as possible. Just my two cents. The storylines are intriguing. Just get the facts straight."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Although Cook writes well enough to get you caught up in the story, Marker should have been a novella. The narrative is extended with irrelevent verbal confrontations, petty arguments and an unbelievable amount of medical jargon. Where was the editor?"},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Another plot that makes you scared to go into the hospital. Entirely too believably possible in the same way that Coma and most of his other medical thriller novels have been. I gave it 4 stars because I thought the book was way too long - it was over 500 pages but probably could have been written in 300. It sort of dragged as a result."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Dr. Jack Stapleton and Dr. Laurie Montgomery both work for the Medical Examiner's Office in Manhattan. They're definitely a couple but Jack is unable make that final commitment. Laurie wants marriage, a family, and a commitment. She moves back to her apartment, and unintentionally starts to see Dr. Roger Rousseau who is voluntarily helping her on a case. Laurie suspects that there is a serial killer working at Manhattan General Hospital. She seemingly ties it together with previous cases at another AmeriCare hospital. No one believes her, her boss, colleagues, Jack; except for Dr. Rousseau about the evidence and her growing stack of statistics. Seemingly healthy individuals are suddenly dying after minor surgeries with no outward causes of death. One of Laurie's suspects is Jasmine Rakoczi, a registered nurse at Manhattan General, with a military background, fanatic about her fitness levels, and a vicious attitude. At the height of her investigation, Laurie requires emergency surgery and ends up in the hands of Jasmine. Jack does manage to come to her rescue with barely minutes to spare. The length of this novel gives you a chance to see the changes in the characters and anticipate how they react to events. You will root for Jack and Laurie, and will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"The best fiction, in my opinion, is that which both entertains and educates. And Robin Cook's books do this. Marker refers to a \\"marker gene\\" that marks mutated genes which indicate major health problems in the future. This is a direct reference to the mapping of the human genome's 3.2 billion base pairs that was published in draft form about five years ago.While this was presented as being very important, it quickly faded from the news as no one could explain just why it was so important. This book explains at least one aspect of why this was so important.This book is also a mystery, the two leading figures work in the Manhattan medical examiner's office, so you know that the story will start off with dead bodies. And in the morgue of New York there are a lot of dead bodies. What makes these bodies so special? And of course, who did it, why did they do it, and what will happen to the on-again/off-again relationship with the two heros? Well, since they've been in several of Robin Cook's books so ...."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"Dr. Cook still can write and hold your interest. His latest thriller,Marker,is a good summer read but takes too long to reach its predictable climax and drags a bit in spots. In a nutshell, the plot revolves around the discovery by Cook's two heroes, Assistant NYC Medical Examiners Dr. Laurie Montgomery and, her boyfriend, Dr. Jack Stapleton, of a heinous scheme by a major medical hospital/health insurance company. It seems that highers-up in the fictitious AmeriCares Company are sanctioning the murders of healthy young adult patients in some NYC hospitals for minor surgery who happen to have markers in their blood for the possible development of diseases, like cancer, later in life. How they are sanctioned and when drive the plot of this thriller.In alot of ways this book reminded me of Coma, one of Robin Cook's early bestsellers. Marker lends itself to a Hollywood movie treatment,like Coma. At the same time,its subject matter includes plenty of doses of the latest information concerning the human genome, mapping DNA and the use of markers in modern medicine, along with its controversial implications."},{"Title":"Marker","review":"I've been reading Robin Cook's novels for quite a few years, beginning in the 1980s when I was attending college. I guess as I've grown, my tastes have matured a bit, but I hope that hasn't made me into a snob. I enjoy pulp fiction as much as the next guy. I don't ask for much: interesting plots, good dialog, and characters that act like real people would act.Somewhere along about my 4th or 5th Robin Cook novel I began having a very strong sense of deja vu. Gee, isn't this almost EXACTLY the same plot from the last book, with just a few name changes and a fresh coat of paint? Yup. Which is one of my primary (but not only) problems with Cook's novels: the plot is always essentially the same.His books remind me of those 1960s Star Trek episodes. The scene before the opening credits always found the usual cast on the surface of some alien planet, joined by some ensign in the Away Team we'd never seen before. We knew instantly that within the next 60 seconds, Ensign so-and-so (if they even bothered to give him a name) would be dead. His fate? Usually death at the hands of some alien who was immune to our hapless ensign's phasor, or crushed beneath an avalanche of those cheesy foam rubber boulders. Same basic idea in Cook's books. In chapter one, we're always introduced to some perky young coed who will be dead before the chapter is out.Initially, the plot repetition was the only thing that bothered me. But then I began to notice that Cook's characters didn't talk the way real people talk. They used dialog that isn't natural or conversational and is mostly clich&eacute;. And then I began to notice something else: the characters themselves were stereotypical. There was very little interesting about them. Sure, Cook would tell us what color hair and eyes they had, how attractive they were, and maybe what kind of car they drove and where they went to school, but it always felt more like simply putting a few pieces of costume jewelry on a mannequin. There was nothing underneath.And I suppose that sums up the problems I have with Cook's novels in general. The characters are usually stereotypical or one-dimensional, the dialog doesn't even begin to approach the way real people talk, and the plots are always minor variations on the same theme which goes almost exactly like this: some nefarious doctor is killing people and it is up to our tag-team hero/heroine to stop it. Dr. Nefarious goes on killing for 200-300 pages while our protagonists shuffle from bedroom to hospital to basketball court and back again, ploddingly uncovering Dr. Nefarious's activities. One member of the tag team gets caught, and just when Dr. Nefarious is ready to kill our hero/heroine, the other rides in with just seconds to spare and saves the day. The End.In \\"Marker\\" we get pretty much the above-mentioned recipe - no surprises there. But Cook - in the style of Michael Crichton - uses this book to make a social commentary. In this case, it's the use of an individual's genetic information by the medical/insurance industry in ways that may not be in the person's best interests (as if we were unaware of this). I won't say much more about this book, because to do so would be a plot spoiler, but then again, Cook's plots are usually so transparently thin that he telegraphs where we're going to end up almost from the very first page.I've come to view Cook's novels much the way I view fast food. There isn't too much good to say about it other than that it is consistent. The first novel you read from Cook is usually the best. After that, it doesn't much matter because they're all basically the same. If I had to pick just one, I'd suggest \\"Coma\\" because it was clever and original back in the 1970s when it was first released."},{"Title":"Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes","review":"I have only read the first half of this book.

Certainly a good introduction to the subject, written at a reasonably adult level and very understandable."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This book is extremely one-sided. It starts with a foregone conclusion and ends with the same foregone conclusion. Don't buy or borrow it expecting to get a fair overview of the competing theories of cosmology.The biggest flaw: There is no mention of current observational data that directly contradicts the fundamental assumptions of the hallowed BB, such as that of Halton Arp, who shows without question that \\"redshift\\" is NOT a reliable velocity indicator. See Arp's \\"Seeing Red\\" for a compelling contradictory view of the evidence. Also consider Eric Lerner's \\"The Big Bang Never Happened\\", a book similarly heavy on history but much more focused on relevant details than Singh's.Also rarely mentioned: the Big Bang now has so many \\"fudge factors\\" (added variables) that there is almost nothing astronomers could observe that could possibly invalidate it in its current form. The almost universal willingness of scientists to accommodate the theory with unpredicted scientific \\"patches\\" (dark matter and dark energy are only the latest patches applied to the BB to rescue it) are a sign of a theory in crisis. For an overview of just how dire the situation is, do a Google search for \\"Top 30 Problems With The Big Bang\\" or go to http://www.metaresearch.org/cosmology/BB-top-30.asp.Let me reiterate. The problems are severe. The fact that Singh acknowledges none of them is a sign that he's very, very, very convinced that he's right...never a good starting point for objectivity.One positive: Singh's book does contain some entertaining anecdotes regarding the major players in the BB story.Summary: Readers looking for a one-sided open-and-shut case for the BB will certainly find it here. However, readers looking for an honest look at the relatively few successes and multiple failures of the storied BB will do better to look elsewhere.

I got this book for Christmas, and read it in about a week. I found it a compelling, awesome story. Easy to read, easy to understand. I mean, I'd heard of the big bang, but never had any real idea how the theory was determined, or what was involved in arriving at it. Singh (imho) does a fantastic job of telling the story, and making it understandable to the layman.OK, yes, a few gripes, but why even mention them? For example, talking about gravity, Singh uses Newton's formula for gravity as an example, and then talks about how Einstein's theory was better than Newton's. But hey, Singh never gives us Einstein's formula - why not? Singh uses verbal arguments to support Einstein's theory, but why not show us the equation, so we can compare it to Newton's. I mean, are we supposed to take Singh's verbal argument/proof of Einstein's theory rather than see the math? Also, Singh skips over how Newton even arrived at/discovered gravity, which is a key development in the whole BB theory.

The book is very accurate in the description of detailed events that are relevant to the subject, as far as I was able to verify. Singh obviously has read biographies of people like Newton, Copernicus and Galilei, and draws from these established facts without compromise. The book presents virtually no technical (mathematical) details of the various theories, which is peculiar because Singh has written some popular books on math as well. This book is recommended if you want an easy to read overview of the history of cosmology, culminting in the Big Bang theory.I cannot resist the temptation to share my view on the Big Bang theory as such. \\"Science\\" has the courage to extrapolate 15 billion years back, based on a few hundred years of observation. \\"Science\\" also extrapolates billions of lightyears away from here based on concrete observations that barely go beyond our own little planet, plus some manned moon-expeditions that took place in the sixties of last century. This has of course nothing to do with science.The Big Bang theory leans heavily on Special Relativity, which is a theory that can be shown to be inconsistent on one A4 sized piece of paper. Albert Einstein was one of the biggest jokers that \\"science\\" has known. The search for fluctuations in microwave background radiation, which consumed millions if not billions of tax payer money (the COBE project, described thoroughly in this book) is ridiculusly nonsensical. Of course you will find fluctuations in this radiation if you amplify it enough. That's what can be predicted based on knowledge of quantum mechanics. The world at the size of atoms is not smooth and even, but random and unpredictable. This will somehow automatically lead to unevenness in the macroscopic world. Besides that: the measured unevenness in background radiation explains nothing. It requires an explanation instead. Big Bang is science fiction. The funny thing about it is that so many academic and expensive people are bussy with it. Tax payers' dollars should be spent more responsible in my view. Let Isaac Asimov write about the Big Bang."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Too much is written on non-related history like Kepler and bla bla. As a science book, I have got no time to laugh at Europeans/ Christians who believed the Earth was the centre of the universe etcWhen it finally comes to topic concerning Relativity and Quantum Theory, the author just skips the interesting ( and the most important parts).After reading 500+ pages , I still don't get it. Is the BB theory be proven by The General Relativity AND The Quantum Theory? If not, where is the direction?

TJM..."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I own both of Singh's previous books and Singh does an excellent job exploring the history of the Big Bang Theory in his latest book. That being said, this reader found certain aspects of his book disappointing.In the opening chapter Singh touts the Sun-center for its simplicity (and I agree with his observation). As the book went on it seemed to me that the idea of simplicity in scientific theory disappeared as our understanding of the world grew increasingly complex. One would think that Singh is implying that Occam's Razor need not apply in a modern world.Singh spends a considerable amount of time discussing Hubble's Law, but he never mentions that Hubble's Law assumes that the universe is expanding at a constant rate. Cosmic inflation (which is relegated to the closing pages of the book) effectively negates this assumption and implies that Hubble's Constant isn't really constant after all, which may explain why modern estimates place Hubble's Constant at values ranging from 50 to 100 km/s/Mpc.Singh assumes that the Doppler shift remains valid and that no non-Doppler effects (such as the Wolf effect) are present. Maybe he should have mentioned that the speed of light might be slowing down, which could also contribute to the disparate estimates of Hubble's Constant.Singh ignores modern discoveries such as the Great Attractor or the Centaurus Wall, which raises some questions in regards to dark matter and the formation of galactic structures. The interested reviewer is encourged to search the internet for these terms. He also ignores the work of Halton Arp who has put forward a case for the association of neighboring galaxies with disparate redshifts (with Stephan's Quintet being the best example).Overall, this reader believes that the jury is still out on the Big Bang Theory and that more work is necessary before this theory can be called fact."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"The sub title on my book reads, \\"The most important scientific discovery of all time and why you need to know about it.\\" I'm in full agreement, because it explains scientifically, the evidence we have for a beginning or, \\"creation\\" of the universe.Singh lays it all out void of God or any \\"intelligently designed\\" implications but you can read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions. To steal a quote from Hawkins everything about the Big Bang, \\"Smacks of God,\\" because it defies any random event. The laws of physics, the inflation rate, the force of gravity, the strong and weak nuclear force, the cooling and subsequent nucleosynthesis to form hydrogen, it's all so fascinating, I had goose bumps while I was learning some of this.You can read the other reviews, everyone seems to be in agreement. This book is understandable, and clearly delivered. He certainly has the gift to get down to any one's level of intelligence and communicate how it is we came to the discovery of the Big Bang. What helped him in this ability is his recent \\"turning on\\" to this subject. He literally educated himself from scratch, reading astronomy books and talking to cosmologists before he put pen to paper. Then with a writing enthusiasm that keeps you entertained and focused he spills out this brilliant 500 page book, that is highly readable and interesting the whole way through.There is a wonderful glossary explaining scientific terms at the back of the book. He also has 24 quotes from different scientists from different periods of history, giving their definition of, \\"What is science?\\" May I share one?\\"The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely that it is expected to work.\\" John Von Neumann [1903-57] Hungarian born mathematicianOccam's razor;\\"A rule of thumb stating that in the presence of alternative adequate explanations for a phenomenon, the simpler one is more likely to be correct.\\""},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Big Bang is a very comprehensive summary of Physical Sciences, leading to Astronomy and eventually to Cosmology. This is by far the best book from Simon Singh. A well articulated story starting from Ancient Greeks to the modern Nobel prize winners. He describes in detail the Greeks assumptions of a round and spinning earth. And their measurements of Earth's circumference (Eratosthenes), relative sizes of moon and earth (Anaxagoras), and the distance to Sun (Aristarchus).Moving to the middle ages, the story of Tyco Brahe who took observational astronomy to an entirely new level of accuracy. Tyco's experimental data was interpreted correctly by Kepler who was myopic and suffered multiple visions from birth. Experiments of Galileo with pendulum, falling bodies, his observation of planets with the newly invented telescope and his ultimate friction with the Church. He mentions how Galileo could uniquely maintain religious beliefs and scientific dogmas in his mind at the same time, without any conflicts.On how Newton stood on the shoulders of the Giants and built on the planetary model to explain Gravity. William Herschel used telescope to discover the distant planets and their satellites. He came up with a rough size of the Milky Way Galaxy. His son John started recording the celestial pictures on newly invented medium-photography. With this technique, Astronomy entered a new phase.Beyond the Renaissance, how Einstein comes up with his thought experiments leading to theories of relativity (Special and General). For the first time I could understand that Special theory of relativity applied to bodies moving at constant speeds while General theory applied to accelerating or decelerating bodies. Time dilation and length contraction occur in fast moving bodies. How his theories lead to Alexander Friedman's prediction of an evolving Universe. How George Lemaitre's concluded that General theory of relativity implied a moment of creation, and hence Big Bang. And Einstein ended up denouncing both of them and came up with a Cosmological constant, which proves to be the biggest blunder of his life. George Lemaitre is a Belgian monk, who like Galielo, had a good balance between Science and Religion. Letting neither interfere with the other, but at the same time being deeply involved with both.John Goodricke discovered that the Cepheid stars have variable brightness. Because, unlike our Sun, they are not in a state of equilibrium. They go thru cycles of contraction and expansion. Henrietta Leavitt found a relationship between the period of fluctuation and apparent brightness by collecting data from a group of Cepheids in the Magellanic cloud. A team of astronomers found the distance to one Cepheid. Henrietta's theory was used to calculate distances of other Cepheids. Hale's efforts to build bigger and bigger telescopes. Edwin Hubble's greatest contribution by using these telescopes to prove that Andromeda is a separate Galaxy and that the Universe is undoubtedly expanding. Hubble's law vindicated George Lemaitre and Alexander Friedman.Ralph Alpher and George Gamow predicted that in the early Universe, after the Big Bang, matter existed as plasma, which cooled to 3000 degree centigrade and condensed to atoms, as the cosmic fog lifted, and Cosmic background radiation was emitted in all directions. This red shifted light in the microwave region was discovered by Penzias and Wilson of AT&T.; Fred Hoyle, in spite of his adherence to the loosing Steady State theory, made a significant contribution to the explanation of the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements from dying stars.Final chapters on the COBE's (Cosmic Background Explorer) precise measurements of Cosmic background radiation and subtle temperature differences in radiation of early Universe, leading to creation of Stars and Galaxies. This was the climatic moment for the Big Bang theory.This book is a must read for anyone interested in Cosmology."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Simon Singh has written a brilliant book on a very complex subject.To be able to do so in simple terms is a wonderful gift.If you have an interest in following the history of mankind's exploration of earth,space,the sun,the stars the nebulae etc and the scientific thought that accompanied this journey this is a fabulous book."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"While I am fascinated by the process of science and how science arrives at theories based on observation, I am also leery about reading books written by scientists. Their knowledge of the area is usually so great that they are unable to reduce the complexity of the subject to that suitable for mere mortals. But Simon Singh with a PhD in particle physics is not one of them. I noted that he had been a producer for the BBC so I felt that there was a chance that he could tell an understandable story. And I was right. This was one of the best science non-fiction books I've read in a long time. Singh walks us through the chronology of the development of the theory, starting with the earliest physicist/astronomers. He gives examples of objections to the Big Bang theory and then shows how the data supports the theory. One of the objections to the theory was that if the theory were true, then there should be background microwave radiation. And he proceeds to tell the story of how this radiation was finally found. Singh also discusses some of the personalities involved in the development from or fight against the theory. All-in-all this was a very worthwhile read, far superior in interest and anecdotes than books like The Elegant Universe or the Physics of the Buffyverse."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"A book for physics-dummies in a clear and precise language.

Couldn't hardly put it down. Bought another copy for a gift."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Yet another hit by Simon Singh, who has officially surpassed Brian Greene as my favorite science writer. Did you ever wonder how we know how far the Sun is, or the size of our galaxy? Singh begins with a surprisingly thorough history of astronomy and cosmology, dating back to Ancient Greece. You will be amazed by how much the Greeks knew about the Earth and the Solar System. Eventually, all our past knowledge of both cosmology and nuclear physics converges to this beautiful theory of the Big Bang, the birth of our Universe.This book is totally worth it for the catalog of sheer ingenuity of mankind. Singh makes it extremely entertaining by bringing all the historical scientists alive.My only gripe is that some parts are rather slow, and, similarly to the Code Book, the last 50 or so pages are _really_ slow and rather unpolished -- it's like Mr. Singh doesn't like to finish his books.But overall, an excellent trip through the Cosmos. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"With a PhD in particle physics and the easily digestible writing style, shared by his contemporaries Jon Krakauer and Nick Hornby, Simon Singh delivers once again. Having read and found \\"Fermat's Enigma\\" to be a thoroughly enjoyable and well researched book into the history of a seemingly simple equation (get that one too), I eagerly awaited the publication of this book. It makes for an excellent introduction into the world of cosmology. Singh relates the history of the subject from the early thinkers through to the current state of play - everyone from the \\"Cosmology Hall of Fame\\" is given a spot for their thoughts to be elucidated, how they affected the theories, how the modern folks are building on that knowledge, what questions remain unanswered, and what new questions are being promulgated. This is a worthy addition to the armchair and professional astronomer alike...worthy of a place alongside books by Hawking, Rees, Weinberg, Smoot and Gribben."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Who first looked up at the night sky wondering about those specks of light? Whoever and wherever that was, the quest for an answer has endured. Simon Singh traces the results of that search in very human terms. From early creation myths through the orbiting of machines that view the universe in selected frequencies, he explains how our knowledge of the cosmos has built and changed over four long centuries. Using an effective conversational style, he demonstrates how the slow accumulation of knowledge built our picture of the universe. With clarity came distance in our growing perception of the age and scope of the cosmos. After nearly fifteen billion years, the universe has had much time to expand. Whether that will long continue is one of the points of this excellent story.Arranging his topics carefully, Singh ties concepts to their investigators. Early ideas were based on \\"common sense\\" and accepted authorities. Naked eye observation limited our ability to \\"see\\" the universe until the telescope was developed. \\"Decentralising\\" is an ongoing theme in this book as we learn how Western Europe came to understand the Earth was not the centre of things. Galileo's telescopic observations shifted that centre to the sun. When telescopes improved even the sun's location moved to the edge of the Milky Way. Singh demonstrates how each step was proposed, considered and contested, then accepted with additional data. With hindsight, the conclusions all appear obvious. At the time of each new concept's proposal, \\"established\\" views held sway until overwhelming evidence displaced them.No proposal was so hotly disputed as the notion that the cosmos began as a tiny region which rapidly expanded - the Big Bang. Although first proposed in different terms by a Belgian priest, Georges Lemaitre, the idea of explosive beginnings of the universe were generally dismissed. The supporting evidence was lacking and other considerations impaired its acceptance. Not the least of these was the religious connotations arising from the idea of a \\"creation point\\". In fact, the term \\"Big Bang\\" was a derisive term applied to the concept by one of its greatest critics, Fred Hoyle. Hoyle, with a shifting squad of supporters, proposed a \\"Steady State\\" universe in which matter was continuously being created and annihilated. Singh uses a handy set of comparison charts to show how evidence and the issues are balanced in the two theories. Bound to both theses was the question of the universe's age.In the years following World War II, however, technology generated by that conflict provided researchers with a fresh, if previously used, tool kit. Radio telescopy, a true product of \\"war surplus\\" equipment, led to new discoveries. Of the many findings, the one most damaging to Hoyle's Steady State universe came from two scientists trying to reduce static in transcontinental telephone calls. Singh's description of Penzias and Wilson combatting the homing, nesting and excretory habits of a pair of pigeons is typical of his conversational style. It's also a paean to the dedicated researchers who persevered to complete their task. Coupled with radio telescopy was the improvement in spectroscopy - the chemistry of stars. Contributing new information on stellar age had the bizarre impact of clarifying and obscuring the duration of the universe's existence.Understanding the history of our learning the structure of the universe is one thing - grasping the physics and chemistry is quite another. Singh's great talent is being able to convey both with equal facility and clarity. He knows how to summarize without losing meaning. The \\"sketches\\" concluding each chapter are visual summaries that might have been his composing notes. The bibliography is useful, but with the number of books on the topics, it reflects necessarily limited choices. There are countless books on the history and physics of cosmology. Is this one preferable to most? Is it more important than the others? The answer to both questions is a vehement, if qualified, \\"Yes!\\". To someone new to the topic, Singh has provided an informative welcome. Does he justify his subtitle? That remains questionable, but it's clear he's correct in asserting \\"you need to know about it\\". [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Simon Singh is an adept popular science writer. His first significant book was Fermat's Enigma which was an entertaining and informative chronicle of the solution to Fermat's Last Theorem. Then there was the Code Book which provided a nice history of cryptography. Now, in Big Bang, Singh deals with one of the biggest questions of them all: how did the universe begin?Actually, for astronomy junkies - those who've read books like Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe or Hawkings's Brief History of Time - Big Bang is probably a little tame and won't offer much new insight. Singh's audience is the general reader, one who may understand what the Big Bang is but not how the concept was arrived at.Singh starts with the ancient Greeks and the origins of science. Soon enough, we read of Copernicus and his revolutionary idea that the Earth was not the center of the universe. Through Galileo, Kepler, Newton and others, the design of the universe kept changing, sometimes radically (geocentric to heliocentric) and sometimes more subtly (circular orbits to elliptical ones). Then things began to move beyond the solar system to look at the Milky Way: did it contain all the stars in the universe or were there other galaxies as well? The determination that there were many galaxies and that they seemed to mostly receding from each other led to a somewhat startling idea: if the galaxies are moving away from each other, they must have been closer in the past and at some point, they were all in one place.The Big Bang theory would have its fair share of opposition, most notably from Fred Hoyle; ironically, it was Hoyle who wound up coming up with the term \\"Big Bang.\\" The icing on the theoretical cake, however, would come with the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background, an actual remnant from the Big Bang.While superficially a book about the Big Bang, what Singh actually is writing about is how scientific thought develops, how new ideas arise from old. The Big Bang, like evolution, quantum theory or many other concepts, was not just a wild idea unsupported by facts; instead, it is the end result of a series of logical conclusions. In an era when scientific thought is often questioned (look at topics like global warming or evolution), Big Bang shows that - while not perfect - science is often the most reasonable source for answers about the fundamental nature of both the universe and ourselves."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Almost everyone has heard of \\"The Big Bang\\" and its claim that the Universe began with an \\"explosion\\" from an infinitesimally small point some fifteen billion years ago. It is one of those terms that everyone needs to know something about in order to be connected to the larger culture. You don't have to agree with it or believe, but you need to know about it. This book is a terrific way to gain an overview of the theory, its history, and its connection to the history of astronomy since Ptolemy and the earth centered universe.\\"The Big Bang\\" is a terrific read because Simon Singh is an exceptionally talented writer who is able to open even arcane subjects for the general reader. He has a special gift for knowing just how much a subject needs to be simplified while leaving it just challenging enough to make the reader think a bit and puzzle things out in order to appreciate the intellectual change the new insight represents. Mr. Singh also humanizes the story by keeping the men and women who made these discoveries front and center.It is the human rivalries, their mistakes, and their genius that attracts us and keeps us turning the pages to find out what happens next. And what a cast this book has. Just some of the big names are Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Brahe, Kepler, Newton, Hubble, Hoyle, and Einstein. There are dozens of important names I am not listing here simply because they aren't as well known as they deserve to be.I love the story of how Eratosthenes made a pretty good calculation of the circumference of the earth using a stick, a well, some careful measurements, and trigonometry. Once that distance is known, figuring out the size and distance of the moon and the Sun are not that hard. Singh takes on a journey of expanding horizons, difficult intellectual puzzles, ever better observations, and hypotheses that get confirmed or drop away.Fred Hoyle and his Steady State model is presented as a hero and a genius in this story. You can read the book to learn more about this model and its modifications. However, you should know that it was Hoyle who solved the problem of how the heavier elements are synthesized in stars. It involved an excited state of carbon that had more mass than regular carbon 12. Singh feels that Hoyle was shamefully treated in his later years and from what we read here it is easy to agree.Singh informs us that proponents for a quasi-steady state model still exist. However, after COBE and WMAP have confirmed the variation in the background radiation that would indicate an uneven state in the early universe that allowed for the formation of galaxies and other structures, Singh says the current weight of evidence is strongly in favor of \\"The Big Bang\\".This really is a fine book for the general reader. Unless you are already fully conversant in cosmology, this book can add to your knowledge and is a very enjoyable read.I don't say this often, but I believe everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This book is mis-titled; it does not delve into a chronology of the occurrence of the Big Bang event itself, as it is currently understood by scientists, but rather a historical overview of the scientific effort that resulted in the theory.As a lay-person's introduction to the history of astronomy and cosmology, the book is fine, although a bit basic for my taste. For example, I've never studied physics or astronomy, but generally already knew much of the information on the Greeks, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Tycho Brahe, Einstein, etc. Those tired descriptions of special and general relativity, and the expanding universe as a balloon are wheeled out once again.I was disappointed in the book because I enjoyed Fermat's Enigma and The Code Book so much. I had high expectations for this book to be more technical. For example, I felt that glowing testimonials on the process and value of the scientific method detracted from the focus and rigor of the book. As an example, we have an off-topic tangent on \\"paradigm shift\\" within the process of scientific progress. Perhaps Singh has dumbed-down the material too much. Quite patronizing were the chapter-ending \\"notebook\\" sketches which summarized points from each respective chapter. These only served to confirm that the book seemed targeted at a high-school level audience. For readers with little science background, the book should be accessible.The formal chapters of this 2004 book abruptly end with the announcement of the COBE result in 1992; advances of the next 12 years are relegated to an Epilogue. Formalizing my disappointment was Figure 103, a reproduction of a 1992 newspaper article which provided me with perhaps more details of the sort I was hoping the book itself would contain. For example, the book has little or no mention of matter versus anti-matter, quarks, W+ W- Z particles, which are all shown in the clipping.A glaring flaw is the absence of the mention of inflation, Big Crunch, type Ia supernovae, dark energy, and dark matter until the last few pages of this epilogue. Quite a trick for a 500 page book on its purported subject. Many of these topics have been known or debated for decades. For example, the recent WMAP refinement in the age of the universe is only mentioned in the caption to an image! This caption (Figure 104) raises several points which leave the reader wanting more details. Why was so much text spent on COBE when its results were superseded by WMAP, which gets only passing mention? One could be left with the idea that not much is going on in this field since 1992.The book spends a lot of time building what I considered a straw-man argument about the steady-state universe versus the Big Bang. No serious scientist today doubts the latter, and I found Singh's approach tedious and inexplicably dated; a sort of preaching to the choir. As I waded through the very interesting but here belabored scientific advances of the 20th century, my overwhelming sense was, \\"get on with it.\\"As further evidence of the target audience level for this book, note that after the Epilogue, there is a short section, \\"What is Science\\" which declares, \\"This book is a history of the Big Bang Model, but at the same time it attempts to provide an insight into what science is and how it works.\\" I wished I had read the first part of this statement before starting the book so I wouldn't have been expecting a play-by-play account of the Big Bang event, which is not satisfactorily provided here.I quote from the Epilogue regarding current research in cosmology: \\"The rest of this epilogue [about 16 pages] is a brief dip into some of those still to be resolved issues and details. A few paragraphs cannot hope to convey the subtlety, depth and true significance of any of these problems.\\" True, perhaps, but I thought that's what the whole book was for."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This is a remarkably accessible book but caution is advised. The only reason for that is that this is not a purely scientific book. I would categorize this book at a science history book. The title of the book is a bit misleading although if you are not familiar with the Big Bang theory, this can be an excellent start because no one can actually write science history without describing the theories involved to at least some extent.Singh has started the story with the Greek scientists, traversed thru the geocentric world view, Copernicus, Galileo and worked his way towards the modern theories of the universe in an excellent, cohesive manner. Extremely readable and immensely enjoyable. Scientific theories and personalities involved go hand in had thru out the book.The theories, especially the theory of Big Bang are not discussed in-depth but I don't think that the author was even trying to do that. I think this book's audience is people who either don't know anything about these interesting cosmological theories or people who know a lot about these theories but might not know a whole lot about the personalities involved.I had not read anything by Simon Singh before this book and the only reason I bought this book was that it was being offered on a huge discount in my local bookshop. After reading this, I realized that this book is worth every penny of the list price, let alone the bargain price that I had to pay for it.The only somewhat boring part of the book was the one that dealt with the development of telescopes. Although important, I think Singh gave too much space to that section."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"It seems there is a diverse discussion going on about Singh's latest book, here's my take on it.Everyone loves his masterpiece Fermat's Enigma, and for good reasons; but Big Bang is as a matter of fact a very similar book. It is equally brilliantly researched, with the same fantastic style of making complex concepts tangible by painting a picture of the personalities and the historic events around the discoveries.The only explanation that I can come up with why some people seem to not have enjoyed it that much is that most readers might have more general knowledge about astronomy or cosmology than about number theory. With me, it was the other way around; I knew most of the things in Fermat's Enigma, but I picked up some things reading the Big Bang.The other criticism to Big Bang is that it doesn't touch the latest developments. But again, only natural, Singh doesn't write about speculations, he writes about commonly accepted facts. So he has to be well behind the current research. Besides that: Let him have some ground to cover for his next book!My take on Big Bang is that it is a fantastic Encyclopedia (includes a great index) on how the theory about the beginning of the universe developed over the last several thousand years.At the same time, it reads like a mixture of a suspension novel and a set of biographies of some very colorful personalities.So if you expect dry scientific style, stay away from it. If you want to read a book that leads you just about as deep into the topics so that you don't have to read a single sentence twice in order to fully understand the concept, buy it now!"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"In recent years there has been a proliferation of cosmology books aimed at the broad reading public. Simon Singh's \\"Big Bang\\" is one of latest in this growing collection. In his latest work Singh discusses the development of the Big Bang theory in the latter part of the twentieth century.Overall, I found Big Bang an enjoyable book. It is easy to read and clearly geared toward the non-scientist. Singh writes in a concise and non-technical manner yet is still able to effectively communicate key theoretical concepts. I offer a few thoughts on the book for prospective buyers:The weakest part of the book is the opening chapter wherein the author attempts to summarize the full gambit of pre-twentieth century cosmological concepts. I appreciate Singh's attempt to provide this background information, however, the brevity of his summary resulted in a somewhat superficial and stereotypical discussion (e.g. relationship between the. church and science). Many of the issues touched on in this overview are interesting and important topics that warrant a more detailed and even-handed analysis.Singh's discussion of modern cosmology and many of its leading personalities was particularly well down. From my perspective the book moved at a crisp pace and the author achieved the right balance of information and entertainment for an introductory-level book such as this. Singh is especially adept at conveying the excitement of cutting edge science - I would recommend it to high school students who are interested in science - its can be motivational as well as informative.Singh also does a nice job of using the Big Bang theory to demonstrate the resistance that sometimes exists within the scientific community. Contrary to what outsiders may think, science and the scientific community are influenced by individual beliefs and ambitions. Singh notes that the scientific communities, like many other groups, can be rather hostile to those who challenge excepted dogma and slow to accept change. A good example of this type of dogmatism can be seen in the Darwinist response to recent questions regarding evolutionary theory.Overall, good book, I recommend it to anyone seeking a popular level introduction to Big Bang cosmology. For readers seeking more detail regarding on-going developments in this fascinating area I suggest Ferris's \\"The Whole Shebang\\" and Seife's \\"Alpha and Omega\\"."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"In general, I loved this book and it's historical approach to big bang theory. I am familiar with the basics of the big bang theory, but I really did not know much about how the theory developed (aside from Hubble's redshifted galaxy observations), and found the story of theory to be fascinating. This book is not meant to be a physics textbook, so if that's what you're looking for, you will be disappointed. It's just supposed to be a popular science book that tells where the big bang theory came from, and how it developed over the years, and in that regard, it does a fabulous job.Singh does an excellent job of humanizing the scientists that were responsible for cosmological discoveries. He tells the tale of their lives, and gives you feeling that you actually know these great astronomers and theorists on a personal level. I also like his candid approach to explaining how the cultural climate (ie. religion, politics, war, the \\"establishment,\\" etc.) effects scientific advancement.\\"The Big Bang\\" is not without fault, however. One thing that is a little annoying about the book is that it leaves you with unanswered questions. For instance Singh does a great job of summarizing the Steady State Theory, but fails to explain how Steady State Theorists reconciled the idea of continuous creation with the Law of Conservation of Matter. It's easy to imagine that with the Big Bang a finite amount of matter/energy was created once and that evermore it must follow the Laws of Conservation. But with Steady State Theory, how can matter be continually created if matter cannot be created or destroyed according to the Law of Conservation of Matter? This paradox is not even addressed.Furthermore, I was flabberghasted at how Singh acted like there was no longer controversy between science and religion. In his epilogue he states that \\"Even the Church has grown to love the Big Bang model.\\" I don't know if things are so different in the UK that Singh is just not in touch with the culture here in the US, but nothing could be farther from the truth around here. Most Christians I know, unfortunately, believe in the literal, inerrant word of the bible, and find the Big Bang to be nothing short of heresy. In fact, being unfamiliar with the history behind BBT, I was shocked to learn that an ordained priest first proposed the theory and that it was considered by Steady Staters to be a theory to propogate God through science. The tables have quite decidedly turned completely, and I was disappointed that the controversy between creationism and bbt wasn't addressed more adequately. Perhaps fundamentalists would be more apt to accept science if their concerns about the bbt's compatibility with their beliefs were validated and addressed. Because they are not, Singh has limited his potential audience to those of us who are already unhampered by dogma.And for that popular audience, \\"The Big Bang\\" is a great read if you want to know how it all began."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Simon Singh arranges the historical development of the big bang theory in a superb way drawing in ancient elements such as the Greek philosphers and atronomers right up to the recent data obtained by the COBE satellite. The big bang theory is a very unique one in that it predicts the method by which it can be verified or dismissed. Should the theory be correct then there should remain a residual background radiation and if this weak background radiation can be detected it would surely add indisputable evidence that the universe did indeed originate with one very BIG BANG! The chapters are very easy to read and only include mathematical equations when appropriate. Suprisingly, there is very little citation and referencing of comments and therefore sourcing the original material is not possible.The story of the big bang theory can be used to highlight how science works and develops and indeed how paradigm shifts can occur in science."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This is a very exciting book on the origin of the universe. BookTV has an author interview available on tape from January 2005. The author, Simon Singh, does a great job of making the theory of the Big Bang come alive for the general reader. For the reader who is not yet aware, the history of cosmology in the hands of a talented author makes for exciting, interesting and informative reading."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I grabbed this book the first time I saw it and felt immediately drawn into reading it. It is not a book that breaks new ground. As pointed out by another reviewer, the stories of the Greeks, Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, and Einstein are well known by anyone not new to the topic of Cosmology. However, that being said, I think the book is a worthwhile read anyway. Certainly, as an amature anstronomer I think the book belongs on ones shelf for reference if for no other reason.I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the Cosmos. It's written for the lay person and for that reason gets my recommendation."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Simon Singh writes about the big topic - the origin of the universe - in a way that is comprehensive, engaging, and fun. He brings to life people and ideas in a highly accessible and readable manner.The history of cosmology is presented idea-by-idea, experiment-by-experiment, building a wonderful story of science and human imagination. Each scientific description is followed by a practical example elucidating the topic and keeping the material fresh. One such welcome example came for me as I began to fog over on Cepheid variability. My foggy interest was immediately enlightened by the analogy of a flashing lighthouse and its brightness. The book is filled with wonderful examples to back up the science.I highly recommend this book to anyone, lay or professional, of any age, with a general interest in the Big Bang theory, or in the history of the universe. You will not be disappointed. The \`further reading' section will guide you to more information in any area that you find particularly interesting. I applaud Mr. Singh's graceful writing style on a subject that has all too often been lost in arcane footnotes.Lastly, don't let the size of this work fool you. It's a breezy fun read. And there is a surprise at the end of each chapter..."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I doubt that I am alone in believing the reason so many U.S. public school graduates grow up hating math and science is due to the fact that the topics are typically presented as dauntingly difficult, impenetrably arcane and mind-numbingly boring. Enter Simon Singh who does what few writers are able to do in informing the math and science illiterate --i.e., make the subject matter both accessable and interesting. Had I been exposed at a younger age to the science history and theory Singh provides the reader in the Big Bang (as well as in his two other books, Fermat's Enigma and The Code Book), I am certain I would have been far less intimidated, much more inquisitive and, inevitably, better informed about the wonder and magnificence of the world and universe in which we are privileged to live. Thanks to Simon Singh, I look to the heavens with a new sense of fascination, understanding and wonder."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Everything that can be said about this book has been written in other reviews here, so I won't go into detail. However...I specifically came to Amazon to review this book because it was just that great. The title is deceiving in that it is about MUCH MORE than just the Big Bang. It is as if the entire Bible were titled \\"The Story of Joshua.\\"The book gives a fascinating look at the history of science, and religion's views on science, from prehistory to the modern Big Bang theory. How did mythology evolve into scientific reasoning? How did the ancients view the heavens and explain their observations? How can we tell how far away other stars and Galaxies are? How do we know the universe is expanding? And what are the implications of an expanding universe? Will it expand forever or collapse back in on itself? And why do we care? How did geniuses like Galileo make their discoveries, and why were they persecuted by the Church?Besides exploring these and many other questions, Singh gives us a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the physicists who made the greatest discoveries in cosmology, how they came to their conclusions, and the rivalry between competing views and personalities in the world of astronomy and cosmology.And... Singh explains how the ancients correctly calculated the diameter of the earth, and the distances to the sun and moon, and does so in a way that almost anyone can understand. Even me - I didn't have a clue how they did that before reading this book. How would YOU measure the distance from the earth to the sun? This book will tell you how.Singh, in this book and his other writings, takes his place with Asimov and Sagan among the great science writers who seemingly so easily make the most complex aspects of science accessible to the casual reader. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I found myself disapointed with this book by the time I got to the end. It might be because I know a little about the subject, so my expectations for the book were judging it unfairly. But I think the book did set up for what should be a good discussion of an important theory, but then failed to come through with the details.The book turns out to be a walk through the park of science history in the development of the big bang theory, and reports to leave you off once the theory is finally accepted, once it compares well with observations. This is all well and good, but it leaves out most of the important facts in the recent history, and some glaring holes in what people would call the big bang theory today. The simple facts of the big bang theory are stated in the book, it doesn't go on to state that for most scientists there was a long standing belief that big bang theory doesn't hold up as stated, and that something needs to be added. There have been additions to the simple big bang which have been more than important, but necessary to make the big bang acceptable. And more important and related to the tone of the book, there is now observations which make the additions to the theory hold up, and finally currently accepted.The book came at a time soon after the WMAP data, and I was hoping the book would build forward to get to a good discription of how the WMAP data (and other recent data) finally make the big theory interesting, complex and hold up to observation. But this is completely missing. The most important part that is missing is how the inflationary universe actually now looks to be true. I had been following this for many years, and found that many theorists already firmly held the belief in the inflationary universe, but it was hard to believe until there was some sort of data to back it up, and there now is. Adding this in, and with the intesting tone of the book would be a great help, and useful. But without it the book feels like it is missing a large part of the story.I was complaining to my wife about this, and she had no idea what I was talking about, which probably at this point neither do you. Which is why I think the world is still waiting for the great book, writen for a popular audience, about the big bang. She suggested that maybe I should write it. Not sure about that, but it is clear after reading this book, someone should, there is a great subject out there, still waiting for a great book, because this one missed it.I an sure that Simon Singh must know this, and perhaps he found that he couldn't include everything in discussions with his editor. Maybe this book should be called \\"The big bang, vol.1 - getting to a theory\\", and now he sould go on to write, \\"The big bang, vol.2 - the whole story\\"."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I bought this book expecting it to be along the lines of Singh's previous books -- a somewhat sophisticated but also challenging overview of the subject, in this case the strengths and weaknesses of various models of contemporary astrophysics and cosmology. But I have to agree with another reviewer who points out that the book is at best mis-titled and at worst very introductory and shallow.I think that the problem with the book is the expectation set by the title (and also the book jacket text). It's not really about the Big Bang in any significant way. Rather, it's a survey of how people from the ancient Greeks to today thought about the universe, the position of human beings within that universe, and what that all implied for the origin and eventual fate of the universe. As a survey, of course, it does pretty well, but I was left with the feeling that I wanted a little more. In other words, I don't need yet another introduction as to how Copernicus decided that the sun was the center of the universe, or how Einstein fudged his calculations because a universe with a beginning didn't quite fit in with his view of the world. We all learned about Copernicus in grade school, and it's not very interesting to hear the story yet again. I'd rather hear about current debates in the field about what really happened at T plus a glimmer of a nanosecond after the Big Bang. Singh glosses over this at the end of the book very quickly.Another issue is that far too frequently the book seems more like an extended outline for a Discovery Channel documentary than a work meant to stand on its own. It's hard to articulate this concern of mine, but if you read the book you'll see what I mean. The focus on the individuals involved is certainly interesting, but you can almost see in your mind the old stock footage of Einstein wandering through Princeton, thinking great thoughts, or Hoyle with his eye glued to a telescope. It's a little distracting.Standing on its own, the book is a solid introduction, but not anything more. I think my frustration is more a result of the \\"false advertising\\" in the title and promotions than flaws in the book itself, but I would say that anyone who has read virtually any popular science book about these issues will be disappointed. I can't say I learned anything new from reading this book. If you're looking for a more sophisticated yet still accessible work on the Big Bang, read \\"The First Three Minutes\\" by Steven Weinberg -- it may be an older book, but it is significantly more challenging and deep in its approach to basically the same subject."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"The author attempts to rationalize the origin of the universe.He demystifies the big bang theory. By theory and observation,his hypothesis is that the cosmic universe is expanding.According to Richard Feynman, the physicist, \\" if your guessdisappears with experience-it's wrong\\" . The Big Bang theoryevolved from Einstein's theory of relativity. It was transformedinto a theory of an expanding universe. The work contains someclassic contrasts between the Big Bang and the Steady State theories and hypotheses.Big Bang Theory_________________- the universe is young- there is a big bang echo- predicts observed (H/He) ratio- the universe age is unpredictableSteady State Theory____________________- the universe is eternal- there is no big bang echo- matter contains an abundance of atomsThis book poses some very complex scientific issues simply.It would be valuable to a wide constituency in the scientific/academic community. Students of mathematics and physics willappreciate the references to Einstein's work throughout."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"For this reader with a lot formal education, but very little of it in the physical sciences, Simon Singh's \`Big Bang' was phenomenally interesting, engaging, intellectually stimulating, readable, and educational. Others with more background in cosmology may find it too basic. Singh takes the reader through the history of cosmology as he builds toward an explanation of the Big Bang theory. The opening chapter explains the ancient's earth-centered (and common sensical) view of the universe and its downfall at the hands of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler and Galileo. Later chapters follow the disproof of ether, Einstein's special and general theories of relativity, and the \`great debate' between the supporters of a static universe and Lemaitre and others who supported the idea of an expanding (Big Bang) universe.A large portion of the book follows the scientific efforts to gather evidence to support one view or the other. The renowned Edwin Hubble and the less so Henrietta Leavitt played key roles in finally providing enough evidence supporting the Big Bang theory to at least make it a credible argument. The remainder of the book follows the debate between the solid state theorists led by Fred Hoyle and the Big Bang backers led first by Gamow and Alpher, but later by others who resolved some of the nagging doubts about the theory, for example, the crucial 1992 proof of tiny variations in cosmic microwave background radiation.Each chapter (at least in the P.S. version) has handy summary notes. Singh provides a useful glossary as well as recommended further readings for each chapter.I generally read 50-75 books a year and rate The Big Bang as one of my top five books of the year. Five measly stars don't do it justice. I will resist the temptation to rate as a supernova, but this book greatly enhanced my understanding of the world around us and was a joy to read.Absolutely the highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"An eminently readable review of the history of the science behind the big bang theory of the moment of creation. Begining with the Greeks and progressing step by step, this book introduces the personalities, the methods and simplified explanations of the body of observations and facts which lead to our current view and explanations of the universe we live in. I can recall no better summary of the grand progress of our understanding of the universe which we inhabit."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"When you get through the hype associated with mainstream physics you are left with trying to find logical support for its most cherished assumptions. Singh does no better than anyone else at propping up the fast fading concept of a big bang. At least 6 different assumptions, none of which can be proven, are needed to establish the existence of a Big Bang. Singh fails miserably in his attempt to find logical support for a Big Bang."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I loved this book. As someone who has had a fascination with astronomy and the cosmos for most of my life, I found this book to be both informative and simple to follow. The author walks you, step-by-step, through the process of HOW they figured out the Earth revolves around the Sun, then all the way through each subsequent (significant) breakthrough. By the time you're finished, you have a basic, but clear, understanding of the important discoveries and the Big Bang.If I have any criticism, it is the fact that there were some key explanations that he did NOT explain as well as most of the rest of the book. I'm sure entire volumes could be written about some topics in the book, but even with highly complex theories being proven, he did an excellent job explaining them. So why did he skip these?- He skipped completely over how they made a leap from the idea that galaxies were receding inside of space to the fact that all of space was expanding. He stated it as a fact, but did not explain how they determined this.- More significant, I found it odd that he completely skipped explaining mass defect, or how or why there is a loss of mass during fission. He just stated it as fact. But the rest of the book he walks you through each step of how they discovered the next step in proving the Big Bang, so why not explain HOW or WHY there is a loss of mass in fission to generate energy?- The density of the universe was stated, mathematically, but how does one calculate density if you're not certain of the volume? He stated the average density of the universe, but I found this to be a little presumptuous considering that no mention was made as to how the actual (or estimated) volume of the universe was calculated. What if beyond the last \\"layer\\" of galaxies, there are millions of light years of empty space, thus reducing the average density? And if we know this isn't true, why skip over explaining how we know it's true?All in all, I could not put the book down!"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This is a very well written book which takes you from the early discovery of the solar system through modern arguments for/against the big bang. It contain enough details to keep it interesting. A nice book."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Other than that, this book is nearly flawless! It is an historical overview of all the scientific endeavors that lead to the discovery and ultimately acceptance of the big bang model of the origin of the universe, but it reads like a drama. There are many interesting characters who greatly contributed in various ways, and their scientific achievements as well as personal stories makes this book a page turner.The author begins with some of humanities very earliest knowledge of the cosmos. He even explains in simple terms how once we were able to calculate the size of the earth, we were able to approximate the sizes of both the sun and moon as well as their distances, all using elementary methods. The story continues as we learn about the discoveries of Kepler, Galileo, Newton, and other famous names in the \\"classical\\" understanding of the universe. One thing that was very interesting was how the author made the case that at the time, humanity had very good reasons for holding to geocentrism, including geocentrism's ability to predict things as well as the inability to detect the parallax shifts. This was due to the fact that the stars were WAY further from us then we could have possibly imagined. The justification for holding to geocentrism in then contrasted with the fact that as our telescopes improved, many scientists refused to accept the new theory and wanted to cling to the old. This is also seen when the author discusses Einstein's theory of relativity. His theory implied an overthrow of some of Newton's theories, which seemed to be tried and true tested. But that was because of the scale that we were working with. It was with Einstein's theory of relativity that some of the scientific community began to see that the universe may have begun to exist, and so the big bang model begins to form. From here, we meet many fascinating characters, including Gamow and Hubble. The author goes on to explain many of the phenomena that the big bang model could not explain at the time, and then shows when it was explained, by whom, and how. It was a very fascinating and easy read. One does not need to know much science (if any) to appreciate this book and the drama that is the story of the big bang."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"The Big Bang provides an incredible, in-depth, detailed overview of the history of cosmology. From the founding fathers of science to 20th century geniuses, Simon Singh provides incredible detail into each of their lives and contributions. I felt that the writing style was very smooth and easy to read. Even if I weren't at all interested in science, reading this book would have been very, very easy and fun. Overall, it's a great book, even if you've never felt naturally inclined towards science."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This time, in his 3rd book with the similar approach, Simon Singh dwelves into the world of Cosmology (leaving Fermat's Theorem and Coding Theory behind) with the intension of popularizing this field, making it approachable for a broader audience. Does he succeed? Yes, he does (as always this far).Starting out with the presentation of thoughts on the universe by Greek philosophers, continuing with outlining the ideas (and personalities) of, for instance, Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galilei & Einstein, and in the final run describing the back-and-forth battle between the believers of a stationary in contrast to a expanding universe (assuming an infinitely old universe in contrast to creation through a 'Big bang') he takes us on a long, but both fascinating and inspirational journey.Throughout this trip, we are exposed to a rich amount of facts corresponding to thoughts and derivations based on scientific logic and brilliance from such diverse fields as atomic theory, general physics, chemistry, mathematics and (of course) astronomy. Though the mathematics are kept to a minimum, it might help the reader to be to some extent acquainted with scientifc reasoning based on logical arguments and to hold some tiny insight into the world of academics.You will meet a set of truly outstanding personalities and make your way through the accumulation of knowledge (in the paradigm-sense) through brilliant theories and observations, all presented in a logically, lively, well-structured and exciting way. You will most likely learn exlicitly by absorbing the actual content, and implicitly through kick-starting your knowledge-searching inherent ability, ending up a brighter and/or better person so to speak.

Impressive!]"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"\\"Big Bang\\" is a very informative book which not only elucidates the history of the Big Bang theory, but begins by documenting the history of cosmology in general from many different civilizations, from Pythagoras to Hubble.Every aspect of the Big Bang theory is discussed from redshift to elemental synthesis, and it is all explained is simple English (well as simple as nuclear physics can get anyway!). The history of modern cosmology is also well documented, discussing Hubble, Hoyle and Lemaitre, to mention just a few. An immense amount of research has been done by Singh for this book, and for this reason I regard it as a vital source for anyone who has a love for science and/or the history of science and cosmology.An extremely enjoyable read! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Singh managed to present potentially complicated material in a manner that a regular person could understand. It was actually a fun and quick read. I thought that understanding such theories are beyond my reach before I read this book. I am truely thankful that Singh wrote this book. (When I say regular person, it presumes that the person have at least take some basic physics in highschool or one physics class in college. Just to give you more idea, when I recently attempted to read a quantum physics intro book, I was lost most of the ways, but I think I understand close to 100% of this book.) I would give it a 6 star if I can."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"As I thumbed through this book in the bookstore prior to purchasing it, I got the impression it would be about how science discovered the Big Bang and how the Big Bang came to be canonized in cosmology. That is exactly what Simon Singh did with this book. Some of us have science backgrounds, and so much of the first half of the book is seen as unnecessary or at least too long. Those with no science background may have enjoyed the stories of Copernicus, Kepler, etc. more than Hoyle's hurt feelings later in the saga.I feel Singh accomplished what he set out to do. It's too long, and I think he could have summarized much of the early history of astronomy and our understanding of the basics of our galaxy. This is a pretty petty concern, and I'll admit it. I wanted to find out how the Big Bang even entered someone's mind, and I wanted to know just how supported and accepted it is (and why).

In this book, He describes the history and evolution of our understanding of the universe by introducing the key human figures who contributed to this noble quest. This book is certainly the most reachable account of cosmology I have encountered to date.Chapter 1 follows the progress of Astronomy from ancient Greece until the door steps of the 20th century. It explores the various competing models that have been proposed to describe the universe. Some of the heroes encoutered here are Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo. Chapter 2 is mostly concerned with Einstein's general theory or Relativity and its implications on out understanding of the universe. It also introduces the notions of the Big bang and the steady state universe. Chapter 3 discusses the great debate between supporters of the Big Bang Model and the Steady state Model of the universe. It also explores the efforts of cosmologists to measure distances to stars and some of the ingenious techniques they utilized. The bulk of the chapter is concerned with the ground breaking discoveries of Edwin Hubble. Chapter 4 describes how the few remaining obstacles facing the Big Bang model were finally leveled. The Epilogue discusses some of the problems still facing our understanding of the universe and speculates over such questions as \\"What came before the Big Bang?\\".I gave this book four out of five because (1) Very little if any mention is made of more recent advances in our vision of the big bang. (2) Some of hottest topics that certainly deserved a place in the bulk of the book are only mentioned in passing in the epilogue. (3) It gets a bit too superficial at times, (4) It lacks almost any coverage of quantum physics or string theory which have been so instrumental to our understanding of the universe.BOTTOM LINE: Readers with little or no prior knowledge of cosmology will love this book. Those with even a mediocre background will not get much out of it."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"An excellent book. Reads like a novel. Great for someone like me who knows a little physics but hasn't updated it since discussing brewons and beerins with a physicist friend twenty years ago at university.Singh tells the story well and gets the reader to understand why it matters.

I've enjoyed his books a lot, his style is both entertaining and educational at the same time. Big Bang is no different. By focusing his story on the colourful characters instead of equations, Singh makes the book easy to approach.There's one thing to notice: the book is less about the Big Bang itself and more about the theory of Big Bang. Singh starts from the ancient Greek, describing how the whole concept of science was born and developed. Much of the book is devoted to the argument between Big Bang and steady-state universe theories. After reading this book, the reader will be familiar with the scientific process and the evolution of scientific paradigms.Another success for Singh, and I'm definitely looking forward to whatever he's doing next. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Simon Singh's retelling of how the Big Bang theory came about and was confirmed, is an epic tale of how good science is supposed to be done and is supposed to work. It gives a detailed, yet a panoramic view of how we emerged from an era of myth, superstition, and intellectual darkness to the frontiers of the science of Cosmology, Astronomy, Astro and Nuclear physics.The book is organized into five chapters with an epilogue. However, the most important aspect of the book is that each chapter contains a valuable handwritten and annotated summary with diagrams that can be used to further consolidate ones understanding by visualizing the diagrams, as a way to peek ahead, or to skip interim chapters to more quickly get to the meaty portions of the book. I have used the chapter headings and those summaries as a guide to writing the rest of this review:1.In the BeginningThe story begins at the beginning of science and thus with the Greeks, and continues through contemporary attempts to consolidate the latest findings on the Big Bang Theory. It touches on all of the historical signposts in between, and summarizes the contributions and idiosyncrasies of the cast of characters from the Greeks onwards.It then moves from the Greeks to the Arabs who proved to be the intellectual caretakers of civilization during the Dark Ages, when the Western World was still in an 800-year old intellectual slumber. As the author points out: the same Moors who conquered Spain, were the ones who, after the burning of the great Library of Alexandria, managed to salvage and save for posterity, most of the science the Greeks had invented.Singh then goes on to describe the work and idiosyncrasies of the great giants of scientific discovery and their respective contributions to Big Bang Cosmology. Here, there are many interesting stories to be told and Singh tells them all very well and with a comedic flair.But more importantly, we learn, through Singh's careful descriptions, how the scientific process actually works: its essence being that in the end it must match reality and be open to testing. We also learn about how a Greek Librarian, Eratosthenes, using only logic and the geometry of congruent triangles, was the first to estimate the distance from the earth to the sun and moon and to estimate their sizes and rotation speeds.The reader becomes a spectator to the historical controversy over whether the known universe was geo or helio-centric. Here we see how common sense (what Einstein called the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen) can be over-rated and how the influence of religion and racial prejudices can undermine scientific pursuits.Common sense had suggested that the earth must have been both stationary and flat. Otherwise, many thought that on a round and moving earth, people in the Southern Hemisphere would have fallen off. Theologians supported the geocentric model because it was consistent with the Bible. And Westerners as a whole trusted and believed that the Greeks could do no wrong -- even though most of what the Greeks did was filled with errors and even though their philosophical hero, Aristotle, believed that men had more teeth than women. It seemed that the great philosopher, who was married four times, failed to take the time to discover that all of his wives had the same number of teeth as he did.Central to what emerged later was the invention of the telescope and the debates over early models of the universe; namely those of, Copernicus, Ptolemy, and Galileo.2.Theories of the UniverseThe question that animated Cosmology up until the 20th Century was this: Was the universe created or had it existed for eternity? Einstein's theories of relativity, especially his General Theory, dealing with gravity, changed the context of this question. With the general theory, gravity ceased to be a mystery and the entire universe quickly came under the legitimate scope for scientific scrutiny, hypothesizing and empirical testing.The implication of Einstein's gravitational theory was enormous. Among others, it suggested that the universe was NOT static and had NOT existed for eternity, and more importantly, that it was probably unstable as well. The potential impact of this last point was one that even Einstein himself could not stomach. It caused him so much angst in fact that he added his own \\"fudge factor\\" called the \\"Cosmological Constant\\" to ensure against the universe being unstable. He would later describe this \\"fudge factor\\" as the greatest mistake of his career. However, even when Einstein himself had refused to do so, the Russian Physicist Alexander Friedman, and a Belgian Cosmologist and Priest, Georges Lemaitre, took Einstein's theory at face value - Cosmological Constant and all. As a result, they were the first to put forth the fullest implications of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity: the Big Bang theory.3.The Great DebateAlthough Einstein's General Theory of Relativity had set the stage for the great debate about the origin of the universe, the debate itself had to wait until empirical evidence could catch up with theoretical developments. In fact, there were two great debates going on at once: One, taking place on the theoretical plane, the other, on the empirical plane. The theoretical debate centered on the question of whether the universe is static and eternal, or dynamic and finite? The empirical debate centered on the question of whether nebulae seen through telescopes were a part of our Milky Way, or part of another more distant and completely detached galaxic system?This latter debate brought us fully into the modern era of empirical Astronomy, where astronomical star-gazing, with its larger and more precise telescopes, began to allow Astronomers to measure the distances and chemical composition of stars with increasing accuracy. The pulsation of Cepheid stars became the first and for a long time the only astronomical yardstick by which the universe could be successfully reckoned. At the same time, spectroscopy demonstrated that different atoms emitted and absorbed different wavelengths of light. With these two yardsticks, an empirical revolution rivaling that of Einstein's theoretical one, had begun in earnest. It rapidly began to make its weight felt on both debates.Edwin Hubble, the last true giant of Astronomy, through incessant star-gazing and meticulous measurements, not only proved that the nebulae he saw were independent of our Milky Way, but also that the universe itself was full of such far off galaxies. And more importantly he showed that they were speeding away from our Milky Way at a rate proportional to the distance they were from it (Hubble's Law).Reasoning backwards, Hubble's measurements seem to suggest that at some point in the past, the universe must have existed in a much more condensed and a very much more compact state.4.Mavericks of the CosmosGeorges Lemaitre took Hubble's measurements as evidence that his (Lemaitre's) own theory of the Big Bang was correct. But now, with empirical tools to provide precise measurements and confirmation or falsification, the stakes had been raised immeasurably. There was a head-to-head challenge to the Big Bang Theory from some of the foremost Astronomers themselves in the form of their own version of a \\"Steady State Theory\\" of the Universe.This theory contended that the universe was indeed dynamic as the Big Bang Theory also had claimed, BUT also that the universe was replenishing itself continuously, and filling in blank spaces in the universe with created matter. Therefore, their contention was that the universe could not have begun in a cataclysmic explosion as the Big Bang theorized.If the big bang were to be proven correct, inferences and assertions about a singularity alone would no longer do the trick. The Big Bang theory would need a great deal more circumstantial and corollary support to maintain and justify its continued preeminence. Not only would it have to prove that creation began at a single point in the distant past (as a singularity or as a seed atom according to Lemaitre's formulation), but also it would have to explain how all of the chemical elements that exist within the universe had emerged as a byproduct of the initial birth-giving explosion. As well, it must also demonstrate beyond even a shadow of doubt how the stars and galaxies emerged from the Big Bang - that is it must also explain how matter emerged with its current distribution across the universe.5.Paradigm ShiftThe story of the Big Bang itself ends with the great Astronomer Federick Hoyle (who not coincidentally was one of the major proponents of the \\"Steady State Theory\\") who himself made one of the most important discoveries of our times: linking the creation of the heavier elements with the death of stars, and thus binding it to the Big Bang Theory.The first step along this journey, made by George Gamow and his colleagues, of explaining the creation of all of the elements began by explaining how hydrogen could be cooked into helium in the heat and pressure of the early years after the Big Bang. But after this discovery there was a long hiatus before Hoyle made a paradigm shifting discovery: linking the discovery of the heavier elements with the life cycle of stars, that is to the cooling effects taking place within the core of dying stars.The final pieces of the puzzle came together much later in both the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and COBE experiments respectively. The CMB experiments settled the issue of the missing background radiation from the Big Bang; and the COBE experiments demonstrated conclusively that ripples in the background radiation were enough to explain why matter is distributed in the way it is.The EpilogueFrom Singh's deft pen, we are taken on a scientific tour of how wonder about the origins of the universe went from myth, speculation and mystery to theoretical hypothesizing, and how theoretical hypothesizing was turned into a scientific (and thus a testable) hypothesis; and from a testable hypothesis to confirmed facts.Although each of the topics are covered in greater depth in any number of other books, none covers the waterfront we well as Singh has done and puts everything in such a nice readable package. This was a wonderful ride. Five Stars"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This is a must read for anyone who slept through physics (and chemistry) class in high school. Singh explains the history of astronomy with complete clarity. The book is highly entertaining as Singh describes the personalities and theories of astronomy, atoms, and the Big Bang.

Simon Singh's treatment put me off at first because he begins by recounting creation myths... so I skipped ahead in the book... noticed a little statement about what some Greek dude \\"Eratosthenes\\" did... looked HIM up in the index, read THAT part, and got HOOKED... ended up reading the book cover to cover and loving it...What I particularly like about this review of cosmology are two things. First, Singh shows how the arguments and evidence for \\"big bang\\" (i.e., a definitive start of the universe) vs. \\"steady state\\" (i.e., it's always been and always will be) evolved over time JUST LIKE the arguments and evidence for \\"sun is the center of the solar system) vs. \\"earth is the center of the solar system\\".It really shows the scientific method in action AND shows that \\"it ain't over yet\\" in that all current \\"best\\" cosmology theories remain subject to further updates.Second, along its way the book explains how the Greek dudes figured out the size of the earth, sun and moon, and the distances apart, without any tools other than geometry and thinking, and without any experimental evidence other than measuring shadows on the ground.It really shows the power of inference and extrapolation from tiny data points to looking at the entire cosmos. This point is demonstrated again as Singh reviews how astronomers figure out the size and distances of stars, galaxies, other planets, black holes etc.Singh properly acknowledges the role of WOMEN scientists in the cosmology story... though there's room for more (acknowledgement) as we work THAT kink out of our social systems..."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I read \\"The Big Bang\\" by Singh, as well as \\"The Elegant Universe\\", and \\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" by Brian Greene. All these books were good but I loved \\"The Big Bang\\" because it put forth a chronological historical approach to the big bang theory. I am a physician who is familiar with the the big bang theory, but I only had a nebulous idea about how the theory developed starting from ancient times. This book is not a physics textbook, and those seeking more details can refer to Brian Greene's 2 books.Singh gives a background life stories of the scientists involved. This book is not a comprehensive review of the Big Bang but it is a fantastic start. Once I started to read it, I had a hard time putting it down. This is in contrast to Brian Greene's books which are \\"slow reads\\" and then you have to take time to digest what was written. \\"The Big Bang\\" does not delve at all into particle physics; if it did, the book would have had to be twice as large in size.Another book that adopts a similar historical approach to science is \\"E=mc squared\\" by Bodanis. I intend to give both of these books to my high school daughter who I think will really enjoy them and maybe prompt an interest in physics!"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I've read a number of reviews of this book that criticize it because it is not \\"cutting edge\\" enough in its description of big bang theory and if it was Dr. Singh's goal to give us a look at the current popular conjectures circulating around big bang theory then he has failed miserably. If, on the other hand, his purpose was to take us through the historical scientific development that led to the big bang theory being the most prominent cosmological theory of the day, then he succeeds admirably.This is a book that begins at the beginning: with stories of myth and legend about the creation of the world. Then he quickly moves to the ancient Greeks; that is, Aristotle and Ptolemy. After that, we go through many of the big names in classical science: Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc.. In short order we reach Einstein, Hubble and many of the other important contributors to modern physics and cosmology. Along the way, we pick up much of the basic physics that is going to lead inexorably to big bang theory.There is much about this book that I like a lot. Dr. Singh is very knowledgeable and leaves out very little of importance as he teaches us how big bang theory came to be. I especially liked his focus on the experimental and observational discoveries that were crucial to the development of the theory. Too often the experimentalists get short shrift in these histories. He is also particularly good about explaining why new theories can only incrementally supersede old theories as they answer more questions and explain new observations. His \\"theory checklists\\" (see p. 34-35 for an example) are clever at showing why many people held onto the old theories (geocentrism, etc.) and why they were eventually overturned.This is not a perfect book. Dr. Singh does have a tendency to digress and his prose is not always the most absorbing; however, he has written a book that is very accessible. Any reasonably educated reader should have no trouble following along. Of course, anyone looking for an up-to-the-minute elucidation of big bang theory should look elsewhere. But if you a looking for a detailed examination of the foundation of big bang theory, you have come to the right place. This is a history, not a article of the moment. This book will be around long after the \\"cutting edge\\" books have been consigned to history."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Once again Simon Singh blew me away with his ability to explain a complex and difficult subject in an understandable and honest way. Too many popular science books either oversimply to the point where obvious questions are ignored or are fuzzy about so many details that the book becomes hard to understand. For me, Simon Singh is one of the few who can present a believable picture that's consistent and understandable. I came in trusting Singh since I know something about number theory and was impressed with the mathematically honest presentation in 'Fermat's Enigma'. Before reading his latest book, I knew next to nothing about the big bang or cosmology. I finished the book feeling like I had a fairly good high-level understanding of the subject. He presents a series of discoveries and shows how the big bang is derived from some and predicts others. He's honest about areas where there's still disagreement or a lack of information. He puts in just enough human interest to keep the story line interesting (this isn't a textbook, after all) without putting in so much that it stops seeming like a science book. I wish more people could write like Singh."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"What is the origin of the universe? What does the nighttime sky say about the manner in which this universe has evolved? How have astronomers sought to learn the answer to these and other fundamental questions? \\"Big Bang: The Origins of the Universe,\\" by physicist turned journalist Simon Singh, seeks to provide answers to these questions. It is a broad, useful overview that serves well as an introductory text for neophytes and students, but it will be disappointing to scholars of all stripes. For example, its title may mislead too many readers. Anyone seeking a cosmological discussion of the origins and evolution of the universe--and there are many very good books on this subject and a broad audience reading them--they will be disappointed with Singh's work. Instead of cosmology of the type offered by such popular science writers as James S. Trefil, John Gribbin, Brian Greene, or Paul Davies, this is a history--and a singularly linear one at that--of how the theory of the Big Bang emerged in the science community in the early part of the twentieth century and eventually came to be accepted as the standard method of explaining the origins of the universe.After two introductory chapters that lay out a generalized version of cosmology from the ancients to the beginning of the twentieth century and a discussion of Einstein and his place in astrophysics Singh relates how the notion of a Big Bang gained a foothold in the scientific discipline. He emphasizes how hotly disputed this prospect was at first, suggesting as it does that all of the matter of the universe might have been rolled into a infinitesimally small point that exploded with such force that matter moved outward, setting in motion the forces that create stars, galaxies, planets, and eventually life. Offered first by the Belgian priest and scientist, Georges Lemaitre, this concept of an explosive beginning to the universe found few adherents because of a dearth of supporting evidence. For many scientists, such a \\"creation\\" also smacked of religious ideology. The observations of Edwin Hubble on the expanding universe in the 1920s provided some of the first undisputable evidence that something violent had taken place at some point in the history of the universe.Over time, as scientific data mounted, the Big Bang gradually gained support in key scientific communities and eventually became the standard explanation of how the universe has evolved. Most of this change came in the heady years following World War II when new technologies offered startling new scientific understandings. Among the most important of these capabilities involved the radio telescope and advances in spectroscopy, employed by a myriad of researchers to collect data about the universe, to explore the chemistry of stars. They discovered that the uneven distribution of galaxies in the universe called into question other modes of explanation. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson proved to be the critical scientists in collecting and interpreting this data, finding that background radiation existed in the cosmos and gaining the Nobel Prize in 1978 for this discovery. Others followed. NASA's COBE satellite in the early 1990s discovered background radiation of varying densities clumped in various parts of the universe that could have fostered the formation of galaxies. NASA scientist John Mather received the Nobel Prize in 2006 for his path breaking work with COBE. Others dated the origins of the universe to 13.7 billion years ago, with a margin of error of +/- 200 million years.A central actor in this story was the eminent British astronomer Fred Hoyle, who coined the term \\"Big Bang\\" as a derisive label for the theory. Hoyle became the theory's most vocal and obvious critic, and offered an alternative theory labeled the \\"Steady State\\" universe that sought to counteract the \\"Big Bang\\" model. Central to his theory was a timeless universe in which matter was continuously being created and annihilated. For more than two decades his theory garnered the lion's share of support from cosmologists, but over time the weight of countervailing evidence swung against the \\"Steady State\\" model.Hoyle refused to give up on his theory despite mounting evidence supporting the \\"Big Bang,\\" however, and Singh makes much of his intransigence. One of Singh's major conclusions is explained thus: \\"Death is an essential element in the progress of science, since it takes care of conservative scientists of a previous generation reluctant to let go of an old, fallacious theory and embrace a new and accurate one\\" (p. 75). In Singh's estimation, Hoyle and his theory died together. This is an unfortunate conclusion on many levels. While there are always diehard advocates of any theory, scientific or other, in most instances scientists are persuaded by compelling evidence and that is what happened in the case of the \\"Big Bang.\\" The process of scientific advancement is much more complex than waiting for the advocates of an alternative explanation to die off. It involves alteration of models over time to take into account new data and understandings. It may, but does not always, involve the overthrow of a dominant paradigm after the facts no longer support it as Thomas S. Kuhn famously analyzed in \\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" (University of Chicago Press, 1962). There are also many instances of how scientists were more open-minded than Hoyle. For one, Harold Urey abandoned his model for the capture theory to explain the origins of the Moon when evidence went against him during the Apollo era, as historian of science Stephen G. Brush noted in \\"Fruitful Encounters: The Origin of the Solar System and of the Moon from Chamberlin to Apollo\\" (Cambridge University Press, 1996). Singh's facile explanation is both less illuminating than the complex processes of scientific discovery and incorporation of it into the body of knowledge. He does a disservice to scientists and their scientific pursuits with such easy explanations.While \\"Big Bang: The Origins of the Universe\\" is an entertaining and sometimes enlightening work, it could have been so much more. A sophisticated history of how scientists formulated, evolved, and adopted the \\"Big Bang\\" model of the universe is a noble endeavor deserving of serious scholarly attention. We have the beginnings of it in Singh's book, but historians of science have yet to tackle this important subject in their research. Potentially, the history of how the Big Bang gained primacy as a scientific explanation of the universe's origins could be a study as significant of the replacement of the Ptolemaic with the Copernican model of the solar system as explained by Kuhn. I await such a path-breaking study."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"Science shouldn't be dull, it should be stimulating.

Dr. Alpher remains amongst the \\"last Big Bang\\" men and women standing (allusion to an excellent Discover magazine article).For those interested in cosmology, this belongs on one's bookshelf as a reference, and I recommend it as such. As one very familiar with the history, I feel that Singh has made an excellent contribution to ground that has required re-examination at a time when the easier writing project on new turf is possibly more rewarding.

Second, it is very well-written, drawing out not only the science but also the human element. Third, the story is an excellent example of real science and how it is conducted, and that is vitally important in these dark days where sorcery and wishful thinking hold sway over facts and figures.The story moves rapidly but with sufficient detail from our earliest myths of cretion to modern thinking about how the universe came into being. Along the way we touch on Copericus, Newton, Galileo, Einstein and a host of other less-well known but equally important astronemers, scientists and cosmologists. Many famous battles are recounted with verve and humour: between the Church and science, between Einstein and the scientific establishment and between Hoyle and his fellow Steady-staters and the proponents of the Big Bang.

From \\"Fermat's last theorem\\" and \\"The code book\\" it was obvious that he has a real knack for writing well about interesting topics in science and mathematics. The \\"Big Bang\\" is not different. It is very well written and tells the story of cosmology with such flair that the book reads like a thriller - it's actually hard to put down (for other people, that is, I don't like thrillers). The story is told as a gradual development of theories, from the times of the Greeks to the 1990s. As always, Singh makes an emphasis on the people behind the theories and equations, which is probably what makes the book really readable, but he doesn't forget to present enough interesting scientific facts to make the book interesting from a scientific point of view as well as a historical one.Another interesting thing about this book is the attempt to explain what stands behind scientific discovery. In particular, the complementing roles of theory and experimentation in the progress of human knowledge, and how these two aspects advanced in an interleaving manner to expand our understanding of the universe.I noted that the book delved deeper in the simpler topics but left much of the more complicated theories (which arose in the second part of the 20th century) on a conceptual level. I guess this makes sense because the later theories are so complicated it would ruin the book's \\"pop-sci\\" quality to explore these topics more thoroughly. Still, I'd like to get a better understanding of this topics, to see more \\"meat\\" (i.e. equations) in the last part of the book."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"\\"The Big Bang\\" is, as you can see from other reviews, a brief history of the theory of the Big Bang genesis of the universe.

He has the ability to present complex ideas and concepts in a very clear and lucid way. That said, however, the casual reader will understand only some of the detail, even with Mr Singh as your guide.At nearly 500 pages, the book could easily have been much longer. Many ideas are relatively new, and terms that would not have been generally understood 50 years ago (e.g. 'red shift') are fundamental in the complex reasoning chains described. The pages lead a tour first of the history of astronomy, and then of the highly complex cosmological concepts and discoveries than followed from Einstein's General Relativity.There are deliberately very few equations, and the intention is to have \\"notions, not notations\\". [That comes from one of the quotes at the start of each chapter - which I appreciated]. The chapters are very long, but a short notes summary at the end of each prevents the reader losing the storyline. What is the plot? There is one central story, but interwoven are many sub-plots, often with scientific confrontation as a theme. It is only on finishing the book that this reader could see the whole picture, which I suppose make sense.As scientific knowledge develops, what was once seen as occult can become the accepted truth. It is easy to see from our place in history the chain of discovery that leads from Copernicus through Kepler, Galileo, Newton, and others. At the time, though, it is not that simple. When the baton is being passed from one generation of scientists to the next, it is not easy to see that it is a baton. Or that it is being passed.Singh also describes the irony of the two huge confrontation s of 20th century astronomy/cosmology, the Great Debate (whether there are nebulae outside of the Milky Way), and the Steady State vs Big Bang discussion. Both of these rumbled on for years or decades. It was Fred Hoyle, a 'Steady Stater' that coined the phrase Big Bang, and Hoyle also made significant discoveries that enabled the Big Bang to be a coherent explanation for the beginning of things. The author majors on the role of chance (\\"serendipity\\") in scientific advance, and also the difficulty of recognising at the time that a paradigm shift is occurring, or about to occur. He also points out that most 'advances' in science are not that; there are many failed advances, as a proposed solution is shown to be worthless; a failed paradigm shift.The diagrams used throughout are free-standing, with textural explanation as a footnote to the illustration itself. This can be irritating when reading the text, not just looking at the diagrams. But the advantage to this irritation is that the diagram has enough of an explanation in it to be understandable on its own. I found the illustrations excellent, be they describing red shift, or illustrating the importance of huge distances in failing to detect stellar parallax. It also enabled the light to dawn on how the ancient Greeks were able to measure the size of the earth, and moon, and the distance from the earth to the sun.There is nothing contradictory in believing in a creator God, and in using scientific processes to discover the meaning of life, and 'how it all began'. Singh draws no theological conclusions along these lines, and it would be a poorer book if it went down that route. Towards the end of the volume there are some unanswered questions (or perhaps the questions are never quite asked). There are clear reasons for concluding that the Big Bang happened, or that there is evidence that shows that something like the Big Bang appeared to happen. Whether the theories fit the evidence is what science is all about. Singh's book is about more than the struggle to reach a theory that best fits the facts.

Never have I started a review like this, but boy do I love this book. I read a LOT of books and this one had me gripped from the first page and kept me engrossed and stimulated the whole way through. Singh manages to explain complex ideas and theories in such a way that they are rendered clear and coherent and allow you to understand the difficult themes surrounding cosmology and the big bang theory. This book starts by looking at Copernicus, Galileo, Newton etc and showing how their ideas lead to modern cosmology research and development, it explores the development of telescopes and other measuring apparatus (more interesting than it sounds!) and how discoveries were made about galaxies millions of km's away from earth. It looks at opposing theories and the controversies surrounding them and how each theory gained ground and was either disproved or confirmed. This book is littered with anecdotes and humorous asides that add to the enjoyment of reading, as well as increasing your understanding. You also get a real feel for the excitement of discovery and of the various protagonists of the various theories and debates. At the end of each chapter you get a wonderfully illustrated and condensed summary that allows you to solidify the knowledge gained before going on to the next chapter, as well as allowing you to go back to this book and refreshing your memory. It has loads of clear tables and illustrations to explain particular points and various photos to compliment the text. Rarely have I enjoyed a book as much as this in the past few years and i've loved the sense of wonder and trains of thought it has lead me on. I could gush about this book for ages (as you may be able to tell!) but needless to say it comes HIGHLY recommended indeed.Dedicated to Stephen A. Haines whose reviews inspired me to read some amazing science books and who will be greatly missed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I put off reading this book for a while because I looked at the contents and did not feel like reading about the triumphs of the Ancient Greeks, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Einstein and company for what felt like the umpteenth time. That said, I picked it up a few days ago at the bookstore, genuinely wanting to get a better understanding of why the big bang is true, and have been unduly impressed...Singh does a terrific job relaying the science without sacrificing too much. There is not much math, but the little math that is present is very straight forward. The diagrams are superb both in their imagery and in their words. For the first time I feel like I can really appreciate why the ancients believed that the Sun revolved around the Earth from a scientific perspective. It actually provided better planetary predictions with the Ptolemaic model at the time. Singh uses a table that he revisits several times that looks at about ten different factors comparing the Earth and Sun-centered models.Also, I am learning new things that I did not fully grasp before. Like how we can figure out the diameter of the moon, and the sun, after simply getting that of the Earth and using a little geometry (you need a mind and a stick). I had never heard of a particular Einstein thought experiment before: one when he imagined himself moving at the speed of light with a mirror (it appeared to violate the Galilean principle of relativity.) Also, I now understand how the theory of relativity supplanted Newtonian Mechanics, not just the why.From my perspective, Singh presents the history of astronomy better than I have read from anyone else. It's very clear, cuts to the point, and relates some very entertaining quotes, stories and experiments throughout. It would be a fabulous place to start for novices. Non-specialists with a background in this area will likely enjoy the way that he puts it all together. He's got a great vocabulary (\\"blinkered\\"), understands how the progress of science works, and adds fresh insight to most of the historical discussion along with the latest evidence that has been left out of some earlier works.UPDATE: I finished everything but the epilogue. Wow. I had read about the big bang before and thought, \\"That makes sense.\\" With this book, I really feel like I understand why we accept the truth of the big bang. Singh continues to unwrap the story of the big bang as it was unwrapped by the scientists discovery after discovery. If someone asks me in the future why we believe the big bang is true, I can honestly tell them (the red shifts of galaxies, the variation of elements, the microwave cosmic background radiation, the observed differences in that radiation). Like in most cases of major scientific theories, it's not just one thing, but a series of observations that have shown the theory to ring true. The contrast with the Steady State theory throughout is especially insightful. One of the best non-fiction books I have ever read.If you want to know if the big bang is really true, or why the scientific community contends that it is true, this is the book. It's such an important theory that it doesn't make sense not to read it. (Final confirmation did not come until 1992.)"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"The \\"readability\\" is great. This book is very well written, and explains complex ideas in easy to understand ways. 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"How could scientists in antiquity determine the radius of the Sun? First, Eratosthenes determined the radius of the Earth by measuring the angle of a shadow and the distance between two locations. Then using reasoning and observation, once we know the radius of the Earth we can find the radius of the Moon, once we know the radius of the Moon we can find the distance to the Moon, once we know the distance to the Moon we can find the distance to the Sun, and once we know the distance to the Sun we can find the radius of the Sun. Each discovery is used as a toe hold to get to the next discovery, and this is a motif of the book.Singh compares the criteria scientists used to decide between the Ptolemaic (Earth centred) and the Keplerian (Sun centred) models of the solar system. The Ptolemaic system makes sense if the nature of the universe for everything to orbit the Earth, and it could explain the apparent motion of the stars, the Sun, the planets and the Moon, but once Galileo discovered the moons of Jupiter it was apparent that not everything orbits the Earth. A second critical observation made by Galileo was of the phases of Venus. The two models made starkly different predictions for how Venus would appear from the Earth, and Galileo's observations were consistent with the Sun centred solar system. The big critical experiment in this book is the observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation by George Smoot, which decided between the big bang model and the steady state model.Galilean relativity is the principle that if you are moving at constant velocity then you cannot tell what that velocity is without referring to an external reference frame, e.g., if you are in a box moving at some velocity, there is no experiment you can do inside the box to tell you what that velocity is, the only way to tell is to open the box and to look out. Singh explains how Einstein deduced as a consequence of Galilean relativity that light does not move in an ether. (Special relativity is about things moving at constant velocity, and general relativity is about things whose velocity can change, i.e. accelerated things.)To measure the distance to stars we use the fact that the apparent brightness of a star is proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the observer and the star. If all stars had the same intrinsic brightness, once we knew the distance to one star we could figure out the distance to any other star. Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel was the first to measure the distance to another star: using stellar parallax he determined the distance to 61 Cygni. But stars don't have the same intrinsic brightness, and the next step in finding distances to stars was made by Henrietta Leavitt with Cepheid variable stars. Brightness is proportional to the period of a Cepheid, and if we know the distance to one we then know the distance to the other.Finding the velocities of stars was also fundamental for arriving at the big bang theory. William Huggins applied the Doppler effect to measure the radial velocity of stars. In 1868 William and Margaret Huggins found a Doppler shift in Sirius; this is called a red shift because the light had longer wavelength than normal light, so it was shifted to the red end of the spectrum. Vesto Slipher found that most galaxies were red shifted instead of blue shifted. This led to Hubble's law that the speed of a galaxy is proportional to its distance from us.The next topic that comes up is atomic physics, which Singh explains well. Ralph Alpher showed how the big bang explained the abundance of helium that we observe in the universe, which is too much to have been produced in stars. Alpher and Herman found that there would be light from the big bang that was released at the end of the plasma epoch, and that this light would have a wavelength of 1mm, in the microwave spectrum. This light is the cosmic microwave background radiation that was observed by Arno Penzi and Robert Wilson in 1965."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I usually don't write detailed reviews. But this book was such a joy to read that I am compelled to write something about it. I had gathered small tidbits of information about astronomy through other books, documentaries, news articles etc due to my interest in the subject matter. However, no other source I had used in the past gave me a clear sequence of discoveries which led us to the current, widely accepted 'Big Bang' model of the origin of the universe. This book provides a concise sequence of discoveries leading to the success of the Big Bang Theory, without losing logical flow. In addition to scientific information, the writer also provides small interesting stories about the scientists involved, making reading the book an enjoyable journey through the history of the development of our understanding of the nature of the universe. I thought the explanation of scientific concepts was very easy to understand with the illustrations provided in the book. However, my opinion maybe a little biased since I do have a Sci/Tech background, albeit in a completely different area. Finally, the two page summaries at the end of each chapter, are a great way to recap the events discussed at length in the chapter. I would highly recommend this book to anybody with an interest in learning about our current understanding about the origin of the universe."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I read the Code Book (by the same author) a couple years ago and loved it. I decided to see what else was offered by Mr. Singh, and found this book. Cosmology has always been an interest of mine, so this was right up my alley. However, I think even if it wasn't, I would have still loved it. He makes complicated topics easy to understand without sacrificing any details. From the ancient religious views concerning the universe to the creation and development of the Big Bang model, this book covers it all. The knowledge I've gained has come into play a surprising number of times, and people are amazed that I know so much about the universe. I HIGHLY recommend this book for ANYONE. Even if you are religious, this book even mentions where religion could or could not fit in, thus not trying to disprove what you believe. I didn't think it could be done, but this book is even better than the Code Book."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I recently read the book 'Fermat's Enigma' by the author. It is the best non fiction book I have ever read. It was only natural for me to sample other works by Simon Singh and I am not disappointed. Most of us would have read about big bang in school. It is very fascinating stuff. The school text books do not describe the process which brought us to the conclusion that the world was created with a Bang. This books take the reader back in history. I loved the section, how clever men, hundreds of years ago, came to work out the size of Earth, distance between Earth and moon, size of moon and speed of light. It is absolutely mind blowing.This is an old book. There have been new discoveries since the publication of the book. There are other books if someone wants to read the most recent stuff. No one covers the history as good as Simon Singh though.Dr Singh, I am your fan."},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"I received this as a birthday present. I've now read it twice and I'm working my way through it again. I love how Singh starts with the first forays into the scientific method and slowly progresses his way from the first attempts to understand the universe to the Greeks' ability to calculate the circumference of the Earth to how that little bit of knowledge led through various steps (and many mis-steps) to the current theory of the Big Bang. This book is very readable, especially to non-technical people. He includes many diagrams and pictures to illustrate certain points. The text is cogent and concise. Love this book!"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This isn't just a book about the big bang. Big Bang is an epic journey of cosmological discovery and scientific achievement throughout human history.The book starts in roughly 250BC with Eratosthenes' first tentative calculations of the circumference of the Earth and covers all the major players and discoveries right up to the establishment and eventual acceptance of the Big Bang theory.Singh has a way with words. Not only does he concisely explain complicated subjects normally beyond the reach of the layman in simple yet accurate terms, but his enthusiasm and passion for his subject shines through, bringing each of the characters involved to life and doing full justice to the magnificance of their discoveries. Big Bang was so enjoyable I could hardly put it down and found myself choosing sleep deprivation without regret by staying up late to find out what happened next.This is without a doubt the most enjoyable popular science book I have ever read and I thoroughly believe it is a book everyone should read both for the lessons about science and human achievement it imparts, but also for the sheer enjoyement it gives.

The author does this is such compelling language and with such ease that it's hard to remember this is a physics book. The book has the best explanation of the simple theory of relativity of any work I've read.

(Actually, I'm not sure right now, whether Pythagoras required the eating of beans, or forbade it. Religious nuttery, in either case.)Since I've just been reading William Dunham'sJourney through Genius: The Great Theorems of Mathematics, I was a little surprised to be encountering the same cast of characters all over again, but let me say that Singh's account is much, much better for the general reader. Dunham has no problem covering 2-3 pages with calculus formulas, and Singh wouldn't dream of doing such a thing. Nevertheless, for the very first time in my life, I have a clear understanding of how the Copernican Revolution occurred. I used to have a mish-mash of Tyco Brahe, Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo which was not clearly understood. but Simon Singh explained it to me. In brief: Copernicus was the first to revive the thoughts of an ancient Greek \\"heretic\\" who believed in a sun-centered universe. But Copernicus wrote very badly, and his book was sabotaged at the printers literally as Copernicus lay dying. Enter, stage left, Tyco Brahe, an eccentric nobleman who made the most exact astronomical observations in history, and drank too much. (He also had a metal nose...) The humble Lutheran \\"peasant\\" Kepler was the man who did all the hard math work, using Brahe's observations and Copernicus's theory, and he published the definitive work which explained that the planets did NOT have circular orbits, but elliptical orbits --- an idea which made \\"Aristotelians\\" foam at the mouth. Finally, enter Galileo (stage right) bearing a weapon of great power --- the telescope. The telescope eventually proved Kepler right in just about every detail.This is a very enjoyable and educational book, which reminds me of that great TV series, \\"Connections.\\" Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Big Bang: The Origin Of The Universe","review":"This was my second astronomy book I've read.

Catholic ethicist Daniel C. Maguire, President of the Religious Consultation on Population, Reproductive Health and Ethics, convened an international, interreligious team of scholars to look at birth control and abortion from a variety of faith-based starting points.They concluded that in every case, even the most recalcitrant, there is evidence of competing views within each tradition. This volume is a highly readable summary of the findings. It is suitable for college classes, congregational study group and public policy discussions. Do your religious professional a favor and give this book as a gift.The backdrop for this discussion is the complicated web of population and development issues that has been fanned by religious fervor. Policy makers who leave aside religious views do so at their peril. Worse, when they accept as true the word of those who purport to speak for a faith tradition without examining the practice and beliefs of the majority of its adherents, they miss a great deal and do a grave disservice.Catholicism is a good example. While it would seem to be the airtight case against both contraceptives and birth control based on the Vatican's pronouncements, Dr. Maguire et al find that the tradition is far more nuanced. Theologians like Professor Christine Gudorf give good Catholic reasons to limit births. They see the teaching in a state of development not fixed, as the Vatican would have it. They take women's well being as a central ethical need, thus approve of abortion as a woman's right to choose.Islam would seem to be another case where it would be hard to find women-friendly ethics. But Muslim Professor Riffat Hassan offers a feminist challenge to her faith. Indeed many Muslims consider first trimester abortion to be licit; many forms of birth control have long been a part of Islamic culture. Who knew? As these views come to the fore it will be harder and harder to pin anti-choice positions on religions.Likewise, Chinese religions see these matters in quite open terms. The move toward universal harmony requires some limits on population. This worldview is very practical in claiming the need to put the common good before the desires of individuals. This is admittedly a position many in the West find problematic, but one that has its deep roots in an ancient and venerable culture.There is no suggestion in this volume that one will agree with all of the positions expressed, nor even find them morally tolerable. Sex selection abortion, for example, is one difficult issue. But what Dr. Maguire, with his scholarly guides, does so brilliantly is make the data accessible, lift the shroud of stereotype, and let the reader decide for her/himself. This methodological point, as opposed to rigid positions as all there is, distinguishes this marvelous volume as one that will launch discussions in a useful direction."},{"Title":"Sacred Choices (Sacred Energies Series)","review":"Who first told us &quot;there are two sides to every story?&quot; Maybe our mother, maybe life itself hammering into our heads that truth is never simple.In recent years the conservative Right, condemning contraception and abortion, has dominated that ethical debate.

Dan McGuire, drawing on a lifetime of study and research, in conjunction with scholars from other religions, finds that Christianity and other faith traditions have many strands of thought expressed over the centuries. The common thread is a passion for the givenness of our human life, and the sacred dimension of making critical decisions affecting reproduction. McGuire and the other writers survey the less well-known attitudes in the historic faiths and suggest that that univocal opposition to planned pregnancy is in sore need of review. He offers cogent, yet powerful reasons for doing more research. The book will be welcomed by all who want more open discussion, including Catholics for Free Choice who want freer dialogue in their religious communities about options for men and women regarding their fertility. ..."},{"Title":"Sacred Choices (Sacred Energies Series)","review":"While Daniel Maguire is one of the few mirthful scholars of religious thought, his writings have serious import in a world too often darkened by religious crime. Maguire and his sources demonstrate quite vividly that while most of the world's religions have often been involved in horrific and destructive actions, that there was and is a serious and awe inspiring underpining to their formation and purpose. My personal opinion is that there was probably much more fear and trembling than awe and reverence at their core beginnings, but Maquire is more generous in his accessment. Maguire takes us through more than ten of the world's great religious traditions with the help of scholars well versed in their own religious traditions, to demonstrate conclusively that although there is much in religious tradtions to comfort Pro-Life adherents, that there is a line of equally orthodox thought in every religious tradition to support the Pro-Choice view, and that government support of one of these religious views over the other is in conflict with the American ideal of resisting governmental intervention into religious matters. Maguire has an obvious bias toward the Pro-Choice religious position, but he is generous in granting legitimacy to the Pro-Life position as well. However, he unabashedly points out the inconsistancies in the lobbying and advocacy efforts by current avowedly Pro-Life activist's positions on multiple fronts in public policy debates. This is an important book for anyone who takes religious matters seriously. And whether or not one is religious or irreligious, I think that none can deny that religion plays a very big part in both national and international policy debates, and therefor, it behooves us all to take seriously matters of religious thought. Maguire shows us in his first few pages exactly why it is so necessary that we do so. An excellent and thoughtful read and a book which belongs on any thinking person's book shelves. wfh"},{"Title":"Sacred Choices (Sacred Energies Series)","review":"Who first told us &quot;there are two sides to every story?&quot; Maybe our mother, maybe life itself hammering into our heads that truth is never simple.In recent years the conservative Right, condemning contraception and abortion, has dominated that ethical debate.

Yet the thesaurus did not have a word that seemed adequate, so I do not know how to use the English language to adequately communicate to you how bad this book really is.After an introduction that boasts of the scholarship and credentials of the group of scholars that has been assembled to undertake the writing of this book, we go on to find approximately 0 footnotes and a dozen or so \\"suggested reading\\" lists amidst a plethora of statistics, quotes, claims, etc. In fact, the book is full of statistics that are almost impossible to verify, as no references are given. Sometimes there is a hint of where a quote can be found, but it is never referenced, so I can not find where Aquinas claimed that Catholics are justified in killing heretics, for example.Unfortunately, the book begins with the faulty premise of utilitarianism. That is simply an underlying assumption which is never addressed. With the utilitarian framework in place, the first couple chapters attempt to argue that the world is overpopulated (yawn), and once this has been established, it naturally follows that we are justified in using contraception and abortion.When the book is not making utilitarian arguments and throwing out unverifiable statistics, it is parroting every cliche phrase in the book. You name it, this book has it covered, including \\"trust women to make their own decisions\\", \\"choice is a personal, private decision which should be between the woman and her doctor\\", \\"religion teaches that sex is dirty\\" , \\"those who do not support abortion should not have abortions themselves\\" etc etc etc.I do not even know where to begin critiquing the \\"Catholic\\" position on abortion in this book. The overall argument is basically as follows: there seem to be a few instances in history of Catholic theologians saying things that don't directly condemn abortion and there are also times when certain the Church didn't say anything about abortion when we think they should have: therefore, abortion is permissible. This isn't even worthy of being labeled a non sequitur. \\"Quotes\\" of these fathers are sparse, sometimes giving partial sentences or sentence fragments, other times simply asserting that a certain Church father said something. Of course, not a hint of a reference is given. The anti-science, 18th century, stone age notion of \\"quickening\\" is, of course, appealed to. No poorly argued pro-choice book of religion would be complete without it. Some of the most asinine straw men are used. What is the reason that the Catholic church is against abortion? The author speculates that it is because women are becoming too independent and gaining too much power and its a way to \\"hold them down.\\" No mention of science, never interacting with any other viewpoints. No arguments of John Paul II, Christopher West, Patrick Lee, Robert George, Frank Beckwith. No documents or arguments which actually outline a coherent anti-abortion position are considered. Instead, we get the straw man that all of this is based on the Church's want to keep women in their place. Only in the world where it is legitimate to slice up your unborn child is it also acceptable to build these ridiculous straw men, never once interacting with any sort of argument that the pro-life side puts forth. This is why the \\"scholarship\\" of this book is a joke. Not only is NOTHING referenced, but there is no interaction with scholars from the \\"other side\\", or even documents that outline the other sides position, such as Evangelium Vitae. So much more can be said about the inaccuracies and half truths of this chapter, including the absurd notion on the \\"sense of the faithful\\" to justify abortion i.e. if enough of the faithful really want it to be a certain way, then it is! How pathetic. But they used the Latin phrase for \\"the sense of the faithful\\", so it must be a true Catholic teaching! Wait a minute... what if a majority of Catholics believed that there was no \\"sense of the faithful\\" in Catholic theology. Then it would follow by the sense of the faithful that there is no sense of the faithful. Is this self-refuting? Oh well, who cares as long as we get to kill the unborn!The upshot of this book is that it is a very good indicator of how deep and far away from reason someone will go because of sin. I'd like to say that this book is dangerous, but it is so badly reasoned and argued, that I can't imagine this would pose a threat to any thinking person. Most pro-choicers are honest enough to at least realize that the Catholic Church unequivocally condemns abortion. I never accuse people of being outright liars, but the authors of this book are the closest I've seen to legitimately thinking that they are straight-up liars.

For those who need convincing just look at the word contraception and its associative meaning. Contra = against or Anti; and Ception = Life or Christ. Put it together contra-ception = Anti-Christ. (This semantic play reveals the meaning behind the practice of contraception). This book's thesis is that the Catholic Church, along with other religious traditions, support contraception, or alternativly the Anti-Christ, or that which is agaist Life.If religion is about the celebration of Life, how could this ex-priest have the (...) to suggest that religions support anti-life devices and proceedures that end life pre-maturely? The mind boggles . . . there is something darker in this author than what can be gleened from the cover of his book!"},{"Title":"Congressional government: A study in American politics","review":"In the gutsiest political manifesto of American history, Woodrow Wilson dared to say that the Founding Fathers had it wrong. What's amazing is that his analysis holds up after 100 years. Wilson believed that &quot;separation of powers&quot; did not exist, and that the building impenetrable walls between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches produced abdication of responsbility. Wilson held up as a model the Westminster cabinet form of government as a model of clarity, openness, and responsibility. You can read Wilson's 1884 pages as if he wrote them today. The style is pure Victorian -- run-on sentences galore -- but the analysis is rapier-sharp. My opinion -- get this book, and have your mind changed. You will never see American government the same way again.PATRICK McGRATH The Campaign for Responsible Government Stony Point, NY"},{"Title":"Congressional government: A study in American politics","review":"This book is a classic. As a young academic with a keen interest in national politics, but without any experience, Wilson critiques the American governmental structure on a number of points, examines all of the branches (except judicial), the inner workings and character of each branch, and their inter-workings. Wilson is mostly critical of the system's deficiencies and has few words of praise for Constitutional government. Instead, his ideal model is the British system, with which he is constantly comparing the American. He also touches on the model of French government to provide a broader basis of comparison. The world's other great model Republic, Switzerland, is given passing mention. A broader discussion of the diversity of foreign models, including more discussion of the brilliant Swiss federal system, but also including the German system, would have added much to this book.Wilson's principal complaints with the shortcomings of American government can be summed up with one word: disjoint. He states that there is no structure in the Congress that can be described as \\"leadership\\" in British sense, meaning that even the nominal \\"leaders\\" of the parties cannot claim to speak for the rank-and-file members, who may act on their own initiative, through committees, in the process of drafting legislation (instead of having legislation crafted by a central administration and having members vote or reject it). The result is that there is no cohesive policy, as the various committees draft legislation within their own domains that in the end can be contradictory or mutually abrasive.Wilson also states that there is disjoint between the executive and Congress, largely due to the executive being independent from the legislature. This is almost unique to the American system; in most systems, the functions of administering law are subordinate to those of making law. The independent executive leads to a disconnection between the making of law and the making of policy, which makes forming a cohesive policy quite difficult.Wilson offers more such examples of disjoint in the American government, including the disconnect between those who decide how to tax and those who decide how to spend, but the logic is similar. If one extends the line of Wilson's thinking, the implication is simple: the concept of checks and balances in our Constitution has been a failure. This conclusion harkens back to the spirit of Centinel, who in 1789 condemned checks and balances as snake oil, contending that human intellect is not equal to the task of checking the various interests through an elaborate counterbalancing system. A more effective alternative would be a simple and transparent system (the American system is not transparent but quite obfuscated) in which any attentive observer could determine the chain of events that produces results, and act directly to indicate his approval or dissent of that result. In contrast, Wilson states that in the American system, \\"the voter has no way of knowing how his ballot can any effect on the government or policy, even an infinitesimal one.\\" Wilson's thesis is similar to Centinel's sentiment in his famous letters.Noticeably absent from Wilson's dissertation is any mention of the judiciary (typically presented at the most basic educational level as one of three coequal branches), which in the United States, takes a role in crafting policy through the concepts of judicial review and the setting of precedents that are similar to legislation in effect. One may conclude that this absence is because the judicial branch has only become so prominent in the 20th century, but such a conclusion would be misinformed; the Supreme Court has been crucial to policy in America, since John Marshall. The absence of the judicial branch in this analysis is a minor deficiency, but an intelligent reader should be able to extend Wilson's logic of disjoint to the judicial branch. Nonetheless, it would have been interesting to see his thoughts on the matter.In all, this book is quite informative, insightful, and worth reading. On a lighter level, it is interesting to see how some of Wilson's observations on government hold just as true 125 years later, and to see how some that he states as essential have come to change."},{"Title":"Congressional government: A study in American politics","review":"To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."},{"Title":"Dinnertime for animals (Books for young explorers)","review":"Dinnertime for Animals is one of many volumes in the Books For Young Explorers Series published by the National Geographic Society. This book portrays the eating habits, diets, and methods of gathering food of many different kinds of animals. Some animals eat plants, some eat other animals, and others will eat almost anything. Some animals use tools, claws, or bills to gather food. Woodpeckers, ants, camels, and bees are animals that store their food. The book also shows how some animals feed their young. With photographs on every page, this book is ideal for your young animal lover.

Apparently the author Deborah Crombie found a subject, Glastonbury, which she found fascinating and around which she attempted to construct her story. However, automatic writing from a centuries-dead monk and visions of musical chants are a bit far-fetched. I will grant that the legends and myths of Glastonbury are an interesting subject, but Ms. Crombie's attempt to incorporate them into a mystery to be solved by Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James just didn't work. I hope that in her future books Ms. Crombie returns to the high quality of writing and story-telling that she has exhibited in her previous books."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I have been reading Crombie's series for some time now, and &quot;A Finer End&quot; is one of her best efforts. In this new mystery, Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Duncan Kincaid is summoned by his cousin, Jack Montfort, to provide help with a sensitive matter. Winnie Catesby, an Anglican priest and Jack's lover, has been hit by a car and left for dead. Was this an accident or a deliberate attempt at murder? Jack wants Duncan to look into the case and give his professional opinion. Gemma James, Duncan's lover and former partner, has been promoted to Inspector, a move that has caused a rift between Gemma and Duncan. Gemma comes with Duncan to Glastonbury, where Jack lives, to get away from the pressures of her new job for a few days. Glastonbury is a town that features the ruins of an ancient abbey. It is also a tourist attraction for New Agers who come to get in touch with the powerful spiritual forces that are reputed to be centered there. Crombie's book features a fascinating cast of characters, including Simon Fitzstephen, a Church scholar with dark secrets and Garnet Todd, an eccentric woman who is terrified of the forces of darkness that she believes are present in Glastonbury. Soon after Winnie's &quot;accident,&quot; another resident of the town is murdered. Kincaid and James get embroiled in the passions of a place where feelings of fear and anger have been festering for many years. &quot;A Finer End&quot; is a psychological mystery that is also rich in history, spirituality and romance. The mystery is intriguing and satisfying, with enough red herrings to keep the reader guessing until the end.

Do not pass this series and this entry into the series"},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Although fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy Crombie's lastest offering, I found the underlying mystery in this one somewhat ridiculous and certainly contrived. The characters are really sketchily drawn and their actions are, shall we say, out of character. And things just don't make sense -- the runaway Faith, has run away from the next village over and is working in a restaurant. Why didn't her family, who was allegedly searching for her, find her? Where did they look? When stuck, Crombie moves the action forward by the use of &quot;automatic&quot; writing or finally by &quot;automatic&quot; painting. After finishing the book, I'm still a bit confused as to what actually happened, and why. Guess my crystal is a bit clouded.Duncan and Gemma's love story continues down a rather surprising path and it will be interesting to see how Ms. Crombie handles the coming changes in their lives. However, I am troubled by the lack of communication between these two, particularly Gemma to Duncan. Crombie paints Kinkaid as a loving, supportive, affectionate man, and I have a bit of trouble understanding why Gemma can't talk to him about even the most mundane matters. If memory serves me correctly, Gemma struggled throughout KISSED A SAD GOODBYE, to gain the courage to tell Duncan she was taking piano lessons. Things get a bit rougher in A FINER END."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Pros. This is a pleasant read. The first half of this book consists of vignettes developing Crombie's expendable (non-series) characters. They are interspersed with glimpses of the changing state of the romance between our two police detectives, Kincaid and James. The small-town characters are really well-developed, the strongest part of this story. I was really drawn in to their roundly depicted and interesting lives, and not one of them is an obviously crooked or villainous person. Each character has an engaging personality and profession. It turns out that most of them also are concealing regrettable, if not criminal, episodes somewhere in their pasts that provide motivation, and suspicious behavior, in the present. And you get a good feel for their ancient Arthurian pilgrimmage town of Glastonbury, now a New Age mecca, whose glowering Tor and ruined Abbey play their own important roles in the plot. Half way through the story some crimes finally occur and everyone is sucked into the stew.Cons. Because the characters are so well drawn the periodic attempts to introduce an ominous or creepy Glastonbury atmosphere seem artificial. I've never run into a mystery like this where you have to accept visions, dreams, premonitions, sceances, and spirits to make the plot development at all credible. The passing of time between vignettes is not well-marked, and transitions can be jumpy. There isn't as much consistent \\"Britishness\\" as you'd expect from a true English writer. Kincaid and James are on holiday here, in another copper's patch. There's a lot of police leaping to conclusions and speculating-obviously to keep us guessing-and rather little hard police procedural. I enjoyed this book much more as a story that resolves the varied personal difficulties of the local characters (ancient as well as modern) rather than specifically as a mystery (which is thin)."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"A FINER END by Deborah Crombie is a &quot;good read&quot; but not nearly as well written as her earlier novel KISSED A SAD GOODBYE. Crombie seems to have fallen into the trap of the &quot;successful&quot; writer who feels compelled to &quot;get out the next novel&quot; to her waiting fans. As a fan who has been waiting, I can appreciate her effort, but this is a sad development because Crombie can write well and has not done so in this novel.As a result of her expedited effort, the plot of A FINER END is thin and contrived, the characters (even the two main characters Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James) are poorly developed, and the text filled with sterotypes and hackneyed expressions. I found A FINER END to be an amalgam of a Susan Allen Toth &quot;thumbprint visit&quot; of Glastonbury, an imitation Cadfael, a warmed over Miss Marple murder and the vicar, and dinner at the heartbreak cafe --in other words, formulaic. I almost expected to find a chapter beginning &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot;Crombie is not English (she lives in a small town in Texas), but she was able to keep her American identity &quot;under wraps&quot; in previous books--perhaps because she concentrated her stories in London which is relatively heterogeneous, somewhat middle-class, relatively democratic, and acculturated by American televison and movies. Her superficial knowledge is exposed in this novel.However, I suppose the thing that irritated me most about A FINER END is Crombie's ethnocentric ignorance of religions -- which wouldn't matter except her book hinges on a New Age-Pagan-Goddess religious connection--all different religious/spiritual practices. When the narrator utters the phrase &quot;not even the Goddess could predict&quot; you know the book is in trouble.There are those who believe the Goddess knows all things, sees all things, etc. just as there are those who believe Allah or God or Jehovah is omniscient, omnipotant etc. And, Pagans are nature worshippers, not Goddess worshippers. And when did the &quot;Old Ones&quot; come to represent ALL pre-Christian beliefs? And, do you not think Christianity has it's dark side -- a crucified lord, the inquisition, crusades, the devil!! Crombie has created a mish-mash with which she associates the word &quot;cult&quot; and comes very close to calling human-sacrificers but does not quite because someone had the good sense to keep her from going over the cliff or Tor in this case--or did they?I agree with the other disappointed reviewer. There are a lot of silly loose ends. A little thing that nagged me was why would one fire ceramic tiles without electricity? Yes, I know the artist is making tiles in the old way, using designs and paints from the past, and I know there are ways of heating ovens with firewood/charcoal (we have examples of the process in various historical locations in Virginia) but I do not know a single professional-artist tile-maker--working alone--who makes tiles for a living and does not use electricity.If you must read this book, wait for the paperback or check it out of the library."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"If Deborah Crombie wants to be drawn into New Age gobbeldegook, that's her business, but she is supposed to be writing stories of rational crime DETECTION, not dragging in Cthulhu and other eldritch dark side of the force cliches of pulp fantasy! Conan Doyle fell like a ton o' bricks for sooper-dooper-natural fancies, too--remember his photographs of the \\"little people\\"?--but never, never did he allow Sherlock Holmes to deviate from rationality. The scientific method is the heart of detective fiction. Crombie abandoned it in this silly novel.There are so many things wrong with this book I couldn't list them all, but here are a few:--automatic writing? Nice ghosts? Crombie sets these up not as speculative mysteries, but as REAL. That's a no-no in detective fiction, and not very good writing even for a story in a pulp fantasy. Only a sucker becomes a true believer instantly and there is no evidence whatsoever for genuine automatic writing or ghosts (nice or nasty). I would rather believe in the ghosts at Hogwarts than in dear Edmund.--too many characters with similar 4-letter names, whose personalities were either blandly superficial or too similar. I couldn't remember who was who. Kincaid got lost in the story, and Gemma was an embarrassment, swallowing all that Noodlehead Age stuff. She should leave police work forever if it's that easy for her to abandon common sense.--My graduate education was in Medieval church history, largely in England, and I can assure you the big abbeys, their greedy political prelates and lazy lecherous monks were thoroughly detested by the local people and the moralists of their day. (Whirlpools of the sea, sucking all into their greedy maw, according to Wyclif, Gower, Chaucer, Langland, Matthew Paris, and the others.) In the late 13th century Edward I's Statute of Mortmain nicknamed the monastic Church the \\"dead hand\\" that kept England from prospering, and forbade future gifts of land to the Church without royal permission, which was hard to obtain. Chaucer's monk who loved \\"venery\\" (in several senses of the word) was much commoner than the very rare sweet abbot, especially in powerful abbeys like Glastonbury. I could relate some hair-raising stories! Even Crombie tells us of a \\"generous\\" abbot who murdered his own monks! That's why the antipapal Parliamentarians of the 1376 and 1377 Parliaments, in both (opposing) parties, created laws which severed the English church from the Continent. All Henry VIII needed, to make England autonomous, were two Acts of Dissolution of the Monasteries. In the South of England, when the Benedictine monasteries fell, most townsfolk breathed relief. (One less boot on their necks, taxing them to death.) In the North the austere Cistercians still commanded some respect; thus, the Pilgrimage of Grace, an attempted civil war against Henry VIII led by devout English Catholics and their allies, devout English Protestants, attracted northerners, while southerners fought with Henry. I wish romanticalist authors would read real historians, not New Age folderol.--As for the grail being a chant of many \\"voices\\", I've been Music Director in three churches, have taught Medieval music history in college, and must ask what she means by \\"voices\\"? A bunch of people gathered in a monophonic choir, all singing the same notes or at least trying not to go too far off-key? Surely she doesn't mean part-harmony of the Palestrina and Tallis sort! Northern Europe had NO part harmony at all until the 9th century, and it was no more advanced than drone bass or organum, usually in parallel fifths and fourths, until the 12th. It's attractive, but not geuine part-harmony, and no more than in two parts. To believe that an Anglo-Saxon (or \\"Celtic\\"? or ancient Hebrew?) choir would sing harmonously in multiple parts, whether polyphonically or homophonically, is ludicrous. Possibly deep in Africa some Bantu folk choirs were doing so at that early date, but complex harmony hadn't yet come up through Italy to Northern Europe.--Finally, I've been to Glastonbury. It's impressive from a distance, just as other ancient sites are--like Caerleon, Bath (which she mentions) and the Rock of Cashel. But close up, those places look sadly run-down, not evocative, and there are numerous others. Some famous castles and monasteries are all but smothered in kudzu vine, and the Scots have even built ticky-tacky houses on their greatest treasure, the Bannockburn battlefield. If I were a self-respecting ghost, I'd go and haunt somewhere else.Please, Deborah Crombie, don't get off into the unreal. Get back to the great detection of the first 3 or 4 novels, before you started imitating P.D. James, and I will continue to read your writing. I've been devouring sci-fi and fantasy since age 13 (am now 75) and enjoy fantasy, even the occasional Lovecraftian or Ashton Smith paranoid hysteria -- if it's well written. Unfortunately, this novel is neither fish nor fowl, neither good mystery nor good fantasy."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I feel duped. I don't mind a little magic in the books I read, but I plowed through this book to the very end hoping that the so-called communications from 11th century monks and &quot;Old Ones&quot; would be explained rationally; I was fooled. Crombie does a good job resolving the crime elements, and I appreciated the medieval history lesson, but the characters' motivation is absurd. I just can't imagine an actual Scotland Yard detective accepting automatic writing, visions, and aural hallucinations as factual."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"While this is a bit of a departure for Crombie (it is reminiscent of many Barbara Michaels novels due to the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" quality), it was still an engaging page-turner.

Her book hinges on a New Age-Pagan-Goddess religious connection but she doesn't seem to understand the Goddess knows all things, sees all things.

Thurstan had been the first Norman abbot there, brought in from Caen in France by King William after the Conquest in 1077. Aethelnoth had been the last Saxon abbot from 1053 to 1078.This is a British who dunit with fictional characters filling in between the historical passages. Todd Garnet took in stray cats, and had one kingly feline named Dion. There was Phoebe the Spaniel who surveyed the comings and going in the little settlement around the Tor, a multi-layered mound used on All Hollow's Eve.Winnie Gatesby lives in the vicarage and falls for the blue eyes of Jack Montfort. She'd been happily self-sufficient until she met Jack unaware of any void in her busy life. \\"So, why now did the thought of a future without him fill her with such desolation?\\" She had been the vicar at St. Mary's in Compton Grenville.Although Thurstan was a godly man, and a builder like all Normans, he made the monks of the abbey stop the Gregorian chant they had used and substituted a French chant. The original chant had been a part of the very fabric of their lives, and so the monks protested. The church had been destroyed by an earthquake, and only the tower was left standing. There was a lovely church downhill called St. John the Baptist.Chalice Well Gardens lay in the gentle valley between Chalice Hill and the Tor. The gardesn rose, level by level, until the last, an enclosed leafy bower housed the well where Garnet was drown by an unknown assailant. The Lion's Head pool below had a constant temperature of fifty-two degrees Fahrenheit. The well's intricate wrought-iron cover had a carving of an ancient called the 'vesica piscis,' two interlocking circles.Jack, it turns out, is an ancestor of the French painter who hid the manuscript he had been searching for behind one of the paintings. He had not been interested in history until he started researching his geneology.Ms. Crombie has written IN A DARK HOUSE and ALL SHALL BE WELL, among several other British mysteries.

Her descriptions of the countryside around Glastonbury are also beautifully drawn, and it sure made me want to visit this ancient place. She draws her main characters very well, but it's her secondary characters that seem to come alive from the page. She is an incredibly talented writer. This book gets off to somewhat of a slow start, but once about halfway through the pace picks up and it moves very quickly. I find this book almost has a dreamlike atmosphere to it as Ms. Crombie spins her yarn and as she decribes things from the medieval ages and how it applies to the modern-day. Kincaid and Gemma go to Glastonbury at the request of Duncan's cousin. While there they meet all kinds of wonderful characters - some remnants from the hippy era, a very young unwed mother, a middle-aged female vicar, and Gemma particularly is touched by the magic of the place and of the old abbey. It turns out that ancient violence ends up cropping up in modern-day Glastonbury and Gemma and Duncan are on the tail of a killer.

I've reviewed a lot of them and it takes a really good writer to make me care about the characters as people and to feel involved in their lives and their tribulations. Usually I read them in a detached way, assessing the characterization, setting, dialogue and so on. This story grabbed me from the beginning and I cared about Jack, Winnie, Fiona and the others and what happened to them. I found the setting completely engrossing - Glastonbury has depth and dimensions of history that the writer has portrayed accurately. This tale requires a great amount of suspension of disbelief, but it worked and worked well for me.I am always impressed that an American woman can express English life, especially one eccentric corner of it, so precisely. It's not jut acute observation, it's an understanding of the feelings under the surface.This is a really good English mystery novel, with an unexpected bonus of present evils woven into ancient wrongs. The writer's understanding of the thinness of the veil between the Old religion and the New, as well as the possibility, in certain circumstances, of the collapsing of time to reach others across the centuries is well balanced. This could have been mawkish and New Age precious but it isn't. The writer nails perfectly these spiritual and temporal ambiguities.This is a fine book in a good series."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Deborah Crombie has become one of my favorite writers. I can't wait for the paperbacks any longer. I have to have the hardbacks when they are first released. Having been to Glastonbury several times, I especially loved &quot;A Finer End&quot;. I slipped back into the Abbey ruins and up on the Tor as I read and reread this book.She is one of the best authors out there. She knows the areas in which her books are set so well. Having visited many of the Villages and the areas she mentions, I see that she has an intimate knowledge of the English countryside and cities. I highly recommend all of her books."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"The magic of Glastonbury was more prevalent in this novel than the mystery. The story allowed the characters to develop, to move forward, and the mists of Avalon surrounded them. The mystery was intriguing, the characters were facinating, and the setting was incredible. You definitly don't know whodunnit, but that doesn't really matter as much as why and where. In what century, even. Beautiful story."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"This author never fails to produce believable characters and a fascinating story line. Although this is part of a series, each book can well stand on its' own."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Deborah Crombie's A FINER END is packed with story lines that will keep you reading this well written series.The hit and run of an Anglican priest almost killed her.

If I had it to do over again, I would have started with number one. It's not that you're lost if you jump in at the seventh, but you miss the character development that has gone before. It tends to be a significant part of the story. That aside, though, I liked this book. It was nicely plotted and not easy to see through, although I had Andrew's situation figured out from early on. The characters were interesting and well-drawn, and the historical aspect and setting of the story added to the somewhat eerie atmosphere and my interest level.My only problem with A FINER END was the almost casual way in which direct communication from am 11th century priest plays into the story. Whenever seemingly supernatural elements are used by most mystery writers, they end up with a logical explanation, as is the case with the spectral hound in THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. A FINER END askes the reader to accept &quot;automatic writing&quot; almost as if it was perfectly normal. The characters struggle with the idea at first, but in the end it's an accepted part of the story and a source of evidence for the mystery. My credibility was stretched farther that I usually like.Outside of the overdone mystical element, I found A FINER END to be a very enjoyable mystery. I'll be reading more of Crombie's books in the future. When I do, though, I will be going back and picking up the Kincaid/Jones series from the beginning. I think other mystery fans will like these books as well as I do. Take my word for it and give them a try."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"This book is excellent. I have found that Deborah Crombie always delivers with her books. There is so much to recommend this book: the writing itself is first-rate, the characterizations are spot-on, the mystery is intriguing, the subject matter is different from any other mystery I have read. And that brings up an interesting point - after I finished reading this book, I realized that the subject matter of unconscious writing did not distract from the mystery itself. I think that with most other writers I would have found myself distracted by thinking about the subject, wondering whether I could believe in it or not, etc. While reading this book, I simply accepted it as truth and I think that says something for Ms. Crombie's writing. She makes it easy to accept what you are reading without drawing attention to the fact that it might be a little \\"out there.\\" This is not the best in the series as that would still have to be \\"Dreaming of the Bones,\\" but this book is far above most any other mystery you will find on the storeshelves today.Can't wait for the next in the series, \\"And Justice There is None.\\""},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Ever since the quality of Elizabeth George's books fell off a cliff, I have been taking my greatest mystery-reading pleasure from the Kincaid/James novels by Deborah Crombie. This one, like the previous six, features wonderful writing, a further sensitive and perceptive development of the relationship and personalities of Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, and interesting, well-drawn characters and suspects.However, the plot is not up Crombie's usual standards. The mystery begins with some sort of supernatural communication from a long-dead monk to a modern-day architect, Jack Montfort, who happens to be Kincaid's cousin. This communication, in the form of some sort of involuntary writing in Medieval Latin which comes to Montfort while in a trance, provides the continuing thread for the entire plot.Crombie (and all of her characters) apparently take this notion seriously. No rational explanation is given for this phenomenon, nor for the mysterious power of the nearby \\"Glastonbury Tor\\" - a forbidding, bleak, low mountain that dominates the landscape. There are vague echoes of \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" in the story. But that movie never resorted to out-of-body experiences to explain the plot - everything that happened was the result of pure human evil, which is a lot easier to believe in.For me, the New Age irrationality and unreality detracted mightily from the pleasure of reading Crombie's superb writing and character development. I hope this book was just an aberration."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"While this mystery requires a lot of leaps of faith and belief in coincidences, any Deborah Crombie novel is worth reading. I could have done without the channeling with the past, and such, but Gemma and Kincaid are so good together, both as colleagues and lovers, that this was an extremely good read. The best part is at the end when it states that the author is working on her eight book already!"},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I see most of the reviewers on this forum liked the book. I liked it, too, but do not think it is Crombie's best. The murder mystery angle was good &amp; I was kept guessing right up to the end. But the supernatural elements just didn't work for me. Too much suspension of disbelief is required from readers who expect to see the detectives do some hard-nosed detecting. Also, too many characters are introduced right at the beginning. This is a characteristic of her more recent books. It's hard to keep them all straight until the plot actually begins to unfold. And, hey, isn't it time for Duncan &amp; Gemma to get married already?"},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Superintendent Duncan Kincaid of Scotland Yard gets caught up in the strangest cases. This time he's off to Glastonbury, center of New Age mysticism in Britain, to help his cousin, Jack, sort out a hit-and-run in which the local (female) vicar was nearly killed. Meanwhile, Sgt. Gemma James is due for a promotion and so she's off at a training course and reappears shortly as a newly-minted Detective Inspector. Kincaid is pleased for her, but at the same time, he's upset at the dissolution of their investigative partnership. He knows that's selfish, but he's gotten used to things. Happily, he persuades Gemma to take a few days off and join him. All of which is fine, and it leads into a nicely complex plot, the roots of which go back not only into the 1970s but even back to the 11th century. Glastonbury Abbey (reputedly the burial place of King Arthur) and Glastonbury Tor (supposedly the landing place of Joseph of Arimathea two thousand years ago) make for a nice, romantic locale and many of the local residents are people who came for a visit years ago and never left. And it becomes one of those cases in which old conflicts and old scores to settle reappear in modern guise, which is fine -- but then Crombie kind of loses control. Having her characters, some of them, believe in automatic writing and ghosts and Dark Powers is one thing; there are a lot of peculiar people like that in the world. But postulating such things as an objective reality is something else entirely. Would a couple of hard-nosed coppers like Kincaid and Gemma really buy that? I somehow doubt it. And that assumption on the author's part rather spoiled this book for me, even while I enjoyed the interplay among her as-always strong characterizations."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"this is my second Gemma/Duncan book. I loved the first one, but this left me cold. I didn't like the magical elements (automatic writing, being 'pulled' toward the mountain, dreams that come true) and so I had trouble believing anyone's motivations, actions, or words. However, Crombie is a skilled writer and I will give another of her books a try before giving up!"},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"\\"A Finer End\\" is Deborah Crombie's seventh installment of her police procedural series featuring Scotland Yard investigators Duncan Kincaid and Gemma Jones. If you haven't read the previous books in this series, you should know that the two are lovers and that Superintendent Kincaid is Gemma's superior officer.Kincaid is asked by his cousin, Jack Montfort, to come to Glastonbury to find out who was driving the car that ran into his lover, Winifred Catesby, while she was riding her bicycle. Jack has a strong feeling that the hit and run was not an accident. Shortly after Kincaid arrives, Garnet Todd, a friend of Jack and Winnie, is found murdered and there are many suspects and possible motives to keep the reader guessing.Crombie, who's an American, does a good job of portraying the town of Glastonbury in Somerset, England, along with its history and legends. The frontispiece of the hardcover edition contains a map of the village. A prominent geographic features on the map is a high hill called the Tor, on which a lot of the action in the book takes places. If you're interested, you can use the satellite view in Google Maps to actually see what the Tor looks like.Unfortunately, the mystery is often interrupted by a number of personal issues that Kincaid and Jones must cope with. Jones is trying to be promoted to detective, which has ended their partnership and caused some resentment on the part of Kincaid. Meanwhile, she suspects that she may be pregnant but keeps putting off finding out for sure. We hear a number of times how Kincaid may lose his son if his legal guardian takes a job in Canada. There's also a lot of new age pseudo mysticism involving Jack's automatic writing in ancient Latin about a lost manuscript that was hidden long ago by a priest. Instead of including all the personal issues and mysticism, Crombie should have spent more time developing the characters of the suspects."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"If you like spiritualism and supernaturalism in your mysteries, then you'll love this book. In it, people today receive a series of messages from a monk who has been dead for more than 800 years. The messages are integral to the plot and are described as completely real.If you don't like spiritualism and supernaturalism with your mysteries, however, this book definitely isn't for you."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"First Sentence: The shadows crept into Jack Montfort's small office, filling the corners with a comfortable dimness.DI's Duncan Kincaid and Gemma Jones travel to Glastonbury, England after a call from Duncan's architect cousin, Jack Montfort. It appears that Jack may be a conduit via automatic writing, for a medieval monk who wants Jack to find a missing relic. Duncan is not the only one who knows about Jack's unasked for link to the past. Anglican priest and Jack's lover, Winnie; Nick, a handsome, young bookstore clerk; Faith, the very pregnant, psychically-sensitive runaway; Garnet, the reclusive, new-age potter, and Simon, a Church-scholar with his own secrets, all join with Jack to uncover what is happening. An attempted murder and an actual murder blend the paranormal with police procedure.Crombie certainly knows how to capture your attention and draw you straight into the story. From the very first page, Crombie creates a delicious sense of menace and foreboding; a sense of something supernatural at work. This is wonderfully offset by the everyday, very real concerns in Gemma's and Duncan's lives and their ever-evolving relationship.We are well introduced to the cast of characters, learning who they are and how they interconnect. They were rather fascinating and unusual for a mystery. Certainly, they all had pasts and elements of those pasts they wanted to keep from being revealed. However, it was refreshing that there wasn't an obvious villain in the group. That made the final resolution even more effective when it was revealed.The history was fascinating and well imparted, from the furnishing in one character's home to information on the Abbey. Crombie's descriptions are wonderful. She is an author who paints with words and, in this case, sent me straight to the internet looking for more information. I particularly loved the role music played in the story including Gemma's reaction to music and the conveyance of when music touches your soul, as well as learning that the word 'enchantment' is derived from the work chant as it was believe music was the strongest magic.On the other side, I did feel there were some dubious bits of information concerned religion, old and new, and pottery. There were also a couple significant coincidences and a few threads left hanging. I enjoyed the paranormal element but might have found it more interesting to have a non-paranormal resolution.In summary, we have a story a bit heavy on the paranormal but a captivating plot, lots of viable suspects and excellent plot twists. All in all, it worked for me."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I think A Finer End is the best book yet in the Duncan Kincaid / Gemma James series. This book has multiple mysteries, wonderful characters in Glastonbury (Duncan and Gemma are almost sidelined by the &quot;secondary&quot; characters), history, spiritualism, and themes of faith and redemption.I really think Ms. Crombie outdid herself with this book! Loved it! Highly recommended (and I'd love to see Jack and Winnie show up again in future books)."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I usuakky am an avid British mystery fan; however this book took forever to get me interested. And then, it totally lost me with the unrealistic and unapealing characters. I will not try another Deborah Crombie book. Much better to stick with Robinson and Rankin."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"This book was certainly better than the last, although the mystical part was unexpected and unwanted. Kincaid and James relationship is doing better, but she still is struggling with the results of her selfishness. She is finding the results unexpected and unwanted as well.A good read!"},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Jack Montfort, a widowed architect who is sleeping with Winifred, the local vicar, starts producing automatic writings ostensibly from Edmund, an 11th century Benedictine monk of Glastonbury Abbey. Surprise! Jack discovers he is the direct descendent of Edmund, who shared Winifred's disdain of the Commandments, and had illicit sexual relations with the stone-mason's daughter Alys. He discovers Edmund stole an illuminated manuscript as well as abortifacient plants from the Abbey, to give to his pregnant mistress (apparently she was supposed to learn how to read and have an abortion at the same time). Alys passed the baby off on her hastily acquired Norman French upperclass husband, Montfort, and handed the manuscript down through 900 years to Jack Montfort. Got that far? ALSO, the manuscript contains the \\"true\\" religious chant of Jesus, composed by pagan Egyptian priests and brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea in the 2nd century. Unlike plain chant/Gregorian chant, this is the \\"real\\" thing, designed to produce trances, altered states of being, etc. Quotes from Dion Fortune prove these channeled statements. There's a schoolmaster who rapes a student, a murder, some attempted crimes, and too many cousins, but the book focuses on the chant, described as the real Holy Grail of the Last Supper."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Good for escapist reading, with a lot of willing suspension of disbelief, that is. For me, there was too much new-age mumbo jumbo that goes nowhere, and most of the characters were not that appealing. This was my first Deborah Crombie mystery. I may try another; however, to put this novel(as some reviewers have)in the territory of P.D. James and Barbara Vine is a good marketing ploy but a bit of a stretch."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Other than a slight hiccup here or there I've been loving this entire series from the beginning. I've found that this book is similar to Dreaming of the Bones, which was the only one to this point I didn't rate at five stars right off the bat. While I liked that book in the end I found that the stalwarts of the series, Duncan and Gemma weren't in the book enough for at least half of it. A Finer End is similar, the difference being however is that I just found this book not to be to my liking for several reasons.Perhaps my biggest complaint with the book was the overall mysticism involved in a major portion of the plot. Automatic writing? Painter's with visions? Pagan rituals? Sometimes I find those things to be interesting, when in the right context but I don't find it works well in the Kinkaid/James framework.The historical aspects and lore of the location were interesting. There's also several new developments in both the working and romantic aspects of Duncan and Gemma's relationship that are VERY interesting, which has become a staple of the series and a welcome one at that! The actual whodunnit portion is well done as well and it will keep you guessing right up till the end, which is also becoming another staple of this series.I can't rate this novel higher than a three though because of the problems I mentioned before. Some of the themes are a little too far fetched for this series as it stands and coupled with a distinct lack of Duncan and Gemma for roughly the first 40% of the book and we get a bit of a hiccup in an otherwise great series.I didn't by any means hate it, I guess I'm just used to loving these novels from start to finish and I was a bit let down. That being said I can't wait to get to the next one to see where Duncan and Gemma go next on their life's journey."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"This was a book I picked up at random at the library and intrigued by the synopsis on the inside cover, I checked it out. What a fabulous book! A well-researched and engaging book with interesting sub-plots and an overall story that draws you in. The number of main players in the book made it hard to follow at first, but once you got who was who down (within a few chapters) it enhanced the story because not everything was cut and dried. Some of the story you were able to figure out, but others were a surprise...and it was genuinely enjoyable. It inspired an interest in Glastonbury, Glastonbury Abbey and the Tor as well."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I read this book, and I liked the beginning but I lost interest in it quickly. The story didn't make sense and the characters were sketchy. I was dissapointed in it. I thought that it would be a lot better. Fell asleep reading it. BORING."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"I rather liked &quot;A Finer End&quot; by Deborah Crombie; however be forewarned this is not the usual Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James murder mystery. Indeed the murder attempt does not take place until almost halfway through the novel! I think that the basic plot of this novel has already been detailed nicely, so I'll stick to what I liked and didn't like about this latest Kincaid/James mystery. I rather enjoyed the entire paranormal angle, and was really interested in what the long dead monk, Edward of Glastonbury, was trying to disclose. And the motley group of characters that were involved with this paranormal investigation were interesting and colourful enough to hold my interest and to pull me into the events that were unfolding before my eyes. I also liked the detailed description of the town, the abbey and the Glastonbury Tor. Deborah Crombie, was I think, entirely successfully in imbuing this novel with the right kind atmospheric feel. Indeed, the first part of this mystery novel held a lot of promise. Strangely enough it was in the second part of the novel, where Duncan and Gemma arrive to help discover who had attacked one of the group, that things became a little unsatifactory. The investigation into this attack seemed to go no where, and then another member of the group is murdered, and again Duncan and Gemma, and the local police seem to be scrambling all over the place, with no coherent plan of action. And when the final denouncement came, I felt enormously cheated, because the motive wasn't even mentioned until the third chapter from the last (except for two tantalising sentences in the middle of the book). I was also a little disconcerted at all the hurdles that Crombie keeps throwing at Duncan and Gemma: they already seem to have an awful lot to deal with, so why did Crombie feel that she should complicate their relationship even more?&quot;A Finer End&quot; is an intriguing novel; however murder mystery wise it does not live up to previous Kincaid/James novels."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"This latest Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James police procedural is set in Glastonbury. There is a very strong sense of the place here - its history, geography, and strong, sometimes creepy atmosphere permeate everything.Duncan's cousin and childhood friend Jack Montfort calls him for help when violence impacts his life. Duncan and Gemma oblige, traveling to see Jack and to look into the lives and relationships of his friends and neighbors. His girlfriend is an Anglican priest with an angry brother and a painter friend who can't seem to stop painting the same image. Jack's circle also includes a renowned author, a lovelorn clerk at a New Age bookstore, and a Goddess-worshiping tilemaker who is fiercely (over?)protective of her ward, a pregnant teen. Strange happenings in Glastonbury's past and present seem to have an equally strong power over everyone there.I liked this book very much, but I can see why some may feel differently. The plotting/mystery elements are a little weak, and there's a strong woo-woo element which some readers might (understandably) find unbelievable. Still, there is much to enjoy here. Crombie's writing is, as always, elegant. It usually takes me a couple of chapters to really get into one of her books, but this one grabbed me right away. It's atmospheric, absorbing, and well-paced, and the characters are unique and intriguing. I also liked the depiction of Duncan and Gemma's struggles with their personal and professional roles."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Good book in the Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series, well written.

Previous books in this series have quite successfully paired the police procedural and cozy genres. The mysteries have been cleverly plotted, with all clues quite fairly supplied, the relationship between Duncan and Gemma has been well written, quite believable as the pair attempt to sort out their increasingly complicated personal lives. Unfortunately for this one Crombie has decided to toss in a supernatural element into the mix which, in this reader's opinion, is just too much. Instead of focusing on Duncan and Gemma as the earlier books have done the spotlight here is on a large cast of new characters, Duncan's cousin (mentioned in A SHARE IN DEATH) and his circle of friends and acquaintances. Even the locale has shifted from the London/Cambridge settings of the earlier novels to Glastonbury which seems to have the pair behaving in the oddest ways - the ever practical Gemma experiencing mystic compulsions, skeptical Duncan accepting clues delivered through automatic writing. Even the mystery element in this one is subpar - it was fairly obvious early on who the culprits were which left the reader wondering when Duncan and Gemma would catch up.Fans of the series will want to read this one though if only because the overall story arc of this series is so pronounced and certain pivotal events are revealed and characters introduced in this one that will certainly factor into later novels. We can only hope that Crombie's venture into the supernatural will be confined to this novel. For heaven's sake do not begin the series with this one - it is not typical of the series at all."},{"Title":"A Finer End","review":"Someone on Amazon's mystery threads recommended Deborah Crombie to me and her books with Scotland Yard's Duncan and Gemma are a new guilty pleasure. This was one of my favorites so far in the series. Crombie seems to enjoy experimenting with plot lines, form, and style of her books which keeps them fresh and non-formulaic.I enjoyed the spiritual element in this book with reaching back to the past to resolve an ancient mystery which is now impacting the lives of Glastonbury villagers, including Duncan's cousin Jack. The book is populated with likable characters who seem real. The ancient and modern spiritual forces swirling around the characters and story line heightened the suspense for me and added depth. If you don't like that sort of thing, they may be off-putting and you're advised to move on to another Crombie mystery.I felt like I was in the village and enjoyed the history and atmosphere.

Not only did he fight on the anti-Imperial side in Montenegro during the Great War, but he adopted and may even have actually sired a young girl.To his shock, this young Yugoslav maiden--whom he had lost track of--reappears in his life, up to her neck in a particularly messy, intricate affair that may or may not include missing diamonds, a dead body or two, international intrigue, and a bellboy's uniform. For all of the peeks into Wolfe's previously unsuspected soul, he remains as crumudgeonly and as immovable as ever. Archie Goodwin, of course, remains the wisecracking, milk-drinking sidekick, flirting with anything in a skirt and even giving a Nazi agent a black eye just for the fun of it.The joy of these books is their marriage of the American gumshoe attitude and the British cozy focus on character. Where they generally fall short is their plotting. This entry in the series is, without a doubt, the most successfully rounded out of the lot. Stout manages to keep the mystery truly mysterious, and yet never manages to confuse the reader so thoroughly that s/he can't find the exit. The plot actually ends on the last page--many of the Nero Wolfe mysteries fizzle out, wrapping up a chapter or two before the end, leaving nothing but rumination and grumbling for the final pages. Others seem never quite to wrap up all the loose ends. Here, the conclusion is both inevitable and unexpected--utterly satisfying."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"'Over My Dead Body' finds a young lady who arrives at Wolfe's door claiming to be Wolfe's daughter. Wow! What a way to start the book! Things begin to heat up even more when the young lady is suspected of a murder in a fencing studio.This is the seventh entry in the Wolfe series, and it is an entertaining one. Wolfe is in his usual beer-drinking, orchid-loving form, using that brilliant mind of his to sort out any difficulty. In this book, we begin to see a little more depth in two of the recurring minor characters in Wolfe's employ: First, Fred Durkin, the lumbering, bumbling guy who is not too bright, but is always there when Wolfe needs him. Second, Saul Panzer, who is probably just as good a detective as Archie (well, almost), but is completely no-nonsense. (And Archie thinks he's better looking than Saul.)I'd give the book 4.5 stars if I could. The only problem is Wolfe says a few words and lines that really aren't in character for him. This would only distract readers who have read a lot of the books. Since this book is still fairly early in the series, Stout can be forgiven. 'Over My Dead Body' is definitely a Wolfe book not to be missed."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Very smooth, fast paced, one of the top ten of the Wolfe opus"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"This book hits on all cylinders.

Yugoslav women who are instructors there are possible suspects, one of whom is Nero Wolfe's adopted daughter from his days as an ill advised Austrian agent in the Balkans, pre World War, before we started numbering them. This alone is a startling revelation about Wolfe. Wolfe slender? Youthful? Abroad, outside, involved with people? I was astonished.As usual, the beer drinking, orchid collecting, erudite, corpulent food lover Nero Wolfe declines, under any circumstances, to leave his brownstone abode with a greenhouse rooftop for his rare flowers. Using Archie, his assistant, as legs, Wolfe solves the baffling case. I knew he would. He's solved all the other mysteries in the Nero Wolfe books I've read.Mystery fans who have not read mysteries from the golden age (pre-1950) do not know what they are missing. There is no sex to lure the lascivious reader, very little violence, no profanity.

Archie Goodwin is in top form as a wise cracking pain-in-the-neck. Inspector Cramer is present more than a lot of stories giving Goodwin plenty of opportunities for zingers besides the ones he routinely fires at Wolfe. Wolfe himself is definitely out of his comfort zone dealing with the situation of his adopted daughter and this also adds to the potential for laughs.This is a very entertaining book and I would recommend it for readers unfamiliar with Nero Wolfe as a great place to start or for established fans."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Imagine having Nero Wolfe as your dear old dad.

The police go from adversaries to allies, and there's plenty of action to keep us on our toes."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Great read. The whodunnit keeps you guessing. And Archie Goodwin's never been funnier!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"This book begins with the astounding revelation, to Archie and to the reader, that long ago, in his native Montenegro, Nero Wolfe had adopted a daughter. That daughter, now in New York City, is in trouble and comes to her adoptive father for help. But Nero hasn't seen this daughter since she was an infant. She has a piece of paper that she says \\"proves\\" she's the daughter he adopted. Is she?Of course there's murder in this book, more than one. Somebody is killing the students at a fencing studio (frequented by Wolfe's daughter), running them through with a lethal epee (a deadly point is attached to the epee). And: somebody is trying to frame Archie Goodwin for these murders! Not only that, but Archie takes the evidence that was planted on him at the fencing studio and brings it home, where Fritz hides it in a loaf of bread.Inspector Cramer is baffled and spends time at Wolfe's brownstone, waiting for something to happen. Government agents make demands, which Wolfe ignores.This is a fun read, as is almost every Nero Wolfe title, but the ending is a bit busy, hasty, and confusing, almost as if Stout couldn't think of a really perfect ending. Nevertheless, worth reading."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"It is all about wise-cracking by Wolfe's protege/assistant Archie Goodwin. I am not at all impressed, may be it shouldn't be the first book to start with but... I wouldn't buy another book by this author in the near future!!! Trash...."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"\\"...Wolfe sipped the last drop of his luncheon coffee, put down his cup, and made two distinct and separate oral noises. The first was meant to express his pleasure and satisfaction in the immediate past, the hour spent at table; the second was a grunt of resigned dismay at the prospect of the immediate future, which was embodied in the bulky figure of Inspector Cramer...\\"Well, they just don't write like that anymore. If you're like me, you'll read with Webster's on hand as Wolfe and his assistant Goodwin carry on their 'persiflage' amidst the current investigation. Wolfe calls for his beer, his leftover roast duck, his orchid files, and all of his witnesses because he doesn't take walk-ins, he won't suffer fools, and he never leaves his house.This was my first pass at the Rex Stout mystery library, and I'm definitely signing on for more!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"One morning in 1939 a young woman appeared at the brownstone, seeking Nero Wolfe. Archie Goodwin was hopeful that the meeting would lead to a case but he never expected the surprises that would soon follow for shortly after Wolfe entered the office the young woman proclaimed herself to be Wolfe's long lost daughter. As if that statement was not shocking enough Archie was further stunned when Wolfe acknowledged that she could very well be his missing child. After these stunning revelations the dead bodies, semi clad women, horde of NYPD detectives and persistent FBI agents are almost anti climatic.Fans of the Nero Wolfe series will not want to miss this introduction to Wolfe's daughter (she also figures in THE BLACK MOUNTAIN) and learn a bit more about Wolfe's mysterious past. Those who are new to the series could begin with this one, even though it is the seventh in the series. Archie is at his devious best in this one as he manages to stay one step ahead of both the police and the FBI in this one.Serious Wolfe fans might be able to catch Wolfe in a lie to the FBI if they read carefully....happy hunting!"},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"In this Nero Wolfe mystery-one of the earlier episodes-we encounter Wolfe's adopted daughter, who is in a bit of a fix. Wolfe comes to the rescue and along the way, shares little glimpses into his past: his tumultuous youth in Europe; the origins of his suspicion of all women; how he came to adopt a child. In this book, probably more than any other in Rex Stout's series, do we see the effect that women-especially those from the former nation of Yugoslavia-have upon Wolfe's psyche. It's a good read-a good mystery with a great plot-like pretty much all of Stout's works."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Prichard has done unabridged audio tapes of a whole series of Nero Wolfe novels and he is ideally suited for the task. You could find no better way to experience Stout's work than these audio tapes.

No, he's not acting as an agent for any foreign person. But the G-Man starts asking questions about Wolfe's youth in Europe culminating with:\\"What about your wife? Weren't you married?\\"To which Wolfe replies \\"No. Married? That was what--\\" and then as good as tells the G-Man to go to hell.Is there a more frustrating unfinished sentence in all of detective fiction? \\"That was what....\\" WHAT!?!? We know that Wolfe was once young and romantic is not completely immune to the charms of the opposite sex. I have spent far too many hours concocting scenarios, an exotically beautiful spy who lures him into marrying her and gets information from him. Only too late does he find the marriage is invalid and she disappears...perhaps carrying his child? But enough of my flights of fantasy.\\"Over My Dead Body\\" is a intriguing read, cerebral and action packed as well. It's a stand out for the glimpses it provides us into Wolfe's and Archie's characters. Give it a read, you won't regret it! I've read it more than once and I'm certain I'll read it more than once more."},{"Title":"Over My Dead Body","review":"Love Rex Stout.

He sends some assistants out. The case involves a strong personal angle, and you cannot be sure who is who.

Now that I've grown up, I thought I'd give them a go to see what I thought as an adult. Short version: not my style.A big roadblock to my enjoying this more than I did is that my tastes have changed: if I want to read a mystery, give me a Chandler or a Hammett. This was a little too close to the \\"sealed room\\" style of Christie, which I actively dislike. Another negative was the similarities to Doyle: if something's described for over a couple of sentences it *must* be important, and if Wolfe asks a question about something you know it's key. Wolfe is a little too \\"super-sleuth\\" for my tastes.That said, Stout's a decent writer -- except his attempts at a Slavic accent, which I found embarrassingly bad-- and there were a couple of good lines peppered throughout this. Each chapter ends on a sort of cliffhanger (I'm assuming it was serialized when originally published) which was a good way to keep me reading. The book held my interest, though the ending was a seriously contrived affair that my calling a \\"let-down\\" under-describes my disappointment by a couple orders of magnitude. If it had been handled better, I would have given the book 4 stars.If you're a Stout fan, you'll probably like it, but a novice coming in cold might have some problems."},{"Title":"The Full Box: Gift Set","review":"The audio Book version is a great addition to the hand held books.

I've read NR's MacGregor series and enjoyed most of them, so I knew I could be satisfied with her shorter works. Unfortunately this one felt rough--very rough. The portrayal of the hero and heroine and their descent into love felt very clumsy, abrupt, and unbelievable.Catherine was 23 and felt even younger. I was pretty irritated by her continuous rants to Trent about 'men like him'. I get that she needed a handy target for her anger, and I can't blame her for that. It was realistic, but it made her seem pretty bullheaded and petty. She was the most immature of her sisters and it showed.Also, there wasn't any real falling in love depicted. Catherine decided she was willing to go all the way with him and suddenly she was in love. It just felt clumsy and false. Trent's love wasn't any better though. He didn't seem to fall either. He had more potential for a believable buildup, but then all of a sudden it was the end of the book and he was in love with no real journey.It was disappointing all around.A Man For Amanda: 3 StarsI definitely enjoyed this one more than the first book. I saw a lot more shades of the charm of her later characters than I did in the first one.With Amanda we got the straight-laced business woman who reluctantly falls for the charming architect. Sloan seemed like a beta version of this author's later smooth, charming hero. He's definitely more of a throwback though. I got a bit of the domineering man vibe from him at times, although it wasn't overwhelming.I got a little tired of Amanda's prickly attitude at times. I prefer her to her sister CC, but I would have liked her to jump down Sloan's throat less. It just seemed that she was always blowing up at him for something or other.Although the story was rather thin it was still enjoyable to read.For The Love Of Lilah: 3 StarsI think NR's older style is not going to become a favorite of mine. I see the potential, but it doesn't have the smoothness or characters depth that I've come to expect. The characterization just felt clumsy and abrupt.Max is like the Beta version of her newer nerdy hero. She uses a lot of the same character types in her writing, but that works for me because she writes them dead on. I only dislike a formula when it doesn't work well. So, I can see the charm of Max, but he just falls prey to a less polished form of writing. The motivations and personalities weren't as fleshed out and convincing as I was hoping for.Lilah was a hard character to like. I think her middle name must be \\"Jumps to Conclusions.\\" Seriously, most of their conflict stemmed from Lilah taking something Max said wrong. Maybe I was supposed to be on her side, but I thought her conclusions were pretty dumb and wish she would have just taken a moment to think before deciding she was the one wronged.The book wasn't bad, but it didn't thrill me. It's an okay way to pass the time, but I doubt it'll be one I reread. I wasn't planning to continue the series anytime soon but got suckered in by the foreshadowing of Suzanne and her possible love interest. I've been curious to read her story for a while now so hopefully I like it better."},{"Title":"CALHOUNS: CATHERINE, AMANDA AND LILAH","review":"The three stories revolve around 3 of 4 sisters who are trying to solve the mystery of some missing family emeralds.

I bought the Donovan legacy, Carolina Moon, and several other equally enjoyable books because they seemed romantic and realistic (to a point). I almost threw this book away half an hour after buying it because (...) Why is it acceptable for older women to treat their daughters or young female relatives like pieces of meat, and why would anyone think that's romantic? Also, why don't younger women get to stand up for themselves and express their anger? Why are these women so docile, and why can't the matriarch at least apologize in earnest for treating her nieces' feelings like garbage? Most of her other books have women being empowered and making their own decisions about the romance in their lives, but in this one, the aunt seems to think it's up to her whether her nieces choose to stay with these men. Nora Roberts has several good series, indeed several that I've read multiple times, like the Irish Born trilogy and Sullivan's Woman, but this one was perhaps the worst romance novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"CALHOUNS: CATHERINE, AMANDA AND LILAH","review":"First of all, the paperback I purchased DID NOT advertise that this is a series, and oh guess what, the story does not end. You have to buy more books.Second of all, the first two of the three romances are neanderthal type. These \\"romantic\\" male leads manhandle these women. In one instance it is definitely physical abuse, but the author wants us to think it is romantic??? If a man decked me the last thing I would do get moony-eyed and think it was erotic. This is sick romance, and I can't believe any woman would enjoy this.

Aunt Coco reminds me of my mom. I also like the personalities of the sisters and how they are able to stand up for themselves but appear feminine and maybe even a little helpless. Men do sometimes like to know they are needed, but we women know we have real backbone when we need it! I also enjoy the ongoing hunt for the emeralds and wondering what the slimey thief is going to try to pull next!I look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"CALHOUNS: CATHERINE, AMANDA AND LILAH","review":"Nora Roberts is a good writer, but she's at her best when she's writing a series that covers multiple family members. That's the case with this book, and continues with the stories of Suzanna and Megan. Each book is good on it's own, but it's better to read them order because the stories do tie together.The Calhoun women live in Bar Harbor in The Towers, the family home for over 80 years. The place has seen better days and they are facing the prospect of selling it. The first story is about Catherine and Trent. Trent's family owns a string of first-rate hotels and he wants to buy The Towers. The two, of course, have an attraction and by the end of the book, it is agreed that half will remain the Calhoun family home, half will be renovated into a hotel. Woven into the story is one about Bianca, the girls great-grandmother. It tells her story from her point of view about her loveless marriage and how she falls in love with a painter. The similarities between the two stories are wonderful.There is also the legend of the Calhoun emeralds, a necklace that Bianca hid from her husband and has never been found. It is agreed they are hidden in the house, and so the mystery of finding them begins.This is a great old-fashioned romance story. There is humor, love, friendship and mystery. The sisters are a wonderful group of women, Catherine, the mechanic, Amanda, the sensible one, Lilah, the carefree one and Suzanna, the mom. Megan, a sister-in-law by marriage, fits right in with them.Once you start reading the first entry, Courting Catherine, you won't stop until the conclusion with Megan's Mate. I found them hard to put down. Nora Roberts, once again, proves she's one of the best in romance writing!"},{"Title":"CALHOUNS: CATHERINE, AMANDA AND LILAH","review":"This is a reissue of the first three stories of the Calhoun Women Series, Courting Catherine, A Man for Amanda, and For the Love of Lilah.

Webb, first of all the aunt is extremely loving, I mean, she took in her four neices after their parents died, and she is usually funny, as are Suzanna's children. For the Love of Lilah was the second book I read by Nora Roberts, and if it hadn't been that good, I probably wouldn't of become the Nora-holic I am today. I need to own them all.

I enjoyed it the second time around as much as I did the first time.Yes, this is early Nora Roberts. But it is still wonderful.

Woven into the 3 seperate stories(and into the following 2 stories in the next book) is the continuing mystery of their great grandmother's tragic death and her missing emeralds. That alone will keep you intrigued and turning the pages.In the first story you meet the youngest Calhoun sister, C.C. She is a mechanic who runs her own shop. Trenton St. James is summoned to the old family house by the aunt to look into buying it as the family is in financial troubles and the palatial home is deteriorating.In the second story you meet Amanda, the second oldest a hotel manager that ends up falling for the architect designing the renovation of their home.In the third story we meet Lilah, the third sister. She is the beautiful dreamy eyed sister who rescues Max Quartermain from drowning in the ocean below the Towers.Each individual story is wonderful.

In the process, he lands a well-placed jab in the jaw of the dinosaur known as area studies. Jones makes an ambitious effort to historicize his study of modern Chinese music through a detailed account of its rise as an industry within a global context of technological and cultural change. His analysis of major figures in the modern Chinese musical world makes a substantial contribution to a neglected field of cultural enterprise in the study of modern China, while his focus on the music industry and musical culture of Shanghai, including records, cinema, cabarets, revues, and popular magazines and journals, sheds additional light to the growing field of Shanghai cultural history.Jones places the history of modern Chinese music within the frameworks of global capitalism, Euro-American colonialism, and the American \\"culture industry\\" that came to influence so many different parts of the world during the twentieth century. Even so, Yellow Music reminds us that China's own film industry, beginning with the first cinematic exhibition in a Shanghai teahouse in 1896, kept pace with Hollywood and eventually began to exert a significant ideological power of its own upon the Chinese movie-going and record-playing public, especially during the 1930s when the ideologies of nationalism became imbricated in the film music and content of Shanghai\`s leftist film studios. The advent of songwriter Nie Er--whose film song \\"March of the Volunteers\\" eventually became China's national anthem under the P.R.C.--on the Chinese stage and screen thus marks an important turning point in the history of modern China.Jones is at his best when describing the careers of musicians Li Jinhui and Nie Er, both of whom worked in Shanghai's burgeoning musical scene during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Li Jinhui established a blend of Chinese folk and Western jazz music to create the sounds of modern Chinese pop. He commercialized his music through song-and-dance troupes, one of which included his daughter Li Minghui. Although his efforts to nationalize his music through the use of Mandarin was a valid contribution to the project of modern Chinese nationalism, the contents of his music and dance programs were deemed prurient or \\"yellow\\" by both conservative and leftist Chinese nationalists.Nie Er began his career as a songwriter working under Li Jinhui. Following the attack by Japan on the Zhabei district of Shanghai in 1932, and in the context of heightened Chinese nationalism that followed Japanese aggression during the 1930s, Nie Er turned away from the \\"yellow\\" music of sinified jazz and began writing \\"revolutionary\\" music for leftist films. His efforts to infuse a sense of heroic Chinese nationalism into his music through strident marches and patriotic lyrics earned him fame among leftists and communists. Today, a statue of Nie Er in a small park on the corner of Fuxing and Huaihai Roads attests to his status as a revolutionary hero in the communist pantheon.That Nie Er's \\"March of the Volunteers\\" became the anthem of a totalitarian regime is an irony that is apparently lost on Jones, as are the hegemonic tendencies of Han Chinese nationalists, who even during the height of European colonialist endeavors were bent on disciplining, subjugating, and suppressing other ethnicities within the Chinese geopolitical sphere, not to mention their own people. Jones\`s attempt to explain the fascist tendencies of Chiang Kai-shek and his Blue Shirts as nave strikes one as unnecessarily apologetic. Nor does Jones fully explore the implications of the imposition of a national language via music and film on the ethnic and regional identities of hundreds of millions of people in China who did not speak Mandarin as their native tongue.One is also skeptical at times about the quality of the research that went into this slim volume. For instance, Jones begins his study with an anecdote about the African American jazz musician Buck Clayton, who traveled to Shanghai in the 1930s to play in the city's nightclubs. Jones uses anecdotes drawn from Clayton's autobiography to illustrate \\"truths\\" about the complex racial hierarchy that characterized the polyglot city of Shanghai. The story of Clayton's dismissal from the Canidrome Ballroom, told briefly from the point of view of Clayton himself, is actually far more complicated than Jones makes it out to be. In fact, it was not Caucasian American managers and Marines who engineered his dismissal, but rather the club's Chinese managers, who themselves were under the influence of the notorious mob boss Du Yuesheng. The man who attacked Clayton was not a Marine but rather an American mobster named Jack Riley who was probably paid by the Chinese management to start the fight. The real objective was to fire the band for causing a disturbance, since the band had become too expensive to maintain and since there was no other way to legally sever their contract. This is just one of many topics in the book whose nuances could have been explored more fully.For a study of an academic topic as serious and complex as the rise of modern Chinese music, Jones's book is refreshingly short. Moreover, despite numerous references to cultural and critical theory and the liberal peppering of his text with theoretical jargon, the book remains highly readable, engaging, and stimulating throughout. For these reasons, Yellow Music may serve well as an addition to any college course on modern China, colonialism, music history, or globalization."},{"Title":"The Couple","review":"The Couple is a husband and wife's utterly frank account of their experience in the Masters & Johnson sex clinic.

Any current ir prospective owner should get Debbie Ducommun's books, Rat health Care, and Rats for Today's Pet Owner (this is available here). Debbie is the &quot;rat lady&quot; and her books should be considered rat owners bibles.Just because a book is written by a vet does not mean it should be taken at face value. I give this book no stars because it deserves none.

I have always been fascinated about all aspects of their lives. But never have I read a book about them which demonstrated just how sad their lives really were. This is not a narrative or biographical review of the Dionnes. Rather, it is a collection of the records of various observations and experments done on the children who, in my opinion, became not only the human interest story of the century, but also laboratory rats. Here, you will find palm and foot prints,photographic studies, and charts detailing eveything from feedings and growth, to play times and trips to the washroom. As you read through the various studies, you will enter the sterile and restricted hospital which was their home in their first years and beyond. You will quickly come to realize why these little girls had such trouble adjusting to family life as well as society in general. This book is for anyone who is able to look past the pretty and fascinating pictures of 5 identical baby girls and see the truth beyond the headlines and government propoganda. It's not an easy read, but the Blatz studies shed much light on attitudes of the day concerning not only child rearing but also the supposed well treatment of our &quot;National Treasures&quot;."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"...I really enjoy the zombie genre. I have a huge collection of both zombie movies, fiction and games, many of which are very good. This book is not. The following are my opinions, but I stand by them.Project phoenix Dead Rising tm is in my opinion not only the worst book I have ever read, but I suspect the worst book ever written. The sad thing is that I was looking forward to reading it. I shelled out my $...plus shipping and waited for it to arrive, happy that zombies were getting more attention. Eagerly I opened the cover (The design of which is very nice.) The dedication page citied all the right sources, so far so good. Then I read the introduction, things began to fall apart at that point. As soon as the author's voice entered the story I became worried. Then the prologue, which for no reason what-so-ever switches from the all knowing narration to first person. This trick might have worked if the author had anything interesting to say but sadly that was not the case. In fact here is when I really began to notice what a train wreck this \\"novel\\" really was.There appears to have been no editing besides a quick run through with a spell checker. All the words are spelled correctly, but they are in the wrong place. The comical result being that at times the main character ends up sounding Jamaican. With phrases like \\"him arm\\" rather than \\"his arm\\". But that's only the beginning... When I encountered sentences like \\"They were each one the dead rumored in legend that found a new meal to nibble upon with Gibson.\\" What?!Perhaps English is Mr. Patterson's second language, perhaps he is \\"special\\" I don't know, but I do know that I shelled out about $...dollars for this!It gets better, or worse depending on your point of view. By the first chapter the author begins to include quotes, which is fine except he quotes himself! Complete with the dates that he said these profound things. One can only imagine the hubris involved with quoting oneself, particularly when he says nothing that hasn't been said before and better by other people. Take for example this winner \\"God is forgiving of sin. Does the devil wage this as well?\\" I can guess what this is supposed to mean, but it's just bad language. The kicker is that the date given is 07/09/94-03/19/99...it took him about five years to polish that specimen of an insight.The book is full of forgettable, clich&eacute;d characters, a plot that makes no sense and writing that is honestly at a junior high level. The author has no problem using the same word over and over again in a sentence ( Thesauruses are not that expensive.) And yes I get it! You are naming characters after people involved with the zombie genre! But fear not because at the end of the book he thoughtfully explains what he meant to all you dimwits out there reading it. Actually he explains pretty much everything and goes on to pat himself on the back for being original. (Which he is not)I cringed expectantly when he introduced a character named Dante'. I knew it was just a matter of time before he would start a fire to be called \\"Dante's inferno\\" I was not disappointed. (Well, yes I was...but the author did it none the less.)I prayed there would not being a sex scene...page 209 made sure my nightmares became a reality. The passage was trite, insulting and predictable. Like a pubescent boy's fantasy of what sex might be like.A very telling moment is when the author begins a diatribe about how jocks (pretty boy types) don't know how to treat or appreciate a woman. The just use them and throw them away. It comes off sounding like a personal beef by someone who has been rejected a few too many times.The entire time I was reading this monstrous book I couldn't help picturing the comic book guy from the simpsons having written it. ) In my opinion, the final nail (in this book's proverbial coffin) of this being nothing more than glorified \\"fan boy\\" fiction came at the afterward when the author talked of this being a trilogy and describing it as a \\"star wars of the dead\\".By any stretch of the imagination this is an awful book. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it. Spend your money on anything else. Rent a good zombie movie, take your sweetheart out on a date, because the real horror of this tome is that it's out there, disguised as literature and waiting for you to waste your hard earned money on it.If you want to be scared think of this, the author has promised (threatened) that there may be two more to follow it. Well fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I am done with anything this author has to say.Now since I did pay for this book I have found a great use for it. I have many friends who are writers, when they come over we open it to a random page and read aloud. It never fails to get a laugh. So in the long run I suppose I did get my money's worth, but I would advise you not to take the risk. I could go on and on but I won't.This is a bad book by someone who has no artistic grasp of language. They say an infinite amount of monkeys given an infinite amount of time could write a Shakespeare play. If that is true my guess is that this took a couple a monkeys and a long weekend.If you need instant proof of how bad the writting is, check out the author's own 5 star review of his work right here on this page. He can't even get the title of his review right. It should read \\"Raising the Dead\\" or perhaps \\"The Rising Dead\\" But not as he wrote \\"Rising the Dead\\"."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"First let me just say that I appreciate all of the reviews submitted, both good and bad. These help to show me my mistakes and where to improve. Project Phoenix WAS in fact started around high school and my maturity level may have not been up there with the likes of Stephen King or others. I shouldn't attack some of the bad reviewers, because we all need them even if they seem to go out of their way to bash something that doesn't fit into their view of the world. Being mean-spirited and actually personally attacking the author is wrong. You have the right to your opinion and disgust, but keep it in focus and point out the flaws in the product, the book, not a human being. With the faceless nature of the Internet, it seems many individuals seem fit to say things they may not say in person without thinking of the consquences. Being libel to a person is damaging to that individual's reputation. For that, their opinion becomes meaningless because they can't concentrate on the nature of the book, but instead on the nature of the person they haven't even met.I can waste my time here and go on, but I think you get the point. You love it or you don't. I can't change your mind. I can tell you that hopefully in the near future, I will have this book and others edited by a college level English Professor and have the book republished. I apologize that it is in the state it is and is embarassing to say the least. Certain things will be removed such as the personal quotes, which is really stupid, I realize that now. I will try to bring them up to more professional standards and hope you will give me a second chance. I would like to make things right for those who were disappointed, but I wouldn't have the resources to do so.Project Phoenix was my second novel and it does show. Once again, I'm sorry.-D. Patterson 03/23/05"},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"There were several other well written reviews so I will keep this brief.First of all if you read nothing else in this review...stay away from this book!I have never read such a weak and unprofessionally written story. Spell check cannot stand in for an editor. The plot is weak and the characters are paper thin. The story is hard to follow becuase the sentance structure is so bad.So you know, I love zombie movies/books and based on experience I have pretty low expectations. There are so many well written zombie novels out there this one can be missed.Instead try some of the following (not in any order): &quot;The Rising&quot; by Keene (not great but not terrible), &quot;Reign of the Dead&quot; by Len Barnhart (not bad, the story is a little weak), and finally &quot;The Dead&quot; by Mark Rogers (One of the best zombie books out there).Before You say I am being overly harsh, I paid $20 for this piece of garbage. By reading this book I EARNED the right to be critical."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. From bad phrasing to over the top descriptions it was tedious. I couldn't even finish it, I made it to chapter four and gave up. Mr. Patterson, good luck in the future. You're gonna need it."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"I love zombie stories don't get me wrong. I read alot of fanfic and truly do understand a work of love as opposed to writing to make a living. HOWEVER; this book would turn a zombie's stomach. It is that awful. I'm embarrassed for him. I actually read some of the paragraphs out loud to my husband to see if it is actually as BAD as it looks to me as I read it. It almost seems like a bad joke but it isn't. DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THIS BOOK. You'll be disappointed and god forbid we give any encouragement to this man. AND who the hell told him that the author picture on the back was cool? Jeez. Could you look anymore like an idiot? AND is that a nudie calendar behind him? I bet he lives in his mom's basement. This is just sad."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"...and I quote the author. On one hand, I give full credit to anyone who has the gumption to sit down and write a novel. On the other hand, with spell check and grammar check on most word processing programs, there's just no excuse for the multitide of errors found in this book. On the OTHER hand, I've had a great time opening up to random pages and reading things like 'he coped a feel of a corpse.' However, I've been unable to read the book through because the errors are just too distracting. I hope that the author channels some of his energy into editing next time around."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"This is not the worst book I've ever read, mainly because I don't really want to acknowledge that I've read it. I've never encountered such a waste of paper, ink, and time. The story itself is horribly derivative without a single claim to originality. No zombie book can claim to be completely original if its inspired by George Romero's work, but the author steals so many specific details from films and computer games that one wonders how working on this book satisfied any form of creative impulse for him. The first zombies are from a remote island (Just like Fulci's \\"Zombie\\"). An accident releases the zombies (just like \\"Resident Evil\\"). The Zombies need to eat human brains to ease the pain of death, and the ending involves the government dropping a nuclear weapon to stop the zombies (lifted directly from \\"Return of the Living Dead). The characters are all perverts or twisted in some way, which instead of adding spice only makes you roll your eyes since it happens again and again. This book itself is a visual assault since most of the characters spend their time in the book SHOUTING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE SHOUTING BECAUSE WHEN THEY DO THE AUTHOR WRITES WHOLE PARAGPRAHS IN CAPS!The worst and most embarrassing part about this book is the spelling and grammar. There are so many errors and so many typos that one is forced to wonder if even the author read his own work. The grammar and typos are so extreme that the book verges on public humiliation. On more than one occasion he writes the word \`we' instead of \`he', forgets verbs, forgets his subject verb agreement, and consistantly uses the word Revered instead of Reverend (which actually might have been a play on words, but the sarcasm is lost in the midst of the thousands of other mistakes which accompany it). Actually, my favorite part of the book is the ending when the U.S. Government decides to drop an 'Adam Bomb', not an Atom Bomb on the zombies.A real disaster of a book. If you want zombie literature, read Bernhart's \\"Reign of the Dead\\", or better yet Craig and Spector's \\"Still Dead\\"."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"The first thing you need to understand is that this is an IBOOK -self published. It shows!While the IDEA is sound, it goes downhill fast. The writing is a mishmash of ideas borrowed from Romero films, Return Of The Living Dead, and oddly, the bible. The story is woven together in a reasonable way...more or less...and the author doesn't skimp on the gore or perversion (Touching on necrophilia and pedophilia in places) but gore alone doesn't save this one.I wouldn't buy this one mainly because of the godawful spelling problems and syntax errors. - They make it a painfull read. Still if you must have anything zombie this could add to a collection if only for completion. Otherwise, avoid!"},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"This book failed to scare me.

However, DBP's atrocious spelling (too many errors to count on any given single page), meandering sentences that border on prattle, incorrect or inappropriate usage of words (which proves that he must have skipped vocabulary lessons in English class as well as spelling) and poor syntax and sentence structure, render this book unreadable. If not for the picture of the adult author on the back of the book, my best guess would have been that the book was the product of a semi-literate grade school student (no offense meant to grade school students). I am begging DBP, please get someone to edit your next book, or at the very least run a spell check on your file before it is published. For those who enjoy Dead literature that displays a basic command of the English language on the part of the author, I recommend (as have other reviewers) Reign of the Dead, or the Dead anthologies, The Book of the Dead and Still Dead."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"it didnt read well and Couldnt stay interseted in it."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"This book is A-W-F-U-L!!!

Shoot, he could have probably even found a high school English teacher somewhere to proofread his book for free, if he could not afford an editor!Very poorly written & a pure rip-off.....Do not waste your money on this book, unless your idea of fun is trying to figure out what he heck he is saying!"},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"This book is unreadable.

In the meantime, I'll stick with Mark Hunter's The Dead, The Books of All Flesh series, and Skipp &amp; Spectors Books of the Dead series. Sorry, Darrin, I really do share your passion, but you need to stop smoking that crap before you sit down in front of your word processor."},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"This book IS about zombies. It has plenty of things that anyone interested in this sort of thing would find appealing. On one side, you have violence, intense and sometimes non-stop. Gore galore of zombies feasting on the living, damned as they are. On the other, you have a conflicting human side to it of what seems to be real people at times, trying to survive in a world gone mad. It plays like a paper and pulp B-Movie, with action that includes the army and police thrown into the mix. True, the author seems to have stumbled on a few spelling, but truth be told, I have seen the same from such big celebs as Stephen King himself. (i.e. Cujo was spelled: Jujo or something to that effect.) It seems to be either human or machine error, but who really cares in the long run? Most of these reviewers seem to want something that is hard to deliver in a post Romero living dead universe. George will always be king of that, regardless, but I believe the author has tried to recreate something that is truly lacking in this particular genre. It isn't a Hardy Boys book that you can read in one afternoon. The author does jump around from character to character whom are in different locations, but that is the only way it seems to be able to tell many sides of a story. (I think it would be truly hard to understand if he would have told of one character and halfway through the book, changed to another and never went back to the first until the end. So, in this way, he switches back and forth for the reader to see how the others are getting along.) More and more, it seems some of these reviewers can't grasp the large picture and would probably do better with a coloring book instead. In the end, not the greatest, but certainly not the worse. I recommend you give it a read, and if you don't want to buy it, then borrow it somewhere. (Believe me, I did since I was initially dupped into not buying it from the reviews, but now I am definitely willing to purchase it someday.)"},{"Title":"Project Phoenix: Dead Rising","review":"...

It's a great book about zombies. Patterson knows, about what he's writing - and that's good. Combined with classic situations that we all know from various zombie-shlashers, the author presents a fresh upgrade for a genre that was too long forgotten.The only negative thing about this book is the too often used slang-languige.

In this first installment, we eavesdrop on Godwin's life as she emerges as a writer during her travels to Europe as a young woman.The journals open as Godwin is waitressing at a resort in North Carolina, saving money for her grand excursion. She is soon on a ship headed to Denmark --- and adventure. Humorous character sketches of her fellow passengers draw the reader in as we follow her to her destination.Godwin struggles with self-doubt as a writer and her relationship with the man she loves in Denmark, as well as her perennial lack of money. She considers going home, but when she's offered a job in London, she takes it. First, though, she visits the Canary Islands for a blissful month. Afterward, she is torn between staying with a local love and going on to London. When she finally decides, her leave-taking is wrenching.In London, her roller-coaster writer's life continues with the highs of doing good work and completing projects in which she takes pride. The lows are rejections and periods of writing inertia. She similarly experiences a roller-coaster relationship with 38-year-old never-married, \\"probably hopeless\\" James. She connects with other men and travels back to North Carolina to meet up with an old lover.Back in London, Godwin struggles with co-workers, office politics, changing apartments, and writing or not writing. She yearns for a true relationship with a man, all the while despising herself for caring so much. At the same time, she celebrates her freedom.Godwin constantly thinks about her writing. Even as she battles self-doubt she concocts rules to write by, such as: Don't be false. Trust in the story. Eliminate the dull parts. Forget second-best plots. Don't anticipate the reader's reaction. Start somewhere, anywhere. Let the ending be found in the beginning.The reader of THE MAKING OF A WRITER is privileged to watch as Godwin composes a story, talking herself through each part and using her life experiences --- a fascinating process. She also includes advice on keeping a journal and the reflection that her journal entries seed writing that may come decades later. The book is also liberally peppered with footnotes; at the outset I found these distracting but soon came to relish them.I've been a Gail Godwin fan for decades. After reading her journal, I feel that I now know her as a struggling author and as a person of moods and vulnerabilities. I constantly looked forward to my time reading it and discovering more about the author. It is particularly fascinating to read Godwin's latest novel, QUEEN OF THE UNDERWORLD, which was partially based on the author's experience as a young reporter in Miami, in order to discover echoes between the two books: a suicide, waitressing jobs, significant names, and more. An excellent read; highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon (terryms2001@yahoo.com)"},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer: Journals, 1961-1963","review":"I first read Gail Godwin's work in the mid-seventies, when in the midst of the women's movement, I was trying to find my way through the dilemma of being an independent woman who loved men. Godwin had been there before me, and I was attracted to her early novels--The Perfectionist, The Odd Woman and Violet Clay.Now, reading her journal, I see that she was addressing of this dilemma nine years before she published her first novel in 1970. She's been one step ahead of me ever since. At first, this journal seems to be rather typically about a woman with a wealth of male lovers and friends who can't decide who's Mr. Right. Remember, this is pre-Second Wave feminism, on the early edge of the Sexual Revolution. She's so circumspect about her sexuality that you must read carefully to figure out who she's sleeping with, and who she's not. Although Britain must have been more open that North Carolina where she grew up, Gail scandalizes the people who run the boarding house where she lives by staying out all night. She struggles with developing her own moral compass just as diligently as she struggles with her affection for a variety of men.She also forms one of her rare female friendships with an American woman of color, something that was uncommon for Southern white women as the Civil Rights movement gained momentum.Meanwhile, she flogs herself about her writing and re-writing of various fictions, none of which makes it to publication during the course of this journal. She takes her vocation as a writer seriously, above anything else. Amazingly, she's only twenty-four when this journal begins, but she's already married and discarded one husband and one career as a journalist.Beyond her determination to be a writer, two things intrigued me about these musings: the attraction she must have held for men and the absence of mention of her parents. I found explanations for both that satisfied me before I finished. The poet Sylvia Plath was about the same age as Godwin and lived in London at the same time. There is no indication that they encountered each other, but it's interesting to compare how the two women addressed very similar personal and vocational issues.Now I want to return to the novels and see if they have the same power I felt when I first read them. Godwin was brave to publish this journal, because by spilling her guts on some very raw material, she reveals how her persistence led to a rich literary career."},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer: Journals, 1961-1963","review":"This book didn't quite float my bar of soap. But there a lot of subjective reasons for that.1. I've never read Godwin's fiction, so I have no connection to her as author or a person.2. I found it difficult to relate to her lifestyle and personal problems.3. I was hoping for more writing-related tidbits, instead of Godwin's social life.The tidbits I did find were interesting and encouraging, as comisserative comparison between authors often is. But, all in all, through no fault of the author's, I just didn't find much in here that applied to me."},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer: Journals, 1961-1963","review":"On the face of it, this book seems to be pitched to aspiring writers, but I think that it holds greater value as a reflection of the early 1960's, and as a testimony to the human spirit.In \\"The Making of a Writer\\" Gail Godwin describes her life in terms that echo the words of a heroine in her fictional work, \\"The Odd Woman\\". In that book, the character of Jane says, \\"Sometimes I think those persons raised in the interstices of Zeitgeists are the ones most punished.\\"At the beginning of the 1960's, America was not a country given over to self-examination. A resurgence of feminism was nothing more than a vague rumor that may have swirled in the air. Women in the early 60's were not well positioned for success. This was a generation in peril of falling through the cracks. The truest echo of this time may be Sylvia Plath's classic, \\"The Bell Jar\\".For Gail Godwin, the 60's began with an abortive attempt at marraige and a short stint as a journalist with the Miami Herald which also ended disastrously. Focusing her indomitable will on her desire to become a writer, Godwin embarked on a personal odyssey, traveling to Denmark, Spain, and the Canary Islands before taking a job with the Travel Service and extended residence in London.In her journals she depicts both the struggle to become a published fiction writer, and a deeper quest to understand herself and other human beings. As she records impressions of her life and the characters who populate it, she also strives to find the modern writers that most speak to her sensibilities and to discover the essences she most wants to inform her own stories.As a \\"twenty- something'', Godwin is possessed of a very acute intelligence--but the reader will also find hints of youthful callowness. To her credit, Godwin has not expurgated her journals. Their scrupulous honesty is part of their appeal.As the book progresses, Godwin seems to shift her aims away from overly idealized characterizations and toward a new concern with \\"displaced persons\\". As this volume ends, she is beginning to investigate Carl Jung's psychological theories, something which seems to bode well for a young writer who views much of the world in black and white.One thing that I didn't find endearing about this book was its use of an \\"explicator\\", in the form of editor Rob Neufeld. His italicized introductions and interjections often seem to be leading the reader like a rather stuffy tour guide through the Musee d' Godwin. I didn't really appreciate his presence, and I wish Godwin had done the honors (of \\"explication\\") herself.Not every reader who comes to this book is going to buy into the idea, as Neufeld does, that Godwin is a writer of greatness deserving to join Faulkner, Steinbeck, or even Salinger in the firmament. The excerpts from the fiction Godwin was writing at the time of these memoirs reveal only a talented beginner---one who seems intimidated by the contemporary Beat writers ( her story about a Village girl seems lifeless ) and unsure about how to fully animate fiction drawing on her own backround.It could be that in the future, nonetheless, these diaries (of which this volume is the first) may be regarded as Godwin's best work. I am not ready to compare her to Anais Nin or Lou Salome, but these journals do reveal an estimable intelligence possessed of great determination. In finally stepping out from behind the veil of fiction, it is here that Godwin may make her lasting mark."},{"Title":"The Making of a Writer: Journals, 1961-1963","review":"Gail Godwin's latest book is as much about the struggle of a female in her mid-twenties to find her life's work, as it is about writing. As her story unfolds over a two-year period, the reader can sense the author's growth, both as a person and as a writer. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to be a writer."},{"Title":"Hydrophidian (Spider Garden Book Two)","review":"You can read Hydrophidian (and its predecessor Spider Garden) as addressing a fundamental question in science fiction: what will people do with their time if they don't have to work and all is possible?

Yes, I know it is based on fantasy and whatnot but maybe I've read one too many stories intended for adults that are looking repetitive which is why I'm pretty fed up with artists reaching for that sort of angle to make something ''darker & more taboo''. I know that depravity is the name of the game when it comes to some if not most of S&M; fiction and some readers may dig that sort of thing but as we politely say on this side of the woods, YKINMK.I LOVE the artwork of Michael Manning.

This is fresh air to me. And rejuvenates me.This French author is intense.He shares his faith (Christian Catholic), and especially brings a new perspective to hope. Theologal hope. The one that moves you, that keeps you moving, and keeps you living. In peace. Towards God. Unites you, in a way, to God's hope and love.Most of all he depicts how God himself hopes in us! In a way, depends on us. On our will to do good.In a sense, it is also an answer to all those of us who, in time, ask why there are so many ill in this world. Why God would let people harm others.There is a question of love. Which depends on freedom of will to respond or not to the given love. To do good or ill. Without this freedom, there would be no love. Without hope and confidence in love, only hatred would exist, and war, and ill.This book is about hope, faith, love, God and us, in a moving, living relationship.A really moving reading to do!"},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"Randolph Marcy, an army cavalry officer, wrote this book (1859) when it became apparent to him that nobody better qualified was going to do the job. He intended for the book to serve as a manual for those who were going to travel westward by wagon train over rugged territory inhabited by hostile indians. A glance at his index reveals the information and actions he deemed vital: choosing a route and a group leader, selecting wagons and draft animals, buying provisions, supplies, equipments, personal clothing and weapons, march procedures, herding and guarding animals, organizing a first-aid kit, treating snakebites, selecting campsites, pitching tents, building fires, fording rivers, etc.When Marcy explains the value of a qualified leader-guide, and the merits of having people with hunter-woodsman skills, he deviates somewhat and talks at length about indians. Eastern indians differ greatly from western indians, he explains, and all indians have natural skills of tracking and navigating uncharted territory that white men can rarely emulate. He describes indian tracking techniques, their use of smoke signals and sign language, and their battle tactics - simular in certain respects to those used by Arab guerrillas. He describes how they hunt the bigger animals - the buffalo, bears, deer, antelopes and bighorn sheep.In brief, this little book (230 pages)- written for the 'prairie traveler' by a man who'd 'been there and done that' is entertaining, fascinating, and informative. Read it and you'll view those old western movies through new eyes."},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"A fascinating assemblage of facts and information for the overland emigrant of the mid-1800's to successfully complete the long, arduous journey to the west coast. Captain Marcy includes everything one can possibly imagine: from types of wagons, livestock, food, provisions and medicines to fording rivers, selection of campsites, types of saddles, packing, tracking, guides, guards, etc. and habits of Indians. The itineraries at the end of the book detail the mileages, availability of water, grass, wood, road conditions, etc. along several different routes to the Pacific. With our many modern day conveniencies traveling across the country, we tend to dismiss the hardships and sacrifices our pioneers endured while traversing the continent. This little book puts it all into focus."},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and bought some for friends who like history. The reading is easy, though you will find a dictionary helpful with some of the archaic words. I have relatives who crossed the prairie in 1848 to California; I have a much better understanding of what the trip must've been like.For those who love American history, esp. the old west I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"Read this book and you will view things a bit differently on your next drive. As you effortlessly drive across a bridge over a river at 65 MPH, your thoughts may well travel back to Captain Marcy's advice on how to cross a river with wagons pulled by mule-team.This book is essential to any author, movie director or Living Historian who wants to \\"get it right\\". THE PRAIRIE TRAVELER is chock-full of information about overland travel in the mid-19th century, and covers almost any possible, practical, useful subject related to wilderness travel. Although it is written in 1850's American English, it is actually a fairly easy read with very little \\"culture shock\\".For those of you with the cerebral agility to remove the mental straight-jacket of \\"Political Correctness\\", THE PRAIRIE TRAVELER will accurately picture the Frontier society as it existed at the time. It was a very good society in most ways, with the limitations that 19th century people were born into and educated with. Those pioneers did advance themselves, bit-by-bit, away from the limitations they were born into, and the result is the 21st Century America we live in today. We stand on their shoulders, advanced as far as we are today, because of the small advances they made in their generation.A 21st century man condemning a 19th century man for being the product of his times reflects the mental and educational limitations of the 21st century man."},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"A good insight into the mind of an inhabitant of the new world in the 1800s. Very unpolitically correct to the point of being amusing (section on 'Indians'). I read this book on a long camping tour and liked in a lot. There are some sections that are more like lists, and arenot as interesting, but you can skip over them."},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"One of the most practical and popular guides to the settlement of the West was Randolph B. Marcy's THE PRAIRIE TRAVELER, published in 1859. Marcy had graduated from West Point in 1832, and by 1859 he had extensive experience in the West as a U.S. Army officer. By the late 1850's, thousands of Americans were streaming west, and many were dying along the way. Marcy's book, with its practical advice presented in plain English based on twenty-five years of experience, surely saved additional deaths.THE PRAIRIE TRAVELER contains sections on such various and sundry matters as \\"The different Routes to California and Oregon\\"; \\"Relative Merits of Mules and Oxen\\"; \\"Camp Equipage\\"; \\"Different methods of finding and purifying [water]\\"; \\"Stampedes\\"; \\"Repairing broken Wagons\\"; \\"Descending Mountains\\"; and \\"Rattlesnake Bites\\". The last thirty pages consist of eight detailed \\"itineraries\\" or routes, showing for each \\"the distances between camping-places, the character of the roads, and the facilities for obtaining wood, water, and grass.\\"More so than any other nineteenth-century \\"emigrant guide\\" that I have browsed through, Marcy's makes for enjoyable reading for an inquisitive modern reader. Better than almost any other book I know of, and certainly better than any Hollywood movie I can think of, it communicates to the modern reader the sorts of everyday matters the Westward emigrants had to deal with and therefore should know in order to complete their migration successfully.Mixed in with his practical advice are numerous anecdotes from Marcy's career in the West. These stories save the book from being a dry, pedantic \\"how to\\" manual. They also serve as a window into the mind-set of an intelligent, Caucasian facilitator of Manifest Destiny. Most Indians are \\"savages\\". Buffalo, grizzly bears, and big-horn sheep are there to be hunted, wantonly. Without evincing any regret, Marcy writes about the buffalo: \\"Not many years since they thronged in countless multitudes over all that vast area lying between Mexico and the British possessions, but now their range is confined within very narrow limits, and a few more years will probably witness the extinction of the species.\\" For Marcy, the white man is sweeping over the West and in the process eradicating the Indian and the buffalo -- and that's simply the way it is, no different than the earth revolving on its axis.This edition published by Cosimo Classics is a facsimile of a nineteenth-century edition of THE PRAIRIE TRAVELER. (However, I don't believe that it is a facsimile of the original 1859 publication.) Several other print-on-demand editions of THE PRAIRIE TRAVELER are presently offered by Amazon, but I would opt for this Cosimo Classics edition. (Plus, it's cheaper.)"},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"It's impossible for us today to imagine what a frightening proposition it must've been in the mid-19th century to sell your eastern farm or business and prepare to head west to start a new life. Maps were unreliable, distances were staggering, and stories about wild animals and Indians sobering. It wasn't quite like stepping off the edge of the world, but it probably seemed like it to many greenhorns.So in 1859, Captain Randolph Marcy, under orders from the Department of War, wrote The Prairie Traveler. Marcy, who would later serve as a Brigadier in the Civil War, was an accomplished traveler in the west, and his guidebook was packed with useful information for the determined but inexperienced pioneer taking either the northern overland trail to Oregon or the southern Sante Fe one to California.The book is great reading--and, not infrequently, helpful even today for the camper when it comes to advice about improvising shelter or lighting a fire from damp wood. For the mid-19th century reader, it provides essential tips on provisions, wagon-packing and animal-care, first aid (large doses of whiskey are the best remedy for rattlesnake bite), identifying good water (alkaline ponds are surrounded by yellow-reddish grass), improvisation (red willow bark is a good substitute for tobacco), collapsible camp furniture, and gun safety. The food section is especially interesting. Marcy recommends carrying lots of dried vegetables (one ounce of dry vegetables, when wettened, equals an entire ration), \\"cold flour,\\" a concoction of flour, cinammon, and sugar which, when mixed with a bit of water, provides a pick-me-up (not unlike today's energy bar), and jerked meat (no need for salt; the prairie sun will dry buffalo strips in short order). He also provides a rather gruesome recipe for pemmican (powdered buffalo meat saturated in raw buffalo fat, sown up in a hide bag with the hair turned outwards).Marcy distrusts and indeed actively dislikes Plains Indians, although he admires Delawares and Shawnees, and writes quite warmly of a Delaware friend of his named Black Beaver. So he spends a fair number of pages warning prairie travelers to be wary of approaching Indians. To better prepare them, he teaches the rudiments of sign language, teaches how to track Indians (scattered mustang manure rather than whole mustang manure indicates Indians on the move rather than just a wild mustang herd), and gives detailed instructions on how to sleep with cocked and primed rifles. It never seems to occur to Marcy that Plains Indians were a diverse group, or that their animosity might've had more to do with the white pioneers' presence than with the natural meanness he attributes to them.A fascinating read!"},{"Title":"The Prairie Traveler (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"I bought this book (used paperback copy) to do research for an assignment.

There are only six references listed, none of which are Kano's original writings. For someone as important in the modern Olympic movement as the author depicts Kano, there must be some of Kano's work extant. The author provides a large number of quotes and conversations, several from letters Kano wrote, but does not provide sources for this. Most of the conversations seem stilted and forced. I can't say I gained much insight into Kano's philosophy and the development of Kodokan judo."},{"Title":"The Father of Judo: A Biography of Jigoro Kano (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)","review":"Available for 5 years now, one can still pick up a First Edition copy in most book stores. Mr. Watson does a fine job at basically presenting Kano Jigoro to a public that is especially starved of information about the man and his many accomplishments, on and off the mat.However, from the perspective of good biography and as an historical work, it does not go nearly deep enough into Kano's life and, frustratingly so, can (and does) leave the reader with more questions than answers about this remarkable man's life.That said, there is so very little that has been written about Kano that I grudgingly rate it at 4 stars. For this reason alone, I think it belongs on the library shelf of any self-respecting judoka. Mr. Watson, however, could have given this subject a much more extensive treatment."},{"Title":"The Father of Judo: A Biography of Jigoro Kano (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)","review":"For most judo students, this will provide an excellent introduction to the founder of judo.

The book went through Kano's life very quickly and failed to cover large segments of his life. It provided good detail in some areas but was woefully lacking in other areas. Plus, the book was written on a very low level, practically at a child's level. In addition, it was obvious that the author did not have much to contribute because he filled the book at the end with tournament results. How this had anything to do with the subject is beyond me. It is a necessary book to have but I expected better."},{"Title":"The Father of Judo: A Biography of Jigoro Kano (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)","review":"This book is valuable for providing little-known information about an important figure. Unfortunately, it is written at about an eighth-grade level. Those who read history seriously will be frustrated by the book's superficiality. It is difficult to determine what is documented and what is contrived for readability. The author states up front that he has created dialogue to make the book more interesting, but there is no way to tell which dialogue is created. For example, were those really Kano's last words? On the other hand, the photographs are terrific, and a time-line of events (at the end of the book) is very helpful."},{"Title":"The Father of Judo: A Biography of Jigoro Kano (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior)","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Mary Johnson is the very model of what an intellectual and educator should be.This book is set mostly in Canada, and during the long-ago years 1956-1970; and yet, of all the many excellent book about the reading wars, this might be the best. Only 170 pages long, it manages to be both intensely personal and high-scholarly. It shows you the kids, parents and schools struggling with look-say; the politicians ducking; the Education Establishment scheming for dollars and control.My own conclusion about public education in the last 75 years is that it is a swamp of sophistries and lies, not to mention depravity. This book reinforces my conclusion. Mary Johnson, a music tutor and housewife in Winnipeg, begins to realize that kids don't know how to read. She slowly launches a challenge, presenting to the government her analysis and proposals. She is hugely counterattacked by the Canadian education professors, the publishing companies who made so many millions of dollars on Dick and Jane books, and by that lobbying group called the International Reading Association (IRA). Watching these people conspire in perfect harmony to make sure kids don't learn to read is creepy. You can just imagine the sneer these phonies used in dismissing a housewife in 1959. And yet she just kept fighting. She should be a feminist icon.On balance, the bad boys won more often than not. But it's also fair to say that Mary Johnson and her allies throughout Canada and the United States (in particular, the RRF or Reading Reform Foundation) probably saved millions of children from complete illiteracy.Which brings us to the title: \\"Programmed Illiteracy in our Schools.\\" I found this book because I was looking for early references to \\"planned illiteracy\\" (I'm doing so because of an upcoming book called \\"Planned Illiteracy in Australia?\\".) In fact, authors in many countries have made more or less the same charge. Somebody there is that doesn't love a book!And how did they intend to reduce literacy? Typically, when people try to explain the Reading Wars, they start off talking about the silliness of memorizing words as shapes or configurations. But Mary Johnson reminds me that there is an aspect more primal that needs to be focused on, and it's all laid out in this paragraph on page 77: \\"The publishers taught our teachers to regard Dick and Jane as a scientific, all-inclusive, delicately balanced teaching tool, not to be tinkered with by amateurs. It was frequently stressed that English was \`not a phonetic language' and that children did not need to be told the separate letter sounds. \`Surely we don't have anyone here who is old-fashioned enough to tell children the sounds of the letters!' teased one consultant [from a publishing company].\\"The plot, simply stated, was to make the alphabet disappear. Think about the lunatic audacity of this scheme. Letters are everywhere around us; but the geniuses of look-say wanted to create a landscape where the ABC's would hardly be present except as graphic elements inside Sight-Words. To the degree these so-called experts can pull off this nonsense, kids become illiterate and dyslexic. The plot continues today. Public schools are at this moment forcing millions of five- and six-year old children to memorize their Dolch Words.The remedy is to make sure that all three and four-year-olds learn the alphabet. Nothing is more important.Mary Johnson is famous for devising the simplest reading test of all. Children are asked to read these two sentences: \\"Mother will not like me to play games in my big red hat\\" and \\" Mike fed some nuts and figs to his tame rat.\\"Sight-word readers have no trouble with the first sentence; but they usually can't read the second sentence without mistakes because these words haven't been memorized; and the kids are unable to figure them out, despite the massive propaganda saying they can. Second-graders produce variations like this: \\"Mide fed some nits and fudge to him take right.\\"The most vivid memory I have of Mary Johnson's cleverness is when she went to city parks and recruited kids to read for her. She tape-recorded their reading and then had the recordings played on local radio stations. And parents everywhere were stunned (and so relieved) to find that their child was not the only illiterate in town, that schools were creating great numbers of kids who also stumbled, hesitated and guessed wildly.As much as I admire Rudolf Flesch and others, I have to say that Mary Johnson was perhaps more alone and needed greater courage and ingenuity for her fight against the huge army of quacks, hacks and flacks in control of public education. She was a Mama Grizzly before we heard the term."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"Nora Roberts Rocks! Lt. Eve Dallas makes the best protagonist and it's like a ongoing series so there is always a new story!"},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"First my knocks on this book. Why not bring in more killings from \\"the past\\" such as the Manson murders or John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, etc? It just seems you have so many murders and psychopaths to choose from, there was not really a need to \\"invent\\" one. Although, in fairness it speaks to JD ROBB/Nora Roberts' imagination when she was able to conjure such a believable villain.The opening chapter was absolutely brutal and violent but it was not grotesque. It was very smartly done. It grabs your attention and you are hooked. You either are determined to finish this book after chapter one or you will put it down and probably never pick it back up, but rabid fans know that Nora always delivers powerful blows like this.Typical to the \\"JD ROBB\\" style, Roberts pulls no punches, but attacks the violence with a malevolent class and style that only she can muster. Truly, this is one of the better stories of the series. I was impressed with Portrait... I was absolutely AMAZED by Purity... this one... I don't know. I'm at a loss for words. I can't wait to see what \\"DETECTIVE\\" Peabody will do in future books.I love the way we are really IN These characters lives. They eat, they drink, they party. They have sex, they bleed, they cry, they laugh, they plan for their future, they love and they lose. They live and (at times) they die. This story is true to reality. The characters FEEL real and by now they are a part of a reader's pseudo-family. A dysfunctional and outrageous family, but a family nonetheless.Reading each book is like a trip home... a family reunion.

And there is every indication that he does not intend to stop. Leaving taunting messages at the crime scenes, he baits Eve into a challenging game of cat and mouse. And once again, Lieutenant Eve Dallas finds herself on the trail of a psychopathic killer.In this installment we find Eve on the hot trail of a psychotic killer, and struggling to solve some difficult cases that have a lot of very powerful people as suspects. And on top of it all Eve is having to deal with a number of other issues, amongst them...Roarke's revolutions about his past (his new knowledge about his mother who was tragically killed) and an ex-girlfriend of Roarke's whose new boyfriend is a suspect. Peabody, Dallas' partner is studying for the Detective's exam, and feels more than a little scared about moving-in or cohabing with her lover, McNabb. And then there is a surviving victim who reminds Eve of herself...battered and left for dead, only to be a miracle and survive. And as we all know, Eve feels the pressure to solve every case and fast. She stands for the victims and the anxiety she has often makes her seem insensitive and angry. And finally, Eve is dealing with those neverending nightmares about her father and anxiety about Summerset's impending return any day from vacation. But no matter what the odds, Eve Dallas always gets her guy or girl.I really liked Imitation, and if you follow the series at all, you will enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"As the latest in the In Death series, J.D.

It's the classic mix she's been using all along, and one as a fan of the series, I'm glad she hasn't decided to mess with.If you're new to the series, stop and go back to the beginning - start with the first book Naked In Death. Trying to jump into the series this far into it, you may enjoy the book, but there's a whole host of character development and backstory that you'll miss out on, which will add to your full enjoyment of this book (and probably help explain a lot)."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I've read all the other books in the series and had been eagerly awaiting this one. While it provided a nice visit with some old friends, I'm having trouble believing it was written by the same person who wrote the other books in the series.

I particularly liked the way Eve connected with and empowered one of the victims.The depth of Robb's/Roberts' imagination amazes me. Even after having written so many books in this series, she still manages to develop the characters and make them compelling.It was interesting and fun to read about Eve and Roarke doing &quot;average&quot; things like visiting friends and attempting a barbecue. Those parts of the book helped to humanize those characters and to make the reader connect with them even more.Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I am a huge fan of the In Death series, but this one is a bit lackluster.

Peabody takes the detective exam so be sure and read the book and find out whats going to happen with that! This is a great book! Definately worth the reading time even if your don't regularly read J.D. Robb.The reader is presented with the normal cast of returning characters. What makes this book interesting to me beyond the great story is this is the second book since the author changed her tone of writing. It is my belief that the first 15 books with the much gritier and grimmer writing style gives the reader a glimps into the soul of Lt. Eve Dallas as it where. In latest 2 books the writing style as lighted considerably. Not to say Dallas is any less of a great cop or that her personality has been changed by the author. No its more as if some of the deep mental wounds have been healed to an extent that while Dallas is still a hardass she's enjoying living more.Another great Lt.

However I was intrested to see a little more in depth of Eve's past and Roarke's(and everybody else) reaction to Eve's uniform was a hoot.

I am somewhat disappointed. It's the same old, same old, with Eve and Roarke. She confides, he helps, they argue, they make love. Peabody and McNab are well under way, thank goodness. But, where are all the other wonderful, colorful characters I have come to know from all previous books? Don't misunderstand, I LOVE Eve and Roarke, but it is time for a new twist or two in their relationship.I will say that I am in awe of N.Roberts. The talent and scope of her ability to write such an unusual series is amazing."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I buy the J.D. Robb books like most people go to movies they really want to see-on the first day they're available. Then, I read it cover to cover-no matter how late, no matter what time I have to get up in the morning-I have to match wits with Eve Dallas, Roarke, and the crew to see if I can guess who the killer is. The one thing I LOVE about this series (and Nora Roberts in general) is that I'm always guessing until the last clue is in place. Not so with this particular installment of the 'In Death' series.I don't want to spoil it for those who read this book, but there's a VERY VERY big clue that reveals the killer's identity right off the bat, and it's so obvious you almost miss it. When I realized it, I was so upset, because that's the fun for me. This is the first book I've acutally been able to put down and leave for awhile-the first that didn't fully engage me to the point that everything else is a distraction. All of the qualities that makes these books so much fun are there-Roarke and Eve's love for one another, McNabb and Peabody getting more committed, Summerset (he's back!!!); and let's not forget the witty reparte' the characters have. The book got off to a very slow start for me, and I didn't enjoy this book as much as the rest. It's saying something that it took book 17 for me to get disheartened, so lets hope that \\"Remember When\\" and the next \\"In Death\\" novel makes up for this slight misstep in an otherwise great series."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"A man dressed in fancy clothes, including a hat and a cap, shows up in one of the shady neighborhoods in New York in the year 2059, approaches a licensed companion and takes her to an alley to do his business. But his business is not what she is used to dealing with, instead she gets killed quickly and efficiently, and after that the man goes to work on her, taking one of her organs as a souvenir. He leaves an envelope behind addressed to Lieutenant Eve Dallas in which he acknowledges her ability to solve murders and challenges her to go head on with him. The note is signed Jack...can you guess where this is going?When a second victim is found, together with another note for Eve, the killer shows his versatility by changing his modus operandi. Now he is not imitating Jack the Riper anymore, but the Boston Strangler. Dallas is now facing a clever criminal, and her list of suspects include powerful men that can destroy her career if she misses a step. Of course, those who have been reading this series know that this will not intimidate Eve, and as expected she moves forward full force with her case.In the personal arena, Eve is dealing with Peabody, her aide, who is preparing the detective's exam and with the nervous wreck she currently is due to the situation. Peabody is also looking for a place to move in together with her love, the computer whiz McNabb. On the home front, Eve pretends to be in paradise due to Summerset being away, but it is clear that she misses Roarke's butler and best friend. And her husband, Roarke, is going through a confusing time after having discovered the truth about his mother's death.Once again Robb does a very good job in merging together the mystery with the development of the personal stories of the main characters. After a book like \\"Portrait in Death\\" which had highly emotional moments it is hard to keep up the intensity, and this shows a little bit in the current novel. Nevertheless, the result is better than good and there is no reason to pass this one up."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"Not (in general) a romance novel fan, a mystery fan or a Nora Roberts fan, I was given this by a friend. The mystery was of minimal interest, but I gave it credit for being less dull than most.However, this book had the key to what I consider essential to all great books: good characters. As an abrasive woman myself, I was easily able to identify with Eve Dallas and found her husband (a wealthy mature version of my own husband) utterly loveable. I became quite consumed with these characters and, though I had not read the whole series, found myself desperately interested in their entire history.Since reading this, I have now read Naked in Death and Glory in Death and would heartily recommend that anyone interested in these characters read the series from the beginning. I am now determined to own them all.One last point; I read books to my husband and, although neither romances nor mysteries are on his list of preferred books, he is now as hooked on these as I am."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"2 scenes stand out: Roarke and the grill, and the ending. It's clear that JD Robb is really getting to know her characters, but it's unfortunate that the focus on all the relationships is harming the crimesolving portion of the story.

D. Robb, alter ego of bestselling author Nora Roberts. With the very first victim, Eve realizes that the killer stalking the streets of New York City isn't a run-of-the-mill serial murderer. The copycat executions are imitating the methods and victim choices of an ominous list of notorious serial killers, beginning with Jack the Ripper. And when the killer leaves a distinctive note at the crime scene, it's clear that he's targeting Eve personally--a fact that worries Roarke, Eve's shrewd husband.Assisted by her aide, Peabody, Eve compiles a list of suspects that includes several high-profile possibilities. Their very prominence, however, complicates the investigation, for they have the power and influence to make the search difficult. All of the suspects are reluctant to cooperate but one of them is playing with Eve like a cat with a mouse by tempting her with crime scene notes and challenging her to find him. Can Eve stop him before he slaughters again? Or will his next victim be Eve herself?The More I read this Series The MORE I like it I Am SO TOTALLY HOOKED!!

With the first murder, you see a little more of usual police procedure: Dallas working the case but not really getting anywhere, not enough information to solve anything yet. And is shows why she IS such a good cop: she keeps working it without reward, doesn't give up.I like all the interaction around Peabody gearing up for her detective's exam.And on the personal side, SPOILER ALERT: Dallas has a significant memory of her mother, which nets two realizations. First: the character's self discovery that she had an unconscious private fantasy that a loving mother might be out there somewhere - a situation probably exacerbated by Roarke's mother-revelation in the last book, Portrait in Death. Second: the reader realizing the probable reason for Dallas' rejection of all things traditionally feminine.Good read."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I really enjoyed this addition to the In Death series.Eve is on the trail of a serial killer who is imitating famous killers of the past.

Because Robb (aka the best-selling Nora Roberts) is best known for writing romance stories, many detective fiction fans have overlooked these books. They shouldn't.That said, &quot;Imitation in Death&quot; is missing one key feature in my opinion, and that's tension. As always, Robb/Roberts has painted the future with great skill, and it's rewarding to visit again the returning characters. But in the best of the series, for example &quot;Conspiracy in Death&quot; and &quot;Portrait in Death&quot;, there's conflict to be solved among the protagonists as well as conflict with the criminals.

But that's not what makes this series special, at least not from my point of view. It is watching the characters evolve and develop. Not only Eve and Roarke, and their relationship, but all the other 'side' characters that have been introduced in the previous books. In 'Imitation in Death', all the side characters are mentioned once, as if for form's sake. I would have preferred if J.D. Robb had concentrated more on one of them, but had told a real story about him or her. Also, Eve and Roarke carry on as usual, fighting, making up, but there is little character development. To sum it up, hardly anything happens in this book, exept for a murder mystery. That makes it a good book, but not an exceptional one. I hope this is not a sign that J.D.

On the toe of the victim is a letter addressed to Eve challenging her to try and catch him.The only clue he left behind is the stationary addressed to Eve that is illegal in this country since it is not recycled. Only a few outlets in Europe sells them and Eve is able to get the names of the people who bought it who are now living in New York. All the suspects are rich and powerful so Eve has to tread carefully even when the perpetrator strikes two more times mimicking The Boston Strangler and Ted Bundy. Eve is in a race against time before the suspect kills again but she needs one more piece of evidence before she can take him down.J.D. Robb has written another exciting futuristic romantic mystery that will have fans of many genres clamoring to read it.

I was disappointed in this book though because unlike in many of the others, I barely got to see any of the other people in Eve's life. Roarke was there but didn't have the presence he normally does and Mavis and Summerset, whom I both just love because of the reactions of Eve off of both, were almost completely lacking. They each only had one part in the book.I would recommend this book because you do learn a bit more about Eve as she begins to remember some more of her past and you get to see Peabody grow as she continues to study for her exam."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I loved this book.

The story line continues from the last book with the role of both Roark and Eve's mothers taking a central place in the drama. We see Peabody come of age and her role in Eve's life just gets closer and closer by the end.

It wasn't shorter than the others, but it just didn't feel like your typical Eve Dallas story.I felt like there was very little in depth character interaction. The premise was a good one, but I even thought the villian could have been more interesting, considering that premise.I'm still giving this a four, because I did enjoy reading it, but compared to the last book in the series, that I thought was among the best, if not The best, this one was a bit of a let down.

Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main cast members as they come into play and develop into first-rate characters.Thank you Ms. Robb!Shelley Dawn, author ofDark NightsandSweet, Sweet Jessie"},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"An LC (futurist term for prostitute) is murdered in the flamboyant style of Jack the Ripper, which is bad. But the unknown killer leaves a personal note for Lieutenant Eve Dallas, which is even worse. When the serial killer strikes again, it is not as Jack the Ripper, but as The Boston Strangler. Another note is left and Dallas and her associates race against time to figure out who is so meticulously copycatting the infamous serial killers of old. This is the first 'In Death' book I have read and it most certainly will not be the last. The mystery is good, with enough red herrings to keep the pages turning, but, sadly, the front cover offers more than a bit of a spoiler.

Other Death books are more exciting, but I look forward to seeing how all the characters keep growing in Ms. Roberts' books."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I rushed down to the store to get this yesterday, and unlike the last one [Portrait], which left me feeling a bit hurried and miffed, this one had a lot of the best things about this series. Eve Dallas has some very good moments in this book - the mystery makes sense (the murderer is actually one of the main suspects this time), still managing to keep the reader guessing. It plays out well, and the murders manage to impress upon the reader the appropriate sense of disgust intended.The main characters mostly have some good points in this book, although I was a bit weirded out by Roberts' description of Morris (he is suddenly described with the adjective 'exotic' on two consecutive pages). Peabody is taking the detective exam, McNab is being lovey-dovey with the aforementioned, and Roarke is getting through the loss discovered in Portrait. There's a lack of Feeney in this book, as well as Nadine, but it plays out better for it, especially since Portrait had characters experiencing Significant Moments of Life every five pages. Not that this book isn't lacking in the odd character moment here and there, but it works anyway. For Lt. Dallas herself, there is a big flashback - and a fascinating one, for it's about the person that her brandy-colored eyes are from - and no, it's not her dad.One of my favorite aspects of this series is the Eve-Roarke dynamic, and in this book, they're awfully cute in this book, and such fun to read. I don't mean gushy cute, thank goodness, but they're a highly amusing couple. A favorite moment of mine is Eve watching, with some baffled horror, as Roarke cooks, and I don't mean with an Auto-Chef. More than ever, I think this couple has really settled into a comfortable dynamic, the way that only they can do it.One of the reasons it's such fun to read this is because of how the characters have grown throughout the books. I feel that Roberts' other books often lost realism in the characters, with the books themselves too often ending with a tidily engaged couple and pregnant female. However, the In Death series gives her the chance to naturally grow these characters, and it's really evident in this book. Compare Imitation to Naked or Glory, and it's actually a little scary to see how these characters - especially Eve and Roarke - have changed, but they've done so together, and it's sweetly romantic.Last word: this isn't a book for new readers. It would be completely confusing, very bizarre, and without the enjoyment of seeing how these beloved characters continue to change. There is an unusually high amount of references to other J.D. Robbs here(there was even a reference to Interlude in Death), and although it's nice for the devoted reader, it can be nothing but bizarre to a newbie. In the end, this was a very entertaining book - I think one of the best in this series - and though there were no previews, I look very forward to buying Remember When in a few weeks and Divided in Death in the new year. :>"},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"Book #19 in the In Death Series.In this book Eve is trying to catch a killer who imitates histories most notorious serial killers.

And Eve tries for some normalcy when she goes to a family picnic at Mira's house.McNab shines as he helps Peabody study for her detective shield.

J.D. Robb, take a back seat, again as usual, to Roberts' ever-evolving characters. Like the tough, courageous, makeup-scorning New York-loving culturally deprived but brilliantly wise Eve, the reader has difficulty selecting a favorite from Roberts' list of \\"suspects\\": the stalwart, always-hungry Officer Delia Peabody, Eve's sidekick, fretting over the detectives' exam; Peabody's main squeeze, the ultimate computer geek Detective Ian McNab, whose relationship with Peabody Eve has at last (reluctantly) accepted; Charles Monroe, the smooth-talking but heart-of-gold LC (that's high-class legal prostitute) dating Eve's doctor friend after a tense love triangle with Peabody and McNab; Mavis Freestone, Eve's pregnant but untamed friend; Dr. Charlotte Mira, the razor-sharp-within-velvet-gloves New York police (NYPSD) psychologist who horrifies Eve by inviting her to a family barbecue; Eve's mother and father, who would make Susan Smith's blood run cold, glimpsed in Eve's nightmares; and Roarke, Eve's wealthy, romantic, utterly sexy (his attempt at a private barbecue is adorably botched) husband who, like her, emerged from a rough childhood as a productive if not always law-abiding citizen.Motherhood and family, including the extended family Eve has put together (her relationships with Peabody, Roarke and Mira in particular become richer), form the heart of this thriller, combined with the sharp police work, moral compass and hot loving sex readers have come to expect."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"We continue to be astounded at the publishing pace of Nora Roberts. Despite her \\"regular\\" books under her own name, these fun NYPD homicide Lt. Eve Dallas stories, written as \\"JD Robb\\", keep coming at the rate of one or two a year. \\"Imitation...\\", the 17th entry in the \\"... In Death\\" series, is not the emotional blockbuster of the just prior two (\\"Purity...\\" and \\"Portrait...\\"), but nonetheless entertains throughout this tough-minded police procedural. When a licensed companion (that's a \\"hooker\\" in year 2059 parlance) is found brutally murdered in the style of Jack the Ripper, followed in quick succession by the killing of a popular female apartment dweller, slain Boston Strangler style, it doesn't take the two notes recovered from the bodies, on unusual stationary, to clue any of us that a vicious copycat serial killer is on the loose. When it turns out the notes are addressed to Dallas personally, it's also clear that she herself is probably on the intended hit list, providing immense worry to her billionaire but loving husband Roarke. His role in this novel, as in many of the prior tales, is one of Eve's crime-solving sidekick, along with faithful aide Officer Delia Peabody. Fortunately, the notepaper provides a small roster of immediate suspects, but Robb cleverly keeps us guessing, 'til like ten pages before the end, which of the half dozen users of the stationary might be the real sicko. While a sub-plot of sorts involves Peabody's trials and tribulations getting ready for her detective's exam, the storyline is very much ala Ellery Queen in terms of clues, follow-up, and solid police work. Eve's intuition serves her well, but her assembling and processing of the clues is flawless as she gradually zeroes in, then sucks in, the bad guy.Eve's hardships as an abused young girl, and her husband's often \\"shady\\" background provide the usual backdrop to much of the motivation of the principals. Their marital relationship is always a subject of both display and discussion. Meanwhile, Peabody's moving in with McNab, another regular, provides a foil in \\"examining\\" the nature of adults living together. We're still big fans of the whole set, and at the point when many similar ongoing character series novels have long gone stale, find continued enjoyment in Dallas' pursuits. We think you will too!"},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"Eve Dallas, a police lieutenant, faces the most challenging case of her career, when she has to track down a serial killer that duplicates the brutal killing styles of notorious serial killers. A prostitute (LC is the term used in the book) is killed in the style of Jack the Ripper and the next victim meets their fate a la Boston Strangler style. With each murder, a personal note is left for Eve as the killer singles her out. Roarke, Eve's husband, is not the least bit amused with this last fact.Robb, a.k.a. Nora Roberts, offers a splendid blend of mystery, thriller action, internal friction amongst the principle characters and poignant intimacy spiced with a dash of sex to make this a very interesting read. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"Personal notes attached to the victims draw Eve Dallas into a case where she trails a murderer imitating historical serial killers. Peabody is worried about her detective's exam and moving in with McNab. Unfortunately, that pretty much sums up this book. The other 'In Death' murder mysteries were usually gripping and new readers could enjoy those stories, even if they were unfamiliar with the series' characters. I don't believe that is the case with this book. I found the murder mystery to be recycled and predictable and thought the story just dragged. All the regular chararacters were stagnant. Mavis, Nadine, Feeney, Morris, Trueheart and even Summerset were thrown into the story as afterthoughts. Some of the scenes with Eve and Roarke were cute but there was no additional evolution of their relationship.I have followed the 'In Death' series from the first book, but this is my least favorite. Like the other fans of the series, I'm hooked and will buy the future 'In Death' novels as soon as they come out, but I definitely do not recommend this book for a new reader. If this was a reader's first book in the series, they would never pick up another and that would be a shame because most are really good stories."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I have read every &quot;In Death&quot; book in the entire series, and each time I finish an entry like &quot;Imitation in Death,&quot; I am chafing at the bit for the next one.&quot;Imitation in Death&quot; is one of the better books in the series, because it so adeptly weaves together the ongoing stories of the main characters with the very well-drawn plot at hand: A serial killer is showing off for Eve, modeling each of his horrendous murders after a &quot;classic&quot; killer, from Jack the Ripper to the Boston Strangler to a fictional perpetrator who supposedly plied his trade in the 2020s.Now, in the 2050s, Eve must stop him before he runs completely amok--and her main suspects include some very famous people. Meanwhile, down on the home front, Eve and Roarke's relationship is better than ever (this is one of the main draws of the series, to my mind) as Eve savors the last days without her hated adversary Summerset, the major domo (butler!) of Roarke's estate, who was sent on vacation in the last book.Peabody and McNab have made a &quot;mag&quot; and major decision, which has Peabody in a tizzy as she studies for her detective's exam. Will she make it? And Mavis and Leonardo are busy garbing Mavis in outrageous maternity clothes that only she could wear--and only he could design.Absolutely a winner.

PLEASE!"},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I greatly enjoyed &quot;Imitation in Death.&quot; The mystery was solid, as was the background on Lt. Eve Dallas' police work and the growth of her character.The main drawback of this installment of the series is the lack of interaction with the secondary characters. Even Roarke seemed a little cookie cutter this go-round. However, having said that, I believe there is a legitimate reason for it that goes deeper than lack of inspiration.Essentially, the character of Eve was feeling cut off from her loved ones in this story. She was dealing with inner demons quite a bit -- not as dramatically as in some previous books, but nonetheless she was definitely withdrawn to some degree while she dealt with new information about her past. Also, several of the secondary characters, such as Peabody, were dealing with life changes and were not their &quot;usual selves.&quot;I think that the story functioned as a mirror of Eve's own innerlooking attitude, life changes of several characters, and finally and perhaps most importantly as a bridge to the next phase of the series. I won't say what that phase is -- you will know as soon as you finish the book -- because I don't want to spoil the story.But believe me, while the story itself may not satisfy the reader as much as Roberts' earlier installments, I think that it serves its purpose perfectly and sets up a lot of new things that will keep the series as a whole fresh for years to come."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"This series never disappoints, as long as you're looking for escapist detective fiction.The storyline gallops along, and as usual, the identity of the villain is not obvious. With the exception of Summerset, who is on vacation for most of the story, the main characters are all present and consistently entertaining and interesting. Peabody is getting ready for her detective's exam and Eve is beginning to have dreams about her mother.Of course there is also the usual mix of humor, murder and mystery. A killer is emulating famous serial killers, and Eve finds that her suspects all have something to hide.Note that although J.D. Robb is the nom de plume of a successful romance writer, this is no Barbara Cartland."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"There is some excellent plot and character in this latest Robb book. First off, if you've never read any of the J.D. Robb series, you're missing out, and shouldn't start here, but with 'Naked in Death' the first in the series.Eve Dallas is a tough detective in an even tougher future New York. In 'Imitation in Death,' the latest serial killer is imitating the serial killers of history, and has left notes for Dallas - all but taunting her inability to make it stop. While Dallas does her usual hard-ass investigation, the list of suspects quickly fills itself - with important and influential individuals. She certainly can't afford to mess this one up.With help from her sexy-to-the-\\"ult\\" husband Roarke (no other name) and her relationship-jittery aide Delia Peabody, Eve tries to hunt down the baddie with her usual zest and sarcasm. Her bafflement with all things feminine and family continues, and the sub-plot of Eve's slowly uncovering amnesia/repression about her family gets a little further in this book - with some startling results.Even better, the secondary characters we all know and love - Peabody especially, taking her Detective's test - all get a bit of book-time in 'Imitation in Death.' They grow, change, and interact with the sassy style you're used to from Robb, and with awesome results.You'll find it ult. Icy, even. But definitely murder.'Nathan"},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"For me, probably the least involving of the entire series. Robb goes through the motions of making this a mystery, but with a glaring clue upfront that narrows the list down to 5 suspects immediately, even the fact that all of the suspects are very high-profile works against sustaining interest and involvement as she checks out their lives and alibis. We know that if Eve Dallas really wants to cut through the chase and follow up on similar crimes in other locales, she can get her computer super guru husband to check out all possible travel links for her suspects surreptitiously to eliminate the red herrings and then use \\"logic\\" to follow up on the murderer thus revealed.Side plots involving the usual cast of characters go from cardboard to elements we're apt to see developed more fully in coming books. One cute bit of \\"business\\" has Roarke trying and failing as a backyard chef on his new grille, but even there we know that by the next book he will be a \\"grillemaster\\".These books need to devolve a bit from time to time. After several very high profile cases, Robb needs to figure out something more low-key, but interesting to do with Eve and Roarke."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"I know the title for the review sounds kind of lame, but I'll explain.

The characters are great, and if you've read this far in the series (the books should be read in order) you're either hooked or masochistic. I can't decide what that says about me. Being a mystery buff, I'm dismayed at the lack of actual \\"mystery\\" in these books. Usually, the title gives you the 'whodunit'; maybe Ms. Robb doesn't want to cause her readers any anxiety by making them wait for Dallas to solve the crime. In the case of this book, the answer wasn't in the title, but rather in something equally as obvious. But I'm still reading them because I love the characters and their interaction. No one plays a minor role in these stories, which is in itself an accomplishment. Yep, definitely my guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"A real page turner.

This had more humor and more disturbing murders than any of the others."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"Having read nearly every In Death book, I'd have to say this one was the worst. I doubt I would ever try to read it, again.The villain on the piece is copying the murders of classic serial killers. Well, actually only two readers would know. While an interesting concept, I don't think he plot ever lives up to the potential. Yet another killer enthralled by the great Eve Dallas, that he even leaves a note for her at the scene of his murders. In quite a few of the books, the killer becomes obsessed with Eve and getting her attention and just how great would Eve be without Roarke, McNab or Feeney helping her out to get information. Hate to say it, but I think Ms. Roberts is a little too in love with this character, that she's even got the criminals singing her praises and genuflecting to her.The book isn't helped with the carting out of the failed Mira/Eve faux mother-daughter relationship. It hasn't worked from the first book, and the more Ms. Roberts keeps trying to sell it, the less it works. So sick of this Mira/Eve thing, I've taken to skimming over any scenes involving Dr. Mira, who is the worst character in the series, and who I wish would get cut from it.The two best scenes involved Roarke/Eve. The funniest was him trying to barbacue and the most interesting was when he learned Eve had been keeping from him the fact she recalled something new from her past. Otherwise, the book was pretty blah, over all.Since there really wasn't much movement in the characters, aside from Peabody making detective, you may want to skip this one and read Divided in Death. Perhaps the best book in this series."},{"Title":"Imitation in Death (In Death #17)","review":"how could anyone give this book anything but 5 stars? It was wonderful.

This book focuses on traditional cooking in Spanish bars, restaurants and homes. An introduction and a useful index bookend four sections on tapas, costal cooking, inland cooking, and sweets. Although the book is credited to one author, John Newton, the style is informative but detached and impersonal; I thought it was written by committee at first. Although half of these 191 pages are taken up by images, the few pages that introduce each section or focus on an ingredient are interesting and prove the author's knowledge of the country and it's traditional food. I've found the seafood and tapas sections to be quite good; the Spanish \\"tortilla\\" recipe is more complete and precise than the ones I have learned from native cooks.Recipes are either presented in two-page spreads with a full-color image on one page. The photography, unfortunately, succumbs to the silly out-of-focus style so popular with this sort of cookbook, but most dishes are shown finished on the plate or in a serving dish. On the other page, the title and a short introductory paragraph are followed by a list of ingredients on the left and several paragraphs of instructions of the right. At the bottom of the page you may find helpful photos of steps in the preparation, but sometimes just a pretty picture of an ingredient. If only the publisher had chosen a more legible font! The pretty, modern sans-serif letters are printed with a very thin line, which makes the 10 point font a bit hard on the eyes; even the large titles fail to jump out from the page.Several pages in each section highlight a specific ingredient or technique; Jerez sherry or allioli dressing or rice or jamon, with a photo of the ingredient in the background of one or both pages (again, pretty but less legible than it should be). These pages, along the introductions to each section, are interesting if you like to read cookbooks with a view to the culture or cuisine as a whole, as I do, but they are not as extensive or personal as what you will find in a thicker book.Mr. Newton manages to fit just over a hundred recipes into 191 pages by including three on a page, several times in each section. The title (\\"three ways with garlic\\" or \\"three ways with fish sauces) is followed by a paragraph on the use of an ingredient or technique, and then three recipes, each in a single paragraph, set apart by titles. The facing page shows one or two of those finished recipes. I find these dense paragraphs a little hard to follow, and it is hard to tell what you the final dish will become without reading it all the way through, but the recipes seem to be complete. About 45 of the recipes are found on these pages; they tend to be simpler than those given the full-page treatment.If you prefer beautiful cookbooks and want an introduction to traditional Spanish cooking, this book would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Ohio Salt","review":"This is a must-read if you like mysteries!

From our position in the galay, the sun's size and age and our distance from it, the fact that Jupiter and Saturn exist and the role they play in protecting life on earth from bombardment from asteroids and comets, and the structure of the earth itself including the miracle of tectonics.All of these are REQUIRED for our world to exist as we know it. Without all these things life would have been &quot;re-started&quot; over and over and over again. You owe it to yourself to read this book.Whether you end up agreeing with their contention or not, the points they raise in this wonderful book are certainly worth thinking about, debating, and learning from. Thanks to Ward and Brownlee."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I believe that paleobiologist Peter D. Ward and his colleague at the University of Washington, astronomer Donald Brownlee, have done a fine service to both the scientific community and those in the general public who are interested and knowledgeable in the sciences by presenting their arguments in this book \\"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe\\". At best they offer a persuasive scenario which should be construed primarily as an elegant null hypothesis in the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life, by noting the diversity of single-cell organisms and their existence across a wide array of environments, including a few that would seem completely inhospitable to life. And they make a compelling case for the difficulty of metazoan (multicellular animal) life to evolve here on Earth, noting as a classic example, the sudden rise and fall of both the Ediacaran fauna and the subsequent Burgess Shale fauna in the latest Precambrian to Middle Cambrian intervals of Earth's geological history. However, after carefully reading this book, I am more inclined to agree with an unnamed recent Amazon.com reviewer who is a professional astronomer that this book is merely an intriguing example of scientific speculation not fully buttressed by supporting scientific data. The mere absence of something, or rather, the likely uniqueness of a phenomena (e. g. plate tectonics on Earth) does not mean that it does not exist elsewhere in the Milky Way Galaxy. Our current state of knowledge of extrasolar planets is truly akin to a single individual looking out upon the Atlantic Ocean from some wind-swept New England cove, trying to comprehend its immense size merely through his or her eyes. So I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing and then reading this book to bear in mind that at best it may be an elegant example of decent scientific speculation; at worst, it may be a bad example of such speculation run amok."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a great, thought provoking book.

The problem is that even the authors are reluctant to assume that. The idea that our planet is the only one capable of harbor complex life in our galaxy (maybe in the Universe), certainly annoy many people."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"First of all, astrobiology, which is what this book is about, is a speculative field. One cannot expect anyone to be much smarter than others. As of today, there is no reliable evidence supporting the existence of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations.The so-called Drake equation, proposed in the 1960s to \\"calculate\\" the number of extraterrestrial TV programs that we will be able to watch in the next centuries as a product of roughly ten comparably unknown quantities, became a symbol of a superficially quantitative approach to a question that is untestable and that reflects our faith. A method to write down an equation to pretend that the discussion is serious, without answering any question by the equation. Well, in one of his famous speeches, Michael Crichton has even blamed the Drake equation for the appearance of unprovable catastrophic scenarios such as those found in nuclear winter and global warming hypotheses.How difficult is it for life to evolve? The authors claim that it is quite easy for primitive life to occur. Primitive life has been observed in extreme circumstances of many types. A scientific approach to the origins of life more or less dictates that the organic molecules can be formed rather generically and the constraints on the temperature and concentration of various elements etc. cannot be too strict. More importantly, we have a pretty convincing observational evidence that the early life should not be so difficult to create: the primitive life on this planet clearly started a relatively short time after the planet was created.However, the authors say that it is very unlikely for animal life to evolve because the animals require a much more friendly environment. You could say that even the animal life appeared shortly after the birth of the Earth which seems to imply that it should evolve quickly (and therefore likely?), too. And you would be almost right. If it starts to occur, it occurs fast. But the point of the authors is not that the evolution of the animal life is very slow: their point is that it may be fast, but if the conditions on the planet are not \\"quite right\\", it won't happen at all (at least this is the expectation).They enumerate many features of our particular Solar system and our planet - including the composition and brightness of the Sun; its location within our Galaxy; the existence of the Moon that stabilizes the precession of the Earth; various hypothetical collisions in the past that initiated plate tectonics; other requirements for animals to live. It is not rigorously known, of course, how serious these constraints are and whether a slightly different kind of higher life could evolve if some of these conditions were not satisfied. More recently, some exoplanets that would satisfy some of the \\"non-trivial\\" criteria have been found.However, the authors definitely prove that there exist very reasonable assumptions that may lead to the conclusion that we are probably the unique advanced civilization in our Galaxy if not the whole visible Universe.You know, these questions are politicized a bit. According to creationists, the life is so precious and overly refined that it could not have appeared spontaneously. Those who want to isolate themselves from the creationists often like to say - and even think - that it must be trivial to create life, and therefore we should be surrounded by aliens. (Fermi asked: Where are they?) That's the opposite extreme which is what others like.Neither party is supported by observations. It is clearly not hard to create primitive life - but on the other hand, it is not terribly easy to create intelligent, advanced life because otherwise we would have already met the extraterrestrials. The number of civilizations like ours in the Universe may be comparable to one - and it may be exactly one just because we were a bit (or very) lucky. And the \\"coincidences\\" required for life to be created could have been barely enough to produce one Earth that allowed life like ours.All these possibilities are open and no solid data are available, which is the main reason I gave the book 4 stars only. But nevertheless, I recommend you this book to see that the guess that \\"we're alone after all\\" is definitely not silly."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This appears to be a well-researched and very interesting theory. I would have given it five stars, but didn't for two reasons. The first is that I would have liked to hear about possible candidates for complex life that don't necessarily rely on water, carbon and/or oxygen. Methane-breathing, silicon-based life that drink ammonia? haha. Who knows, I'm not a Chemist or Biologist. Perhaps no credible theories for life based on alternative components exist, but the authors should have made that clear if that is the current consensus. To be fair to the authors, they did make it clear at the beginning that they were using the only proven forms of life known to exist, i.e. life found on Earth, as a benchmark. The second reason is due to several erroneous, but minor, &quot;facts&quot; included in the text, which could have been caught by more careful editing. Some of which have already been pointed out by other reviewers, so I won't list them here. None of the errors that I noticed deter from the overall gist of the theory.Be that as it may, the real reason I am writing this review is to rebut several reviews I saw from people trying to characterize this book as a foundation for the Creationist view of how life originated. That notion is patently absurd. If the Rare Earth Theory is correct, the fact that there are so many (trillions) of stars in the universe makes it highly probable that at least one (ours) has managed to assemble itself, by simple chance alone, into a system conducive to habitation by complex life forms (plants and animals). I submit that the only way the Creationist view could have any hope of being true is that if the various components of the Rare Earth Theory are proven to be correct; and yet we find that complex life is present in a high percentage of star systems. That would imply that some outside force was helping things along and facilitating the eventual rise of complex life in spite of the many obstacles outlined in the Rare Earth Theory. But I think that is less likely to happen than the percentage of duplicate Earths in the universe. haha.For more convincing evidence that Creationism is highly unlikely, I dare you to read: &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; by Richard Dawkins; &quot;Darwin's Dangerous Idea&quot; by Daniel Dennett; and &quot;How the Mind Works&quot; by Steven Pinker.I will agree with one point of one of the Creationist reviewers. This theory should be taught in schools, but not presented as proven, and not as a foundation for Creationism. Rather, it should be tied in with the notion, as pointed out by the authors, that if habitable planets and complex life truly are rare, it's all the more reason we should take good care of the Earth. It may be the only planet we ever find on which we can survive as a species (at least until another mass extinction event occurs)."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This book contains a wealth of interesting information and I recommend it as a source to anyone interested in the subject. Unfortunately though, as several recent books, it seems to assume an attention span of about 15 minutes of its average reader, annoying me to the point of nearly throwing it away by repeating the same statements every few pages. A serious editor could have cut it down quite a bit without loss of information and even increased readability. The rating is an average of very good marks for contents and very bad marks for the presentation."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a fascinating book. The authors address a fundamental question, \\"Are we alone in the universe?\\" They focus on various stages that other planets would have to go through to be like our Earth. They explain why each stage is very unlikely, and that this means our Earth is a very, very special place.The Drake Equations, developed by Frank Drake, were an attempt to make an intelligent guess on the number of space going civilizations in our galaxy, and the whole universe. There were several factors, each having to do with a stage along the path to a space going civilization. Some scientists came up with a number like a couple million space going civilizations in our galaxy. The authors of \\"Rare Earth\\" believe that this is way too high. They break down the various factors of the Drake Equations and explain why it is unlikely to get through that stage successfully.The authors make a large number of interesting observations. For example one of the things I found fascinating was in the last 500 million years there have been 15 mass extinctions of life on Earth. Another was just how important Jupiter being in a stable orbit has been in cleaning out random junk, thus reducing the amount of junk that could hit the Earth. Jupiter has probably cleared out 99.99% of the junk floating around our sun.For me the most interesting thing was what the moon was doing to the Earth billions of years ago. Current models show some body of matter coming close to the Earth, losing its iron core to the Earth, and then some of the left over matter forming into the moon. It appears the moon originally may have been 15 times closer than it is now, so the gravity from the moon would have been 225 times greater. It appears this generated land tides in which the land on the Earth might be going up and down by hundreds of feet every couple hours, with the \\"waves\\" going thousands of miles per hour.The book is full of many such interesting things. It is well written and I had a hard time putting it down. The authors comment on a large variety of topics relating to how unique our Earth may be. If you have any interest in this topic, this is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Some reviewers have given excellent summaries of the book so I shall not repeat the facts. I just wanted to reinforce the other 5 star reviews and say that I took this book on vacation with me this summer and I could hardly wait until the end of each day so I could get back to reading it. I found it so interesting that I couldn't put it down. It presents a unique blend of many different branches of science including paleontology, biology, astronomy and geology. I had some relatively minor quibbles with the writing style in that it wasn't written with \\"one voice\\" and you could sometimes tell which author was responsible for particular sections. Also, sometimes they tried to be metaphorical with the way they phrased their ideas and that didn't work for me. The book does need some rewriting because there are some errors, but none of them are serious enough to mislead the reader. Once or twice a figure was provided that wasn't adequately explained. For instance, Figure 9-1 used the terms \\"lithosphere\\" and \\"asthenosphere\\" without defining what they mean. Readers might not be in a position to use other resources to supplement the reading of the book, so the book should be as self-contained as possible.

Of course, like others have said, there is alot we still don't know about many factors effecting the chance of life existing elsewhere - so when the Rare Earth HYPOTHESIS is presented, you must remember that this is just a suggested scenario from the authors - it is not scientifically proven fact.You may have read reviews from some people talking about a \\"hidden agenda\\" of the Rare Earth authors, and their coworker having certain intelligent design or creationist beliefs. This is explained in the book \\"Life Everywhere\\" by David Darling. I STRONLY suggest reading that book AFTER reading Rare Earth, however - this \\"revelation\\" does not take away at all from the quality of Rare Earth. The two books merely offer opposing perspectives - one thinking advanced life may be quite rare, the other thinking it may not be as rare. As far as we know, neither is right or wrong, and I think they both offer important views on the subject.Some people have said \\"This is speculation not science\\". Well that is partially true - but science starts with speculation doesn't it? One could say that science is speculation. And we just don't know everything about how life starts - it's a very complicated subject! This book at least attempts to explain what we DO know, and what possibly could be factors in the origin and evolution of life elsewhere.Overall, I'd definately recommend this book, NOT because of the hypothesis presented, but because it clearly discusses most of the factors effecting the possibility of life existing/evolving elsewhere."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The fascinating quest for other worlds that might support life has for far too long been pre-empted by astronomers. But rather than practicing astronomy, what these idealists are really searching for is an extraterrestrial with whom they can converse. In a feat of l&eacute;ger demain they all seque effortlesly from planets with water to planets with creatures who talk. Their search for non-human sentient beings is always based on simple assumptions about orbital mechanics. Is a planet at such a distance from its stable parent sun that liquid water can exist over millions of years? If yes, then advanced life forms will likely have arisen and---if Darwin is to be believed---sentient beings with radio transmissions. Hopeful astronomers have even created a highly optimistic calculation--the Drake equation--to predict the number of sentient beings in the universe. According to the late Carl Sagan, that number is in the millions.But life, and especially complex sentient life, is not the purview of these celestial mechanics. Rather the question of life must be answered by biologists or, in the case of non-terrestrial life, astro- or exo-biologists. These scientists tell a much less optimistic story.These biologists feel the advent of complex life on Earth (simple microbial life can likely be found throughout the universe) was due to an incredible series of fortuitous accidents--accidents so unusual that if all life on Earth were to disappear today, it is unlikely that humans could ever evolve again on our present planet.One such accident for example, is the creation/capture of the moon by Earth--an event occasioned by an Earth-size planet striking us a glancing blow and dislodging the mass that would eventually coalesce into the moon. Our moon is large fraction of the Earth's size compared to the relative moon size of other planets. Ten times nearer to Earth, it exerted a powerful influence on tides. Enormous waves washed inland for miles twice a day. This enormous tidal flow caused salt water to dissolve inland minerals and combine them in unique ways by the filtration of hundred-mile run-offs. Unusual combinations of salts, the anaerobic atmosphere, lightning and other natural phenomenon and the mixing and filtering of ubiquitous microbes eventually created (we still don't know how) larger self-replicating life forms.The exobiological side of the story is seldom heard in the public realm because it is so deeply pessimistic over the likelihood of intelligent life arising at all--thus dashing the fervent hope of millions of scientists and fellow travelers searching for signs of intelligence with their planet-wide SETI endeavor.This book provides an excellent exegesis of the exobiological side of the SETI story--and a useful antidote. Another excellent discussion along these lines--this time whether there was ever life on Mars--may be found in \\"White Mars: The story of the Red Planet Without Water,\\" by Nick Hoffman, 2000.It's a bummer, I know, to learn from these real experts on life, that we sentient creatures may be alone in our galaxy. All those hopeful hours spent watching Star Trek down the tubes!

The authors conclude that various traits of our planet, Solar System, and position in the Galaxy, are uncommonly fortunate for the development of complex life forms. While the authors believe that there are no doubt other planets somewhere where this fortunate confluence has also occurred, they conclude that multi-cellular life is rare in the universe, and that for all intents and purposes mankind may be essentially alone and nearly unique.The authors make a case. They show that our Solar System is particularly well-positioned in its orbit within the Galaxy for life, as our star is largely on the outer periphery of the Galaxy where it is spared the lethal effects of novas and other cosmic catastrophes that are more common nearer the core of the Galaxy. Further, the authors note that our own Solar System is uncommon in that the gas giant planets are confined to the outer reaches of the System, where they do not interfere much with the orbits of the inner planets, i.e. Earth, and in fact act as meteor shields, reducing the number of catastrophic meteor strikes which can, and have, caused most complex species to become extinct.The authors also note that even throughout most of Earth's history life was single-celled and species were few, until the Cambrian Explosion of speciation. This event, in order to take place, required numerous fortunate circumstances all to occur, and the authors make a case that such a fortunate confluence of conditions cannot be common in the universe. They may be right.Or they may not. The problem, of course, is that we are really dealing with a sample of one -- at this juncture we have discovered life nowhere but on our own planet, and our ability to explore the conditions that exist on planets outside our own Solar System (or even inside it) is greatly limited. What makes this book worth reading is the importance of its topic, for surely there can be no more profound question than \\"Are We Alone?...\\"Some of the science in this book becomes a little hard to follow for non-scientists, but mostly the authors present their case with clarity, and certainly even the layman can follow the main threads of the authors' arguments throughout the piece. This is a fascinating and important work that should appeal to many."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"For a layman's book this is fairly dense which is a good thing. I agree mostly with the arguments presented but the jury's still out on tidally locked planets located in the habitable zones of their stars. The authors' contend that the tidal locking excludes any evolution of complex metazoans but the Gliese 581 system may present more definitive answers in the coming decades. To me that's the most dynamic issue raised by this book and I'm very excited about the outcome. For instance: Can any of these planets hold an atmosphere? Do any of them have liquid water and if any how much? From my own research 581C may be more like Venus than Earth but 581D which is on the outer periphery may host microbial life and in time as the planet warms, more complex life. It could be another earth in the making but most likely not. I find myself picking this book up quite often. It's well written and well argued mostly from the viewpoint of what can be extrapolated from life's early complex evolution on planet earth. So many issues to consider but it really does not look like complex plants and animals are easy or fast to achieve even on earthlike planets which may be interspersed at an average of 5000 light year increments in a 15,000 light year habitable zone which would not include the center or edge areas of the galaxy. There really isn't enough data yet but that is the suspician of the authors'. That should be a sobering thought."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"As an astronomer working in a related field, I find this book to be extremely disappointing. While it contains much interesting science that is generally well presented, virually all of their main points rely very significantly on speculation well beyond what is well established science. Mankind's knowledge of processes such as the formation of Earth-like planets and especially the evolution of complex life forms is so poor that we can only observe what happened in our own system. Ward and Brownlee jump to the conclusion that complex life could only form in systems with histories very like out own, but in fact, they (as well as other scientists) really don't have any idea what is required for complex life to develop. Perhaps it would not sell so many books, but I would certainly rate the book more highly if the authors could be more honest about this."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The only reason I give this book a 3-star rating is that it is already becoming dated by the blinding speed at which exoplanetary science is developing. When this book was written (remember that books typically take at least a year to see the light of day from the time they're written), the science that was discovering exoplanets (planets outside our own solar system) was fairly recent and the number of planets discovered was very low, and they were all &quot;super-Jupiters&quot;.However, the methods used have improved greatly and the number of known exoplanets is now over 100. More recent discoveries of terrestrial plannets in addition to gas giants makes it increasingly likely that planetary systems are the rule, not the exception.The other criteria the authors state as necessary: large moon, Jupiter-type planet, etc., are also turning out to be common. This is not to slight their work; given the available information at the time they wrote the book, it was solid research. However, just as early mariners had to continuously redraw their maps as the world's oceans were explored, so will our self-important ideas uniquemess have to be abandoned.Simply put, the numbers are mounting to a simple but profound conclusion: It is very likely that we are not alone, which is no surprise given that there are 200 billion stars in our galaxy alone and there are over 400 quadrillon known galaxies, each with hundreds of millions of stars.

But I have found that as science advances and new discoveries are made, the theories on the origin of life on Earth and in the Universe as a whole more and more agree with what can be found in the Bible. Scientists tend to not regard the Bible as relevant, or belief in God as important, but most of them appear to be awestruck by things like the rarity of life, and the apparently careful designs that are found in Nature. Carl Sagan always remarked on the beauty and awesomeness of the Universe, but went to his grave unmoved by the claims of Scripture, and at times openly hostile to any form of religion. What a shame!

It is somewhat on the \\"lite\\" side of science--there are some sweeping generalizations that deserve more nuance (e.g., an asteriod wiped out the dinosaurs) but on the whole it's a remarkable achievement. The authors' conclusion that although microbial life is likely very common in the universe, complex animal life is probably very rare is well documented and I have no disagreement with it.On page 282 of my edition (paperback, 2004) the authors say: \\"The greatest danger to our thesis . . . is that it is a product of our lack of imagination.\\" I think so. Of course Earth is just right for us--we evolved here. Four billion years of natural selection on Earth has produced us. It is not at all surprising that the Earth is just right for us. Rather, we are just right for Earth.The universe is so vast--hell, the galaxy is so vast, that I really don't think our puny imaginations are capable of surmising what complex life on other planets could be like. We are only now coming to grips with how limited our senses are. We know that the visible light spectrum is a small segment of possible wave lengths, and that our hearing encompasses a limited frequency. We know that dogs' sense of smell is orders of magnitude more sensitive than ours but I don't think we can really imagine what it would be like to have such an ability. And we are just learning that our day-to-day reality is very, very different from that of elementary particles. In the past century we have accomplished much in terms of coming to know what we don't know, and we know that there is still more out there that we don't know.I suppose that if complex life from elsewhere in the galaxy is so different from us that we can't communicate with it (say, it exists in another dimension) then as far as we are concerned it really doesn't exist. But the authors seem to have a Star-Trek notion of what other intelligent life would be like: just like us, even to the extent that they all speak English, but some have pretty severe complexion problems.But to say that unless the Klingon Home World is earth-like in every respect, there are no Klingons--is silly, especially if you are only looking for Klingons."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"These authors have struck on a perfect book idea -- based on no data whatsoever from Earth's (non-existent) interstellar expeditions, they've concluded that complex life resulted quite by accident from a large set of circumstances unique to Earth. This assumes that the Earth has had basically the same conditions, free of catastrophes, and that assumption is laughable at this point.I noticed that even in the multi-starred reviews scientific errors are cited. Considering that the authors' conclusions miraculously match their original assumptions, I'm not too surprised to read that, although the high ratings on this title do surprise.Fossil evidence shows that the Moon couldn't possibly have arisen from an impact on the proto-Earth. Nautilus shells today show about 30 daily growth lines per \\"month\\". 420 million years ago they had a mere nine days. The Moon's orbital period was nine days, its distance was less than half its present value, and Earth's rate of rotation was faster. [Larry Gedney, \\"When the Days Were Shorter\\", Alaska Science Forum]Since most of the distance between Earth and Moon has accumulated in the past 420 million years, it's impossible that the Moon was born of impact four billion years ago. That's the hard evidence. The alternatives include that the Earth has had a series of moons and lost the others (Hoerbiger), or that the current Moon is the only one Earth has had, but has lost it and recaptured it at least once, or that the Earth was formerly in proximity to a different larger body (i.e., not a satellite of the Sun).The simplest model is that the Moon must have been captured sometime during or shortly before the most recent 420 million year interval -- less than ten per cent of the age of the Earth. Microbial life on Earth is believed to be attested in microfossils at least 3 billion years old. Therefore, the Moon is irrelevant to the origin of life on Earth -- unless one wishes to assume repeated captures and losses of the Moon.Ward and Brownlee think that the Moon has always been around and has been one of the indispensible factors in the rise and evolution of life. It's hogwash. Even without the Moon, the Sun produces one third of the tides -- the tides being W&B;'s most important consequence of the existence of the Moon.Since a satellite in prograde orbit and rotation will enjoy a momentum transfer from the parent body, the Earth must have formed closer to the Sun, meaning that the tides (provided there were seas) from the Sun alone were larger four and a half billion years ago.The book is an elaborate apologia for Darwin. The gradualist drivel -- tides, glaciation, continental drift (oops, \\"plate tectonics\\"), axis wobble, etc -- are there as props, but are likewise there to be propped.While not a creationist or young-Earther myself, the hostility toward some of the better reviews which expressed such a view is pretty much what I'd expect. The similar high ratings for the title by reviewers of both stripes may betray the same level of credulity that could buy into this book's claims. Some creationists reject life on other worlds because the Bible sez humans were created by God. The secular fans of this title reject life on other worlds because that could open the door to UFOs, transluminal space flight, ETs, and other things that they claim to know are impossible.While this book may prop up a few different believers, it isn't scientific. Lovers of science fiction may enjoy it. Those interested in the sociology of belief may find it, uh, indispensible.No paperback version has come out (as of early January 2003). I'll also be surprised to see subsequent titles by these authors. Instead of this, read this one in its new edition:The Deep, Hot Biosphereby Thomas Goldforeword by Freeman Dyson[0387952535]Also, do a websearch for Louis Frank (comets).[revised my original review from late August 2001]"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The body of evidence drawn upon by this book is well known by now and was no surprise to me. What is a surprise to me is how these two writers could come up with such dramatic claims based on this evidence.Folks, the fact is that we have barely even begun to explore the habitablility of our Universe beyond planet Earth. Don't be mislead into thinking the task is finished. Despite much self-lauding on how much we've discovered, we've only been at it for 50 years! We know very little even of the other planets in our own solar system, and we are NOT sure that none of them harbor complex life.Outside our own Solar System our knowledge is even less complete. The best we can do at this point is look for fluffy, hot giant planets. While the technology to detect Earths around other stars is certainly coming along, it is not here yet. Ergo, we know nothing about the frequency of Earths orbiting other stars, let alone whether they are habitable.We are very special here--anyone who has walked in the rain, sung a song or been in love will agree. But whether we are ALONE is a whole other matter, one that neither Ward nor Brownlee is prepared to answer given the current body of knowledge.

They believe that our earth is a very special case, because (1) there is more life diversity than on others planets, caused by sudden massive life extinction through meteor impact and by global climate change provoked by plate tectonics; and (2) earth is surrounded by 2 special planets: the moon and Jupiter. The moon causes lunar tides, stabilizes the tilt of Earth's spin axis, and it slows the Earth's rate of rotation. Jupiter was important in the formation of the earth.Their crucial argument is the importance of plate tectonics. They develop their argumentation very well: plate tectonics promotes biological productivity, diversity and helps maintain equable temperatures on earth. But how do they know that it is extremely rare in a cosmos of billions of billions of stars? This argument cannot be tested. So we and they don't know. Their case is built on ignorance.Nevertheless, I recommend this book for its challenging proposition, although the text could be more condensed."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The &quot;Rare Earth&quot; hypothesis is a counter proposal to today's common belief that we are not alone in the universe.

Chapters focus on proofs and evidence for the &quot;Rare Earth&quot; hypothesis. Some of these proofs can get rather lengthy and detailed but it's necessary and it is not so overwhelming that the reader will drop the book and walk away.

In a universe as big as ours, statistically unlikely events occur all the time. The one event described in the book that truly would be a freak would be the existence of the Moon, which (1) stabilizes Earth's axis and (2) augments the tides(which would be provided at 1/3 volume by the Sun). However, this argument is at least qualified by the existence of Pluto and Charon. The problem of the Sun-hugging Jupiters is an interesting one. However this could be due to the fact that the stars around which Sun-huggers formed are much younger than the Sun and the process of solar system formation is not yet complete. The role which extinctions have played in the evolution of life on Earth is itself very inconclusive. Although perhaps they stimulated the evolution of advanced forms, just as easily they could have retarded them. As it is, we know so very little about the formation and history of planets it is premature to jump to grand conclusions. Nonetheless Ward and Brownlee reject facile reasoning and challenge the reader to examine basic assumptions."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"First off, let me say that I'm a big SETI supporter (both in the rah-rah and charity senses), and I don't see this book as anti-SETI or hopelessly pessimistic.

I also found this section of the book to be fun to read.However, their second premise is not as convincing, but not for lack of data.

Brave explorers searched for the Open Polar Ocean. Large swaths of continents were marked &quot;unexplored&quot; on maps. The geological systems of the world were barely glimmers in the minds of the first of the great 19th century scientists. After reading this book, with its fast-forwarding and reversing through geologic time, one feels like we're hanging on to a tiny, fragile marble by our fingernails. There's such a thing as an overdose of perspective!A lot of improbable things seemed to have had to happen for higher life to evolve on earth. The authors say that microscopic life may spring up wherever there is half a chance, but animal life requires a lot of just-so adjustments--adjustments that the Earth took billions of years to perform. For life--meaning carbon-based, liquid water requiring life, other elements being ill-suited to being a base for life--to arise, the sun had to be a yellow main sequence star, and the earth had to be a certain distance, and there had to be plate tectonics, liquid water, a magnetosphere, possibly a freakishly large moon, maybe asteroid bombardments, not too much exposure to gamma rays or nearby novas, and who knows what else. The authors postulate that such a chain of circumstances is probably rare in the universe. This is a disquieting thought, to think of entire gigantic elliptical galaxies probably being barren of life. So, far from being the crown of creation, we seem to be an accident, contemplating an accident.Whether you accept their hypothesis, or you think the universe is buzzing with other sentient life, it is educational to read the latest ideas about the origin of life, the history of Earth, and several of its more probable dooms. The authors are mercifully agnostic about flummery like the Gaia hypothesis, in which, practically, people try to convince themselves that the faces they see in the clouds really are faces. A compact, well delivered geology lesson, wrapped up in a profoundly disturbing idea."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a good book that I will recommend to friends, particularly those who are seeking to better understand their relationship to the universe, yet lack much in the way of scientific background. This book does a great job of describing some basic theory regarding the coalescence of our planet, the structure of our solar system, and the processes involved in evolving the higher life forms we are familiar with. The authors are very readable to a lay audience, though they do tend to be redundant.I am troubled, however, by what appears to be a paradigm problem. The authors spend a great deal of time describing the unique set of circumstances that Earth affords, resulting in the complex array of life forms we observe about us and in the fossil record. The troubling part, however, comes in the manner in which they approach the subject, and is most tellingly observed in their expanded use of the Drake formula near the end of the book, used to roughly quantifiy the probability that we might find intelligent life out there somewhere else in the universe. The problem is, we are looking backwards and saying, &quot;If this didn't happen, and that didn't happen, and this didn't happen, then we would never have gotten to what we see today.&quot; This is really the only tool we have, but the problem lies in the fact that we CAN NOT say, &quot;Had these things not happened, where WOULD we be?&quot; You can never know the multitude of unrealized possibilities when talking about your own experience, but we also cannot lose sight of those when we are talking about an infinitely complex &quot;other&quot; reality that is out there. All we know is that life &quot;as we know it&quot; was a co-creative process that evolved right along with all the factors that appear to have influenced it, such as the presence of the Moon and Jupiter, plate tectonics, and how fortunate we are that the K/T asteroid wasn't twice the size that it was. But if life was evolving along with environmental conditions and changes, and had a DIFFERENT set of conditions existed, might not a different outcome that is just as plausible been the result? Life as we know it is still interacting, moment by moment, with it's environment, and the slowly changing conditions of our solar system, and it is likely to continue to respond...sometimes in ways that cannot be predicted. The deterministic approach of the Rare Earth Hypothesis seems to be locked into the paradigm that life as we know it is the only realistically achievable life. But is that indeed realistic? Perhaps we are rare...in fact, I would surmise that we are. Perhaps, though, there are (in the words of Carl Sagan), &quot;billions and billions&quot; of rare, unique, life supporting planets functioning and evolving according to paradigms we can not yet even conceive of. Just because we don't know HOW to see it does not meen it isn't there. We may not know what to look for, yet!Remember, for a few hundred years, the physics of Newton was unapproachable, and unquestionably &quot;the&quot; way the universe operated. With a shift in paradigm, we got relativity and quantum mechanics, and now Newton's physics, while still very useful, is in many regards, just quaint. Are we doing the same thing with the Rare Earth?It's a good book, and will stimulate considerable thought!"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"It would seem that many (most?) scientists feel that life, in varied forms, must pervade the universe, but the authors of this book make a knowledgeable and well-reasoned case that life, or more precisely, complex, multicellular life, could be exceedingly rare in the universe and may in fact be limited to our Earth. In effect, they answer Fermi's famous query \\"where are they\\" by their analysis of all the factors that contribute to the hospitable environment Earth offers life, and how unique and cumulatively improbable those factors may be. It seems a life-harboring planet can't be near the center of a galaxy or in its periphery; its sun must be the right size -- not too large and not too small -- and must burn its nuclear fuel for at least several billion years to help life develop; the \\"Goldilocks\\" planet must be a rocky planet near the sun, but not too near (I believe the authors estimate the range of the habitable zone in our solar system to be in the neighborhood of only 30 million miles); the planet should be large enough to have sufficient gravity to retain its atmosphere but small enough not to attract frequent asteroid bombardment (it also helps to have a reasonably nearby giant like Jupiter to attract these asteroids); the planet needs to be geologically active with convective heat at its core to generate a magnetic field to deflect the solar wind; and this geologic activity should contribute to plate tectonics which resurfaces the planet resulting in new geographic niches and areas of isolation thus speeding up evolution of the existing forms of life. One fascinating item for me is the benefical existence of our moon which has the required size to maintain our angle of rotation at 23 degrees; without the moon, the angle of rotation would fluctuate too much rendering our seasons too unstable. There's more, but you get the point. As one who would be thrilled with the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe, I nonetheless found their analysis sobering but also stimulating and provocative. For fans of science, their multi-disciplinary approach effectively used astronomy, astrophysics, geology, geophysics, biology, astrobiology, and paleontology.It should be noted, however, that the authors suggest that microbial life may indeed pervade the universe; their pessimism is confined to more complex life (they call it \\"animal life\\") that may require billions of years to evolve. They suggest that the extreme resiliance of micro-organisms in some of earth's most hostile environments, e.g., we've found microbes in Yellowstone hot springs, Anarctica, and in deep ocean vents utilizing hydrogen and sulfur, indicate that this form of simple life may indeed be found in various cosmic environments.This book was published in 2003 and subsequent discoveries in our own solar system have been described as \\"expanding the habitable zone for life\\" rendering, perhaps, this book's assessment of life's chances unduly pessimistic. Over the last decade missions to Jupiter and Saturn have discovered exciting possibilities on two of Jupiter's moons (Io and Europa) and two of Saturn's moons (Enceladus and Titan). While the sun may be distant and these moons quite cold on the surface, tidal forces from the immense gravity of their nearby planets generate heat in the interior. Europa is suspected of having a large amount of liquid water underneath its surface. Titan has the only surface ocean in the solar system (other than Earth) albeit one of liquid methane (liquid at -300 degrees F). The most intriguing possibility is Saturn's moon, Enceladus. The Cassini mission flyby discovered that Enceladus has geysers of liquid water spewing into space that also contain salt and organic molecules. Nonetheless, with all the enthusiasm for finding life in the universe, this book is a welcome counterpoint."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"One of the most popular themes in science fiction is the prevalence of alien intelligent life in the Universe. While the supposed real-life abductions and UFO sightings may be silly, the scientific consensus has been that intelligent life is common in the Universe. Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee support the idea that simple life forms are common in the Universe, but contend in Rare Earth that any type of complex, multi-cellular animal life is extremely rare. Their book covers the \\"Rare Earth Hypothesis\\" which explores the difficulties that evolution overcame to reach today's complexity, as well as the special conditions of the Earth, Moon, Sun, and Solar System that produced the extended period of stability needed to foster complex life and prevent sterilization of the entire planet.I am nowhere near an expert on this topic, but as a scientist I found this book worthy of a review. I highly recommend it for its clear qualitative explanations of complicated scientific topics and its relatively neutral presentation of both sides of the more controversial topics. While readers may have qualms with at least some portion of the Rare Earth hypothesis, most will learn several important and indisputable facts about Earth's history that are essential to life today. The majority of readers will know about the \\"habitable zone\\" of the solar system, but may not be aware of the requirements of other types of stars, types of galaxies, and favorable regions inside of galaxies. The various ups and downs of the evolutionary pathway were also fascinating to read about, as life on Earth evolved little for billions of years and then rapidly diversified in the Cambrian explosion around 500-600 million years ago. The (controversial) reasons behind this explosion of life are essential for understanding how humans evolved and for assessing the timing of evolution on other hypothetical Earth-like planets. Unequivocally, it is relatively easy to create prokaryotes, even in extreme conditions, while evolving multicellular eukaryotes is much more difficult and requires several intermediary steps.I found the section on building a habitable earth to be especially thought provoking. The habitable zones in the universe are quite small due to a shortage of heavy metals near the edge and a close proximity of bodies that cause gravity perturbations or eject high-energy particles near the center. But since the Universe is expanding and heavy metals are becoming more common, perhaps solar systems like ours are rare now, but will become more common several billion years from now? Will the exploded remains of today's stars form into more favorable planetary systems in the distant future? Or, as the authors suggest, will radioactive elements have decayed too much to prevent plate tectonics on newly-developed planets? As with many other topics, there is no definitive answer and the reader is left to form his/her own opinions or conduct further research.The most difficult challenge facing Ward and Brownlee is testing the Rare Earth hypothesis. By their own admission, there simply is not enough evidence to confirm or deny some of the crucial aspects of their arguments. Not surprisingly, this is the greatest shortcoming of the book and the biggest reason why they are not completely persuasive. But as the authors contend, given the current available evidence, Earth may be the only planet with animal life in this portion of the galaxy, and even possibly the entire galaxy. When considering that the \\"Drake equation\\" predictions of a million or more intelligent civilizations, the contention for a far rarer Earth is quite reasonable, even without conclusive evidence for many of the authors' claims. The book is perhaps best characterized as the pessimistic answer to the overly-optimistic projections for life generated by the discovery of exoplanets in the 1990s.Still, the mathematical merit must be given adequate consideration. The \\"sample size\\" for testing various elements of the hypothesis is quite variable. We have good estimates for the total number of stars in the galaxy and the percentage of which are similar to the sun and with an acceptable amount of heavy metals (small quibble: the authors incorrectly cite the number of stars in the Milky Way as 200-300 million, it actually is 200-300 billion). The population of other life-inhibiting dangers such as quasars and magnetars can be reasonably estimated. But the extremely important presence of a Jupiter-like planet to fend off comets is mostly unknown, as it is only possible to measure \\"Hot Jupiters\\" and Jupiter exoplanets with highly elliptical orbits. The only complete sample of a solar system is our own. Earth is the only known planet with a large moon and plate tectonics, with the only other candidates for comparison being Venus and Mars. Models can estimate the probability of some of these factors, but the initial conditions are inherently biased without more complete data from other stars.Earth is the one and only example of life itself. From our perspective it may appear that animal life here emerged by pure chance. But we do not know the true odds of this chance. Is our evolutionary path the only one, with the other possibilities resulting in life remaining primitive or going extinct? Or is our planet just one possible path of many? The authors do present the possibility that plate tectonics may have actually inhibited life early in the Earth's history by slowing the oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, the details of the fossil record are so sparse that it is hard to know what actually existed, much less what could have existed in an alternate evolutionary paradigm. It seems nave to think that Earth's way is the only way--but it certainly could be.The opportunity for debate is actually a big part of the appeal of Rare Earth. The question, \\"Are we alone?\\" pervades popular culture and makes for great discussion. As mentioned in the preface, Rare Earth emerged from lunchroom conversations. The concluding chapter actually weakens the thesis by laying out alternate explanations to the Rare Earth hypothesis while offering nothing new to counter except references to the previous chapters. I think this is intentional--an attempt to provoke conversation--but perhaps the authors simply lack evidence or do not want to be redundant. Ultimately, there is no way to confirm or deny the Rare Earth hypothesis, so it may be many generations before this book's legitimacy is decided: either forgotten as an anathema to widespread discovery of other earths, or a groundbreaking beginning to our society's role as protectors of a very rare and special ecosystem."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"It is scientific, but it doesn't have the boredom of a chemistry class.

It reads somewhat like a novel about how the Earth came about, and why it supports life, combined with some of the complicated explanations from physics and chemistry that describe what was necessary to make it all happen. It does not talk about God, but as you read you can reflect on the intelligence that was necessary to produce all this, or you can simply give credit to science and leave all talk of \\"cause\\" out of it.It gives a lot of essentials--which I only skim over here--beginning with the \\"Big Bang.\\" From this came little more than three things--three elements: hydrogen, helium, and lithium. The hydrogen produced helium as a result of thermonuclear fusion. It was now the heaviest element in the universe. However, almost everything we take for granted to support life on earth requires elements heavier than helium--even the elements that make up 96% of the earth's mass--oxygen, magnesium, silicon, iron and sulfur! Where did these come from? How did they come about? It's a long story and complex--more than be explained here. But Peter Ward does explain the formation of the stars, planets, moon, galaxies, etc. It's really very interesting if you enjoy this stuff.What I found most exciting is when he talked about the formation of \\"carbon,\\" maybe because this has been tossed around as a political football. But this was the secret to having life in the universe. No carbon--no life--for a while! Carbon had to wait for the formation of giant red stars. These had such density that their inevitable explosions (and the thermonuclear fusion that accompanied them) were powerful enough to allow three way collisions of helium atoms to form carbon atoms. From carbon, heavier atoms could be formed. This all happened because the matter from the Big Bang was being cycled/recycled in and out of stars. Don't' believe it? The atoms of our bodies were once the matter of stars too! This gradually began to enrich the universe.In my very simple summation: our sun was formed by this process and such resultant matter. While it was forming, it was surrounded by millions of miles of gas, dust and rocks. As the sun grew hotter, only certain elements could survive in certain areas orbiting the sun. Planets were formed by those elements. Those closer to the sun were too hot to end up with enough nitrogen and carbon to support life. Those too cold wound up with an abundance of these but were too unstable to form solid surfaces. The earth was the only one to have the right surface warmth (climate/temperature) where all the elements could survive. It makes sense too! Our atmosphere is a precise mixture: 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.039% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases, which is what supposedly works out to be the best for forming hard surfaces and supporting life.Other things I found fascinating were the earth's characteristics and conclusions that can be drawn from them. One thing is that the earth is the only planet in our solar system that has water on the surface and a temperature range that allows it to always exist. It also has linear mountain ranges. These are not as important as the process that creates and adjusts them: plate tectonics. Although this is what causes such terrible things like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, it is what is also responsible for acting as the planet's thermostat, by recycling chemicals which are crucial in keeping the volume of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere relatively uniform and liquid water abundant. It is also the cause behind changes in our sea levels and the formation of minerals that keep the levels of carbon dioxide in check (yes, global temperatures). It also make possible one of earth's greatest characteristics: its magnetic fields which above all protects us from deadly cosmic radiation.One of the pleasures this affords is that the author describes in much detail how all of this happens."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Writers Ward and Brownlee have put together a very readable text on astrobiology in their Rare Earth, Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe. It discussed in detail many of the tough issues that scientists in the fields wrangle with such as the beginning of life and concepts of our Earth's history through its past 4Ga. They discuss what it has taken for our Earth to evolve and what some other planetary systems may have that would allow \\"life.\\" They finally look at the Drake Equation and assess possibilities for other Earth-like existence. Some will differ in their opinion at the end."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"There is a long tradition among humans that we are not aloneinthe universe - that there are other worlds with other intelligentbeings such as ourselves. This tradition is found in many religions and embodied in some scientific thought. The late Carl Sagan, for example, surmised the existence of one million civilizations capable of interstellar communications in the Milky Way galaxy. Ward and Brownlee take exception to these estimates. According to the authors, microbial life is common in the universe &quot;but even the simplest animal life is exceedingly rare.&quot; Instead of millions of such civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy there might be just a few. There might be just one.One of the things I liked most about this book its very nice summary of the history of earth. Chapter 1 has some interesting information about recent discoveries regarding the environments in which extremophiles live. It might seem incredible to us, but extremophiles actually thrive in very high temperatures, pressures, and pH levels that we would find terribly fatal. The wide range of environments in which the simplest life forms can live gives rise to the greater probability of finding them throughout the universe. Extremophiles not only thrive in such environments, they can also tolerate brief forays into space aboard debris ejected from meteor impacts, and they can escape harsh surface conditions by living deep under ground.The second chapter introduces us to the concept of habitable zones. For extremophiles the habitable zones are quite large, so planets harboring such life can be found in a wider range of orbits around a wider range of stars. More complex life, however, requires far smaller ranges in environmental conditions, leading to a much-reduced habitable zone. Habitable zones must also exist over sufficiently long periods of time for life to evolve. In other words, the habitable zone has both spatial and a temporal components. The upshot is that habitable zones for complex life are pretty small, and may not exist at all unless the star is quite similar to ours.Chapter three describes some of the critical components for a habitable earth, including the creation of hydrogen and helium (and a bit of lithium) in the Big Bang, and the creation of heavier elements in stars. The earth needed to form from an inter-stellar accumulation rich in metals with the right amount of water. The authors argue that such conditions are rare in the universe, and that planets such as ours are rare as well.Chapter four discusses the conditions on earth after the initial bombardment stopped, during the earth's early formation. This chapter has some very interesting material suggesting how bacteria, archaea, and eucarya form the earliest tree of life. Chapter 5 continues by describing how Eucarya are differentiated from the archaeans and the bacteria. Eucarya include the animals, ciliates, fungi, plants, flagellates, and microspordia that constitute the complex life that the authors claim is so rare in the universe. The key piece of evidence regarding eucarya is that they took a long time to evolve in earth's history. The message in this fact, according to the authors, is that eucarya require a more specialized environment in which to evolve - a narrower habitable zone - and that this environment must persist for long periods of time. All of which argues against this type of life being common in the universe.Chapter 6 is called &quot;Snowball Earth,&quot; and describes the earliest known ice ages on earth, which date to 2.4 billion and 800 to 650 million years BP. These ice ages, in contrast to the one a few tens of thousands of years ago, literally covered the entire earth and froze the oceans over. These ice ages could have helped to stimulate the evolution of animals, and (just as importantly) they also show that major environmental changes - changes that can cause mass extinction - have and can occur on earth. Timing and the extreme nature of the events are critical to the evolution of life.The real centerpiece of this book is chapter 7, which discusses the enigma of the Cambrian explosion. Perhaps no other event in earth's history has generated as much debate and speculation as the comparatively sudden rise in complexity of animal species that accompanied the Cambrian explosion. The authors argue that the triggers for this explosion (and they offer several possible candidates) are necessary for the evolution of complex life, but they are also rare - adding further emphasis to their hypothesis that complex life in the universe is rare.Chapter 8 describes mass extinctions and threats to animal life. Chapter 9 raises some interesting issues about the importance of plate tectonics and argues that the evolution of animal life requires plate tectonics to maintain biodiversity and to stabilize global climate. Chapter 10 discusses the importance of the moon in creating tides, contributing to orbital stability (and possibly contributing to plate tectonics) and Jupiter, which cleans the solar system of planet-crossing projectiles that could sterilize earth. Again, the point is that these conditions are rare, and so planets with complex life are also rare.Chapter 11 describes ways in which the rare-earth hypothesis might be tested, and chapter 12 reassesses the odds of complex life in the universe via a modified form of the Drake equation. I found chapter 12 a bit of a disappointment, though, since the authors never really stick there necks out and make a claim for how many planets with complex life might exist in the galaxy. The final chapter discusses the philosophical and ethical implications of the rare-earth hypothesis, including the role people play in the current extinction crisis.This is a first-rate book. The notes are detailed, the index complete, the text clear and understandable. The argument is lucid and in many (though not all) ways compelling. And, of course, it's hard to think of subject matter more relevant."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is one of the most wide-ranging and readable of all science books aimed at a non-specialist audience. The authors raise Big Questions in astronomy, planetary evolution, geology, climatology, ecology, and biological evolution, reminding us of how interdisciplinary the extraterrestrial life debate really is. The vast array of subjects they address could make this book an ideal discussion text for a course designed to introduce non-scientists to scientific issues and methods. The book, at least in its hardback edition, has an uncrowded format that makes it easy to read.Ward and Brownlee accumulate a lengthy series of arguments in support of their position that, while simple life may be relatively common, complex life is rare. At first glance, these arguments seem persuasive. However, a closer reading reveals that the authors sometimes tilt the debate in their favor by choosing the argument that best supports their case even when the evidence is very limited or ambiguous, e.g. their statement that plate tectonics \\"may be vanishingly rare in the Universe as a whole.\\" How can they know this when our sample is limited to our own solar system? Sometimes, the authors make unsupported blanket generalizations, e.g. \\"On every planet, sooner or later, a planetary catastrophe can be expected that either seriously threatens the existence of animal life or wipes it out altogether.\\" Stating that \\"it just seems to have been by chance that our Jupiter formed as it did\\" is hardly scientific. Oddly, after stating that SETI is a futile effort if their hypothesis is correct, the authors go on to say that \\"There probably are other civilizations in the galaxy that have radio telescopes.\\" In the end, the fundamental limitation to such arguments is that they are based on the only biosphere we know -- our own. This is summed up in the authors' statement that \\"It appears that Earth got it just right.\\" Life as we know it may not exhaust all the possibilities.There are some errors. Venus does not always present the same face to the Sun. Nicholas Copernicus was Polish, not Danish. Frank Drake's equation was developed for a meeting held in 1961. One hopes that the authors will clean up these details for a second edition."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"These two authors have written a highly informative book to support their thesis that we might well be the only multi-celled organisms in the universe. It should be stressed that Ward and Brownlee feel strongly that there are probably simple, bacteria like creatures on other planets, but nothing more complex. This is a most interesting book even if you do not agree with their hypotheses. It provides an entertaining and accessible summary of the biological, cosmological, and geological science involved in the development of our home planet. W&amp;B feel that the necessary conditions for complex life are so numerous that few, if any, planets elsewhere could meet the requirements.Read this book and see: 1. Why the moon and Jupiter are essential for our existence. 2. Why a system of plate tectonics is vital for the development of life forms. 3. The effects that mass extinctions have had on evolution. 4. Why life may have originated in the deep ocean near hydrothermal vents. 5. Why earth is very lucky to be located on the far edge of our galaxy.For the scientific oriented layman this book is a true gem."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is the best book that I have seen on the subject of extraterrestrial life and the possibility of its occurrence beyond our solar system in a long time. In order to make the most accurate prediction possible the book makes use of the strongest evidence we have to date, our knowledge of our own solar system. Using very wide breadth, the authors rationalize the following simple theme, \\"The occurrence of simple microbial life is pervasive in the universe, but the occurrence of more complex, multi-cellular life is not.From this book I now realize that the number of natural phenomena affecting the possible occurrence and evolution of complex life in one of our neighboring stars is far greater than I ever imagined. I thank the authors for enlightening me on this subject. Perhaps in future I won't be as disappointed as I was during the first Viking landing. I really did think they would find vegetation on Mars, and I'm still upset about it.The authors of &quot;Rare Earth&quot; present their subject very well, although perhaps not in a style that would excite the average public, as did Carl Sagan and Issac Isamov in their science books. Indeed, I recommend that the authors of this text consider rewriting it in a more popular form, with plenty of illustrations. Hey, people love pictures, myself included.The controversy between the people at SETI and the authors is unfortunate. I believe both sides have a lot to gain from each other's work. In my opinion it was a mistake for the authors to have included, near the very end of the book, references to SETI. The antagonism created was predictable. I myself am a participant in the seteathome project, having completed 225 work units so far. However, I do not allow my excitement over the possibility of receiving an alien signal stand in the way of my objectivity in the face of the best hard evidence we have to date. Besides, I take it not as fact, but simply as the best prediction I have heard anyone say so far. It is the closest to fact that we can get at this time. Hopefully soon we will get closer."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth presents the interesting and not widely disseminated view that complex life forms are probably very rare in the universe. In other words, we haven't seen any ET's because there aren't any-or very few. The book makes this argument reasonably effectively and supports it with some science.I was disappointed that the science seemed pretty shallow-not really well done. There are just plain factual errors, e.g., the repeated assertion that Venus and Mercury present the same face towards the sun all the time, which leads to the elimination of a whole class of stars as potential homes for Earth type planets. Some science was confusingly presented, some just irrelevant, e.g., the discussion of periodite as distinct from basalt.One is tempted to dismiss these as minor flaws, but they are particularly irritating in light of the authors' hubris about our current knowledge. For instance, I think they too easily dismiss the possibility of complex life developing or surviving in some way we haven't thought of. Such a possibility could overcome the need for the presence or absence of certain chemicals, the necessity of protection from ultraviolet radiation, or relax temperature limits, etc.Another instance: in considering the consequences of the cessation of plate tectonics they predict, with no qualifications, that the continents will disappear, Earth will become a \\"waterworld\\", sea life will be aversely affected, carbon dioxide levels will drop to zero, the greenhouse effect will be diminished and Earth will freeze. There are no alternative hypothesis, no consideration of possible breaks in their chain of reasoning. The role of water vapor, clouds, the effects of increased areas of evaporation, the adaptability of life are not dealt with at all. This unqualified confidence seemed particularly unsuited to scientists who, as a group, find it necessary to change some aspects of their creation story every five months and can't come close to predicting next week's weather.The argument that the moon's role in stabilizing the obliquity of the Earth's spin axis was essential for the existence of long lasting complex life was unconvincing. It was hardly an argument, more just an assertion. I came away saying, \\"Maybe....but, well, maybe not.\\" Another assertion, not even an argument, \\"the critical 40 degree C mark that is the upper temperature limit of animal life.\\" Living in Phoenix Arizona, where the temperature reaches 50 degrees C, I'm tempted to say, \\"I don't think so.\\"It was a little jarring to find several mentions of the current \\"mass extinction\\" mixed in with the statement, \\"The fossil record suggests that there are more species of animals and plants alive on Earth today than at any time in the past.\\" No data is presented or alluded to; the nuances and profound uncertainties regarding the current stage of life on Earth are just not acknowledged-just boilerplate about rain forests and topsoil. The idea that intelligent life is very rare is important. This book presents that idea fairly well, but with some distressing and regrettable problems."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I discovered this title in a review in the Boston Sunday Globe a few years ago and decided to try reading the book. To my great pleasure, I found that the authors had done their job well. Although they are pretty sure, given the present state of our knowledge, that advanced life is almost improbable elsewhere in the universe, they continually provide views apposing theirs....so the book is not merely a vehicle to broadcast their own bias [note especially their summation: pp 282-287] They also assert quite strongly that since these studies are just beginning, future discoveries could completely alter the picture as they see it. In addition, the writing, especially considering the material they are discussing, is surprisingly easy to read and understand and totally lacking the 'jargon' so prevalent in today's academic world. I highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to consider the implications of their thesis."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is one of the most astonishing books I have ever read. Its thesis, that complex life similar to life on the Earth, is probably very rare in the galaxy, if not the universe. The authors meticulously build a case for Earth's special place in the cosmos, showing how bacterial life might be common but that anything bigger than simple organisms might not be able to survive the ravages of time and comets and wandering axial tilt. As other readers have pointed out, this doesn't necessarily mean that silicon-based life or some other kind of life can't exist in the universe, but it does demonstrate that Fermi's Dilemma might in fact be true. As a science fiction writer, I was stunned at how much this book could change the way science fiction is written. No more Star Trek universes with complex life in every system, no more &quot;federations&quot; or &quot;foundations&quot; or &quot;assemblies&quot; of thousands of inhabited worlds. According to the thesis Ward and Brownlee present, habitable worlds might be few and far between. Humans may very well find no other worlds beyond the Earth upon which to live. RARE EARTH will make it difficult to read books or watch movies that envision a galaxy filled with wonderful and curious creatures, where humans spread out across the galaxy as if they were so many islands in Polynesia. And if the Rare Earth hypothesis is true, then we are also obliged to get our act together here and now if we are going to become a space-going species. I think this book puts a lot of science fiction writers out of business. It certainly makes a lot of science fiction, including my own, seem downright silly."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is certainly a great book. It is bound to age quickly since most of the book is based on really ground-breaking discoveries and propositions that are many times challenged shortly after their publication. The book presents a paradoxical theory that says that life is widespread on the universe but most of the times it doesn't go much beyond the very simple organisms on the first evolutionary steps.Complex life as we see on earth, the book says, must be extraordinary rare if not unique. The idea is revolutionary and the book is written in a very compelling way.The idea certainly goes against the mainstream challenging consolidated ideas like the Drake Equation. The Drake Equation, devised by Dr. Frank Drake in 1961 is a famous way to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations able to communicate within our own galaxy. This important estimate is one of the pillars for projects like the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence).One of the most interesting ideas presented in the book in my opinion is the possibility of exchange of microorganisms between planets and moons within our solar system. Meteor or comet impacts in planets would eject rocks that could carry live microorganisms to neighbor planets. This would happen more often in smaller planets subject to smaller gravitational force and with thinner atmospheres like Mars. Life as we see it on earth, the book says, might actually have started in Mars. However the book doesn't consider the artificial process of seeding life what is for me the lost factor on Drake's equation, the colonization factor. An advanced civilization, even a unique one, could very well have spread life on the universe bypassing the first evolutionary steps and making complex life feasible even on planets that are for a shorter period of time at the solar system habitable zone. If nobody did it before we, humans, might very well start doing in the near future.Many are, according to the book, the reasons why earth displays such a lush biodiversity. Things that we many times take for granted like plate tectonics, Earth's magnetic field, the presence of other planets like Jupiter and Mars, the size and stability of our Sun and Earth's basic composition are paramount to our very existence. The odds of reproducing such favorable conditions are, according to the book, slim.The book covers a wide range of subjects from astronomy to biology passing through geology, paleontology, climatology, and many other ologies. But don't panic, the book is written in a way that you can read it and enjoy it even if you lack the basic knowledge in one or more of the subjects covered. This is done by constantly restating the key points presented in every chapter.This is a fascinating book on a fascinating topic. The biggest problem is that we try to study or even predict the nature of life in other planets based on our unique sample, Earth. As any statistician would agree it's hard to make good statistics on only one sample.Leonardo Alves, November 2000"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Astrobiology, the subject of this excellent book, is a science still in eager anticipation of its first object of contemplation. Professors Ward and Brownlee from the University of Washington, the former a geologist, the latter an astronomer, argue very strongly that such an object will not be what we would call an animal or a metazoan. Certainly the word &quot;intelligent&quot; will not apply to the first extraterrestrial. Their thesis is that our earth is indeed rare, the product of innumerable rare events and unusual conditions, so much so that we should expect to find similar circumstances elsewhere only very rarely. Acknowledging the recent discoveries of extremophiles, single-celled organisms that can live in very harsh environments, the authors aver that microbial life, on the other hand, should be plentiful. They believe, nonetheless, that the leap from microbes to complex life forms is a very rare event indeed.Their argument is based on all the things that can go wrong. They cite a formidable litany of hindrances including the need for a planet to be the right size at the right distance from a star of the right size and composition, to the need for plate tectonics (for biotic diversity and the recycling of materials) and a large moon (to stabilize the planet's tilt and temperature), to a Jupiter to sweep the system relatively free of deadly planet-crossing bodies, and especially to a very long time period in which to evolve, etc.Their argument is tantalizing and difficult to fault. We have only one example of the rise of complex life, and it seems reasonable to conclude that the factors that allowed this life to evolve are necessary. But I am troubled. If I look at the factors that led to my birth, my birth as exactly me, the whole process seems rather miraculous. If my parents had never met, if my mother had had a headache that night, if, in fact, she or my father had behaved in any way differently from exactly how they did behave during the time up and including my conception, another little sperm might have fertilized the egg and I would not exist. Or, take a hand at bridge. If you are dealt 13 spades, you can be pretty sure that something fishy is going on since the odds against getting exactly 13 spades are astronomical. However, the odds against being dealt any other exact hand at bridge are also astronomical, in fact the odds are identical. But some combination of cards must be dealt! So the fact that the development of complex life on this planet seems miraculous in the sense that everything had to be just right for it to develop may be a misconception. I think it's akin to the anthropic principle. If our solar system were different perhaps some other creatures would be here rhapsodizing over just how miraculous all the coincidences were that produced them!The authors, of course, are talking about carbon-based &quot;life as we know it.&quot; Since it is massively difficult to speculate on life as we don't know it, especially when considering that 90% of the universe, the so-called mysterious dark matter, is still totally beyond our ken, they are wise to qualify the argument. I would add that life may take on forms and modes that we wouldn't recognize as being &quot;alive.&quot; It may be, for example, that the stars are &quot;alive.&quot; We know that they are born, they grow, reproduce and die. They spew their seeds, the heavy elements out into space where they attract other elements and form new stars. Such life would be &quot;life as we wouldn't recognize it.&quot; There is also the possibility that life may take on forms and modes totally beyond our comprehension, giving us &quot;life as we can't possibly know it.&quot; An example would be my friends &quot;the energy beings&quot; who live, reproduce and disappear in a small fraction of a nanosecond, too quick for us ever to be aware of them.Yes, one may, I hope, speculate. Certainly that is what the authors are doing here. Regardless of how carefully they conform to what is currently known in a scientific sense, and regardless of how carefully those speculations are expressed, they are postulating from a sampling of one. But the authors know this. On page 282 they write, &quot;The great danger to our thesis...is that it is a product of our lack of imagination. We assume in this book that animal life will be somehow Earth-like. We take perhaps the jingoistic stance that...lessons from Earth are not only guides but also rules.&quot; Nonetheless they say that &quot;evidence and inference&quot; lead them to believe that the earth is very rare indeed.There is some redundant repetition from chapter to chapter, which can happen with two authors, and there are the usual &quot;spell-checker&quot; typos, i.e., &quot;out&quot; for &quot;our,&quot; etc., that occasionally mar the text, but no more than usual. On page 267, however, they estimate that there are between 200 and 300 million stars in our galaxy. Of course the number is more like 100 billion. They probably meant that there are 200 to 300 million &quot;sun-like&quot; stars in our galaxy. These quibbles aside, I think that the significant value of this book is that, in the process of arguing for their rare earth, Ward and Brownlee are able to share with us their formidable understanding of the latest findings in a number of sciences, especially geology, biology and astronomy, and apply that knowledge to astrobiology. The material on tectonics and mass extinctions is especially interesting. Their recreation of the impact and aftermath of the object that hit the earth at the end of the Cretaceous is strikingly vivid. More than this, it is their enthusiasm in presenting the material that makes this excellent book so very interesting and readable."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth is a fascinating book that argues that intelligent life is rare in the universe. The value of this book does not lie in the cogency of its arguments but rather in the panoply of interesting facts and theories the authors marshal to argue their point. The authors contend that simple unicellular organisms are ubiquitous in the universe, if not potentially in our solar system. They base their argument on the Draconian environments here on earth where extremeophiles survive. They contend, however,that only a set of unique circumstances could allow unicellular organisms to develop into complex metazoans. The unique conditions include the position of a planet in a solar system, the position of a solar system in a galaxy, and the close proximity of both a large planet and a large moon. Furthermore a planet requires earth-like plate tectonics and maybe a couple of ice ages thrown in that dwarf our previously known ice ages in severity and longevity.(They describe the new theory of &quot;snowball earth&quot;). The weakness of their argument lies in their emphasis on the conditions necessary for life rather than the process. The formation of a complex molecule, RNA, necessary for life, and DNA, necessary for reproduction, might be a far more difficult process than the evolution of microbes to complex organisms. They also make their argument from a strictly anthropic point of view,ignoring the possibility of completely different forms of life. It seems axiomatic that the more complex the life form becomes in any habitat,the more specialized the habitat must become to sustain that life. In any case, intelligent life can be extraordinarily rare but be far from unique due to the vastness of our universe. New theories of inflation, especially chaotic inflation, suggest that the visible universe with its one hundred billion galxies is merely a speck in the much larger cosmos. In summary, even though I don't always agree with the authors, this book is too interesting and informative not to read."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the explanations given therein. My bone with the authors is that they have stretched their conclusions (namely that life in the Universe is a rare event) way too far. The idea that Earth is a perfect place for life because everything is 'just so' is not really new. Arguments for intelligent design (code-word for creationism) follow similar logic. The problem with the logic of this book is that it assumes all life must evolve exactly (or nearly so) as it did here on earth (same requirements, same molecular structure etc). Although this may be true, we simply do not yet know if that is the case. The authors do indeed argue that this is true only for complex life and therefore the discovery of simpler life forms may not negate their thesis. However, we also do not have enough information to make such a broad sweeping conclusion regarding the Universe. Ultimately, the argument comes down to what we observe in our own solar system and indeed we may be a 'rare earth' insofaras the type of complex life we have here, but complex life in other forms may be common elsewhere in the Universe. Indeed, the solar system may simply appear 'rare' because we are in charge of defining the term. Nevertheless, this is a very entertaining book and I encourage you to read it with a critical eye."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The thesis of this book is that \\"microbial\\" life is probably common in the Universe, but \\"animal\\" life is uncommon. However, in the process of developing this thesis, many assumptions about the possible forms that life might take are made but not analyzed. The particulars of the astronomical and geological history of Earth are examined in depth, and it is shown that for life exactly as it appears on Earth, it is likely to be the case that many of those particulars turn out to be necessary. Examples of such conditions are the existence of plate tectonics, the presence of a large moon, and the presence of a large planet (Jupiter) in a circular orbit well outside the Earth's orbit. The step that rings false is the inference that since such particulars may well have a lot to do with exactly how complex life developed on Earth, that therefore these particulars must obtain anywhere else in the Universe that complex life occurs.This book an enjoyable read, and is a really interesting summary of the astronomical, geological, and biological history of Earth, but the generalizations as to what may or may not occur elsewhere in the Universe are dubious at best. The implicit assumptions behind the major arguments in this book may turn out to be true, but I actually found the book very frustrating because these extremely important assumptions were never articulated, examined, or analyzed. Here are just some of what I believe are the major implicit assumptions underlying the argument in this book:- life anywhere must occur on an Earth-like (stony) planet- the planet must be in a \\"habitable zone\\" similar to the zone in which Earth exists -- a zone in which Earth life would be able to live- life anywhere requires the existence of liquid water- \\"complex\\" life anywhere requires \\"just the right amount\\" of liquid water, so that the entire planetary surface is not covered- life anywhere must be based on organic (carbon) chemistry- life anywhere must be based on similar biochemical molecules that support life on Earth- life anywhere requires the presence of trace quantities of heavy elements such as are produced in supernovas.- life anywhere must be organized as cells and groupings of cells- eukaryotic cells are a prerequisite for complex life- the category of \\"animals\\" has some natural analog elsewhere that life occurs (although, by hypothesis, this would be rare)- environments in which \\"extremophiles\\" live are actually \\"extreme\\" in an absolute sense, and not just the natural and \\"comfortable\\" (for them) environments in which certain types of organisms have evolved or survived(Other important assumptions, e.g. about the necessity of plate tectonics, a large moon, and a Jupiter-like planet in the system, are at least developed explicitly).I believe these assumptions are allowed to go unexamined because there is no attempt in the book to define in general terms what is meant by \\"life\\". Instead the example of life on Earth is used as a template in a very specific and geocentric fashion. Without addressing these issues, the theory about the relative cosmic abundance of \\"microbial\\" life and the relative scarcity of \\"animal\\" life in the Universe seem somewhat meaningless. The assumption that there must be direct analogs of either category strikes me as unjustified by the presentation here, even if it turns out to be the case.The thesis of the book, about the relative abundance of \\"microbial\\" and \\"animal\\" life in the Universe at large, almost seems like a side show compared to the attempt to show that complex life anywhere must occur in the same conditions as occurred here on Earth. Instead of using the example of life on Earth to speculate on the general conditions under which self-organizing, homeostatic, replicating, adaptive systems may occur, it is implicit in this book that life anywhere must be substantially similar in many details to life on Earth, and that therefore the particular conditions that led to complex life on Earth must be replicated in order for complex life to occur anywhere. The logic of much of the extrapolation of the book is inverted. Contingent events that happened on Earth are used as a basis of speculation about what might be necessary for life anywhere. It is hazardous to make proscriptive generalizations from a sample of size one, but that is done repeatedly in this book. I can't say they are wrong, but I don't find the argument convincing."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"It is refreshing to see some logic and science applied to an area where many prefer to apply mysticism - the belief that the universe either is, or is not populated by advanced life.

And don't even THINK about invoking the Copernican Principle, that overused security blanket of the Lonely Earthlings Club: yes, if we assume that our local physical conditions are ordinary, we would be justified in inferring that life (of whatever level of complexity) might exist elsewhere. But as the authors show in glorious detail, that assumption is glaringly false. We are the end-product of EXTRAORDINARY physical and geological conditions, not ordinary ones.

WHERE IS EVERYBODY?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life. I wanted a more technical analysis of this intriguing subject and Rare Earth provided just that, and a lot more. The book carefully details the countless of factors that had to occur just right for life on Earth to end up where it is now. I found the book highly accessible even though I have no formal education in any of the fields that were heavily present throughout the book, namely astronomy, biology and geology. The only tiny problem I ran into, not being a native English speaker, is that I had to check a few technical words every now and then, the kind of words you don't normally run into (e.g., phyla, specific species' names etc.). This, however, merely helped expand my vocabulary.The book piles up tons of arguments to support its central hypothesis, that while simple life may be common in the universe, complex animal life is exceedingly rare. The book is at its best when it deals with the various astronomical factors that led to the formation of Earth and, ultimately, to the evolution of man. At few points, particularly with respect to evolution, the book does seem to suffer from a lack of imagination and seems to assume that if complex animal life is to evolve elsewhere, it has to evolve more or less the way it evolved here. This issue is not addressed until the sixth last page (of the paperback edition) and there it is dealt with only briefly. Also, around halfway through the book the central hypothesis seems to disappear too often as the focus shifts to detailing the origins of our planet. These are minor complaints, however, as the book is filled with relevant information and manages to cast heavy doubt on even moderately optimistic estimates of the frequency of complex animal life in the universe.Anyone interested in the subject (aren't we all?) should get their hands on this book. Silly and naive beliefs concerning the frequency of complex animal life \\"out there\\" are too widespread these days. The subject deserves to be treated seriously and Rare Earth does just that.

That simple life might be common, and complex life very rare, is a new twist to the enigma of life's genesis. The work highlights the puzzle of the Cambrian, now including, by hypothesis, an invisible period just before and leading up to it, which clarifies its passage into the realm naturalism from the presumptions of Creationists but without providing as yet the explanation, which is not so easily left at the doorstep of geological or external environmental explanation. The appearance of so many complex animal body plans so near the beginning of the rise planetary life as we know it is a reminder that we are missing something still in our theories of evolution. It is often insufficiently clear in accounts of this subject just how much internal organization there is in this high level beginnng period and how far the later period of the evolutionary processes to come are from matching this threshold of the coming beast."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a great book and I am generally a harsh critic.

They discuss why the moon and Jupiter are essential for our existence. The need for plate tectonics and why this may be unusual, mass extinctions, earth's location in the galaxy, and many other reasons why our planet has somehow by chance ended up as a perfect place for complex life.This is a clear rebuttal to the \\"The mediocrity principle\\" which I have heard countless times to argue that extra-terrestrial intelligents is common.

I enjoyed reading it, although I disagree with the authors' premise.The authors' basic thesis is that (1) extraterrestial microbial life is probably common, and (2) extraterrestrial intelligent life is probably rare, if not unique to Earth. Their first conclusion is based largely on the existence of extremophiles, organisms that can survive extremely hostile conditions. Their second conclusion is based on anthropic principle type arguments, many of which have been discussed in earlier works by other authors.Ward &amp; Brownlee are committed to the dogma of naturalism. They admit that &quot;conditions on the early Earth would have been in many ways horrific for natural 'chemistry' experiments involving reactions that now routinely take place in what we humans call 'room temperature'. ... For example, with an oxygen-free atmosphere the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth's surface would have been far higher than today, making delicate chemical reactions on the planet's surface very difficult.&quot; But because &quot;we know that life did arise ... &quot;, they therefore conclude that it must have arisen by naturalistic processes, without any intelligent input.The section on the origin of archaebacteria, and the evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and metazoans are highly speculative. Some difficulties are mentioned and then ignored (as the above). Others are just ignored. For instance, natural selection could not have acted on the simple precursors of prebiotic chemical systems, since they had no survival traits to select until they had reached a minimal level of complexity.Extremophiles also argue against natural selection. Tardigrades are tiny invertebrates that can survive extreme conditions created in laboratories (e.g. extremely high X-ray intensity and hydrostatic pressures, temperatures near to absolute zero, etc.). These conditions far exceed any Earth environment in the history of life, and therefore such hardy traits could not have come about by natural selection.The authors argue for a two-stage development in the evolution of animal life. The second stage is the well-known Cambrian Explosion. This was preceded by an earlier stage involving animals that had differentiated body plans, but were too small to found in the fossil record. This first stage is inferred from the molecular clock. Ward &amp; Brownlee admit that the assumption underlying a molecular clock (that genes mutate at a constant rate) is a matter of &quot;fierce debate&quot;, and that &quot;The Wray group's findings were extremely controversial&quot;. Nevertheless this is conveniently brushed aside when they conclude that &quot;The Wray work confirms that there were indeed two 'explosion'&quot;.The interesting role of plate tectonics in making Earth a suitable environment for life is described at length. The tacit assumption is that conditions that are necessary for life to exist, are also sufficient for life to originate - a giant leap of faith!Stanley Miller's view that &quot;the time necessary to go from soup to bugs may have been far less than 10 million years&quot; is quoted with approval. All this by blind natural mechanisms, when the untiring combined efforts of the world's best minds in biochemistry, sustained over many decades, has come nowhere near to creating the simplest life form from scratch! It seems that when people cease to believe in the Creator, they can believe the most unlikely stories."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The authors theorize that because primitive life apparently (based on scientific evidence) began early in the earth's history that it is likely universal (and may have bounced around from Mars to earth). Once they accept this as a given the rest of the book is about how many factors are uniquely involved to accomodate complex life.This approach glosses over two critical issues.(1) All life on earth is based on the genetic code right down to 'simple' (structurally) viruses (from this point of view it is 'universal'; i.e. all life as we know it). The DNA and RNA processes of the genome are far too complex to arise spontaneously, whether here or from Mars. Modern science suggests that there must be a prebiotic evolution with a DNA precursor. The authors mention a number of theories including the popular \\"RNA World\\" theory where the RNA performed all of the necessary functions. However no one has successfully modeled this so it is only a hypothesis bordering on pure speculation. RNA specialist Gerald Joyce has gone so far as to say \\"The most reasonable assumption is that life did not start with RNA...The transition to an RNA world, like the origins of life in general, is fraught with uncertainty and is plagued by a lack of experimental data.\\" The authors' distinction between 'simple' and 'complex' life from a scientific viewpoint is misguided. The critical first step or 'prebiotic phase' is so far unexplainable and applies to all life. As the authors of a recent unpublished paper (available on the web like many articles) state \\"The information crisis in prebiotic or chemical evolution stems essentially from two observations: (i) the length of a replicating polymer (i.e. RNA-like template) is limited by the replication accuracy per nucleotide, and (ii) templates that differ significantly from each other cannot coexist in a purely competitive setup. Realistic estimates of the error rate of primitive replication mechanisms predict too scanty information content per template - less than 100 nucleotides - to permit the complete codification of the mechanism in just one template.\\"(2) The earth clearly evolved over time from an original molten mass so one might well expect that as it cooled and water formed that more structurally complex life evolved with it (even if the prebiotic phase is universal). For those interested in the evolution they would be better educated by a book on Evolutionary Dynamics that does not, by a bunch of 'hand waving', spend time speculating about the qualitative effects of the moon on tides and Jupitor on asteroids. There is lots of science on the evolution of complexity and how it can work as opposed to not work. This is not to deny that life in the universe maybe very rare, but this is apparent from our telescopes and the very complexity of the much misunderstood first prebiotic steps. However the inference that these first steps can be taken for granted is not science."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I don't own and I haven't read the book but I agree with the authors that &quot;... while simple, microbial life will be very widespread in the universe, complex animal or plant life will be extremely rare.&quot;I would just like to make a simple change in the sentence, adding &quot;,as we know,&quot; after the second word &quot;life&quot;, so that it would read:&quot;...while simple, microbial life will be very widespread in the universe, complex animal or plant life, as we know, will be extremely rare.&quot;Why isn't the History of Science a good lesson to scientists as to the fact that man's perception of reality is in continuous evolution?

They rely on evolution and all the things that have to fall into place for evolution to happen. They talk about the many catastrophic extinctions that have happened during earth's history, but still there was supposedly enough time for evolution to happen. They even spend a whole chapter trying to explain the away the Cambrian Explosion and it's bad implications for evolution, but to no avail. All this, even though there is no scientific proof - from the fossil record to biochemistry - that evolution could be the process by which life formed and then diversified in the first place. Another thing about this book that is intriguing is how they talk so often about all the 'amazing coincidences' that had to happen in order for Earth to be able to support complex life. Earth \\"just happened\\" to be in the habitable zone in the solar system, plate tectonics \\"just happened\\" to develop, the atmosphere \\"just happened\\" to be just the right composition, the moon \\"just happened\\" to be just the right size, and so on. There are actually currently 118 factors that have to be fine tuned - some cannot vary by more than one part in 10^37 - in order for life to exist at all. As scientists, one would think the authors could see that they should take all those factors into consideration, and then they might come to the realization that the likelihood of all those factors coming together at just the right places and times by chance alone is absolutely zero. However, maybe they don't like the implications. As other people have already pointed out, Hugh Ross has been making this point for years in his books \\"The Creator and the Cosmos\\" and \\"The Genesis Question.\\" Maybe now that secular scientists have finally realized what Christian scientists have been saying for a long time, people will listen.Other than that, there is some great information in this book. The chapters on habitable zones, plate tectonics, and the importance of the moon and Jupiter to life are fantastic, and contain a lot of good information written in a way that a non scientist can understand.

You need the right kind of sun, and big gaseous outer planets to vacuum up debris, a moon to provide a shield, and water. This is an old argument. But here it has become a religious argument. Once the rise of complex life becomes exceedingly improbable, special creation becomes more probable. That is the point that they are driving home, even if it is not said explicitly. People want to read that &quot;chance&quot; could not have created life, and this book offers a warm and fuzzy feeling to those people. Surely the authors would have realized that their book would have this effect. They've put humans back in the center of the universe. Once again, there we are. The only blessed planet.

Rare Earth is fast paced, non boring and a page burner. I read it in 2 days. The reader wants to learn more. Very little math. The Drake equation is shown giving us an approximation of intelligent civilizations. Later the Rare Earth equation is shown with a very different approximation of intelligent civilizations. Much rarer.The authors show us other planets having microscopic life maybe common. Also why advanced animals on other planets maybe rare.We learn why its so difficult for a planet to support advanced animals. First a sun about the size of our sun rich in metals must be positioned away from too much activity in galactic centers, no binary or more star systems, away from black holes, pulsars, stars that could supernova blasting the planet with deadly gamma and x rays. Then why a planet must be in a habitable zone and not tidal locked around a star. Then why having a large moon like our moon is so important and why Plate Tectonics is needed for a magnetic field to protect the planet from outside lethal energy rays and to have vulcanism to release greenhouse gases and to have continental drift. Also why the planet may have near extinction events caused by comet and asteroid impacts. Also the role green houses gases play in keeping the planet warm and the balancing act of only having enough greenhouse gases and not too much to keep the planet in a temperature range for animals to live. Also it is shown the billions of years needed for a stable sun for evolution to occur.

By simple life, they mean something along the lines of bacteria or archaeans. However, complex life - such as animals - might be comparatively rare. (They don't discuss plants at any length.) The conditions necessary for the evolution of animals might be so unusual, that our own solar system could be the only one where such creatures have emerged. If so, that would make intelligent life even less likely. Perhaps humans really are alone in the universe.The authors discuss the unusual make-up of our solar system at some length: the sun isn't an average star, the presence of Jupiter tends to shield Earth from approaching comets, our unique moon has an important geological impact on conditions at Earth, plate tectonics are driven by very exotic mechanism, etc. Thus, complex life has evolved due to a long series of highly unlikely circumstances. If the preconditions for animals and thus humans are the results of pure chance, then perhaps it only happened once. Fermi's paradox has been solved: the reason why no aliens have ever visited our planet, is that the aliens don't exist!For rather obvious reasons, it's very difficult to prove or disprove the Rare Earth hypothesis at present. It remains a minority position within the scientific community. Personally, I also suspect that Ward and Brownlee are wrong, but I admit that my reasons for thinking so are largely philosophical. And no, I won't kill myself if somehow it turns out that the authors are right. I mean, who wants to be fried by the big UFOs in \\"Independence Day\\"?Still, it's interesting to speculate about why the Rare Earth hypothesis is so...well, rare. It's almost an article of faith in our culture that aliens simply *must* exist. Why? I don't think it's because the existence of other civilizations in other star systems would make us more humble and less Earth-centred. Please come on, our civilization is *not* humble, a few symbolic paeans to Copernicus and Freud notwithstanding.Paradoxically, I think it's a special kind of scientific thinking that fuels the pseudo-scientific alien-mania. If we can find an advanced race travelling the Galaxy in space ships, that would prove that science, high tech and AI actually works. Also, what better argument for funding the space programs than the chase for aliens? Perhaps atheists also need aliens to give the empty materialist universe some semblance of meaning? If you can find meaning in a non-existent sulphur-based life form at Beta Orionis, you have my sympathy. I can't. I like crows and geese, though.Incidentally, you might want to know that the book Amazon has paired \\"Rare Earth\\" with, \\"The Privileged Planet\\", is a creationist work. The creationists, of course, claim that all the facts enumerated by Ward and Brownlee can't be a co-incidence. It must be God who is behind it all! (God doesn't like sulphur-based life forms on Rigel. He's more into beetles!)\\"Rare Earth\\" is relatively easy to read, contains many interesting facts and interpretations, and gives you something to think about on a spring evening. I mean, what if we actually *are* alone...in the entire universe? The thought is staggering. I also find the theory expounded in this work hard to swallow, but it should be read with an open mind."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I call this an alternate view because it has become somewhat accepted to assume that the universe must be teeming with life. Obviously, the hypothesis forwarded by these authors is that complex life is relatively rare in the universe. Most of this idea is developed by looking at the history of the planet Earth and its neighbors in the solar system and how or why life did or didn't develop on these planets. In the end, the claim is that life on Earth is the result of a number of very rare coincidences that might not be very common across the universe. This is similar to one of Peter Ward's other books in that a very interesting and thought provoking history of the planet is covered. Readers will undoubtedly find something they hadn't heard or thought about. On the other hand, unlike some of Ward's other books, this one doesn't have a lot of personal anecdotes or stories about trips to interesting locales.

For example, if each Milky Way-like galaxy harbors only, say, ten civilizations at a given time, then (crunching the numbers) in all of the universe there may be only ONE case in which there are inhabited worlds as close together as the sun is to Alpha Centauri - More typically sentient &quot;neighbors&quot; would be tens of thousands of light years apart, and in some galaxies there might be but a single sentience, or none. It's truly sobering to realize how alone we may be.I was also surprised that Enrico Fermi was not listed in the index. His famous question &quot;Then, where are they?&quot; (and the implied answer: &quot;Not here, anyway&quot;) is, to me, as compelling a piece of evidence for the rarity of sentience, as all of the geological and biological arguments that are (convincingly!) marshalled by Ward and Brownlee.I was happy to see that the authors dedicated their book to Carl Sagan, one of my personal heroes. Sagan's enthusiastic curiosity about the possibility of life beyond earth was tempered by a scientist's ability to accept new, unpleasant facts (unlike those silly Creationists). I'm sure he would have appreciated &quot;Rare Earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This will not be a popular book. There has long been a sort of enforced silence masking the divide between cosmologists and biologists concerning the existence of intelligent life in the universe. Because Sagan was such a terrific spokesman and had vast media support his arguments have, until recently, carried the day. The fact that little green men are so much more interesting than bacteria may also have something to do with it. Perhaps the most notable achievement of this book is the clear elucidation of complex scientific themes for the layman and the wealth of information provided.The divide between the two groups is now apparent. Biologists have long cautioned against using sheer numbers of possible worlds as a predictor of other civilizations. The old numbers game - there are 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and at least 100 billion could have Earth-like planets and...well, there just HAS to be intelligence by the law of averages. That is not science but conjecture.Another interesting phenomenon is the increasing number of former true believers who have examined the evidence and concluded that they were viewing the galaxy throught rose-colored telescopes. The shift of opinion, by the way, is all one way. I am one of those who sadly concluded that the intelligence and particularly consciousness may be a singular event. (Roger Penrose addresses the uniqueness of consciousness in SHADOWS OF THE MIND - highly recommended.) Earth, as the author points out, is a unique place with all the conditions required for the evolution of life until consciousness appears. Saying that statement is NOT a call for creationism or ID but a summation of current scientific thought. We must remember a paradox - sentient life evolved only because of numerous mass extinctions that created new blank slates upon which life reformatted itself. This is rarely mentioned - as if the path from microbe to consciousness was one long uninterrupted line of continual evolution. If anything, this book will cause people to look past the marketing of SETI and explore the entire situation differently."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"After reading some of the other reviews I've noticed some problems in peoples' perceptions. Some feel that the book is too narrow without looking at other possibilities while others see it as a boon for creationalist. The thesis of the book, I feel, isn't really that there is only one way for life to evolve and therefore all planets must duplicate ours. Rather the thesis is that planets are extremely unstable environments and in order for long stretches of time for evolution to take place certain factors must be involved to provide some stability. Thus, they bring in factors against stability such as meteors, radiation, fluctuations in planetary tilt, comets, distance from the sun, age of the sun, and a host of other problems. Our own earth has experienced a great deal of catastrophes itself and it is safe to assume from looking at the other planets in our system that this is a rule in the universe. Could intelligent life evolve in some other way? Perhaps, but you have to have the stability to find the time. Wonderful book. It pretty much ruined science fiction for me."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The authors set out to explain that, while simple life may be abundant in the Universe, complex life -plants, animals- require so many &quot;coincidences&quot; that we may very well be unique out there. This is a very interesting book in the sense that it shows how knowledge from many different scientific disciplines can be brought together and can be used to theorize about such a complicated subject. Even though there is still much more we don't know about this subject than we do know about it, the authors, rather convincingly, argue their case. The only weaker point in the book is that the authors very much focus on &quot;intelligent&quot; life as we know it on earth, and restrict their search for life to earth-like conditions. It would have been interesting to read their views on the possibility of totally different life forms (based on completely different chemistry and able to develop in totally different conditions)."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"As a non-scientist, I found *Rare Earth* fascinating. I will leave it to scientists to debate the hypothesis, but I do have a minor quibble. The authors state: \\"During the Middle Ages, Earth was not only regarded as the center of the Universe but again was believed to be flat. St. Thomas Aquinas made Earth a sphere again but codified its place as the center of the Universe.\\" Ward and Browlee probably learned this myth in grade school and since then never questioned it.The truth is that in the Middle Ages all educated people (including Aquinas, of course) knew that Earth is a sphere. For example, the geography of Dante's *Divine Comedy* clearly assumes we are living on a globe. Also it should be noted that being at the center did not imply privilege. Satan was frozen at the very center of Dante's universe whereas the poet had to travel to the outer spheres of the heavens for the Beatific Vision of God.

Ihrenes 2006."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This book, which describes the development of intelligent life on Earth, is popular and well-written, with plenty of interesting references. And it attempts to defend a controversial thesis, namely that while life may be prevalent in the Universe, intelligent life is rare.The claim that life itself is at least as common as many others suspect is based on the ability of many \\"extremophiles\\" (some of which may resemble the initial forms of life on Earth) to subsist well outside what many observers would previously have called a \\"habitable environment.\\" The authors also note the fact that unicellular life on Earth appears to have arisen fairly quickly.The claim that intelligent life is rare is based on the fact that multicellular animal life appears to require a large number of potentially difficult steps to evolve, and in fact took a relatively long time to develop on Earth. The authors argue that many aspects of the Earth's nature and history are relatively rare, and that these aspects significantly increased the chance that intelligent life would develop as fast as it did. In addition, the authors point out that the development of intelligent life requires being lucky at several key points. For example, intelligent life on Earth required an oxygen-rich atmosphere. This was provided by early unicellular life. But the production of oxygen wrecked much of the \\"greenhouse effect\\" that had made the Earth's surface relatively warm. The cooling of the Earth that resulted probably did not slow down the further evolution of life, if anything, the authors suspect that it speeded it up. But on other planets, such a reduction of temperature would have been more likely to destroy life than enhance it.This is a very readable and interesting book, and I certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I both hate &amp; love this book. I think it is a must read. Like all reviewers here, I am one of those who hopes that it's a \\"Star Trek\\" universe out there but unlike other reviewers on this board, I do not think that this book will get outdated anytime soon.This book without trying, seems to partially reconcile the \`Creation' &amp; \`Evolution' hypothesis. It does this by sticking to the \`Evolution' script but listing powerful arguments as to why \`Life' as we know it may be unique or at least rare. In the face of mounting evidence, perhaps the church could support this hypothesis without losing legitimacy.The hypothesis is not built on one single argument &amp; therein lies its strength. The book starts by making a clear distinction between microbial &amp; animal life and concedes quickly that the former may be quite common around the universe. Animal life on the other hand, requires a fortuitous alignment of the stars and planets :)The first concept explored in this regard is that of a \`Habitable Zone'(HZ). Off the 3 types of galaxies, only large spiral galaxies are likely to host life. The other two types are either too dense (globular galaxies) or too old (elliptical galaxies &amp; small clusters), lacking the heavy elements necessary to sustain habitable conditions. The former is a problem of overcrowding, too much sun (literally), gravity, harmful radiation &amp; frequent cataclysmic events (supernovae, black holes etc.). The latter would mean a world without a heated core, mostly composed of hydrogen &amp; helium. Think of the Sun &amp; Jupiter, what are the odds of life in these two places.After eliminating all but spiral galaxies, the hypothesis also does the same to systems within spiral galaxies. Too close to the core and you have the same problems faced within globular galaxies, too far &amp; you have the environment similar to an elliptical galaxy, i.e., too few heavy metals. That leaves only the arms of spiral galaxies as likely habitats for complex life.Within the HZ of galaxies, planets also have to be formed within the HZ of their star. Too close &amp; they're toast (all water evaporates and escapes into space), too far and they are too cold to sustain anything but microbial life. Additionally it requires a star with certain properties, a certain size (only 5% of stars are the required size, most stars in the universe unlike our Sun are too small) and a high percentage of heavy metals (again a rare combination).Finally, the roles played by the Moon &amp; Jupiter in supporting life on earth. The Moon stabilizes the rotation of the Earth. Imagine a basketball rolling on a floor rotating in varying directions as opposed to a top, rotating on a fixed axis. Without the Moon, the poles &amp; equator would be constantly shifting. Our planet would be covered by water, temperatures &amp; seasons would be unpredictable. Without Jupiter (because of its size &amp; gravitational pull) attracting and capturing most celestial objects on a collision course with Earth, there would be many more large bodies crashing on earth and threatening life. You know what happened the last time this happened, ask Mr. T-Rex.Even assuming all these factors are duplicated, there is the additional factor of a time period. This ranges from the time the solar system has cooled down &amp; the planets settled into stable orbits to the end when the star runs out of fuel &amp; dies. Complex life has this time span to evolve, live &amp; likely perish.The Rare Earth hypothesis is exactly that, it is not a law. Ward &amp; Brownlee make a strong case, one whose implications I don't like but are nevertheless persuasive. If you are students of science, the origin and future of mankind, I would strongly recommend you read this book."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I grew up in the Saganesque world of Star Trek, where every star had planets with at least one in a habitable zone and therefore a virtual certainty of developing complex life. The only question was how long intelligent life could last.That view has been fading for some time: it turns out we need Jupiter to keep the comets and asteroids away, we need a large moon to stabilize our rotation, and we need plate tectonics to engender variety.The new view is explained in detail in this excellent book, which covers the myriad areas in which the earth is special, and needs to be special, in order to provide a habitat for complex life. It is a carefully reasoned view, and, even if you don't agree with the conclusion, the book provides a clear, thorough layman's overview of the origin and development of life on earth. It's debatable whether the twists and turns of that development are necessary for complex life to evolve, but the evidence suggests that we've been fortunate.I would like the conclusion to be wrong, and in fact the authors point out that they've made one big assumption: that life elsewhere will be a lot like life here. If that's not the case, then perhaps all bets are off. But I'm afraid that's not the way it looks."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This volume is a wonderful compendium of information on earth history, covering most of the pertinent literature in basic geology, basic paleontology and basic astronomy in a readable, understandable fashion. It would be an especially good book for the interested nonprofessional to learn about these subjects or for a high school teacher wishing to teach earth history/geology without boring the student. The book is however slightly too derivative and therefore somewhat frustrating for anyone who has any kind of college background in these fields. What is new here and of interest to any reader is the use of the &quot;known,&quot; life on earth, to predict the liklihood of the &quot;unknown,&quot; life in the galaxy and the universe. After reading Sagan's &quot;Cosmos&quot; in the '70s with interest and enthusiasm and following the SETI investigation over the interum, I found the appearance of an opposing view refreshing and long overdue. It certainly provided a nice counterbalance to the almost overly optimistic notion that the universe is teaming with life--by which most of us mean intelligent life. Sagan and others who first proposed the abundance of life in the universe did so on the basis of guess-timate statistics that did not have the advantage of the more recent information on extremophiles or on existance of other planets. This book provides an overview of this new information and its impact on our ideas about life throughout the universe."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"In Rare Earth, Ward and Brownlee assert that complex life is uncommon in the universe and even offer the possibility that only the Earth harbors complex life. They rely on an interpretation of the history of life on Earth, geology, and astrophysics that supports their view. The authors' assertive style of presentation from start to finish has a hint of preordained certainty that might leave some readers with the impression that strong counter arguments and evidence do not exist, but indeed they do.There are many problems with the facts presented and their interpretation. Here are just a few examples: Ward and Brownlee start with a list of so-called \\"dead zones of the universe\\". Five of the first six entries (there are nine in all) cite the \\"problem\\" of metalicity. For example, the stars in globular clusters \\"are too metal poor to have inner planets as large as Earth.\\" And, the stars comprising elliptical galaxies are \\"too metal poor\\" as well. Low metalicity, they claim, also makes for a dead zone spanning the early universe, globular clusters, elliptical galaxies, small galaxies and the edges of galaxies. This seems to severely limit the number of exoEarths, and the possibility for complex life to form. However, recent studies show that metalicity is not a deal breaker. For example, Lars Buchhave (U. of Copenhagen) and others published in Nature 486, 375-377 (21 June 2012) the results of work that show that the formation of Earth-size planets does not require high metal content in their parent stars. Therefore, it seems that Ward and Brownlee must shorten their list of dead zones by five.Astronomers have found dozens of candidate exoEarths, and the search goes on. The Kepler mission has been extended through 2016. Here is an example of a \\"hiding place\\" for more exoEarths. Many of the Neptune-size and larger planets found by Kepler have orbits close to their parent stars. Some may be in the habitable zone. In addition, some of these might have satellites that are exoEarth candidates. Even if such a satellite were tidally locked to its giant planet, it would still experience day and night cycles, albeit somewhat longer than ours. (It would never be completely dark ... Try to figure out why this would be true.) Tides, climate, weather, and tectonics would produce plenty of change, challenge and opportunity for life and its evolution.The authors insist that the Moon, more specifically the tides produce by it, greatly enhance the prospects for complex life. Therefore, they say we need a moon like ours, just as big and just as close...in other words... just right. However, they ignore the fact that if the Earth had no moon, there would still be tides. The sun is responsible for roughly 30% of our tidal variation. And depending on coastal geography there would still be significant variations, with some relatively high tides in places. There would be more than enough tidal effects for the development and evolution of life, IF such effects are necessary.The authors assert that Jupiter acts as an absorber or deflector of most bombardments of the Earth. However, the presence of Jupiter is not as special as they claim. Remember that the Kepler project and other observations have found giant planets everywhere. It is reasonable to conclude that anywhere there is an exoEarth there is also at least one giant planet in the same system, serving the same guardian function.The authors go on to claim that the putative Cambrian explosion of diverse and complex life (or whatever caused it), as well as plate tectonics, mass extinctions, and other events in Earth's history are rare and possibly unique in the cosmos, but necessary for complex life. Such claims reveal less about why the Earth has complex life and more about the state of our knowledge at the time they wrote this book.I do recommend this book to readers who are reasonably current in the material it presents, because they will see the weak points in the authors' arguments and perhaps contribute to counter arguments. Ultimately it will serve as a case study of the pitfalls of basing assertions and a major conclusion upon incomplete and ongoing science.I am reminded of a thought by Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow): \\"Declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true.\\""},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book.

Perhaps man's existence has a greater purpose (and responsibility) in this universe and on this planet.I emailed Dr. Brownlee the following:\\"(1) You rule out life for much of the universe by saying: unless a planet of a specific size range orbits (at the proper \\"zone of life\\" distance) a single (as apposed to dual or multiple) star of a certain range of magnitude (so as not to have too short a life or on the flip side to be too hot) in a solar system that has no aberrant \\"Jupiter\\" type planets (that are not in elliptical orbits - but stable orbits), and that the solar system of this planet has a low number of large asteroids and comets when life emerges, and that the solar system is positioned in a low density location (to avoid cataclysmic black holes and supernova explosions) of a spiral (and not elliptical) galaxy (so as not to be too old for heavy element and star formation), that multicellular animal life is otherwise most improbable; (2) you seem to admit that Earth, for a very short period of its life, had the right atmospheric mixture of gases (which would not have existed without an unusually large moon [that you call \\"rare\\"] and without heavy radioactive elements on earth which you say are responsible for plate tectonics, thermal vents, volcanic activity and oxygen/co2 production); (3) you describe a Cambrian explosion 550 million years ago of a few million years in duration in which all the historical body plans of animals that have ever existed on Earth \\"sprang\\" into being (a fraction of which exist today) and that no new body plans were generated since that period; (4) you list a host of countless other variables involving DNA, RNA and multicellular development with mathematical odds and explanations that would make Dr. Michael Behe smile.\\"Well I received a response that indicated that the authors were not willing to admit design, but rather were leaving any conclusion about the rarity of the Earth to the reader."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is one side of a fascinating debate, between astrobiologists and xenobiologists.

In a contrasting book, &quot;What Would A Martian Look Like?&quot;, one looks at the question of just how large is the solution space for life, or how many ways might life get going and develop.

I got the feeling that the authors were glossing over some science a little too quickly. Also, I didn't see how they could be so conversant on DNA... as astrophysists or geologists.On a plus side, there are many great references to other books, magazine articles and respected journals.The basic gist of the book is: once you get past the almost impossible odds of duplicating another Earth, there are the incredible odds of making RNA (or DNA which is even more complicated), and duplicating the environmental conditions that allow multi-cellular beings.We can demonstrate making amino acids, but we have no idea how nature made RNA or DNA.So this, and other deductions, leads to their conclusion that higher forms of life (&quot;ET&quot;) is very unlikely on other planets.Again, this is a great read.John Dunbar"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth is an overview of the complexities of, what we consider, life.

The problem I have with this book is that the authors didn't just make assertions, they made assertions as if they were fact. These types of assertions are irresponsible for any scientists to make, muchless ones who wish to be regarded as experts in their field. Why do I say they were irresponsible? Here we are just a few years after the book was written and we have disproven many of the blatent assumptions that the authors used to provide leverage to their flimsy assertions. We now know that the Goldilocks zone is quite a bit larger than was believed before, we know that life can thrive in far more hostile and extreme conditions than was believed before (extremophiles), we know there are many, many more planets circling distant stars than was known before. I could keep going but the point is that the authors jumped to conclusions based on very little information, which is fine accept that they tried to build a convincing and \\"factual\\" sounding argument as to why their assertions were correct.However, if you, like me, are interested in being knowledgeable about astrobiology and the prospects of life elsewhere in the universe, then you probably ought to read this book.

Unfortunately, it fails to provide convincing evidence for this view, is often marked by sloppy writing, and in places borders on being wrong.As an example of the latter, the authors seem to imply that the Sun has little or no interaction with the Galaxy's spiral arms and that the inter-arm regions of a spiral galaxy have a lower stellar density than inside the spiral arms. Neither is correct. It is true that the Sun is not now located in a spiral arm. However, the Sun orbits the Galactic center, taking about 250 million years to do so. The Galaxy's spiral arms do not rotate with the stars. The Sun therefore probably passes through at least one spiral arm every orbit. Over its lifetime the Sun has made approximately 20 orbits, plenty of time to pass through multiple spiral arms. Indeed the authors seem to be unaware of a proposal that massive extinctions in the Earth's past were caused by passage of the Sun through a spiral arm.In many places the presentation also seems muddled. If we are told that Jupiter is more than 300 times the mass of the Earth (p. 235), do we really need to be told less than three pages later that Jupiter's mass is 318 Earth masses (p. 238)?While reading it, I kept finding myself saying, That's not right, or, But what about ....?

They bring up many considerations of habitability that one often doesn't think of (for example, the presence of a large moon, of Jupiter, of plate tectonics, and also the metal content of the Sun compared to other stars). Of course, I think we know too little about other solar systems to be able to say whether or not these factors are truly rare (even the book at times acknowledges this), so it is premature to draw any firm conclusions about whether there are other habitable planets. But I do think that, if we wish to do an honest assessment of whether extraterrestrial life (or for that matter, another habitable planet) is likely to exist, we need to at least ask these questions. It is very interesting to read about the factors making Earth habitable, whether or not you agree with the conclusion.Although this is a scientific (not a theological) book, I will also mention that I am a believing Catholic. So I believe that it is up to God whether Earth is the only inhabited world, or whether there are others (to my knowledge, the Church takes no official position on extraterrestrials). I believe that it is providential that the conditions on Earth are so favorable for life, and that the same would be true of other habitable planets (if they exist).I am inclined to support searches for other habitable planets, provided such searches are conducted as a legitimate scientific inquiry and search for the truth, and not for some other hidden agenda. But again, if the conclusions of this book are correct, it is likely that such planets would be rare (if they even exist) in the Universe, and thus, at best, hard to find.I recommend this book for helping to understand the factors that make a habitable planet, and also one can learn a lot of astronomy, biology, and geology in the process."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"This is a fascinating topic and the authors did a good job of explaining their thesis.

But the evidence cited consists largely of a highly selective smattering of theoretical speculations that are superficially understood and over-interpreted. And some facts are even downright wrong (The human genome has less than 100,000 genes, not &quot;millions&quot;).

Then it goes on to explain, in convincing fashion, why &quot;maybe not&quot; may very well be the truth.I found the book to be very readable, even though there were a few obvious scientific mistakes (and in the introduction, the authors would have us believe that Copernicus was Danish, not Polish) but all in all, I think that I came away with a far better understanding of geophysics, the way the Earth was formed and the way plate tectonics works.There were many times I found myself reading an assertion and then thinking, &quot;well, maybe... we don't have enough evidence for such-and-such yet to know one way or the other.&quot; However, the book does make one extremely timely and, in my opinion, urgent point-- if there are planets out there with life on them, we need to start developing the tools with which to find them. Not to knock the efforts of SETI, but I think that we'd probably do a better job of finding life out there if we were to put extremely large telescopes into our orbit and start looking for Earthlike planets and, if we find some, look for the chemical signatures of life on these planets. We cannot start out from the assumption that there is intelligent life on other worlds and that these intelligent beings must have mastered the concept of communication via electromagnetic waves. I think it behooves us to first find out if any life exists anywhere else, then from there, we can better extrapolate how likely it is that life eventually becomes complex and intelligent in time.I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of our solar system, astronomy, geology and evolution.

So I welcome the publication of &quot;Rare Earth,&quot; which cites much of the same reasoning that I have used and adds a good deal more. The problem with the Drake Equation advocates' position, which posits that intelligent life is common in our galaxy and others, is that it is based on a purely but faulty statistical argument. They say that because there are so many millions of billions of stars, that therefore there must be a great many cases of intelligent life. Frank Drake and Carl Sagan then tried to concoct a formula that would estimate their hypothetical position. The Drake Equation, however, is simplistic and overly optimistic, ignoring the sequence of rare phenomena that led to the evolution of intelligent life here. &quot;Rare Earth&quot; substantively challenges the Drake-Sagan assumptions."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee have written a very thought-provoking book in \\"Rare Earth.\\" They have, in fact, given voice to some thoughts that had occurred to me and to a lot of others quite some time ago - namely \\"Where is everybody?\\" Flying saucer enthusiasts and alien abduction aficionados aside, most of us who think about such things have wondered why no alien civilization's radio transmissions have not obviously reached planet earth by now if alien civilizations were so common. Also we are starting to wonder where life exists in our solar system outside of Earth.When I was in my teens I eagerly kept track of every launch of a spacecraft. I dreamed of even becoming an astronomer specializing in planetary geology. But my true love was biology and the thought of a possible alien biological system was fascinating. I was soon disillusioned. First the veil of Venus was lifted and where swamps and dinosaur-like creatures roamed in science fiction was a barren acid and heat scorched version of Dante's Inferno. Mars was also found to be a volcanic version of the earth's moon, except with weather (dust storms mostly), pole caps of carbon dioxide and water ice, and a very thin atmosphere. The temperature of close to 100 degrees F. below zero did not seem promising and still does not. Thus the civilizations of Mars envisioned by Lowell disappeared into the Martian dust (as they had started to even before the first space probes). Then the moons Titan (Saturn) and Europa (Jupiter) were proposed as abodes of life, however weird, and a Martian meteorite with strange \\"nano-bacteria\\" was brought out. The latter \\"nano-bacteria\\" have become dubious at best and the moons are looking less promising by the day. Titan may have such a smoggy atmosphere and be so cold as to be certainly questionable as an abode for life. In addition to this, recent reports indicate that Europa is covered with a layer of concentrated sulfuric acid (possibly from the neighboring moon Io, which has sulfur volcanoes on its surface) and hydrogen peroxide- not exactly a good place for living things! To top it off some scientists think that the ice on Europa may actually cover a sea of sulfuric acid with a pH close to 0!If we cannot find even \\"primitive\\" to relatively \\"primitive\\" living things (bacteria, lichens, fungi) on other planets in our system we may have to face the fact that life, while it may exist on numerous planets, is not nearly as common and as accessible as some would have it and that \\"civilizations\\" are even less common.Why is this? Ward and Brownlee have provided detailed answers, which, even if their formulae are somewhat flawed (as one reviewer suggested), are persuasive. We have to keep in mind that we do not know how long civilizations last or how often they occur but do not develop our type of technology. We are up against billion of years of time and trillions of cubic light years of space. Star Trek aside, we are not even sure that interstellar travel will ever be possible, so we may never know for sure what is out there.As Ward and Brownlee point out, to even have a planet with the possibility of life we have to have several conditions met. First planets revolving around multiple stars probably do not last long because of tidal effects and if they do life might have to cope with radical changes in surface temperature. Given that, we still have a number of candidate stars and have even found a number of such stars with planets (most of which are huge, some even by Jupiter standards). We also need planets within a star's habitable zone (assuming the star is not unstable and lasts long enough for the development of life). Then contingency has to allow for the development of living forms sometime during the life of the planet. To get more complex life than bacteria we need several billion years and perhaps a large moon. It gets even dicier if we want intelligent life, and even then we may have intelligent ocean-dwelling creatures who never develop radio and thus may not be detectable. Even if radio waves are produced by a civilization, we need to exist ourselves within that civilization's survival time frame (or actually light years later).Ward and Brownlee have provided, I think, some very good reasons why we are unlikely to find multicellular life on nearby planets or advanced technologies on planets even around distant stars. Even if life is fairly abundant in the universe (and I think it probably may be), planets with life (even at the bacterial level) may not be anywhere near as abundant as lifeless ones. This is not a reason to embrace creationism, as some would have it, but is simply a property of our universe. While I wish it were not so, I fear we cannot argue with the logic of this- especially with the little evidence we now possess. Of course one cannot completely rule out the possibility that Ward and Brownlee have missed something, but that is a present a meager hope.Read this book if you are interested in why complex life may be uncommon in the universe."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Chapter Two of this work: &quot;Habitable Zones of the Universe,&quot; was worth the price of the book just in itself.

What is the likelihood another world possesses all the factors needed to drive simple molecules along a track leading to a creature capable of thinking about communicating across vast stellar distances? In dealing with this question, Ward and Brownlee synthesized an immense amount of information, presenting it in a finely crafted style. In fact, the extraterrestrial aspects become relegated to short pieces at chapters' ends. Leaving no stone unturned, the authors deal with cosmology, physics, chemistry and, of course, biology, in easily absorbed prose. Given the wealth of information they needed to survey, no accolade can do sufficient justice to their presentation.Nearly twenty years ago, James Trefil and Robert Rood published &quot;Are We Alone?&quot;. From a list of then-known conditions needed to allow life to begin and evolve, the authors offered optimistic and pessimistic scenarios on whether alien civilizations were likely to exist. Ward and Brownlee have improved the resolution of this question, using the latest information. Sadly, but almost certainly correctly, the come down strongly on the pessimistic side.Paleontology has come far since Are We Alone? was published. Ward and Brownlee's account surveys utilizes the wealth of recent information derived from research studies done during the past few years. With life beginning over 3 thousand million years ago, their task is formidable. Yet they carry us through the stages life without bogging down in pedantic expression. They show how misleading simple pictures of life's progress can be, showing how even &quot;simple&quot; creatures are astonishingly complex.The studies and researchers they discuss offer a wealth of new information, including a few acute surprises. Evolution is fraught with disaster scenarios. Ward and Brownlee offer a good discussion of these, particularly the great Permian dying. Diversity loss from this extinction was severe. Was it the result of a reduction in available DNA patterns due to the loss of species? This is a new question for which the authors call for further research in its response.The most innovative chapter in the book deals with the impact of plate tectonics on evolution. More than simply the drifting of continental land masses, the authors describe how severely mobile continents impact ocean currents, air masses and climate generally. Little considered by paleontologists except as a dating and location device, Ward and Brownlee make continental drift a major factor in evolution. Since no other planet in the solar system exhibits tectonic activity, what is the likelihood this phenomenon occurs on planets circling distant stars? No tectonics, no stimulus to higher life forms and interplanetary communication.In short, this book covers an immense amount of territory in explaining how life starts and likely continues under the proper conditions. They present nicely balanced explanations and critiques of recent research findings. Even outlandish ideas are given a patient hearing. As they remind us, who would have thought life could dwell at the bottom of the ocean's depths? It's well worth investing in this view of life's history. While posing many questions, the authors show how innovative thinking may someday provide answers . Anyone considering entering a scientific field will discover countless areas of investigation. This book should find a place on your shelves for current knowledge and future reference. Perhaps you might gain a place in a revised edition."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"_Rare Earth_ by Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee is an excellent, thorough, and thought provoking work analyzing the possibility of life on other worlds. Ward, a noted paleontologist, and Brownlee, an astronomer, sought to challenge the widespread notion that complex, even intelligent, life is common in the universe. This bias towards believing in intelligent life elsewhere is partly thanks to wishful thinking (aided by works of science fiction) and partly from the famous Drake Equation put forth by astronomers Frank Drake and Carl Sagan. This equation, one designed to estimate the number of advanced civilizations present in our galaxy, was based on educated guesses on how many planets there were in our galaxy, how many of those might harbor life, and of those what percentage advanced to become homes of civilized life forms. Using the best estimates at the time, Drake and Sagan in 1974 postulated that a million civilizations may exist in the Milky Way galaxy alone, and as our galaxy is but one of hundreds of millions of galaxies, according to them the number of intelligent alien species must be staggering.Ward and Brownlee did not think that credible, and put forth an alternative theory, the Rare Earth Hypothesis, using information gathered over the years in paleontology, geology, climatology, and astronomy. In a nutshell, they believe that microbial life is very common in the universe, perhaps more common than even Drake and Sagan anticipated, while complex life - animals and higher plants - is quite rare.As evidence exists that life first appeared on Earth 3.8 billion years ago, almost simultaneously with the end of heavy bombardment from outer space and the lowering of surface temperatures below the boiling point of water, it is possible that life could form very early on a planet, that it can and quite possibly will evolve on any planet if conditions are at least just barely tolerable. Additionally, with evidence that on Earth there are microbes that can survive temperatures above boiling water, as much as 169 degrees Celsius (and maybe up to 200), deep in the Earth's crust or in hydrothermal deep sea vents (as well as life found living in sea ice and snow), it would appear that microorganisms have very wide tolerances for a range of planetary conditions. Given that many believe life may have first evolved deep underground or deep beneath the sea, the authors feel that microorganisms may be quite common, perhaps even present elsewhere in our own solar system.Conversely, the conditions that allow animal and advanced plant life to develop (the authors largely concentrate on animals) are \\"rare if not unique,\\" Earth being a \\"bastion of animals amid a sea of microbe-infested worlds.\\" Ward and Brownlee have composed a long list of \\"low-probability\\" events or conditions that are necessary for the formation of animal life.I had long been familiar with the concept that Earth was lucky to be at just the right distance from its star, in the habitable zone, a region where heat from the sun provides a planetary surface temperature at which water neither freezes nor boils (the authors later narrow this concept to the animal habitable zone, the range of distances where not only is it possible for an Earth-like planet to have liquid surface water but also to maintain average global temperatures of less than 50 degree Celsius, as that is believed the upper limit at which animal life can exist). What was new to me was the concept of the galactic habitable zone, the notion being that complex life can only develop (and survive) on a planet in the right neighborhood of the galaxy basically, and indeed the right type of galaxy period. Earth-life as we know it could not arise at all if the sun was in a globular cluster, an elliptical galaxy, or a small galaxy, as most if not all stars in these formations are too metal-poor and often are too hot for life on inner planets. In systems low in metals (elements other than hydrogen and helium), there would not be enough solid matter to form a planet the size of Earth and even if one formed it would lack the metals needed to produce either magnetic fields or the internal heat sources to drive plate tectonics.Even in suitable galaxies an Earth-like planet could not exist in its center, as that is a region with many energetic processes that could eliminate life altogether; the high density of stars in the center make the danger of supernovae significant (our sun and planet are protected simply by the relative scarcity of stars around us). Other stellar members, such as neutron stars called magnetars, are considerably more common in the center (which can emit vast amounts of lethal X-rays and gamma rays). Nor could Earth exist at the galactic edge, as that region is too metal poor.The authors argued that plate tectonics is vital to the development of animal life for a variety of reasons. It promotes high levels of biodiversity, a major defense against mass extinctions; it provides the planet with a global thermostat by recycling chemicals essential in keeping the volume of carbon dioxide relatively uniform (and thus enabling liquid water to remain on a planet's surface); it creates the continents (not only vital for biodiversity purposes but also in terms of weathering and as source of marine nutrients); and it provides a magnetic field, a defense against lethal cosmic radiation and the loss of an atmosphere.There are a number of other factors that the authors look at; among them the importance of the Moon (extremely vital but perhaps a very rare thing for one of that size to exist around a terrestrial planet), the importance of a stable Jupiter at the right distance from Earth, and several perhaps unique events in Earth's history, such as Snowball Earth episodes and the Cambrian Explosion, vital events in the evolution of life that might be very unlikely to occur on an alien planet."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"When human beings begin exploring planetary systems around other stars, will they find only barren worlds where life never had a chance to evolve? Or will they planets teeming with the equivalents of grass, trees, fish, birds, repiles, and mammals? According to Peter Ward and Donald Brownlee, the answer is neither. Such is their provocative and seemingly paradoxical Rare Earth Hypothesis as spelled out in their new book &quot;Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe&quot; -- that simple microbial life is common throughout the universe, but that complex animal life is not.The existence of life on other planets has been debated, sometimes hotly, by scientists, philosophers, and others. Ward and Brownlee break new ground in this debate by emphasizing the difference between microbial and complex multicellular life. The classic picture of the development of complex life is that -- somehow -- life arises from the chemical properties of certain molecules, andonce life gains a foothold evolutionary processes guide it towards higher and higher levels of complexity, culminating in the rich plant and animal life evident in earth today. What the Rare Earth Hypothesis argues is that the first step is fairly easy, hence life has probably arisen many times in many different places in the universe, but that the second step depends upon many special properties and lucky accidents that happened on earth and are very unlikely to happen elsewhere. Consider: life on earth arose some 3.8 billion years ago shortly after its surface cooled following the heavy bombardment of asteroids. By contrast, complex plant and animal life appeared less than 600 million years ago -- and human intelligence only 3 million years ago!What makes the Rare Earth Hypothesis so extraordinary is that it draws a new distinction in the debate about extraterrestrial life, a nuance that neither side in the debate will welcome. What makes &quot;Rare Earth&quot; an extraordinary book is the way it presents the Rare Earth Hypothesis, meticulously building the case by presenting one bit of evidence after another from many disparate branches of science. To study how life may form in other worlds, Ward and Brownlee survey relevant results from planetary science and the early history of earth and the solar system, geology, oceanography, and biology. Similarly, the unlikeliness of complex life follows from prevailing ideas in astronomy, paleontology, climatology, and statistics, in addition to geology, oceanography, and biology.To me, much of Rare Earth's appeal lies in its lucid exposition of ideas and facts from so many branches of science. Few books offer the opportunity to take as exciting a tour of the scientific landscape as &quot;Rare Earth&quot;. And the methodical presentation of the case for the Rare Earth Hypothesis brings a sense of excitement more common in a book of mystery than a book of science.&quot;Rare Earth&quot; does more than deal a blow to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; galaxy, one populated by dozens or hundreds of intelligent, mostly bipedal, species. It presents a clear, plausible scenario for the development of life on earth and other planets, and it explains why life on other planets is not likely to follow the same path towards complexity as it did on earth. It does all this by appealing to scientific results, and it does a good job of explaining the science involved. Moreover, since many of the results are new and some of them are of a speculative nature, &quot;Rare Earth&quot; takes the reader into the inner world of scientists, where ideas are first proposed and explored. We may not know whether the Rare Earth Hypothesis is true or false until humans finally do reach those alien planets orbiting other stars. Until then, whether you believe in the Rare Earth Hypothesis or not, if you are interested in the question of life in other planets, or if you are a general science enthusiast, do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"+++++This book, by Ward & Brownlee, considers if there are other extrasolar Earth-like planets (that is, Earth-like planets not of our sun). It is NOT saying that there are no extrasolar Earth-SIZE planets but only that extrasolar Earth-LIKE planets (that is, other planets that support carbon-based and DNA-based life as we know it) probably do not exist.In other words, this book (and the authors state this) is using PROVEN forms of life known to exist which is the carbon-based and DNA-based life found on one planet known to have life -- Earth.Also, this book is NOT saying that extrasolar planets that support life as we DO NOT know it (non-carbon based and non-DNA based life) do not exist. It's just that there is no hard evidence (but theoretically it's possible) for such life.This book has a number of good features:(1) REFERENCES. Over 25 pages that mainly consist of recent journal articles written by respected scientists.(2) SUMMARY INTRODUCTIONS. There are two, 2-page summary introductions. They are entitled \\"Dead Zones of the Universe\\" (nine zones where life as we know it is thought not to exist) and \\"Rare Earth Factors\\" (eighteen factors that may be unique to Earth and that thus collectively permit life as we know it). These summary introductions provide a roadmap for the first ten (of thirteen) chapters of this book.(3) THE FIRST TEN CHAPTERS. These chapters are very detailed and build-up (using both historical theories and data as well as recent new theories and data) the summary information mentioned in (2) above.(4) THE FINAL THREE CHAPTERS. These chapters are particularly interesting. Here we get more aquainted with Ward & Brownlee's Rare Earth Hypothesis (microbial life is common in the universe, but complex, multicellular life, such as human life, is rare) and introduced to the Rare Earth Equation. This hypothesis and equation are formulated from the information found in the first ten chapters mentioned in (3) above.Despite these good features, there is one obvious distraction with this book -- it contains some factual errors. Here are just four examples: (1) some of the terms of the famous Drake Equation (developed by the SETI Institute's Dr. Frank Drake in 1961) are not correctly defined (2) the number of stars in our Galaxy is on average 200 billion (not million) (3) Mercury and Venus do not always present the same face to the sun (4) and the human genome has less than 100 thousand (not millions of) genes.Normally, I would not nitpick like this but Ward & Brownlee are scientists and I feel that they should not have gotten these rather elementary facts wrong. However, it should be noted that these distractions do not undermine the main premise of the book.Since this book is dedicated to the late Dr. Carl Sagan (as well as another person), I feel I should explain Sagan's results (presented in his best-seller \\"Cosmos\\") based on using the Drake equation that indicates another reason we may be alone, at least, in the Galaxy. Sagan calculates that \\"the number of [advanced technical] civilizations [known as \\"N\\"] in the Galaxy [could be] in the millions\\" (thus satisfying those who state the simple argument that since there's billions of stars in the Galaxy, there must be many advanced civilizations).BUT Sagan also says that \\"The number N might be as small as 1 [just us].\\" Why does he say this? He explains: \\"If civilizations tend to destroy themselves soon after reaching a technological phase there might be no one for us to talk with but ourselves...Civilizations would take billions of years of tortuous evolution to arise [as Ward & Brownlee detail exquisitely], and then snuff themselves out in an instant [or some cosmic event snuffs them out as Ward & Brownlee, again, explain exquisitely].\\"Finally, for an opposite opinion of what Ward & Brownlee's book present, I recommend Frank Drake's \\"Is Anyone Out There?: The Scientific Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence\\" (paperback, 1994) and/or visting the SETI internet site.In conclusion, despite some factual distractions, this book has a number of good features that collectively give a challenging second opinion regarding life in the universe. If you like challenges, then I strongly recommend that you read this book!!**** 1/2+++++"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Rare Earth provides some fairly strong (and not well known) arguments that animal life on earth has been very lucky, and that planetary surfaces are typically much more hostile to multicellular life than our experience leads us to expect.The most convincing parts of the book deal with geological and astronomical phenomena that suggest that earth-like conditions are unstable, and that it would have been normal for animal life to have been wiped out by disasters such as asteroids, extreme temperatures, supernovae, etc.The parts of the book that deal with biology and evolution are disappointing. The \\"enigma\\" of the Cambrian explosion seems to have been explained by Andrew Parker (see his book In the Blink of an Eye) in a way that undercuts Rare Earth's use of it (dramatic changes of this nature seem very likely when eyes first evolve). This theory was apparently first published in a technical journal in 1998 (i.e. before Rare Earth).They often assume that intelligence could only develop as it has in humans, even suggesting that it couldn't evolve in the ocean, which is rather odd given how close the octopus is to qualifying. But the various arguments in the book are independent enough that the weak parts don't have much affect on the rest of the arguments.I was surprised that they never mentioned the Fermi Paradox, which I consider to be the strongest single argument for their position. Apparently they don't give it much thought because they don't expect technological growth to produce effects that encompass more than our planet and are visible at galactic distances.Their concern over biodiversity seems rather misplaced. I can understand why people who overestimate mother nature's benevolence think that preserving the status quo is a safe strategy for humanity, but it seems to me that anyone sharing Rare Earth's belief that nature could wipe us out any time now should tend to prefer a strategy of putting more of our effort into creating technology that will allow us to survive natural disasters.I am disappointed that they rarely attempt to quantify the range of probabilities they would consider reasonable for the risks they discuss.Stephen Webb has written a book on roughly the same subject called Where is Everybody? that is more carefully argued, but less entertaining, than Rare Earth."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Excellent history of the development of life, complex and otherwise, on planet Earth including a listing of the variables involved in the development, e.g. the right star size, mass and composition, the animal habitable zone, formation of the moon, existence of the Jovian planets, etc., but still not enough to make a final conclusion on Earth's exclusivity.The Drake and Rare Earth equations mentioned cannot and should not be used, at least for the time being, to calculate the possible number a civilizations in our galaxy due to lack of required verifiable values.The whole Rare Earth idea is based on available information from a sample of one subject only, planet Earth, and on processes that we are just beginning to understand. Until we get additional empirical data, albeit at a distance, on the existence of other terrestrial planets, we might be able to come to a reasonable estimate of the abundance of Earth like planets. Also, we must keep in mind that there might be other conditions equally conducive to the development of complex life that we cannot even imagine. Case in point, the extra solar planets discovered have giving us an idea of the different possibilities for the formation of planets, in this case gas giants with highly elliptical orbits or orbits to close to the parent star, we never thought possible before. We must not assume that the structure of our solar system is the only possible configuration.One should not conclude that planet Earth might be unique in the galaxy, or the universe for that matter, or that the galaxy might be teeming with advanced civilizations. Both extremes should be avoided. It is probable that life exits out there due to the sheer number of stars in the universe, must probably carbon based, but then again the probability of finding out conclusively, or making contact at all, are also remote due to the vast distances involved.A strong case has been made for microbial life, extremophiles, but we still need more data by exploring Mars, Titan or Europa so we can get a definite confirmation. If microbial life is found on these harsh environments, then we will have a strong case for existence of life, at least microbial, in the universe.AC.CHB"},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Absolutely stunning!

While some of the reviewers below may claim that the authors have failed to make their case that Earth is a unique planet, they miss the point entirely. Of course there is no way to prove conclusively that we are alone in the universe. Such proof will not be possible until we have been engaged in interstellar exploration for many centuries. What this book does illustrate are the many factors that went into making our planet and how it wasn't as easy or straightforward as the SETI astronomer crowd would have us believe. Like I said, the authors may not have proven conclusively that we are alone.

There could be other life forms but the possibility that intelligent life may have arisen needs a lot of things to go just right otherwise the cake will turn out flat. The central flaw with Ward and Brownlee's book isn't this premise (which is fascinating and worth discussion)but that we're making an assumption for life like us to evolve on other worlds. The conditions that allowed Earth to be a lifeboat in the starry ocean for our form of life might be rare but it doesn't preclude life forms so drastically and dramatically different from our own as to have no commonality with us at all.Nevertheless, Rare Earth provides a thumbnail sketch of the often brutal universe we live in. Ward and Brownlee argue that the Drake Equation that states that the universe is teeming with life may be right--but it might not be intelligent life or complex life such as higher mammals and plants. All of this is conjecture and while it is a fascinating discussion it's based on our bias that life has to somehow resemble us or the creatures of our planet. Ward and Brownlee suggest that we might be disappointed to discover if we hold up a mirror to the univese we won't see ourselves; that's not a surprise given how diverse life (despite the common building blocks)is on Earth.Is there life out there? We won't really know until we get out there. Until such time everything else is speculation. Are the conditions for complex life such as on our planet unlikely to be on other planets? Sure but that doesn't preclude lifeforms radically different from our own that might have as much in common with us as we do with a neutron star.This is indeed a worthwhile book to read but keep in mind that there are other books on the same subject that can provide balance to this point of view."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"Evolution, the Big Bang ... these and other loosely framed theories are devoid of much understandingRare Earth is a gem!

It is an interesting, if ultimately unconvincing book. Interesting theory, lots of conjecture, and lots of \\"What if...\\" in every chapter.To me it seems that in many places sweeping statements are made, but never supported. Take for instance the statement on page 110 \\"Changes in ocean chemistry caused by increased tectonic activity beginning a billion years ago facilitated the evolution of skeletons.\\" But the section does not, to me, provide adequate support or explanation for this supposition.Also take for example the Drake Equations which - while properly explained - is misstated in the details.The equation is usually written: N = R* x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x L where:N = The number of civilizations in The Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable.R* =The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life.fp = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems.Ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life.fl = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears.fi = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emergesfc = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.(Source: Seti Institute, http://www.seti-inst.edu/science/drake-bg.html)However, as given in the text of \\"Rare Earth\\" the formula is:N* x fs x fp x ne x fi x fc x fl = NThis does not appear to be a big difference, however, the terms fi, fl, and fc are each mis-defined in the book. fi is defined as planets where life does arise, not intelligent life; fc as planets on which intelligent life emerges, not civilizations that develop a technology; and fl as percentage of lifetime of a planet that civilizations release detectable signals into space, not planets with life. This may seem nothing more then nit picking over details, but to me this is symptomatic of the entire work. If you can't even get a few simple 40 plus year old definitions right how accurate is the rest of the work? The belief that earth is the rarest of planets and then the selection of information to support that idea appears to be the main thrust here.Good science uses data to take you to a logical, fact supported conclusion, you get the reverse when to select facts to support a preconceived conclusion.Overall an unsatisfactory book."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I originally bought this book after reading an summary in a science magazine, as I wanted to know more about their ideas...

It has numerous up-to-date overviews of various ideas concerning the evolution of life on earth, planetary and solar system evolution, star formation, mass extinction events, evolutionary change etc etc, but I am of the view that the basic thrust of this book-that these many things which have played a role in the development of life on earth are by and large necassary for complex life to form-that this idea is fundamentally flawed. Here are my reasons.I won't go into the exact details of what the book discusses, as there are some other very good reviews which do this admirably. But the thesis is flawed. Just because life on earth has developed in a metal-rich solar system, with a Jupiter-like planet deflecting cometary and meteoric debris, with the &quot;right&quot; temperature (supposedly), the right amount of water, the &quot;proper&quot; (supposedly) distance from the sun etc etc, doesn't mean that all these and other things are necassary for complex life to form. In fact, there are indications that conditions on earth in some ways are not conducive for complex life to form. The earths crust is suprisingly rich in oxygen, oxygen is generally toxic to life. The earth is very stable, (axis, distance from sun, etc etc) which may mean that evolutionary change is considerably slower than on other planets. On another planet, with a more diverse planetary environment, and periodic instabilities, complex life might actually evolve considerably quicker. Life on earth appears to go through long periods of relative stability-this might be peculiar to life on earth and a relatively stable planet, and not the best environment for the evoltution of complex life. The earth is relatively poor in some elements which are apparently very important in complex life forms, such as phosphorous, and others. There are many peculiarities about the earth which are not necassarily necassay for life, and may even hinder it. The book does not spend much time in discussing thses ideas.But apart form these arguments, there is a blatant underlying flaw, that is, the idea that because life as we observe it has indeed been profoundly influenced by a number of different factors we can observe, that this therefore means that these processes are necasary for all/most complex life forms to evolve. How do we even know, for example, that water is necassary for life, let alone continental drift, large gaseous planets, the moon and so on. Silicon has long been conjectured to be able to provide a basis for the complex chemistry necassary for complex life, and silicon reacts differently to carbon with water and various other liquids. The many factors the book discusses are how life as we know it has formed, yes, but this does in no way mean that life can't form in other ways. If there is anything about life that seems obvious, is that is it adaptable, and suprisingly so. Life finds a way. The earth is not a blueprint, it is just one example of its course. Because it took 4 billion years on earth for complex life to get going, may indicate that the earth is not very good at getting life started, rather than complex life being improbable in the first place.I'm of the view that the obvious variety of conditions present in the universe may well create numerous conditions where life can flourish. True, this life might possibly be very different form what we imagine, blobs of 'intelligent jelly', rather than 'little green men'(primates). It is only simplemindedness which assumes that life on earthly conditions is the only way."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"I checked this out at my local library. Books like this really amaze me. Here are intelligent men who aptly demonstrate the unbelievable set of circumstances required for our home planet to be able to sustain life, and then they try to explain how all of this just happened to come into existence purely by mindless and random processes. What a coincidence; what a stroke of luck. Our world just amazingly came to be what it is without any creative force behind it. It truly is amazing that people are so willing to come up with theories that take much more faith to believe in than the idea that the earth is no accident."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"The book &quot;RARE EARTH&quot;, although clearly written by scientists about evolutionary issues, makes a very strong case for creation. Although the conclusion derived from the Rare Earth Hypothesis is that life is unlikely to exist elsewhere in the universe through evolution, it also makes the case that life here on earth, as well as the stable habitat created for life, are statistically improbable, even implausable.If the creation of life by means of evolution is unlikely, then how did our existance come about? The quick answer is &quot;By some other means.&quot; When one considers what those other means might be, the most likely, if notthe only other answer, is &quot;Creation by a supreme, all-knowing, all powerful, being&quot;.Although this is clearly a well written, well documented book of science, the issue of creationism is touched upon in a couple of places; e.g., on page 37, the authors state &quot;If some god-like being could be given the opportunity to plan a sequence of events with the express goal of duplicating our 'Garden of Eden&quot;, that power would face a formidable task.&quot; Who fits this description of God? DUH... Certainly the all knowing, all powerful Judeo-Christion-Muslim God, known as Yahweh, Jehovah, Allah, by the respective groups, could accomplish this, as well as God as characterized by many eastern religions. If this task of creation is too formidable for God, does it make sense to conclude it happened by ACCIDENT, e.g., evolution? Get real. Give me a break.Again of page 129 they write &quot;Sedgewick's discovery of the seemingly instantaneous appearance of complex fossils convinced most scientists of his time that life was spontanteously created - put on Earth through the action of some deity; this observation is still cited by creationists as evidence against the theory of evolution.&quot;Although the authors provide an evolutionary explanation for this &quot;relatively sudden and signal outburst of animals - an unleashing of abundant and voracious creatures upon the earlier bacterial world,&quot; (page 131) they also say &quot;We believe that it yields crucial evidence for estimating the frequency of animal life in the Universe&quot; (which turns out to be 'rare'). How about Genesis 1, verses 20-25, for a description of the Cambrian &quot;explosion&quot;?Could it be that these authors are &quot;closet&quot; creationists? Comments that may seem to some to discredit creationism actually support it.They also make significant inroads against the prevailing scientific view that life in the universe is commonplace, by means of the &quot;Theory of Evolution&quot; (which seems to be taken more as a fact than a hypothesis by these writers and many other authors on the subject). The Drake equation (page 267), proposed by Frank Drake in the 1950s, that predicts the probability of life on other planets, is modified (page 271) to add additional factors that conclude intelligent life elsewhere is improbable, not overwhelmingly prevalent. Carl Sagan's 1974 predictions of millions of civilizations in our galaxy is refuted, as well as the writings of other authors such as Isaac Asimov, who fine tuned the Drake equation in his 1979 book &quot;Extraterrestrial Civilizations&quot; (not specifically mentioned in &quot;Rare Earth&quot;).Another damaging claim, on page 250, questions the viability of the SETI project, the &quot;Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence&quot; where the authors state &quot;If the Rare Earth Hypothesis is correct, then it (SETI) clearly is a futile effort.&quot; How much money have we taxpayers spent on this &quot;futile project&quot;. Should we continue? (There are other examples of wasted funding, which we leave to the reader to discover)To summarize the summary, this book supports &quot;Creationism&quot; in many ways, and should also be sold as a religious book. It should be brought to the attention of our secondary school officials, and used to teach that creationism is at least as viable an explanation of our existance as evolution, if not more so.It should be brought to the attention of our politicians, so that funding for unproductive &quot;golden fleece&quot; projects such as SETI may be redirected towards other, more viable, and urgently needed uses."},{"Title":"Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe","review":"THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO EINSTEIN says that life, at least microbes, exists elsewhere in the universe.

It's fascinating to see how the strip evolved. Chester Gould's artwork started out very poor, but we can see it gradually improving. Tracy's character also evolved. He started out as a weenie by today's standards, and the character paradoxically benefited from being reduced to a square-jawed icon. Notice that in the first year he sometimes used disguises; he didn't do this much in later years, since his visual presence is the strip's anchor. Notice also that few of the stories were about bootleggers: the public was already turning against Prohibition.Yet much of the first-year work in this collection could have been dispensed with. I enjoyed the Hammettesque story of Texie Garcia, a gun moll blackmailing a politician. (Texie: \\"Think what you could do with a thousand dollars.\\" Tracy: \\"Yeah? I could roll it up in a wad and cram it right down your slippery throat.\\") Ditto the Lindbergh-like story of Big Boy Caprice kidnapping Buddy Waldorf Jr., with its knock-down dragout fight at the end. But editor Herb Galewitz himself admits that the stories of Tracy's demotion to a beat cop; con man turned kidnapper Broadway Bates, who resembles Batman's foe the Penguin; bond forger Alec Penn; and dope smuggler-blackmailer Kenneth Grebb are somewhat below par ...Of course, after a year the strip really came to life, and gained readers and newspapers, when Junior first appeared. This was also the occasion for introducing the thug Steve the Tramp, the first of the strip's great villains. He and counterfeiter Stooge Viller dominate the second year, even escaping prison together.The editors would have been well-advised to drop much of the first year, and their selections from the first six months of the Sunday strips, which weren't yet connected to the daily continuity. The space saved would have been better spent on some later stories such as Junior's mother, or Jean Penfield's fight with Tess Trueheart."},{"Title":"Dick Tracy: The Thirties : Tommyguns and Hard Times","review":"This is the perfect companion piece to the book THE CELEBRATED CASES OF DICK TRACY as well as Warren Beatty's DICK TRACY movie. The book collects the early 1930's exploits of the most famous comic strip detective of them all and one can see the evolution of writer Chester Gould's storytelling style. In his heyday Tracy, like Beatty, seemed lean and boyish (his sharped-cut nose and chinned developed slowly) as he matched fists and bullets with bloated mobsters like &quot;Big Boy.&quot; The early stories, themselves, play like matinee melodrama as young Tracy's misadventures with his girlfriend Tess Trueheart and &quot;son&quot; Junior (the comic's first &quot;boy-sidekick&quot;)border on being pure soap opera.

There are repetitive warnings that changes are done your own risk; and backup everything. That said...The first chapter starts off with easy to do tweaks of theDesktop and finder, but then the following chapters progress into moreadvanced changes, such as altering preference files and applicationbundles, and by the last chapter explains how to add scripting tonon-scriptable apps.I found this book to be a very helpful reference book if you need toknow anything about the inner workings of Mac application bundles orAppleScripting. It is presented in an easy to understand step-by-stepmethod for each project or tweak to do, and includes exactly whatapplications, etc you will need before you start (dubbed a \\"Bill of Materials\\"). It also includes a rating system (expressed in a Chinese takeout \`hot peppers' scale) for difficulty level and approximate time to do project.

However, it appears to have the objective of trying to please everyone, being inclusive, etc. There are beautiful prayers from the Liturgy, from Saints, the Fathers of the Church, Popes, Sacred Scripture... then there are prayers of Islam, Buddhism, new age stuff. A chapter preface talks about the beauty of Liturgical Dancing (which, by the way, is not a legitimate part of any truly Catholic Mass). Several prayers begin with \\"Mother God...\\" or \\"Mother/Father God...\\" What is this? There's a prayer of thanksgiving about sexuality, that I had to read several times and still couldn't figure out what the author was praying for.Many of the prayers are contributed by faculty, alums, average people, and many of them are very lovely prayers. However, the overtly \\"inclusive\\", let's-offer-something-for-everyone-even-if-we-offend-the-Catholic-Faith prayers ruined it for me. Of course I acknowledge that many non-Catholics attend Notre Dame Univ. But it's supposed to be a Catholic University, and a prayer book that represents authentic Catholicism throughout would have been very welcome. I cannot recommend this book if you're looking for a Catholic prayer book."},{"Title":"John Deere (Drive. Ride. Fly.)","review":"Very good color photographs and informative text about the development and first decade or so of John Deere's four- and six-cylinder tractors, from the 1010 to the 8020. Includes a lot of interesting comments from retired Deere executives and engineers, and neat historical photos of prototypes and testing work. For 10 series tractors, production number charts are broken down by individual year rather than just total production run figures, so you can see how many gas, row-crop 3010s were built in 1962, or how many diesel ag crawler 2010s were built in 1961, etc. There are no such charts for the 20 series, but yearly starting-serial-number charts for each tractor let you approximate total production of say, 3020s in 1966, but you can't break it down by gas, diesel, row crop, standard, etc. Like many books, there are some editing errors: the chart on 1010s, for example, shows the production figures for agricultural crawlers under the heading of \\"Hi-Crop Crawlers.\\" Having not seen too many hi-crop crawlers, I suspect that is a mistake."},{"Title":"John Deere (Drive.

The way to tackle the problem is from a process point of view, because that is all it is, a process problem. The programmers did not cause the problem the real culprits where the ANSI and the FIP but you always here people blame the programmers. (no I am not a programmer) The book needed to be more hands on, teach and explain the process of how to fix the bug, in this way everyone reading will get something out of the book housewife, programmers, and CEO's.Bottom line I could have done a better job no offensive just the facts as I see them."},{"Title":"The year 2000 software crisis: Challenge of the century (Yourdon Press computing series)","review":"I started to read this book to find out more about Y2K.

Originally I was intrigued by this resource when it was incorporated within the infamous Stong's Exhaustive Concordance (by Nelson publishers). I was so impressed with the topical reference material in it that I went to see if they published that part of the concordance all by itself. After all, who wants to carry around a huge bulky book around everywhere? And so, I saw that they did.I have taken this resource with me when I work on the telephones for Billy Graham, and it has served as a big help when my church has asked me to do a sermon. This is a top tier resource, and one I highly recommend for anybody and everybody serious about the Bible, and what is says regarding so many topics.PRICELESS!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Maxed Out!","review":"I was intrigued by the story line of two brothers in their 20's taking a small sailboat down the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and into the Gulf of Mexico, culminating the journey in the Florida Keys. The author makes up for lack of polish with enough insight and humor to keep the reader turning the pages, entranced. A boat trip often strains relationships. He explained the methods they used to cope with trip and relationship challenges while weaving in a story about their Uncle Billy's depression and drinking problem. Their adventures were chronicled in a journal-like fashion, with interspersed reflections on the past, making for an enjoyable read. But the lapses in grammar were obvious, frequent, and distracting. This book makes a good case for the importance of input from a good editor prior to publication."},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Maxed Out!","review":"This book will have you gripping your armchair with white knuckles when your not laughing your (beep) off!

Brian describes a trip that 99.9% of us would wisely choose not to make; however, his narration had me both laughing out loud and gasping with disbelief. His account of the more dangerous parts of the journey will have you questioning his sanity while his insights into self and his observations on society will assure he is quite sane.

His story is more than some boat trip. Taking place right after the Great Flood of 1993, the description of the towns and land they stop at or pass by are preserved in words that you can picture. A book that can be passed thru the generations for its historical accounting. Brian's insight into the economic and cultural differences come alive with all the different characters they encounter. He expresses his feelings about all his characters and uses humor to narrow the gap of human judgement to a common bond that the reader understands.As you read about his adventure with his brother Dave, you will bust up laughing at his humility!Though there is a sadness surrounding Uncle Billy, the reader is enlightened by the fact that Brian was encouraged by and lived Uncle Billy's dream and his own dream to write the book.A must read for anyone who dreams of living their dream!"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Maxed Out!","review":"What a great way to share a descriptive adventure, without the risk involved, and incorporate a down-to-earth look at various sides of life along the way.

From acquiring the \\"Maxed Out\\" to the daring final leg of the voyage across the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Brian and David became resourceful out of necessity, coping with the many adversities that their adventure embraced. This book is an enjoyable, absorbing, easy read.

The notion of two brothers traveling from mid-Missouri all the way to Key West in a 17 ft. sail boat with a tiny engine is very adventurous ... if not a little crazy. Nold does a nice job of weaving in the personal story of an uncle who influenced his life along with the ride he and his brother experienced following the Great Flood of 1993.I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a good page-turning account of a real life adventure. While Nold, a former corporate pilot, sometimes lacks literary polish ... he more than makes up for that with an incredible tale that keeps the reader turning pages.Everyone I know who has read the book makes the same comment. It's simply hard to put down. Readers want to know how the voyage ends and successfully keeping the reader engaged is a talent many seasoned writers struggle to achieve.Nold's enthusiasm shines through and makes reading The Voyage of the Maxed Out a very worthwhile experience."},{"Title":"Modern Religious Poems","review":"This fine old collection from 1964 harks back to a time when &#34;religious&#34; meant Judaeo-Christian and really Christian.

However, it's message can be realized at any time of the year. The book's focus is on a twelve-year old boy during the final months of his grandmother's life.

If you want a feel-good book with no profanity, violence or sex, give this book a try. Recommended to all readers of Christian fiction."},{"Title":"Christmas Quilt","review":"As I read this, I kept thinking of my grandmother, whose childhood was very similar. This is a good read for teens and adults alike, as it is told from the viewpoint of an older man as he remembers seven months of his childhood during 1942. A teen struggling to find him/herself can relate to this young man growing up in a small town torn between the draw of the world and the love of home. Those who grew up in a rural or small town, will identify greatly with the lifestyle and story presented. It features no profanity or other adult-content imagery. It is sweet without being sappy, so enjoy!I also loved this because the descriptions and way of life recalled are part of my own past. I am young, but this tells a life similar to my ancestors and brings this way of living to reality for me."},{"Title":"Christmas Quilt","review":"This was a different type of book. You know in the first paragraph what goes on at Christmas, but the book is then a lead up to those events. It is an interesting look at family and struggle in the poor rural south. The truth you find out about Joe I suspected, but it was a realistic ending for the time and place. I think in the end you see that these months in 1942 are what changes a boy into a man who can make something out of himself, instead of following in his uncle's footsteps."},{"Title":"Christmas Quilt","review":"I am a teacher of literature and I highly recommend this book for all ages.

The book amply describes in very tangible terms all the days chores, w/ its sweat and all the depth of the relationships of a large country family. The more I read, the more I wanted to read and the faster I read.

Chicago was in ruins, survivors were fleeing the burning cities and the sun was blocked by the nuclear winter that had been created by the bombs. For a amoral vampire this SHOULD be a perfect time. But it isn't. Many of the humans have become contaminated, radiation sickness making their blood useless to him. And the heathly humans are in danger from roaming bands of looters and killers, as food and water becomes more and more scarce.Can he learn to feed without killing? Can he learn to protect the humans he needs to live or will he give into his hunger?I think Kittredge is one of the most realistic vampires I have ever read about. He never pretends to be a good guy, he starts out doing what he does purely for selfish reasons. He doesn't want to be a Rock Star or a God or discover the secrets of the Universe - he just wants to live.And we don't know what will happen when the sun returns after the winter ends."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"I bought \\"Vampire Winter\\" based on a recommendation in another reader's amazon.com list, and I do not regret it. Although VW is not as moving or as thought-provoking as \\"I Am Legend\\", my favorite vampire story, the post-apocalyptic setting does call that book to mind. VW is short (almost too short IMHO), the prose is spare, and the radiation science is a bit simplistic, but it's still a great little story. A vampire wakes up one evening to discover that humanity has just nuked the bejeebers out of itself. This isn't the beautiful, sexy, seductive vampire of Anita Blake's world. He's old, he's dangerous, and he enjoys the experience of killing the people upon whom he feeds. But as nuclear winter settles in, and isolated groups of humans struggle to survive the radioactive fallout, the vampire finds himself in the position of having to change his very nature in order to ensure his own survival over the long term."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. Part vampire story and part gritty survivalist story, the author creates a skewed universe in which the reader comes to feel equal amounts of sympathy and antipathy for the characters.The protagonist, Blaine Kittredge (the one grating note in this story is the romance novel name for the vampire), is a vampire who likes killing and fear and madness. He comes to realize that not only must he stop killing in order to be able to survive after a nuclear holocaust, but he must help his prey survive, as well. They fear him but reluctantly depend upon him, as the line between enemies and allies continually shifts and changes, post-apocalypse.An interesting take on the vampire mythos, and worth a read."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"Blaine Kittredge is a vampire who survives the dropping of a nuclear bomb (actually the dropping of nuclear bombs perhaps all over the world -- we never learn the full extent of the devastation). The symbiotic relationship that develops between Kittredge and the human survivors is pretty much the story of this book. And what a great story it is! I can't help thinking what a great movie it would make, as long as the makers kept strictly to the storyline and didn't twist and warp it out of recognition, e.g., have Kittredge fall in love or endow him with utterly fantastic supernatural capabilities. It is simply a really, really good vampire story and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"no explantation is given for the vampires existance, is it viral or demonic or other? this vamp is capable of thought but unable to overcome the lust for blood....all in all a great read, a light read."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"I am not sure if Lois Tilton was trying to be funny when she wrote this. But some of the things that Kittredge went through were hilarious. I was actually feeling sorry for him towards the end of the book. No one should have put up with so much. (Only a vampire could)I can not recommend this book enough. If only their could be a sequel, but I don't think Kittredge would survive it."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"I bought this book new, hot off the presses. Since then I have given it away and repurchased it 4 times. Vampire Winter is a book that stands alone in concept and embraces the the vampire mythos without the tarnish that Ann Rice and her ilk sullied it with.VW blends the post apocalyptic genre seamlessly with a vampire story by setting the novel immediately after a series of nuclear blasts. As a huge fan of Rawles, Stirling, and anything post-collapse, VW satisfied me. Looters, radiation sickness, food shortages, small town solidarity, and the depths of human depravity...all there.Amidst the chaos, is our reluctant protagonist, vampire Blaine. After discovering that his sunless paradise will be a cold place without an uncontaminated food source, he sets out to save himself. Keeping people is difficult for everyone concerned, but but Blaine soon finds someone to take out his anger on. Blaine's interactions with the leader of the small town that he targets are delightfully psychological. I often don't know who to route for because Tilton never paints a single character in glowing, unrealistic terms.Overall, I can't recommend this book enough..I.am sad to be only the 10th reviewer."},{"Title":"Vampire Winter","review":"LOVE this book.

For the price and speed of arrival i have absolutely no complaints."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"I love all the works of Stefan Zweig; even in translation, you can tell what a brilliant storyteller that Stefan is. In Marie Antoinette, you could almost feel pity for the unfortunate woman that fate so harshly dealt with the responsibility of a queen. The book is excellent in detailing the emotional stages of her life as a young child into womanhood, & all that she had to endure amid all the royal duties, gossips, struggles & fights behind the palace doors. All in all, an execellent book that I enjoy over & over again."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"As a disciple of Freud, Zweig was fascinated with the new psychoanalysis and applying it to historical characters. I think he overdoes it in his biography of Marie Antoinette, attributing her love of clothes, gambling, and partying to supressed desires rather than youthful vivacity, since she was a teenager, married at fourteen. This is a book that has outlived its time. Unfortunately, Zweig's Freudian interpretation has been imitated by other biographers and gives a false view of Marie Antoinette even to this day."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"I was very curious about knowing the author's point of view about Marie Antoinette. To me Zweig is a rare writer that really makes you see through the characters, if imaginary or not, the action, the emotion. Really makes you live the book. And of course it has a real story on it that nobody really knows for sure..."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"I think the title should read, \\"The Portrait of an Average Woman's Behavior\\". I think one would find it hard to accept that Ms. Antointte was anything but an average woman of her time. Yes, it is true that her behavior was typical of an average woman, but she was raised to become a queen, not your average woman. Finding true love with a warm, romantic, and compassionate man in comparison to her husband Louis XVI and the manner in which she handled the affair are truly average. Her thoughts and behavior as the momentum of the French Revolution accelerated are those of an average woman. Aside from the misnomer, I truly enjoyed the information and the manner in which Mr. Zweig presented it to the reader. Mr. Zweig exposed Ms. Antoniette to the reader as if he had known her personally. After reading this biography I now feel that beneath all the hair pieces and hats, she behaved as any woman would have done in her situation."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"Stefan Zweig's excellent account of history's most tragic queen; it's a very good read.Zweig's assertion is that Antoinette was not only unprepared for her role as the last Queen in the ancien regime, but that she - the daughter of Maria Theresa - was simply 'average'. Nothing about this woman was average. This is a vivid account of a life so privileged it is incomprehensible today. It is the story of a spoiled, pampered Queen who is unwilling to pay the price of her station in life: the constraints of etiquette.Perhaps her outlook might be considered to be \`average' for the time. The fall of the French monarchy caused all of Europe to tremble. It would have taken great vision for a person in Antoinette's position to see the inevitability of the revolution. Nevertheless, the book clearly portrays Marie Antoinette as a personage with typical views for her time, of mediocre intelligence, without wit or talent, uneducated (uneducable, perhaps) who is not only unprepared but also unwilling to shoulder the responsibilities of what was the most important throne in Europe.Yet, Zweig's affection for the subject is undeniable and contagious. It might be argued that Antoinette deserved the guillotine, but we're very sorry to see her make that journey in the end."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"I love Stefan Zweig's masterful writing style in this work as well as his Mary, Queen of Scotland and the Isles. I have read both books with fascination and have yet to find a finer pen. His meticulous yet flowing and effortless description of nuance and subtleties open the doors of heaven.Yet, while he provides a plethora of exhaustive details of the societal condition inside and outside the French court, he fails, perhaps with purpose, to discuss the source of the French Revolution that led to the murder of Marie Antoinette and hundreds of thousands of other innocents. Murder is the appropriate word for this was a planned revolution defined by its perpetrators in these words: \\"Revolution is a blow struck at a paralytic.\\" In other words, they paralyze social functionality with the propagation of lies until they have created a false reality, the momentum of which becomes almost irresistible to the masses especially when they are told that they are being disenfranchised by anyone who might be aristocratic. This is the identical formula with which they murdered the completely innocent Czar Nicolas, Czarist Alexandria along with their family and led very Christian Russia to official atheism where there was created the world's first and only Department of Atheism. According Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, in his book The Gulag Archipelago, they proceeded to murder 30 million Christians - yes, 30 million - in the gulags of Siberia, a fact unreported nor even countenanced by our media. What is more, it is a markedly similar formula, if not identical formula, used in Cromwell's overthrow of the English Crown and subsequent murder by public beheading of the man who might have been England's most Christian king, Charles I. I hasten to add that I am not religious. I denote the Christian convictions of these only because the revolutionists were and are as devoutly and profoundly anti-Christian as they are anti-aristocratic.Zweig attributes the French Revolution to Marie Antoinette's naivete and negligence. These failings, however, were greatly exacerbated by the revolutionists. In one of the many examples of this exacerbation, they sold her jewelry at astronomical terms thereby weakening the royal coffers and, consequently, royal resolve. These, and many other schemes began to paralyze the French Crown. But, perhaps, the inexorable impetus for social overthrow was the keenly appetizing notion of eqalitarianism, an idea the peasants did not fully consider and embrace for had they done so they would not have felt themselves superior to the aristocracy and entitled to murder thousands of them.So, it is for omitting of the names of the real revolutionists - perhaps, the same revolutionary tribe that occupies our government - that I have given this beautifully written book only two stars."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"This book is the perfect introduction to the French revolution. It presents a 'visual guided tour' of the life and death of the tragic queen Marie Antoinette. Written in 1932 by the Viennese Jewish novelist and professional biographer Stephan Zweig, the book dips fairly deeply into psychoanalytical thinking, and sometimes the veneration given to Freudian ideas can seem questionable by today's standards. However, the scholarship is truly masterful, and draws on extensive research into the letters and diaries of the most minor characters, without sacrificing narrative style or readability. Zweig writes books that move swiftly, but are rich in detail, and could repay a second reading.Married at fifteen, crowned queen at nineteen, and beheaded at thirty-seven, Marie Antoinette went from the heights of heedless frivolity into the depths of isolation and despair. Zweig argues that she converted the arrogance and narcissism of her early years as the \\"queen of rococo\\", into a brave and selfless defense of the aristocratic lost cause. Surrounded by the mounting violence and insanity of the revolution, which mirrored the earlier unreason of a decadent aristocracy, she was stripped of her power and prestige, but passionately refused to surrender her honor. In the end the force of her character vindicated the nobility which her years of frivolity had discredited. But it was too late, the damage had been done, and she more than any other was the symbol against which the revolution was fought.Independent of the historical significance of the topic, this book is magnificently written, it moves at a rapid and exciting pace, and it contains many deep moral lessons. The Freudian prejudices of the author should be borne in mind, but in some ways they add to the phenomenal drama this book evokes."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"Marie Antoinette... many things go through one's mind when thinking of that name. Many say she was cruel, pampered, and spoiled, and that she was the main couse of the French Revolution, yet, she was just a woman, a woman born a princess in the Austrian court, married to a French boy whom she had never met by the age of 15, crowned by 19, and beheaded by 35.Life went by so fast by Marie Antoinette!!, and never gave her a chance to choose what she wanted out of it.Stefan Zweig is a marvelous writer, and manages to gives us an intimate portrait of at times very hated, at others very loved and admired woman, an ordinary person who only wished for a normal life with her family, a little place of her own, where she didn't have to adjust and adapt to the many different rules impossed on her.He describes the life of the French court as only he could, and you feel like you are part of the story, hearing about Versailles, Louvre, the revolution and the people involved, which makes this an excellent book to learn about history, about life in the French court, and about France's last great queen.So, was she cruel, spoiled, and ignorant? read and decide for yourself...."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"Zweig's biography is so fascinating, I can't believe it's been allowed to go out of print. He does a remarkable job of delineating a light-headed, pleasureseeking woman who was thrust into circumstances she couldn't have anticipated or coped with. Marie Antoinette becomes a real woman, not a figurehead or a scapegoat. No one could ask for anything less."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"Dating from 1933 in its first edition, this book is part biography and part psychological analysis of the great Austrian Empress Maria Theresa's daughter who died a hated Queen of France. While both its writing style and its ideas - particularly its author's assumptions about the fundamental nature of womanhood - may seem quaint to the 21st Century reader, it's still very well worth reading. Zweig refuses to rely upon a number of commonly used sources that he has reason to consider suspect, and he approaches his subject with genuine interest that's refreshingly uncontaminated by awe. The Archduchess Antoinette, the Dauphiness of France, the giddy young Queen to Louis XVI, the maturing mother of the Dauphin who would have become Louis XVII - Zweig captures them all, and then takes us with him through this woman's terrible final transformation into the prematurely white-haired \\"Widow Capet\\" who mounts the scaffold. He writes her life with frankness that's remarkable, truly, considering the era in which his work was originally published."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"This biography was the first well researched effort to present the life of the unfortunate Marie Antoinette in alignement to the facts and also adding psychological insight.Prior to this effort all renditions tended to idiolize her as a martyr or deride her as the personification of all the evils of the old regime. She was neither of the two, but as correctly assesed here, a quite ordinary, uneducated woman that led an extraordinary life due to the historical components that surrounded her fate as a member of a ruling house.Not just ordinary, she was also very naive and not at all intelligent, as when she arrived in France it took seven years for her to get pregnant and it would have taken more had her brother not pushed the husband into the operation that he desperately needed to be able to perform. This is an incredible contrast with a similar situation encountered, much earlier by Catherine de Medici when she married Henry II and did not get pregnant for several years, but Catherine was a Medici and she found a solution to that problem, and all the others that came with her long reign. It is not the youth and lack of experience that were as important as the willingness, the initiative that is missing from her character. This is also the reason that she was almost illiterate when she arrived in France, as shown by her primitive handwriting when she signed her marriage document. The book is particularly accurate in relating the transformation that occurred in this otherwise ordinary woman when the sufferings of the Revolution brought out a character of great depth and tragic dimension that completely stole the limelight from the Revolution with her tragic trial and execution. If the queen's life were made into an opera, the best arias would be reserved for the last act, because it is then that she truly meets her destiny. In a completely unexpected situation, the spendrift, capricious queen turned into a figure worthy of the best of Racine's tragic heroines, her strength of character, the nobility of her every move form the time of the assult to Versailles till her death, is a unique trajectory in a spiritual transformation that to this day has made her a fascinating, unforgettable character. This is most probably the reason that her character is so controversial to this day in France, for Marie Antoinette managed to be a perfect queen when it was least expected of her, and surprised herself, and history by completely humilating the Revolution without intending to do so. The sadistic cruelty, petit-bourgeois pettiness and abusive violence and hatred that characterized the Revolution is all too exposed in the record with her. We understand the people of France were hungry, downtrodden and frustrated by generations of complete neglect from their leaders, and we sympathise with their desire for freedom and improvement, but it is nevertheless hard to believe that the rabble, and the lowest denominator in decency so quickly dominated the movement and called all the shots from the very day of the assult to the Bastille in July 1789 when they proceeded to butcher the surrendering officers in charge, to Robespierre's execution in July 1794 were five long years of violence and terror.As Zweig understands and explains so well in the last chapters, Marie Antoinette was not equipped to understand what had happened either intellectually or through education. She was therefore unfair to the Revolutionaries in the sense that she was unable to accept moderation and reform, which were motivated by a just cause of social improvement and wanted better for their country than the ruinous, inefficient and financially chaotic estate she and Louis XVI inherited from the real culprit if there was ever any, of the disaster, the indolent, selfish, egocentric and completely misguided Louis XV who was at least smart enough to realize and say, at the end of his (unfortunately) long, wasted life \\"After me, the Deluge\\". She saw the Revolution as a rebellion, a sign of the wrath of God perhaps for her past sins, but never as a social change that was overdue and necessary, she could not have understood, from her isolated and sheltered perspective, plus more importantly, it was not her job to do so, she married the king but was NOT the ruler herself, and aside from the myths created by the pamphlets, her husband did have a mind of his own and did not automatically do what she suggested or wanted.As explained here, it was the natural incompetence of the king that prevented any chance of appropriate governing for the hard times they faced, even in a prosperous era he would have been an impediment as he never wanted, as it is clarified in the book, to be king in the first place. He was a quiet, good intentioned man that was happiest making clocks and locks. This image could have been an excellent one to transition the monarchy from the fairy tale nightmare of denial of Louis XV's reign into a modern constitutional state, and Marie Antoinette would have adored the role of simpler, homier queen, but this never happened. The king was too weak and unmotivated to do anything, or enough of anything, but what was worse, he blocked everyone who wanted to, from doing it also. France had in her past kings that were completely dominated by capable ministers: Louis XIII and Richilieu being the most obvious example, so the natural ambition that was very much present in both his brothers and the Duc D'Orleans were never utilized and eventually they turned against him, thus weakening the system further and providing the first primary impulse for the avalanche. The way he handled the famous affair of the necklace was perfect in showing all the deficiencies in his character. Readers may forget for example that at the time Talleyrand, the greatest diplomat of France, was already a bishop and could have been made a minister/advisor, there was no lack of talent around, but the king was attracted to mediocrity and consistently selected poor choices for all the important positions. Moreover, the lapse of time between 1774 and 1789 is long enough for SOME change to have ocurred but nothing was done till it was too late.The passages that explain her relationship with Count Fersen and clarify the rumors about her suppossed lesbian affairs are excellent because we understand totally the intimate aspects of her life, how her friendships were maligned by a press avid for her destruction and defamation, because it served perfectly into their political motives. We also understand that this woman, after fulfilling her duty as a wife and queen, had to find an emotional support that her husband could never provide. It is also important to note that the entire episode of the escape to Varennes was excellently organized by Fersen, and almost met with success but for the king's lack of decision and strength of character. Even when they were detained he could have bullied the post master and gotten away, but it is a sad episode when inbreeding has produced a creature that can not even fight for survival, which is what we see instead.The closing chapter on the trial and execution is a masterpiece of theatrical reconstruction, we can feel the oppressiveness of those horrible months between the king's execution and her own, particularly in recounting the painful separation from her son, then her total isolation at La Conciergerie. The magnificent last stand at her trial where the women present give her an ovation is all the proof we need as to why she has become an inmortal figure of history, but we also see it in the letter that she wrote to the king's sister, a letter which she never received, but that has survived as a testament to a new station in her life she herself never would have ambitioned or suspected, true greatness."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"The book written by Stefan Zweig gives you an explanation of the unhappy queen, it doesn't make her a saint, nor a demon.

Written by an extremely talented writer who deserves to be known."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"Excelllent, scholarly, and sensitive review of the life of Marie Antionette. Fascinating, heart-breaking, devastating in its chronology of her life, from her arrival in France as a spoiled 14 year old princess from Austria to her death as a compassionate, strong, charismatic yet defeated queen. That her growth as a woman and queen began as her days at Versailles were ending due to the impending revolution.....of which she had been largely oblivious, until it was too late, is bittersweet. The weakness and passivity of her husband, Louis XVI, her love of frivolity and wanton spending through most of her reign, the out of touch Court of Versailles, all combined to doom the royal family. Zweig paints a sensitive portrait of this woman, \\"an average woman\\", describing her failures, triumphs, the tragedy of her choices, and her final maturity with compassion and honesty."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"Even if you are well versed on the subjects of Marie Antoinette and Roccoco period France, reading this book is a rare pleasure. Credit goes not only to the brilliance of author Stephan Zweig, but also to his interrpretors, and the period of its publication for the book's elegant syntax and and extensive vocabulary. It was a slow read simply because there were paragraphs, sentences, and words that were well worth reading more than once...not because of an anacronistic style...quite the contrary; I just didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Marie Antoinette; the portrait of an average woman","review":"fantatstic booknot one sided at allstory told from letters writtenyou get to decide how you look upon Marie Antoinette which is refreshing since she is so controversial"},{"Title":"Penny Plain [Hardcover] by O.

The writing is lovely, the characters are likable, and the story is engrossing. The novel was written at a time when reading was one of the main options for the use of one's leisure time and it shows because each of the characters has a thorough knowledge of literature (many of the chapters open with quotes from Shakespeare.) Not only did I enjoy the story of Jean and Pamela and their \\"happy endings\\", I also enjoyed the many references to great literary works.A delightful book."},{"Title":"Penny Plain [Hardcover] by O. Douglas","review":"So far I've read several of O Douglas's (Anna Buchan) well written, engaging and delightfully charming stories, full of wonderful characters and lovely descriptions. I am glad to have finally found her. She is one of many British authors -- virtualy all now RIP who wrote wonderful books which tell great stories. Nothing sordid, boring or unpleasant, just stories told with humor, affection, lots of details, and sympathetic [mostly] protagonists. I've read some of her brother John's wonderful books and just reread THE THIRTY NINE STEPS and GREENMANTLE -- both are wonderful stories but just a tiny bit stilted and of their time. By contrast, sister Anna's books flow very smoothly and while not nearly as adventurous or dramatic, are every bit as great stories, if not better. I'm glad to have access to both authors!My only criticism of PENNY PLAIN is that the paperback version (print on demand?) is as large as a good sized magazine and a bit awkward. I found an old copy of PRIORSFORD (the successor volume) which is, by comparison, tiny.There have to be many such books that have, sadly, fallen out of print. It is good that a few are being brought back and I hope that more find the light of day soon.Island Girl"},{"Title":"Penny Plain [Hardcover] by O. Douglas","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot.

All knowledge and skill are obtained by consistent and determined study and practice, and so the Prophet found it to be the case in translating the Book of Mormon\\" (216). In June of 1829, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were visited by the Angel Moroni and shown the Gold Plates. It was during this occasion they heard the voice of the Lord declare the plates had been translated by the gift of God. Eventually, another eight witnesses saw and held the Gold plates totaling twelve witnesses.The Urim and Thummim was sealed up so they could be used for translating the Gold plates \\"at the time as the Lord should grant to man to intrepret them.\\" When the Gold plates were revealed, \\"they were to be intrepreted by the aid of the same Urim and Thummim\\" (224)Mr. Egbert B. Grandin was paid five thousand dollars to print 3,000 copies. In Aug 1829, Mr. Grandin began printing the Book of Mormon and was ready for distribution Mar 1830. The actual amount of time translating the Book of Mormon was from April 7, 1829 to Jun, not to exceed two months.The Prophet Joseph Smith received a command from the Lord that the entire manuscript be copied and that version sent to the printer and the original manuscript should not be permitted to go out of his hands. The original manuscript was by his own hand placed in the corner stone of the Nauvoo House, Oct 2, 1841. In the course of time the walls were torn down and Mr. Lewis C. Bidamon came in contact with the manuscript. Some of the pages were ruined and others were preserved and distributed. President Joseph F. Smith obtained pages 3 to 22 of the original manuscript. These pages are now in the Church Historians office. Elders Andrew Jenson, Edward Stevenson, and Joseph W Summerhays and other obtained portions of the original manuscript.We must protest when evil men seek to destroy the protections and liberties of the Constitution.1. The Lord established the Constitution of the United States. America is a land choice above all other lands declared by divine providence. The Lord has declared that the people should serve him and keep his commandments.2. The government of the United States came into existence through divine guidance. The inspiration of the Lord rested upon the patriots who established it, and inspired them through the dark days until independence.3. A Prophetic warning to succeeding generations was to be true to all the standards which lay at the foundation of our government.4. America will be preserved against all other nations, as long as, they serve Jesus Christ. If the inhabitants of America stray from the Son of God then they will cease to be a land of liberty and the Lords anger will be kindled agains them.5. The constitution will be in danger of being overthrown. Orson Hyde said, \\"If the Constitution be saved at all, it will be by the elders of this Church.\\"6. The first government on earth established by Adam was theocratic. However, the sons and daughters of Adam fell to the influence and Satan and established man made governments. The governments were not under the direction of revelation from God. The governments ignored and failed to harken to the commandments of God. Men arose and usurped the right to rule and reign over the people. The Power of satan was in these governments of the world.7. The Constitution of the United States was inspired of God. However, we will not have the government of God, until Christ shall reign and he comes as king of kings.8. Satan is governing the nations. D&C; 1, \\"The devil shall have power over his own dominion\\". Satan's power is confusion, strive, bitterness, and class distinction. Satan's power is delusion and not one of peace and righteousness. There will be no peace in world governments until Christ comes again.9. Governments are accountable to God for their actions. The Lord requires of every man to answer for his sins. \\"Every man will stand to be judged according to his works, and the Lord will also Judge the nations according to their works.\\" (318)10. If we have a righteous government we have peace. Without the aid of the Spirit of God it is impossible to govern in righteousness. The perfect government is based on the love of God. Destruction comes to nations and civilizations when they fail to hearken to the spirit of truth.11. \\"Many of the discoveries and inventions are now being used to bring destruction to the human race. They are being used in the most cruel, most inhuman, godless wars the world has ever seen. They are employed by criminals to aid in their crimes, by the ambitious in their efforts to destroy the agency of man, and by the despots who are endeavoring to subjugate the world to an unholy, wicked rule.\\" (272)12. Governments with large populations have denied God. They have tried to make the state supreme. The world is wrapped in a veil of spiritual darkness.13. \\"I am concerned over this nation; I am concerned over the nations, because of the wickedness of the people. I can see evil in the trend of the times. I can see anarchy ahead of us. If we are going to permit men, in organized form, to desecrate the sacredness of the laws of this country and the Constitution of the this country; if we are going to permit them, in the spirit of anarchy, to take possession of that which does not belong to the, without protest, we are going to reap the whirlwind, just as surely as we live\\" (317) Amen"},{"Title":"The Great American Bathroom Reader","review":"I realize that this sounds overenthusiastic, but this is the best book ever written.

Trust me."},{"Title":"The Internet: Effective Online Communication (with CD-ROM)","review":"Tyrone Adams' and Norman Clark's new book, The Internet: Effective Online Communication, provides a comprehensive and insightful view of the Internet from a communication perspective. Although there are other texts on the Internet, this is the first to focus on communication competence in the online environment. The text integrates theory and practice to help readers become critical Internet consumers and producers.I found Chapter 1 on the Internet's history the most intriguing. That background information provides a context for understanding the Internet's structure and current uses. In Chapter 2, the authors distinguish the Internet from other communication mediums, and at the same time observe that the boundaries between communication contexts are blurring.Chapters 3-5 cover the nuts and bolts of communicating online: email, listservs, newsgroups, chat rooms, MUDs, MOOs, and net conferencing. Although most students are quite familiar with email, listservs, and chat rooms, they are often less familiar with newsgroups, MUDs, MOOs, and net conferencing. With more and more organizations using net conferencing for work group and team meetings, the latter topic is especially useful.Chapters 6 and 7 address gathering information on the Internet. These invaluable chapters move readers out of the traditional search engine to other search strategies such as topic rings and bibliographic databases. In addition, the authors provide specific criteria for evaluating online information and how to cite the information found.Chapters 8-10 shift the reader from an Internet consumer to an Internet producer. With the help of the CD-ROM included with the book, students can design a fairly sophisticated webpage. Although the authors stress the utility of learning HTML, the web editor on the CD-ROM allows students to produce their first webpage with ease.Students found Part 5, &quot;Exiting Cyberspace: Implications of the Internet,&quot; particularly informative and sometimes surprising. For example, Chapter 12, &quot;The Internet and U.S. Law,&quot; led several students to investigate computer use policies in the workplace.My students gave the book high marks for readability, current examples, and thorough explanations. The authors' familiarity with effective online communication is plainly evident: Adams and Clark don't just write about the Internet; they are cybertravelers, clearly comfortable with and truly knowledgeable about Internet communication. We've become so immersed in online communication that we seldom give it a second thought. Adams and Clark include provocative information that will spark much debate in any classroom. Students learn practical online communication skills, as well as the theoretical background they need to adjust to an ever-changing and increasingly globalized Internet."},{"Title":"The Spa Encyclopedia: A Guide to Treatments & Their Benefits for Health & Healing","review":"I purchased this book as a refresher for past training and hoping to find some new ideas.

The book is easy to read (1-2 hours at the most), gives great examples and has already inspired me to take charge of my parenting with my almost 4 yr old twin boys. I can certainly see it's effectiveness into the teen years.The Canter's give you an overview of &quot;being assertive&quot; and ineffective communication. Then they keep it simple by giving you in one short chapter the tools most parents will need to get results - speak assertively, use nonverbal cues, utilize the broken record technique for arguers, and praise when behavior is appropriate. The next couple chapters suggest how to back up your words with actions and lay down the law, including some examples of &quot;extreme&quot; measures people have taken. Each chapter supplies examples and a one page summary at the end.The rest of the book gives great ideas for enforcing positive behavior, working with 2 or more children, changing behavior at school, and working with spouses and ex-spouses. There are examples situations for working parents, babysitters, and single parents. There is a question and answer section of the most &quot;what if?&quot; and &quot;but..&quot; questions, a long problem/consequence example chapter and worksheets for disciplinary plans in various situations.I highly recommend this book as one of the first to read. I really like the way they give suggestions, but don't treat them as the only way to do things.

(Well they won't actually thank you until they become parents, but they will certainly benefit from your assertive parenting.Assertive is not a four letter word. It's what your kid needs instead of compliant, hostile, unrealistic, ineffective or punishing parenting.Discipline is not the same thing as punishment. The authors define it as corrective action designed to help teach children more appropriate behavior. It should never violate the physical or emotional well being of the child. Although to me the screaming fit that occurred when I finally started taking charge FELT like I was inflicting emotional pain.

Using plenty of facts, figures, charts, and research is John Mauldin's forte. His arguements are well laid and his advice on investments for this period is solid.I recommend this book highly for anyone wishing to not just survive y2k, but possibly thrive. Way to go John!"},{"Title":"How to Profit From the Y2k Recession By Converting the Year 2000 Crisis Into an Opportunity for Your Investments and Business","review":"This is the book I've been looking for to pull into focus what's happening and what could happen regarding the Y2K problem. Mauldin eloquently, yet in easy to understand language, explains the world of high finance--from stocks and mutual funds to bonds, gold, silver, CD's, money market funds, and hedge funds in general and in specific to the Y2K problem. He explains how it all effects the average person--he even provides a scenario for a married couple in their forties, who need to prepare for Y2K, and then another for a couple in their 50's in addition to what your business can do to prepare for the worst. This book provides a guide for everything from money and finances to storing a little extra water and food, candles, and medicine in the event of an extended outage of services and the percentage of the country that most likely would be affected. He discusses politics and economics, &quot;pulling no punches&quot; regarding dangerous philosophies of isolationism. He has a deep sense of history that colors his opinions of our Fed. political/economic policies and the world as a free market. His logic will challenge you to think and act responsibly in the face of the Y2K unknowns and possible chaos. If you read any Y2K book, this one should be your first choice."},{"Title":"How to Profit From the Y2k Recession By Converting the Year 2000 Crisis Into an Opportunity for Your Investments and Business","review":"John Mauldin's book gives a step-by-step account of why he feels that the Y2K computer bug and related issues will result in a recession. He has a reasoned approach, unlike the gloom-and-doomers. His financial advice is well-reasoned and good advice regardless of how bad the situation gets. His approach does not depend upon the end of the world, but instead, as Mauldin points out, &quot;this will just be a recession.&quot; Yet, he details changes in investment portfolios that will be necessary this year in order to avoid being caught up in the changing situation.I highly recommend this book as a guide to understanding the economic and investment landscape as it pertains to the Y2K problem."},{"Title":"How to Profit From the Y2k Recession By Converting the Year 2000 Crisis Into an Opportunity for Your Investments and Business","review":"Unlike most of the apocalyptic Y2K books, this one focuses on the personal finance and business consequences of Y2K. It's not about stockpiling canned goods and going off into the wilderness--to the contrary, it's much more optimistic, albeit cautionary, about the impact of Y2K on everyday life. Mauldin persuasively analyzes Y2K preparation (or lack thereof) in America and abroad; he predicts that the economic and financial problems will stem largely from overseas difficulties (ie. bank failures, business failures, disruptions of imports and materials and goods manufactured abroad), rather than from major US problems. Indeed, Mauldin sees the biggest y2K related problems in US government agencies (despite the recent report about 92% preparedness, which is b.s.). And so while he does forecast a turn downwards in the stock market, as well as significant numbers of failures of small businesses that cannot handle a disruption of say 2-5 months, he does not believe that the US will suffer an economic catastrophe or another Great Depression. This is a good book to read if you want to find some specific recommendations about what to do with your money over the next couple of years, both leading up to and following on from Y2K. It's also a book for small businesspeople who want to prepare themselves for potential disruptions in their business and their communities."},{"Title":"How to Profit From the Y2k Recession By Converting the Year 2000 Crisis Into an Opportunity for Your Investments and Business","review":"This book offers a very rational and balanced analysis of the Y2K problem. Mauldin, a leading Y2K authority, has done his homework! He cites a great many sources on the nature of this problem, exploring fully the positions of both the Y2K Alarmists and the Business-As-Usual Crowd.After reviewing the progress (or lack thereof) by various industries and economic sectors, Mauldin gets to the heart of this matter, explaining how the various Y2K problems will impact the economy. He also details, quarter by quarter, what he expects to unfold during the next two years.Armed with his extensive research and analysis, Mauldin then delves into the investment implications of Y2K, as his book title would certainly imply. His carefully drawn conclusions provide a welcomed respite from the current popular extremes of pending catastrophe versus head-in-the sand complacency.Forwarned is forearmed.

I found many of the writing samples to be very odd. Here are a couple of examples.\\"The police found Mary Beth huddled naked in one corner of a small, filthy, foul-smelling bedroom. One thin wrist was tied to a bedpost with an electric cord. Her frail body was a mass of bruises and welts.\\"\\"I have a twelve-year old daughter who gets good grades in school and who is generally well behaved. However, last summer she began seeing a fifteen-year old boy. After some time I discovered evidence that she was having sex with this boy.\\" In this writing example, the writer of this Dear Abby style letter goes on to discuss that she's not sure what to do.There are many writing examples that have graphic, disturbing images and ideas such as these. I was hoping to use this book as part of a classical education homeschooling program for my high school age daughter, but there is too much of this just plain weird writing for my tastes. Five stars for the type of composition teaching method, zero stars for the icky-ness."},{"Title":"Composition in the Classical Tradition","review":"To the best of my awareness, this is the only textbook in vernacular English concerning the progymnasmata, a series of exercises used in the eastern Mediterranean in late Antiquity to teach the steps preparatory to crafting a formal speech or argument in the public sphere. Though classicist George A. Kennedy has translated the surviving Greek handbooks into English for study (q.v.), this book is the only one to incorporate current rhetorical and literary theory in the process of creating a finely crafted preparatory argument.This book assumes familiarity with written English but no prior training in creating written argument. The author's target audience appears to be lower-division high school students and other such inexperienced writers. The text includes a synoptic, and perhaps overly pat, introduction to the process of formal argument, but this intro is not necessary to understand the exercises. The approach is systematic and each chapter builds on the processes introduced in the prior chapter.Thankfully, this text does not limit itself to the progymnasmata as laid out in the ancient handbooks. It draws on arrangement structures and concepts from rhetoricians like Quintillian and Cicero to amplify the steps. The chapters are detailed without being prolix, and complete without being wordy. Some of the discussion and writing questions seem a little abstruse; I frequently find myself making up my own questions and assignments for my students rather than relying on those in the book.When I was learning how to teach composition, I remember my teacher and my fellow students lamenting that there was no systematic approach to the teaching of writing. We felt we were flailing like drowning people in deep water. Imagine my pleasure on discovering that exactly this sort of methodical teaching process has been in existence for millennia. Why this system isn't better known I cannot imagine, but the fact that an orderly teaching method already exists is a godsend to me, and probably will be to other composition teachers as well."},{"Title":"Composition in the Classical Tradition","review":"An invaluable resource! I have been using the progymnasmata to teach writing for two years and I have been looking for a book like this. This book provides richness and depth to understanding the progymnasmata exercises by placing them squarely into the rhetorical handbook tradition. It will give me and my students an even better understanding than before."},{"Title":"Composition in the Classical Tradition","review":"This is perhaps the only easily available resource with the progymnasmata exercises. A valuable book."},{"Title":"The shadow","review":"Written by a co-founder of the NAACP, this novel is set in turn of the century Florida and New York City. It is the story of an illegitimate white girl raised by the black workers on an orange plantation. The girl, Hertha, is brought up to believe she is colored, though so light skinned she could pass for white, and she works at the \\"big house\\" as a maid for one of the white owners. She is very close to her loving adopted black family, and though she knows she is not related by blood, she believes she is related by race. This story was set during the time of Jim Crow laws in the south and in the North, when blacks were not allowed in white restuarants, parks, churches, schools, theaters. Even where they could sit on buses and streetcars was determined by law. Breaking one of those laws could get a black person lynched, or at the very least badly beaten and thrown in jail. When Hertha is in her early 20's, the truth comes out, that she is actually white, and has a small inheritence from her white grandfather. Immediately, all the white people change their attitude toward her, from a beloved \\"pet\\" and servant to one of them, and set about establishing a future for her in white society. She thwarts their plans, and goes to New York. There she meets labor activists (as the author was), a southern white man who falls in love with her, and her black adopted brother, who left school in the north to work in New York City. Hertha chooses to keep her story a secret from all the whites she meets, letting everyone believe she is a poor white woman from the south. After her story comes out (thanks to an article in a southern newspaper that makes its way north), she experiences the racism of the north, every bit as ugly and cruel as it was in the south.This novel affected me profoundly, as it described Hertha's turmoil of being black, then suddenly white. First she was of the underclass, and then, in less than an hour, one of hte ruling class. At no time did she ever forget that she was raised black, that the family she knew and loved were black, the world and customs she knew were black. The only reason she could act \\"white\\" was because from childhood she had served as a colored maid to a white woman, and had learned to move in that world as well. Once she becomes white, her inner turmoil, the strain of acting a part she feels does not fit her is described and believable. She no longer lives into the black world, but she cannot fully enter the white world, either.If this book as a fault, it is the long conversations of the labor movement among factory workers in New York City. I didn't feel it advanced Hertha's story, especially as she didn't feel the struggle was hers, as it involved primarily white and Jewish workers. For this reason alone, I gave the book 4 stars, rather than 5 . . . but only because I couldn't give it 4.9 stars."},{"Title":"The shadow","review":"Thsi book starts out slow but hooks you into the suspsense.....all the way to the end.....I found it hard to put down."},{"Title":"Live the Life You Love","review":"Over the years I've read a lot of self-improvement books.

(10) Create a path that will lead you straight to the life you love.I found three tips particularly helpful. The author suggests ways to incorporate the things that give us joy into our daily lives, without needing to give up our day jobs.She describes how to draw on the experience and expertise of others in a most creative, effective way.And she explains that we're genetically programmed to resist change. Sher gives some easy ways to deal with that resistance, dispelling the notion that we must be weak or unmotivated if we resist, procrastinate or otherwise sabotage our dreams.All in all a practical book that is both easy to read and easy to implement."},{"Title":"Live the Life You Love","review":"Loved it. I'm also a sucker for self help books. Barbara Sher is the greatest because she has a sense of humor. She doesn't believe in affirmations. Yeah. Who can remember them anyway?

The purpose of the book appears to be one of mindset preparation prior to engaging the new life the reader would like to live. It gets the reader to look inward and to understand the feelings one has as well as to recognize one's natural gifts. Importantly, Barbara Sher gets the reader to recognize the resistance we all sometimes feel when called to action and then she deals with ways of overconming it. The reader is taken to the starting line and then encouraged to dig in one's heels and to move out when the opening shot is fired.

You have got to figure out some way to make this audiobook available to the general public.

I've listened to tons of audiobooks in my lifetime and this one is right at the top of my list of best audiobooks EVER. It gave me goosebumps and made me cry on several occasions, and has motivated me to follow my own career path. I can't thank you enough for making this.Unfortunately, the only versions still available are in CASETTE audio format, which nowadays is like telling someone it's available on an 8 track. Isn't there some way you can make this available for MP3 download? PLEASE????I would love to listen to these again. If it were available for MP3 download, or available in a CD format, I would buy it immediately. I've recommended it to sooo many people, but unfortunately they will most likely NEVER get to hear it because nobody seems to have a working cassette recorder anymore. There has got to be some way you can get Sounds True to release an MP3 download of these tapes.Please think about it, ok? If you want some help, and want some of your fans to get on the phone and bug your publishing company about it for you, just contact me, I am totally on board. You really should get a standing ovation for these audios and it would be a shame for all the people who would have greatly benefitted from these recordings, to never get to hear them because they just don't have a working cassette player.I'm sure the books are great, but for those of us who are too busy to sit down and read a book (but spend a lot of time commuting and love to listen to audiobooks while we do stuff), your wonderful recordings in MP3 or CD format would be a godsend."},{"Title":"Live the Life You Love","review":"I am still working through the exercises.

I followed the steps described and it really worked. I had a dream of teaching environmental ethics at university, and now I am! A great thing about this book is that it is really written for sceptics like me who can't stand self-help books. Barbera Sher is particularly suspicious of resolutions and positive affirmations. She states quite clearly that you don't have to improve your character in order to get a good life - good news indeed! Another great thing about this book is that, just as she promises, all the exercises suggested are actually fun. This book moved me from a place of despondancy to a widening sense of wonder and excitement in life. Could you ask for more than that?"},{"Title":"Live the Life You Love","review":"This is one of the best books I have read for improving and understanding your life.The premise of the book is that you can't force yourself to be &quot;successful&quot; or happy. The success gurus generally tell you to discipline yourself, to use the power of choice, to take more action. As Barbara Sher points out, these philosophies have mixed results because people can rarely discipline themselves for very long to do things that they don't feel like doing.Maybe you know that you need to contact certain people to get started on the path towards something you love, but somehow you never get around to it? We need to understand that this doesn't happen just because we are weak and undisciplined -- there's a REASON for our behavior. This book awakened me to the concept of resistance. There are many different possible reasons that we experience resistance to doing things that we know we need to do. But if we try to just force ourselves to do things, then inevitably it will become too uncomfortable and we will quit, or &quot;forget&quot; about it.In addition to resistance the book describes how to awaken yourself to things that you might love to do, and gives numerous techniques for helping you on the path to doing them. I will refer to this book again and again as I pursue my goals and dreams.Overall this book is much better organized and written than her book &quot;I could do anything, if only I knew what it was&quot;.

The author explains why positive thinking, affirmations, and willing and wishing aren't always successful.She describes how everyone is motivated differently and by using her techniques you will be able to determine what motivates you. She will help you learn how to take steps to make your desires come true even when you feel like you can't possibly succeed. The author describes techniques for a strong imaginary support system that will help you achieve your goals.This book is very different than the usual &quot;you can do it&quot; book.

As it is now, I got my belief in what I want reinforced, which is a good thing. Also, I like the way this book cuts through some New Age type mythology, like make-believe affirmations. (I prefer the Popeye affirmation: \\"I yam what I yam\\"!) What the book and the exercises really do is playfully make you start looking outside the box; the box consisting of all your tired old habits and beliefs.The only time I noticed the book was written a decade ago was when reading about how to use the internet.

Blake is a Pediatrician, who just after joining a practice in Whitehorn, sees Nate Dovesong who has an allergic reaction to a bee sting and realizes that this is his son, whom he knew nothing about.This book is Blake trying to gain the love and respect not only from Nate, but from his mother Serena as well. It seems to him that he is doing all the wrong things, because he didn't have a positive dad role model, he just seems at a loss to know what to do right. But with the help of Serena and even Nate himself he seems to come into his own.This is a very good book, just like the other two, I'm really looking forward to the next nine books.

While treating a college friend's son for what he suspects is a hereditary allergic reaction to a bee sting, he comes to the conclusion that this boy is his son. Rather than deny it, Serena Dovesong confirms his claim and, surprisingly, encourages his attempts to bond with Nate. She claims their father-son relationship has nothing to do with their friendship or their relationship.Blake and Serena have no idea where their relationship will go. Blake is afraid Serena and Nate don't need him in their life and Serena fears Blake will only view them as an obligation he must fulfill. Nate surprisingly prefers to keep his own counsel on the matter. What Blake and Serena learn, however, is that love and obligation go hand in hand. Blake's love for Serena and Nate propels him to want to care for and protect them even as the circumstances surrounding Nate's birth, as well as her own childhood, cause Serena to fear being beholden to the man she has loved for years.Jennifer Greene has written a good story about a man whose feelings of being rootless are quelled when he falls in love with Serena and the incredibly bright child they've created together. Her writing is steady and the characters she's drawn are strong. Much of Blake's individual development stems from the integration of an overarching subplot. But that, in turn, also works in favor of the development of Blake's connection with the Dovesongs."},{"Title":"You Belong To Me (Montana Mavericks)","review":"Got book and discovered it is one of many, so many..

The author looks at Carlos Fuentes and Juan Rulfo as two male writers who question the Mexican code of Masculinity in their work, and then she moves to SOr Juana, of course; the author makes the frightening point that between Sor Juana, writing in the mid 17th century, and Rosario Castellanos, writing in the mid 20th century, there exists a 300 year gap in the Narration of the life of Mexican women in their own words and perspectives. The author also points the complicity of the Catholic church, long an arm of the authoritarian government here, in oppressing women and even teaching them to love their bondage into the binary role of mother/wife (la virgen de guadalupe) or betraying slut (la malinche).The author also discusses the vast class disparity in this country, where most women even of the educated classes don't read books or consider ways to create new narratives for themselves. Further, even the majority of women writing in mexico over the past 50 years ( Castellanos, Garro, Poniatowska, Loeza, etc) write from the perspective of the very upper crust, which obviously does not speak too much of the plight of the indigenous or mestiza classes.

The fact that, after her father's passing, she herself became a Christian Scientist (and lived into the 1960's) makes her perspective even more valuable and interesting. It should be noted that Clara is NOT a typical Christian Scientist, so her thoughts may not fit with either the simply pro-Christian Science or anti-Christian Science crowd, but this fact makes her observations and her conclusions all the more meaningful to those looking for the truth about Mark Twain's thoughts on the religion rather than simply seeking for ballast for their already formed prejudices. A most worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Awake to a Perfect Day: My Experience With Christian Science","review":"Clara Clemens, daughter of Mark Twain, became a Christian Scientist despite (or in spite of) her father's scathing criticisms of Mary Baker Eddy and her religion, Christian Science.Twain wrote articles for years investigating the woman and the religion, pouring over financial and legal documents, comparing several revisions of the textbook and all of the miscellaneous writings, expounding on the church manual, collecting countless interviews.His position was unequivocal, calling her a money-grubbing and power-hungry tyrant, with childish prose and unoriginal ideas, a huckster bilking her flock with absolute power. He feared Christian Science would continue its rapid growth and take over the modern world.He compiled his articles into book form, wrote more, and fought his publisher for four years (who delayed and capitulated to protestations from Christian Scientists, in Twain's opinion), but finally published just three years before his death.In Clara Clemens' Awake to a Perfect Day, published 45 years after her father's death, she claims he had a complete change of heart on Eddy's character.Was this discovery from a diary or a conversation they had together many years ago?No. Clara Clemens, read a paragraph in one of Twain's posthumous biographies that seemed to praise Eddy.Unfortunately, the satire was lost on poor Clara.Although, the satire was also lost on the biographer, Albert Paine, a patron of mental healing, who oddly conjectured this one conversation was at odds with Twain's very public and longstanding convictions.[...]The conversation took place in 1906, while Twain was still working to publish his book, Christian Science.He said to Paine, \\"Mother Eddy deserves a place in the Trinity as much as any member of it.\\"For anyone who's read Twain's book, we know he especially despised Eddy's self-deification, articulating how she vaulted herself on the level of Jesus, slightly above the Virgin Mary.He also berated Eddy for allowing her \\"chattel\\" to call her Mother, prompting Eddy to revise the church manual shortly before her death.But Clara, being either obtuse or willfully ignorant, cherry-picked the Trinity comment as all the proof she needed of a man who had a demonstration and saw the Truth about her dear Leader.Her book opens:\\"Many people know that my father, Mark Twain, wrote a book against Mary Baker Eddy. But little attention has been drawn to his extravagant praise of her, which was recorded by Albert Bigelow Paine in his biography of my father.\\"She continues:\\"he placed Mrs. Eddy on a level with the Trinity, he was using the most startling language he could invent to express his excessive admiration for her achievement.\\"No mention of how this conversation from 1906 reconciles with the opposite opinions held concurrently, loudly and clearly, in Twain's own words.From Twain's book, Christian Science, published in 1907:\\"Already her army of disciples speak of her reverently as 'Our Mother.'\\"\\"Our divine origin. It suggests Equal again. It is inferable, then, that in the near by-and-by the new Church will officially rank the Holy Family in the following order:1. Jesus of Nazareth.--1. Our Mother. 2. The Virgin Mary.\\"\\"although she may regard 'self-deification as blasphemous,' she is as fond of it as I am of pie.\\"\\"[Profiling Eddy's character] Grasping, sordid, penurious, famishing for everything she sees - money, power, glory - vain, untruthful, jealous, despotic, arrogant, insolent, pitiless where thinkers and hypnotists are concerned, illiterate, shallow, incapable of reasoning outside of commercial lines, immeasurably selfish.\\"Clara's book is just an embarrassment, an attempt to rewrite history from one satirical comment.Oh, and she also did rewrite history. After Twain's death, Clara and Paine edited the autobiographical works of Twain, but censored all anti-Christian Science statements for several years.She also, as the sole heir, prevented the publication of Twain's, Letters from the Earth, for 23 years.Unfortunately, for Christian Scientists, this book's existence is all that's needed to satisfy in their minds that Twain held a nuanced and respected view of Eddy.Understanding Clara's motives and actions require just an inkling of critical thinking, but Christian Science promotes the opposite.More than anything, this book is an illustration of the Christian Science mindset: latching on to a ridiculous idea with no evidence but desire, expounding on it, and clinging to it in the face of overwhelming disconfirming evidence."},{"Title":"Death's Deal","review":"\\"Death's Deal\\" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved.

They are Aum Truthseekers, men devoted a religious cult, and willing to die at their leader's command. When their leader was found guilty of murder in a court of law and given the death penalty, the judges who condemned him as a madman rather than a savior then unwittingly condemned themselves as well.Dr. Carol Mayer would rather enjoy the waters of Choctawatchee Bay than deal with a sudden influx of upper respiratory complaints. But when a patient dies in her waiting room, she realizes this is not the ordinary flu. She reports the epidemic to the Centers for Disease Control, but only one man can possibly locate a hoped-for vaccine: Beck Casey.Beck is a former CIA expert on biological warfare, where he held a job he once believed only existed in fiction. When he fell in the hands of the Russian Mafia, enduring interrogation and torture, Beck nearly died. He returned to the State an empty man, retiring from the CIA, and accepted temporary teaching positions in universities across the country. Now his country needs his expertise in epidemics, pandemics and bioplagues, as well as the social breakdown they create. Worse, his recall requires him to work hand and glove with the people who nearly destroyed him.Author Earl Merkel pens a novel of lethal intensity in FINAL EPIDEMIC. Readers will be interested to note that Penguin/Putnam originally scheduled FINAL EPIDEMIC for publication last year, but it was delayed following the September 11, 2001 attack because of content. Terrorism, warfare, and horrific situations all make FINAL EPIDEMIC a chillingly timely novel that confronts the moral and ethical issues of stemming a plague that can wipe out eighty percent of the world's population. In only four days, this virus leaves leaders with impossible scenarios, with no cure and no recovery. Riots raze cities, public buildings burn and quarantine and martial law are ineffective. This shifting narrative allows the reader a glimpse of cross cultural issues, cultist and militia mentality, and personal ramifications. A tense, roller coaster ride that readers will find impossible to put down, FINAL EPIDEMIC comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Final Epidemic:: A Novel of Medical Suspense","review":"This book could have been a really good book if it stuck to it's premise of being a bio terrorism thriller.

We know more about how the kid hates her parents than what happens on the ground once the virus is released. I wanted to know what was happening to the people stuck in Manhattan. Nothing but a passing mention. I want to know how Florida is breaking down. I want to know what the state government is doing. I want a death toll. I want more about the riots. Instead way too many subplots. More time spent on a loading dock in Montana than where the virus breaks out. I want to know how the world is dealing with a global suspension of air traffic.

One month later, patients near death begin to fill a Miami hospital. Within hours attending physician Dr. Carol Mayer begins to suspect this is going to be a flu epidemic of unprecedented proportions, but tests can't pin down which flu strain it is and the U.S. government struggles to contain the secret. On the same day, Dr. Beck Casey, a former CIA agent whose title is now an academic one, reports to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta on an unwanted secret mission-to join with the Russian government in tracking down a Japanese cult believed to have been developing a deadly virus unknown to man for several centuries. In Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Beck's daughter, who lives with her mother, makes plans to sneak away for a weekend in Miami with two of her girlfriends.Thus begins a riveting and utterly frightening tale of how the end of the world could happen, and it's all too plausible.FINAL EPIDEMIC takes you on an unrestrained roller coaster ride between Russia and the U.S. as Beck struggles to find the virus before it's unleashed. But as we soon learn, it has already been unleashed and is spreading rapidly, first in Florida and next in New York through a series of incidents only a master storyteller of Merkel's caliber could depict. There are quite a few sub-plots, all equally fascinating but too involved to go into here, except to tell you it's easy to see why this book is making such an impact even though it's been out less than a month. It's impossible to predict what will happen nextFINAL EPIDEMIC's tension rapidly builds as you turn the pages. I can't recall being this uptight while reading a book since I read Debt of Honor. Merkel just doesn't let go. His writing is sharp and crisp, the action doesn't stop, ever. As for character development, Merkel wowed me there, too. The internal relationships and struggles Beck has to wade through while he fights this terrifying battle of time are astonishingly thorough and bittersweet.I can't recommend this book highly enough. Signet has a real winner this time. The only complaint I have is that there was no mention anywhere in the book about the author except his name, which I think is a shame, but I'm sure the next book will rectify that. Earl Merkel is heading rapidly toward the top, no doubt about it in this reviewer's mind.Beth Anderson, Rendezvous Review Magazine and AllAboutMurder.com"},{"Title":"Final Epidemic:: A Novel of Medical Suspense","review":"It all started in Fort Walton Beach, Florida when Dr Carol Mayer's emergency room began to fill up with tourists complaining of cold and flu-like symptoms. Within hours, it was obvious this was no summer cold or flu.

As the CDC heads to Florida, and the wheels of government begin turning, former CIA bioterrorism expert, Beck Casey, is called back inside for a mission he can't refuse. Washington is already aware of this deadly virus, even the almost impossible circumstances of where it came from and what it can do, and feel Beck's expertise is their best weapon against what could turn out to be a pandemic of unrivaled proportion. As the virus begins to spread worldwide, cities are quarantined, hysteria mounts, law and order collapses, and citizens begin to act irrationally. Beck Casey circles the globe, forming alliances and meeting with some of our worst enemies to stop this scourge and save the human race, and this mission has become very personal. His only daughter, he learns, is vacationing at ground zero, Fort Walton Beach..... Tighten your seatbelt, Earl Merkel is about to take you on the roller coaster ride of your life with his marvelous debut novel, Final Epidemic.

You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Final Epidemic:: A Novel of Medical Suspense","review":"Earl Merkel's chilling novel of bioterrorism is the kind of book that'll keep you turning the pages until three in the morning.Premise: a highly infectious, genetically altered killer flu virus is released on the US and Russian populations, apparently by a cult of religious fanatics, who then, like the Heaven's Gate cult of a few years ago, commit mass suicide. There is no antidote and no vaccine. Unless some miracle occurs millions will die. This is a doomsday scenario as ripe as fallen fruit, and as poisonously possible as an Osama bin Laden daydream.Beck Casey, ex-CIA bioweapons expert, is the central character. His specialty is the social and political consequences of bioterrorism. He's primarily a historian who knows how people will behave during a murderous epidemic. Because he wrote an expert's book on the subject, he is called in by the President to help deal with the unprecedented emergency. The virus, an altered form of the Spanish flu that killed 40 million people in 1918, has broken out in the panhandle area of Florida and in Moscow. Russian President Putin, in a desperate attempt to stop the spread of the virus, has ordered the gassing of people in his affected area. The death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands. (The Russians look as bad here as they did in spy novels during the Cold War.)The US President is as yet planning no such draconian measure, but when news of the horrific response by the Russians breaks in the press, the US populace is thrown into panic. Marshal law is declared. A large area around the Florida panhandle is quarantined and all public forms of transportation are halted. Gas is severely rationed, shooting the black market price up to something like twenty dollars a gallon. There is rioting in the streets and the national guard is called out. Those trying to escape the quarantined areas are shot. The Center for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health and every other agency of the federal government, including the CIA and the FBI are directed to work toward finding the persons responsible, controlling the populace, and developing a vaccine.And this is just day one.Merkel paints a vivid portrait of what a bioterrorist attack might be like, and he gives a plausible rationale for who did it and why. Although rightly billed as a medical thriller, this is also very much an espionage thriller. There are double agents, CIA \\"spooks,\\" militia crazies, jet fighter pilots, ex-KGB thugs, psychopathic killers, straight-shooting FBI agents, doctors, politicians, heads of state and a stray congressman or two all intensely involved in this worse case scenario.Although there are a number of female characters, one an FBI agent, another a doctor, and of course Beck's ex-wife and daughter, this is a mass market novel with the emphasis on action and intrigue that will appeal primarily to men. Most of the characters, as is typical in this genre, lack psychological depth, but not all. Merkel is especially good with the villainous ones--the ruthless, power hungry, Alexi; the sadistic super professional master of torture, Ilya; and the loony toon, Cappie, are the most intriguing. There are some excellent action sequences that will leave you oblivious to your surroundings as your eyes race along the lines of text.Merkel's vision is also provocative in the questions it raises about the morality and efficacy of torture (if there's a vaccine somewhere, do you torture people to get to it?) and about the sorts of unimaginable trade offs our leaders may have to make in dealing with terrorism (do you opt for millions dead to prevent tens of millions from dying?).The narrative is professional, always in control and focused: the book reads easily and compels our interest with just the right amount of characterization, suspense and interesting dialogue. It is carefully plotted and very well edited. The proofreading is also first rate. It is well researched and contains an ample amount of what I call \\"psychological veracity\\" so that the events seem real and the characters sound and act real. A tremendous amount of work went into this book.Bottom line: this is a page turner with a fine authentic feel. Can a Hollywood production be far behind?"},{"Title":"Final Epidemic:: A Novel of Medical Suspense","review":"It begins with a pounding headache, joint pain, and a runny nose. The typical summer cold in appearance and it is highly contagious. For some, the symptoms escalate rapidly and within hours they are dead. For others, the agony goes on as the coughing slowly worsens and the vomiting begins. The lungs begin to shred and the victims begin to drown in their own bodily fluids.Instead of a summer cold, a bioweapon has been unleashed into Florida and Russia by a doomsday cult in Japan. When their cult leader is sentenced to death for the 1995 Sarin gas attack the cult pronounces sentence on the world. The virus, a modified version of the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed millions is released. The cult commits ritualistic suicide condemning humanity to its fate.As civilized society begins to crack at the seams, the President summons Beck Casey, now a professor from his self imposed exile. During his work with the CIA, Beck wrote the book on biological warfare and its implications on society. Beck has bad memories from his CIA work and for justifiable reasons is less than thrilled to be dealing with the CIA, let alone having to go back to Russia. Regardless of his feelings, his mission is to find a vaccine, a serum, anything left behind by the cultists that might save humanity from its fate.This book is very well written and as enjoyable as any fictionalized novel on the subject could possible be. Before the terror attacks of nearly two years ago, I looked at such books as nothing more than escapist literature much like killer asteroids from space, rogue comets, and the like. Doomsday scenarios that I wasn't likely to ever see or worry about. Just nothing more than a fun read as people tried to survive.Then the attacks happened and the son of my best friend who just happened to be a little late for work that day was still on a ferry as the first plane struck. Others were not so lucky and lives were lost. While I may live half a country away, I haven't forgotten and won't. For me, such books aren't escapist fun reads anymore as they have become all too real.That certainly is not intended, or to be taken as, a criticism of the author or his book. The story is well written with numerous subplots and multiple characters. The novel is very well paced and incredibly realistic.

A Japanese cult, Aum, which released the Tokyo subway nerve gas released this altered flu in Ft Walton Beach Florida and Russia and later their surrogate releases it in New York City to \\"trigger a worldwide religious uprising\\". How this altered Spanish Flu would lead to a religious uprising was never explained. And why start with Florida and Russia when there are larger more concentrated world population centers was never explained either.

However, VIX kills around 5% of the population (three hundred million people) due to compromised immune system such as the very sick, very young and very old.2) Release a newly found vaccine that cannot help those already infected but will prevent infections.

Soon, personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are recommending that Northwest Florida be quarantined.An identical outbreak in Moscow prompts Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin to contemplate the nerve gassing of tens of thousands of Muscovites to control the bug's spread.Meanwhile, Dr. Beck Casey, currently a visiting academic at the University of Chi-cago, is called upon by the government to track down the perpetrators of this potentially world-ending peril.Casey is a former CIA field agent who left the service after being captured and tor-tured by the Russian Mafia. He's an expert on biological warfare and its effects on the civilian sector - but after his experiences in the former Soviet Union he's none to anx-ious to get back in the saddle, especially after learning that his 15-year-old daughter has gone missing in the flu zone, and his ex-wife has vanished trying to find her.\\"Final Epidemic\\" carries the reader on a dizzying global jaunt, from the creepy inner sanctum of the KGB to the back rooms of the White House and a forbidden compound of the Aum Asahara sect in Japan.It is the Aum, authors of the deadly Tokyo subway nerve gas attack of 1995, who are being blamed for this final epidemic. But are they the real villains?The book also explores the dark world of American militia organizations and the backstage machinations of the federal government; a cynic might not be able to tell one from the other.A great deal of the book takes place in Northwest Florida. Beachgoers on Okaloosa Island ponder the strange illness that has ruined their vacation to the Emerald Coast. Fort Walton Beach High School becomes a triage site. Eglin Air Force Base is closed to the public and nobody knows what's happening behind the gates.Eventually, all of Northwest Florida is cordoned off from the outside world, an experience reminiscent of 1995 and the aftermath of Hurricane Opal.Merkel is an ink-stained wretch from the newspaper trade and his skills as an inter-viewer and researcher plainly show in \\"Final Epidemic.\\" The book is extraordinarily well researched and many of its references either actually exist, have recently taken place or are about to happen.For example, the book posits that a statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the man who in the 1920s organized the Soviet Union's dreaded secret police force the Cheka, would be restored to its place of honor in Moscow's Lubyanka Square outside KGB headquarters after mobs tore it down in 1991. In fact, Russians are talking about doing exactly that.But it is Merkel's skills as a writer that add dimension to the story. His prose is neither threadbare nor overwrought, the characters are living, breathing people, and the book makes intelligent statements about life and the world.Readers who don't usually read contemporary thrillers will enjoy seeing Northwest Florida figure so prominently in a book issued by one of the largest publishers in the United States.But chances are \\"Final Epidemic\\" will beguile even non-fans. Merkel has taken the best qualities of authors like Robin Cook, Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlum and synthe-sized the mix into a book that has the taut pacing, accessible characters and page-turning quotient of a best seller.\\"Final Epidemic\\" offers a scary glimpse behind today's headlines about West Nile, anthrax and terrorism. And something else to remember:Flu season is almost upon us."},{"Title":"Final Epidemic:: A Novel of Medical Suspense","review":"In his first book, Earl Merkel combines compelling storytelling with chilling authenticity. He's taken a topic that makes us freshly vulnerable, and treated it with a powerful narrative.The threat of bioterrorism is perhaps too real to comprehend, but in Merkel's capable hands, it is woven into a plot of complex dimensions, yet highly readable. There are enough turns and surprises to keep even the most ardent thriller fan glued to the page.In Beck Casey, Merkel has created a well layered hero we care about throughout the book.He's made him intriguing, intelligent, yet accessible. His relationship with his ex and his daughter become a central point of the tragedy that helps us put the whole bioterror scare in perspective. Beck is a historian who works for the government in an illusive capacity that is highly original for the genre.Final Epidemic is also populated with a wide range of interesting characters in the highest circles of an international world of politics, spies, and medical experts. But the book never becomes lofty, preachy or reaches over our heads. Its fascinating prodedural detail is almost like a character onto itself. How would the government handle an attack of this proportion, how would decisions be made by the President that are much to awful to even contemplate? Merkel takes on that challenge with thought provoking solutions.Ultimately, despite its heady subject matter, Final Epidemic is a page turning thriller that bodes well for a promising author, already in command of his craft. There is a central mystery that unfolds with satisfaction. Yet the book has powerful moral themes that build with each revelation.Final Epidemic unlike Outbreak or some of the other plague thrillers in fiction and film, takes us further than perhaps we'd want to go, but in the hands of a confident writer, we have the courage to get through it all."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"My father heard these stories as a child.

Pyle always sees to it that bullies, evil magicians, cheaters and older nasty siblings get their comeuppance. Little ones enjoy that aspect. Great archaic words are dusted off along with long disused similies and metaphores. It's the kind of book that comes to mind when you meet a bright eyed new child who has read everything else or seen everything else. At age 70 I still keep a copy in my bed's head board. Rap, tap, tap he knocked at the door."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"The Wonder Clock book has been a favorite source of bedtime stories for three generations of Leadley boys (my father, myself and and my son). It is best read (and read and read ...) from ages 7 to 10. The book contains 24 separate faux fairy tales that are just the right length for a 15 minute bedtime story. The short stories are bound together by a metastory of the &quot;wonder clock&quot; that whisks the narrator off to observe and recount the other 24 tales. Each story is preceded by a short, illuminated poem, starts with a scrollwork capital and contains at least two wonderfully ornate illustrations. DO NOT buy a copy of this book which doesn't contain the original illustrations! They are part of the &quot;wonder&quot; for young readers. The stories are set in the Middle Ages somewhere in northern Europe (&iquest;Belgium, Holland or southern Germany?) and feature lots of minor kings, princes, princesses, woodcutters, swineherds, ruffians, rogues and magical creatures.Caveats:1) Although the Wonder Clock book can be read alone by precocious readers as early as second grade, I would recommend a joint reading the first time through with asides on morality. It is my belief that the actions in stories that feature villians being dragged to death behind wild horses, beatings, blindings, whippings, etc. need to be given moral context when a young child is first exposed to them.2) I'm not sure whether this book would have as powerful an appeal to girls. Among us, my grandfather, my father and I have only raised one girl out of ten children (my aunt) and don't have much experience to offer. Upon reading the book again from an adult prospective, I've found the female protagonists (the wise queen, the wise princess, the magical Swan Maiden, etc.) curiously passive. Even Princess Golden Hair, who treks to the end of the earth in search of her beloved husband banished by magic, seems unassertive.Conclusion: Kids, especially boys, love it. Don't feed it to them unadulterated :-)."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"I agree with everything Scott Leadley said, with the additional comments that 1) my daughter, now 10, has always loved these stories as much as my son, in spite of the lack of active female characters (at least on the side of Good); 2) Pyle, like Kipling, understood how to write a story that would be read aloud to children. The paragraphs are short, the vocabulary pointed, and something interesting happens two or three times a page; 3) as Pyle admits in the introduction, the elements of the stories are extracted and mixed from classic fairy stories; for example, in one story the hero kills a dragon by digging a pit, waiting until the dragon crawls over him, and stabbing it in the belly, an obvious borrow from the event in the 'Volsunga Saga' in which the hero Sigurd kills Fafnir the dragon. If you know the older stories you'll enjoy spotting Pyle's sources."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"I have been searching for this book for quite a while. The stories included are gloriously written and the illustrations are phenomenal. The reason I started looking for it again was because my Grandson will soon enjoy it.

I will get him his very own copy and I know he will enjoy it as much as I."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"The narrator of the twenty-four stories (plus an introduction) finds a special clock in Father Time's attic, which strikes on the hour with songs and puppet dances. \\"Four and twenty marvelous tales, one for each hour of the day\\" all start with a verse to coincide with that particular hour. Drawings are included to add further depth. Each ends with a morality lesson, which never interferes with the story, but helps wrap up that entry.This nineteenth century collection is remarkable in different ways depending on the reader. The tales provide insight into daily household life and the morality of a bygone era. The contributions also furbish delightful fairy tales for the young at heart that are enhanced by superb figures of speech and tremendous illustrations with a finale moral lesson. This collection is a winner and will send many a reader searching for other works by Howard Pyle.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"This is the most wonderful collection of fairytales, which I first encountered in the third grade and have reread countless times since.

Great stories, and the verbiage and illustrations (by howard pyle) are the best. The paperback --also listed for sale here--doesn't seem to have the illustrations, or they are not mentioned. If you at all like the original Grimms Fairy Tales, you'll love this book"},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"The Wonder Clock is one of my favorite books of all time. I am now 76, but I read it (and it was read to me) throughout my childhood. Its stories had morals, but they were subtle; your nose was not rubbed in it. The language is stimulating, because it\`s slightly archaic, not slangy. Some of the stories are dramatic and some are very funny. (Some would be scary to 3-4 year olds.)In subsequent years in my professional life, I came to realize that these stories are about peasantry--its moral sense, its lack of productivity, its class structure. In fact, when I was in graduate school, I was detailed to assist another grad student from Central Europe in writing his dissertation. He was himself a peasant and wanted to explain to Americans what peasantry was all about. His English was excellent, but his writing skills were meager. If I had never read The Wonder Clock, I could have made nothing out of it.I suppose the point is that Wonder Clock can be enjoyed at many levels. Kids love the fanciful stories that are a little more tart than Mother Goose. And the parent can get a lot out of them, too. I have read this book to my grand children and they loved it."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"I'll keep it short and sweet, the *Dodo press* edition of this classic title is *completely without illustrations.* This book is robbed of much of its beauty and utility without them.Do not order the Dodo Press version.

I already have the hard cover; have had it for as long as I can remember and grew up on these wonderful tales. Each tale is accompanied by beautiful illustrations and offers some wonderful wisdom and wit. Two thumbs WAY up ;o)"},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"This book has been in my family for four generations, the 1912 edition having been given to my father by his grandmother in 1948.The premise of the story is given in the introduction; the narrator happens upon a marvelous clock in Father Time's attic, which strikes the hour with songs and puppet dances. Twenty-four stories follow, one for each hour of the day. Each story begins with a verse that corresponds to the hour of the day: lighting the fire, preparing breakfast, sending the children to school, making the noonday meal, milking, tea, bedtime. The verses alone are fascinating, as they bring to life the househould routines of a very different era.The stories are illustrated with Howard Pyle's remarkable drawings. Each tale has a frontispiece for the title, and the beginning of the text and each picture caption is heralded with a large ornmental letter like those in illuminated manuscripts. The illustrations are gorgeous. Pyle was fond of capturing scenes of nobility and royal splendour, pastoral life, and witchcraft. Some are stylized portraits of princesses in exquisite gowns and classic poses, while others demonstrate Pyle's gift for caricature and expression.The stories themselves are wonderful, full of heroes and heroines, bravery, beauty, wits and trickery. Although there are allusions to mystic and Christian themes, and to folklore and fables, most of the stories will be unfamiliar and fresh to modern readers. The langauge is rich with metaphor, droll imagery, and dialogue that is made to be read aloud. As with Aesop's fables, the stories are meant to instruct, but the morals take a back seat to the storytelling, at least until the conclusion of each tale, and a great deal is left up to the reader to interpret.This was my favorite book as a child, and I still turn to it on sleepless nights. But our beloved family heirloom is growing very delicate, so I am very glad that the book is still in print. I hope to share it with my own children someday."},{"Title":"The Wonder Clock","review":"I bought this book from the recommendation of Livingmath.net's booklists. We love fairy tales, and this book was supposed to tie into a time theme for math studies. Unfortunately, this book has nothing at all to do with time. It's merely a book of fairy tales.The book is introduced with an story about a \\"wonder clock.\\" Each chapter is preceded by a portion of a poem that goes through the 24 hours of the day. But the stories themselves have no connection to that particular time or any time at all. They are fairy tales, plain and simple. There is no math in this book. This is not a living math book. A living book, yes, but not a math book.Some of the stories are better than others. At the end of about a fourth of the stories, my daughter will look at me and say, \\"THAT was weird!\\" Yes, in fairy tales, you have to suspend disbelief. But talking sausages, a fox who marries and then later eats his goose wife, and a rabbit who begs a prince to chop of its head to break a spell all seemed too far-fetched even for fairy tales. On the positive side we've enjoyed some of the unique vocabulary and expressions as well as the wonderful illustrations. So it's not a total loss."},{"Title":"Sprachenpolitik in Mittel- und Osteuropa (Passagen Diskursforschung) (German Edition)","review":"Another book for those interested in European language policy.

Of particular interest is Seidlhofer's essay about the role of the native speaker in FLL."},{"Title":"Egg of Darkness (Roxanna & The Quest for the Time Bird)","review":"This is a well-drawn, very readable story. The narrative format is familiar: it starts with an elder, training the young generation in the old ways. The youth begins the recitation --It moves into a pleasant fantasy tale, even though the leading character (Roxanna) ends in a puzzling way. There is some mild nudity, notable for the variety of figures assigned to the different individuals. There are some unexplained aspects to the story, but this book is fourth in the series - if I had read the earlier books, it might have held together better.Letendre has given us an enjoyable and somewhat unusual comic. If I find the earlier volumes at a good price, I'd like to fill in the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Description & Setting: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Believable World of People, Places, and Events (Write Great Fiction)","review":"I really enjoyed the easy flow and examples illustrated throughout this work.

Yawn... Also, the usefulness of the suggested free-writing exercises (\\"focus on the past\\" and \\"focus on the present\\") is questionable.Chapter 3 is 99% extraneous material to make the book 212 pages. It covers literary devices such as personification, symbolism, allusions, analogies, similes, and metaphors, including adverbs, adjectives, and punctuation.Chapter 8 comprises commentaries on setting and description as they relate to historical fiction, mystery, science fiction, Westerns, romance and horror. They are too superficial to be of practical use.\\"Your Title\\" on page 167 disappoints. The author does not give any tip for conjuring a good title but merely cites a list of novels as examples of \\"good\\" titles. A Google search trawls out better material on this topic.A few of the author's suggestions are mundane; others should be treated with caution (such as advocating the use of adverbs and adjectives.). For instance, on page 172, he states: \\"A good way to check to see if you are balancing story and voice is to print out chapters or scenes as you finish their first drafts and read them back over carefully.\\" Isn't this obvious?

I have also read its counterpart in this section, Word painting by Rebecca McClanahan, and must say it's really difficult to compare the two.I started off with very little knowledge regarding showing and telling, and for that matter setting. Yeah right, I knew the difference between how to show and tell, but what I did not know was how different it is KNOWING and KNOWING HOW TO do it. In this regard, the book is precious and chock full of excellent advice and examples. What I appreciate most of this book however, is the fact that the front cover promises \\"techniques and exercises for crafting a believable world of people, places, and events\\", and that's exactly what it does.I also have lots of appreciation for the fact that each chapter is summarized in a few, concise reminders of what the chapter was about. And then it ends with a complete summary of each chapter again, pointing out all the most important points mentioned.Whether you're a beginner or an expert, I'd recommend this book wholeheartedly as an addition to your arsenal of must haves. If you believe that you already know it all, don't be surprised when you realize in the end that Ron Rozelle knows a little more than you thought you do.

(The other is the book on revising your novel, which includes maybe two or three chapter that actually address revision.)What was the author thinking? The text winds around and contradicts itself, the exercises are just plain stupid, we learn far more than we need to about the author himself, and although he gives us far too many of his own examples of descriptions, he fails to tell us how to write our own. I actually have a headache from reading the book.I also have a gripe with the author's choice of \\"good\\" and \\"better\\" words.

While the criticisms some others have had are sound, this is by no means a terrible book, and certainly it is not as awful as some would make it out to be. As for the criticism that there is \\"nothing new\\" in the book, that's easy. The author makes the assumption (as he should, seeing as how every other good author who has ever written a non-fiction work on any given subject would do the same) that the reader knows nothing, or little about how to write descriptive passages but wants to know more, so having \\"no new information\\" is an empty criticism. He isn't writing his book for people who already know the concepts, he is writing for those who don't know but want to learn them. The \\"nothing is new\\" criticism is like a math teacher being critical towards a new math book that comes out since it offers \\"nothing new.\\" Obviously the math teacher already knows the concepts that are covered in the math book.But I have spent more than enough time on that. This book will teach you how to describe aspects the reader can see, hear, feel, touch and smell, thus bringing them into the story. It will teach you how little description is too little, and how much is too much. It will teach you how to get the reader to paint a mental picture of the world you create in your story. It will teach you how to apply the other aspects of writing fiction, such as plot, dialogue and character development and how they relate to description. It will teach you how to create a single sentence that is chock full of information that the reader needs to know to understand the context of your story. That is what the author intended, that is what he does, and that is why this book is worth the money."},{"Title":"Description & Setting: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Believable World of People, Places, and Events (Write Great Fiction)","review":"After starting the journey of becoming a published author years ago, I've come across many \\"self-help\\" books on how to write a novel, and my experience is that 90% of them are a load of rubbish.

I took two things away from this book. One, you should use good description. And two, use a journal to write down your sensory observations. The rest of the book's content range from the superficial to the obvious to the questionable. This is the first writing book I've read that extolled the virtues of using adverbs as a writing tool.

Spelling errors (Wurthering Heights, racquet for racket) and weak prose (Rozelle likes to split infinitives with adverbs) weaken credibility, and some of the advice is questionable. Rozelle favors using adverbs to clarify prose instead of finding strong verbs and specific nouns. He also tends to use older books for examples, many at least 15-20 years old. This is especially true when he discusses genre fiction in superficial terms. Some of the book is irrelevant, too, discussing characterization without relating it to setting or description. I'd suggest Monica Wood's book on Description instead of this one."},{"Title":"Description & Setting: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Believable World of People, Places, and Events (Write Great Fiction)","review":"Although this volume is part of the excellent \\"Write Great Fiction\\" series, it's really for those who wish to write mediocre fiction. Grab the other volumes (Characters, Emotion and Viewpoint; Plot and Structure), but skip this one. It's riddled with spelling mistakes, inaccurate quotes and is downright self-contradictory.

It's a struggle to get through."},{"Title":"Description & Setting: Techniques and Exercises for Crafting a Believable World of People, Places, and Events (Write Great Fiction)","review":"Don't be fooled by the bland title. I loved Description and Setting. Yeah, this sounds boring, but I suck at description, so hoped that this would give me a few hints. And did it ever!Let me start by saying that Rozelle is smart enough to not only pick some worthy examples of literature to use as examples, but also explains how and why they can break some of the \\"rules\\" that he lays down. An example of this is found when he explains how the opening from East of Eden works:\\"The Salinas Valley is in northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.\\"This is pure telling rather than showing, a topic that we'll take up in chapter four. It is reportage. But Steinbeck goes on to quickly establish that the place itself is essential to his story and to the narrator. Notice that we meet the place before we meet the narrator or any of the characters; such is its importance to the tale we're about to be told.\\"This is an example of the kind of nuance that Rozelle is capable of going into. He can say, \\"in general, show not tell. But these are places where it might make sense to tell. See this example.\\" That's pretty impressive, and that alone makes this a worthwhile book for any writer who wants to write with similar style and grace.In addition to these lovely examples, Rozelle gives helpful exercises at the end of each chapter, and a rather nice reference guide at the end. (Which I'd like to share with you, but quite frankly, it's rather long.)So, long review and all that but...if what you're after is a book that will really help you think about (and pay attention to), description, setting, and writing intricately nuanced tales, I'd recommend description and setting.

While many of us are blessed to receive this in a positive, healthy manner, others seek it in such a desperate manner that it eventually leads to heartache and self-destruction. Victoria Warren explores this topic in her novel LOVING IN THE DARK.In LOVING IN THE DARK, we are introduced to Samantha. A professional woman, she is like each of us, desiring love and fulfillment. After a bitter split, she meets Isaiah who she later marries. In the beginning, Isaiah seems to be the perfect mate, but as time passes, Samantha discovers that Isaiah is not all that he seems. Underneath the surface, he is abusive and carries secrets that will later play both a pivotal and life-changing role in Samantha's life. What secrets does Isaiah carry? How will Samantha be affected? The answers will surprise and move you.From the beginning, Warren offers a story that is not only honest, but also powerful and real.

Part memoir, part history and wonderfully anecdotal, with characters that chroniclers like Runyon and Winchell and Lardner doted on, Tama Starr (first the child, later the girl and finally the owner-executive running Artkraft Strauss, Jake's neon sign company) pulls the Broadway curtain back on an American story no one has told before--how glitz got to be glitz, and Times Square got to be Times Square. And there's more: provocative stuff on the emotional affects of light and how advertisers use it to sell their wares; how the famous Camel smoke-ring sign was conceived and built; how developers nearly darkened the great white way forever; and, of course, how the New Years Eve ball got to be the New Years Eve ball. Still a ways off from publication (April '98), nonetheless put this on your list if you want a good New York read. Like the Daily News, it's as much New York as you can get."},{"Title":"Signs and Wonders : The Spectacular Marketing of America","review":"I enjoyed this book as much for Tama and Edwards personal enthusiasm for the subject and their behind the scene storys as for the history and insight to the world ofadvertizing and mass marketing."},{"Title":"Signs and Wonders : The Spectacular Marketing of America","review":"\\"Our signs tell us who we are.\\" That's they key point of Tama Starr and Edward Hayman's wonderfully evocative book, \\"Signs and Wonders.\\" This account of the animated super-signs called spectaculars, whose principal habitat was Times Square, is both compelling history and personal narrative-Starr's company is largely responsible for the Square's landmark signs. Thus readers gain original, first-hand information on the creation of such memorable displays as the \\"smoking\\" Camel sign as well as the most enlightening exploration yet of signs as cultural and technological markers. (One lesson learned is that the great handmade neon signs have been totally usurped by prefab vinyl and LED displays--making neon an ever-hotter cultural item.) Photo-illustrated, the book is the best and most comprehensive work on its fascinating subject."},{"Title":"Signs and Wonders : The Spectacular Marketing of America","review":"What a disappointment ! This book goes to show that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. The glitzy, superficial cover accurately warns of the trifling and shallow literary contents awaiting the reader.

Granted I do not really like short story collections--although I had more success with a previous book of short stories picked for my book club. I tried jumping around this book to find something I liked, but it didn't work. The lead characters seemed somewhat interchangable, and I had trouble telling one story that I had begun and not finished from another one that I couldnt stick with. I couldn't stick with a story for more than 2-3 pages. But, that's just me. Give me a novel, or better yet, some non-fiction book of interest any day. Better luck to other readers."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"It's been a month since I finished reading this collection.

One sometimes loses track of good writing in the plethora of books that we read and forget about. I had not read past the first page when I realized that this is the work of a master, a deliberate work of art. The reader is captured by the style and what happens in the stories is not as important as how those happenings are revealed. Then we realize we are reading about ourselves. This is a participatory book in which the reader discovers self in the ordinary experiences of the characters--the fall of a leaf from a tree or a sound in the darkness of a summer night. We are all products of accidental events, and wisdom is elusive as the wind."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"This collection of stories was my introduction to Alice Munro. The stories are well written but, tedious at times. I read this book for a book discussion and there is lots to discuss. I didn't look forward to reading this book after work. The interesting thing is that the more I think about the stories, the more I appreciate them. Except for one of the stories, the plots are really different and Munro is able to tell a person's life in a short amount of time. I recommend this book with reservations."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Ms. Alice Munro once again shows her unique understanding of the feminine spirit in this collection of short story treasures of women searching their souls, seeking and finding themselves through the triumph and tragedy of the journey that is life.

I enjoyed the stories well enough, but they really didn't seem to be as finely wrought and resonant as some of Ms. Munro's ardent defenders claim. Still, I read on, and that's saying a lot. I think the one reviewer who compared Munro to Flannery O'Connor may have unwittingly nailed it, for me. O'Connor is sort of the ne plus ultra of short-story writing provincial women obsessed with certain scenarios, characters, and images, and I've been going back to dip into her complete stories again and again for years. Munro's pretty good, but she's no O'Connor."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"I did not feel anything overwhelming nor inspirational while listening to these stories on the CD. Perhaps reading the book might have lead to a different experience since so many people do love the author. I did expect more, more heart-felt emotion, more drama, scintillating prose but no none of that. Stories that touch chaerters who seem to be going through great emotive periods but author just watches them from a distance describing their clothes instead of their motives. The stories seem to me to be written by a depressed English major who describes scenes but can not go below the skin of the character. Either from lack of understanding or fear, I cant tell.Previous to this, I had just finished reading David Sedaris. OK, he is known as a humorous writer but by Gosh, every sentence of his writing packs more punch than all stories in this book. He is not afraid to tell you ALL. I dont want to say that these stories are flat because I feel intimidated by all the accolades here but thats what they are. Uninspiring - to me."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"This was an okay book. I'm not really into short stories. I only read it because it had gotten such good reviews. It is a book about life and life experiences and because of this it is slightly depressing."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"If you have not read Alice Munro, how I envy you. You have so much pleasure ahead of you. She writes for all of us about wonder- the wonder of everyday life; the small things; the touching things; the things that make you say, yes, this is the human heart; all of these are her fictional world, much as they are our pasts, and our presents. This is a strong collection and an excellent place to get to know what she is about. After this, explore her backlist. My personal favorite besides this is an early collection called,The Moons of Jupiter, which is still in print in a nice paperbak format. I hope you enjoy discovering her as much as I have."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro's newest collection of short stories is about time, how small events change lives, and how different those events look as time passes. Several of the stories span the lifetimes of the characters, focusing on one event that changes things forever.Take \\"Chance,\\" \\"Soon\\" and \\"Silence,\\" a trio of stories about Juliet, a young woman whose choices about who to speak to on a train change her life forever. Munro masterfully picks three incidents, the train ride, a visit home, and a search for a daughter, and through them tells the story of Juliet's life. I found it sad to see how the great passion of the first story ends in an accident by the third. Or \\"Tricks,\\" perhaps the most painful story in the collection. The story opens with Robin saying the most banal thing one could imagine, \\"I'll die if that dress isn't ready.\\" Then we learn why, and when Munro repeats the line again we see it's fraught with meaning. We learn of a chance meeting that offers a promise that's snatched away a year later; only at the end of her life does Robin learn what really happened.Suicides, lost souls and disappointments thread through these stories. Munro's world is a lost and lonely place, and be forewarned--none of these stories promises a happy ending. But they're beautifully written and struck a chord--don't we all recall brief, seemingly trivial moments years later and wonder what if?"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro may well be the best short story writer working today, but what's strange is that at first it's a little hard to see why she's so good. She doesn't use any fancy-pants language, she doesn't worry about making her characters warm and sympathetic, and she doesn't try to reach at the typical sorts of short story epiphanies, the straining towards lyrical proclaiming and the conclusive moment of a personal vision's consolidation.What she offers instead is a conversational tone that is quirky and fractured enough to rise above the blandness of a typical conversational style. For example, this is how she renders a crucial scene in one story where the protagonist has entered the house of a man she has a crush on. Note the parenthesis, the incongruous academic metaphor, and the sentence fragments: \\"Juliet hears the door of the truck close, she hears him speaking to the dog, and dread comes over her. She wants to hide somewhere (she says later, I could have crawled under the table, but of course she does not think of doing anything so ridiculous). It's like the moment at school before the winner of the prize is announced. Only worse, because she has no reasonable hope. And because there will never be another chance so momentous in her life.\\"Furthermore, her stories don't so much ask us to root for the characters so much as to examine them, to consider their mistakes and misperceptions. For example, Munro's stories often break out into reflective moments like this one: \\"While she was running away from him - now - Clarke still kept his place in her life. But when she was finished running away, when she just went on, what would she put in his place? What else - who else - could ever be so vivid a challenge?\\" Personally, I was rooting for her only insofar as she really did want to leave her husband, who's rather grouchy and mean and worth ditching. But Munro doesn't care about making her into an idealized romantic hero; she instead wants to depict something far more difficult to understand, which is why the character would stay with her husband.Also, rather than being a steady climb towards a typical epiphany, her stories derive their structure from what might be called \\"the coincidental epiphany.\\" What I mean by that term is that, over and over in her stories, there are moments of crucial importance that also happen to be utterly coincidental. These moments come as utter surprises and derive their incredible power from the way they occupy the climaxes of a story, the places where what's supposed to be the focus is the protagonist's action and the question of whether it succeeds or fails. Munro's \\"coincidental epiphanies\\" instead recontextualize the concerns that led to the protagonist's actions in the first place.By way of illustration, I'll do a long quotation. The \\"trick\\" this passage refers to had accidentally ruined a love affair the protagonist was in; she is just now realizing that what seemed to be have been fate was really just the result of this random, accidental \\"trick\\":\\"It was all spoiled in one day, in a couple of minutes, not by fits and starts, struggles, hopes and losses, in the long-drawn-out way that such things are more often spoiled. And if it's true that things are usually spoiled, isn't the quick way the easier way to bear?But you don't really take that view, not for yourself. Robin doesn't. Even now she can yearn for her chance. She is not going to spare a moment's gratitude for the trick that has been played. But she'll come round to being grateful for the discovery of it. That, at least - the discovery which leaves everything whole, right up to the moment of frivolous intervention. Leaves you outraged, but warmed from a distance, clear of shame.\\"Throughout her stories, it's as if Munro is saying, \\"the crucial moments in life are often the coincidences, not the moments of decision and action that we think of as the real core of our lives. Stories should thus focus on these moments in order to understand and cope with them.\\" In other words, Munro is a perfect guide to the farcical aspects of human life, the overlooked details and unexpected twists that change everything."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro is a wonder and she has done it again with her latest book of short stories. The stories average about 35 pages in length on average but I finished each one feeling I had read and been captured and engrossed in an entire book. And in many cases, emotionally drained by the experience.She writes about ordinary women at different times in their lives; not a great deal seems to happen, yet a great deal does happen. You are left feeling breathless at the arbitrariness of life, of fate and of chance. In other words, about life. It is so difficult to categorize her writing. She writes of women who are not worldly, not necessarily successful but she imbues her characters with the patina of \\"every woman\\".Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"I have been learning to knit lately, and I'm still at the stage where each stitch is awkward and laborious. Watching my friend and teacher do it is quite different --- smooth and rhythmic, neither too much tension nor too little. I see that knitting is a mysterious architecture of wool and soul in which every loop and turn depends on every other, and with a single missed link the whole web can collapse.Reading the Canadian writer Alice Munro is similar to this. Her stories are woven with such craft that it seems almost as if she is describing something that really happened rather than inventing it. And the consequences of a lucky encounter or a fateful decision are still playing out years later.I must admit that I was intimidated by the prospect of reviewing Munro's latest collection, RUNAWAY, named one of the 10 Best Books of 2004 by the New York Times. She is probably my favorite living writer, and so unpretentious about what she does that the last thing I want is to describe her fiction in words fancier or more self-conscious (in one review, I found adumbrate, transformative, sustenance, and salvation) than the language she uses herself.I'm not alone in feeling perplexed. Jonathan Franzen, writing in the New York Times Book Review (November 14, 2004), was so reluctant to do an ordinary review of this extraordinary writer that instead he produced a (brilliant) list of \\"guesses at why [Munro's] excellence so dismayingly exceeds her fame.\\" And it's true: She is revered rather than celebrated --- no Pulitzer, no Nobel, not even a National Book Award (though she has won plenty of other prizes). Possibly (Franzen mentions this) it has to do with literary form: Short stories (Munro has written only one novel) have not been --- since the days of Chekhov (with whom she is regularly compared) and Saki, Katherine Mansfield and O'Henry --- as valued as much as novels. They're just not considered Big-Deal Lit.But I am procrastinating. Without giving away the often devastating twists and surprises of the plots of these eight stories (if literary fiction isn't supposed to be suspenseful, somebody forgot to tell Munro), this is what I'd say to somebody who has never read her (if you have, you probably already have your own copy of RUNAWAY).The first thing is the characters: I wouldn't say they are memorable in the sense that Emma Bovary or Anna Karenina are, but unlike either of those fictional ladies, they are endearingly ordinary: They don't swan around being melodramatic or heroic or incurably romantic. They are often smart, ardent girls, different from others at school, hungry for books and adventure and mystery --- like Grace in \\"Passion,\\" one of my favorites in the collection. Here, Munro has crystallized the stuff of many a coming-of-age novel --- the innocence and fakery, the fear and the splendor --- into one powerful memory of a seductive family and a reckless ride. This is Munro's gift: She gathers us in with ordinary details, and a whole world opens up.The second thing is the place: not just Canada, but a patch of western Ontario. Munro roots almost all her stories in this area a few hours from Toronto, where she grew up and now lives. \\"I am intoxicated by this particular landscape,\\" she has said, and she seeds it with city people transplanted to the country (like Carla and her husband with their horse farm in the title story, \\"Runaway\\") or country people learning urban ways. There is always a tension between these two, and between other recurrent oppositions as well --- marriage and solitude, survival and suicide, faith and apostasy. Duality runs through her work like a bright thread.The third thing that is so compelling about RUNAWAY is a powerful sense of fate, chance, destiny --- the exact word is unimportant. Frequently the structure of the stories works in a circle; you can't understand the beginning of \\"Trespasses\\" until you have read the end. Or, as in the case of the trio of interlinked stories about a woman named Juliet, you don't understand the implications of an accidental meeting in \\"Chance\\" and a fairly uneventful visit to aging parents in \\"Soon\\" until you read the third story, \\"Silence.\\" These tales aren't just chronologically and thematically connected; what Munro does is more like planting time bombs in the narrative that will explode later on, when you least expect them.This quality is even stronger in \\"Tricks.\\" Robin, a nurse who lives near Stratford, Ontario, goes to see a Shakespeare play (until then, her only passion) and encounters --- yes, by accident --- Danilo, a man from Montenegro. They agree that they will meet again a year later. What happens then is a life --- and we follow Robin until she is in her sixties --- that has the arc and heartbreak and curious detachment of genuine tragedy. \\"Tricks\\" is so bold, so horrifying and at the same time so satisfying that I lived with it for days afterward.Even though these stories are often piercingly sad, they aren't depressing. There is a wonderful strength and survivorship in the girls and women of RUNAWAY. In \\"Chance\\" Munro writes of Juliet's love of Greek (her degree is in Classics) as her \\"bright treasure\\"; in \\"Tricks,\\" similarly, of Robin's anticipation of her next meeting with Danilo: \\"She was aware of a shine on herself, on her body, on her voice and all her doings.\\" And in \\"Passion\\" Grace is told by her fianc&eacute;'s mother, \\"Women always have got something, haven't they, to keep them going? That men haven't got.\\"RUNAWAY feels intimate and universal at the same time --- as if the author is whispering in your ear and seeing into your heart and laying bare your secrets. Perhaps that's because Munro herself has spoken of the extreme vulnerability of the \\"thinly clothed\\" writer who has only \\"the thing you're working on now.\\" Her stories dig under the fences of writer and reader, and it is both disturbing and glorious.--- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Several years ago, I picked up Alice Munro's collection of short stories, Open Secrets, and started reading the first story, \\"Carried Away.\\" Over fifty pages, I experienced half a century of a woman's life and a country's history written with boldness, sweep and utter command. By the time I finished the story, Munro had completely redefined my notions about what a short story could be.Munro's best work continues to astonish, and a lot of it is on display in her latest collection, Runaway. The title story is classic Munro, which is as good as it gets. The runaway is a young woman attempting to flee a stalled marriage, and, ultimately, figure out where she fits in the world. The ending, which ties the fate of the girl's pet goat, also a runaway, with her own, is stunning in its rightness and emotional impact.\\"Passion\\" is almost as good. A teenaged girl, Grace, takes an impulsive car ride and learns some life-altering truths about herself and about the dark currents of despair surging beneath the placid surface of her small town Canadian life. \\"Trespasses\\" is about a younger girl carried unwillingly on the tide of adult deceptions and desires. \\"Tricks\\" hinges on a moment of mistaken identity that changes the direction of a young nurse's life.The least successful part of the collection is a group of three connected stories about Juliet, a callow classics major who cuts off ties to her past, only to have her daughter do the same thing to her many years later. The three stories have the length of a novella, but not the cohesiveness. Nor do any the individual panels in this triptych have the resonance of Munro's best made stories.The story whose impact lingers longest is \\"Powers\\" which is too big in all ways to try and summarize. Read it, and be moved by writing that seems beyond storytelling, that feels like Truth Itself. Reading Munro at the height of her art is like listening to John Coltrane play the saxophone - there's a point where analysis breaks down and all you can do is pay homage to genius.Munro characters all bump up against the same defining question: do you have the courage to be who you truly are? Her stories tend to be about small moments with big implications: those times in a life when possibilities for personal liberation either open up or close down. Since the desire to break free from what constrains us exists within all humans, the concerns of Munro's provincial Canadian girls, though firmly grounded in a time and place, are universal in their implications. These characters affect us so deeply because their successes and failures mirror our own.Only great artists achieve this kind of universality, and that level of artistry is on display in Runaways. The collection doesn't have the sustained brilliance of Open Secrets, but what does? You can only compare Munro to herself, because, in the realm of the short story, she has no peers."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"As many reviewers have noted, Runaway resonates in the mind of the reader with a force that is usually attributed to the concussive thump of a powerful novel. I would agree, it is as though we are getting eight compressed novels in Runaway... six, to be precise, since three of the stories are sequentially connected to each other.So wonderful is her characterization and style that I would have remained interested, if any story had been expanded to be the length of a novel.Having only read one other Munro collection (Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage), I am no expert on her work. However, I would say that I enjoyed this book more than the other, simply because these stories seem to me to have a better resolve about them. They close, but they are not closed. Fine-tuned, their open-ended endings beg to be reflected upon. Runaway was an excellent source of near-endless discussion in my own elite Book Club of Two.I highly recommend this book to any and all. I was thrilled to happen to have my TV on one evening, to see the elegant Alice rise and accept the Giller Prize, for Runaway. I joined in the applause, and startled the cat.The stories are centered around the lives and experiences of women, that is to say, women are the protagonists of each story. As a male reader, I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the themes, the motifs, the relevance and style of each story, and conclude that Munro is not a writer only FOR women. Men who enjoy the very best that writing has to offer us today, should read her.I think my own favorite story was Tricks. The twist of fate, the \\"trick\\" in this story alone, is worth the acquisition of and reading of this book.Runaway is unforgettably good, and makes me want to go on and explore all things Munrovian. The wonderland of Alice Munro."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"I have to admit I was a bit worried that these eight short stories about women may be too oriented toward the female perspective for me to appreciate fully. I am happy to report I was quite mistaken, as author Alice Munro is a gifted writer whose multi-layered writing style can be enjoyed by anyone. And the short story format suits her very well, as she tells amazing stories precisely but without making any compromise in character development or storyline.In the title story, the author describes a young woman's attempt to leave her husband. Things have gone bad for the couple, compounded by the disappearance of their pet goat, Flora, has disappeared. The centerpiece of the collection is a triptych of stories about a woman named Juliet - \\"Chance\\", \\"Soon\\" and \\"Silence\\" - and her relationship with her mother and later with her daughter. \\"Chance\\" takes place in the 1960's and finds Juliet on a train as she unexpectedly discovers love. At the same time, Munro accurately shows Juliet's inner conflict as she hungers for a college education at a time when such notions for opportunity were ridiculed. \\"Soon\\" shows her as a young mother who goes to reconcile with her own parents and her ideas of faith. \\"Silence\\" picks up Juliet's story when she is an older woman estranged from her daughter and wondering what became of her life. The unexpected ending is haunting.The remaining stories highlight aspects of youth both from a young girl's mindset and from the hindsight of an older woman. The best story is perhaps the last, \\"Powers\\", which is divided into titled sections. The first section begins in 1927. The last section, dating in the 1970s, describes a dream of the protagonist. In the dream, Munro writes that the past \\"begins to crumble behind her, to crumble and darken tenderly into something like soot and soft ash.\\" It is this kind of observation that makes the author truly exceptional. She has written a lovely necklace of tales that illuminate human motive and behavior with piercing insight. Munro is a master of the small moment and how each one expands into revelations for which neither her characters nor we ever seem to be prepared. Highly recommended for both genders."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"It doesn't take Alice Munro a lot of pages to tell a story, to build up feelings and believable characters. As a matter of fact, she can do that from sentence one - and move on with a story. What is mot fascinating in this writer body of work - and her latest \\"Runaway\\" is a terrific example - is that she can create a whole world and make it believable, using the amount of words that others would need in an introduction.This world is inhabited by human beings dealing with human issues: love, lost, betrayal, fear, joy. Name a feeling, a sensation and you will find it in her stories. As Jonathan Franzen once said praise doesn't make justice to her, the best thing to do is read her books to understand why Munro is the best heiress to Chekov's style and stories.In \\"Runaway\\" there is a sequence of three stories with the same main character. We start following the life of this woman when she is still in her late teens until when we are able to see her evolution as a human being, a daughter, a wife, a mother. This so called evolution involves many discoveries and deceptions. Since Munro is interested in the intimacy of her characters, what her reader gets is a deep look in the interior of this character throughout the years - and how her opinions and convictions change. Everything is mutable - it only depends on the moment.The stories are always populated by women - some are strong, others are not. But they are always very real, very believable. We meet the girl who thinks she may be adopted, the young woman who meets a man after a play, another woman whose marriage is not happy and she wants to run away, and so on. But what would be banal in the hands of a less gifted writer is complex and interesting in Munro's.Her stories threaten to burst out in life, to leave the pages of the book and create flesh and bones in the real world. But it seems she to work the other way round. Real world is the inspiration to her stories. And this is the best we can expect from a writer, translating real world in art."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"These stories are gorgeous, beautiful pieces with a lot of charm and bittersweet flavors. However, not one of the characters seemed someone I would identify with or care too much about. They all seemed to be controlled and as cold as their northern settings. I understand why readers would admire Munro's writing style and even enjoy these stories, which are all very carefully written with a certain wry fatalistic viewpoint. Munro's truly skilled and talented, but I like to feel a bit more for the characters I read about. I can't tell if the stories didn't live up to the hype, or if they just weren't for me. Because certainly there isn't a lot to criticize with Munro's prose. She's an astute observer and wonderful writer; these particular stories just didn't grab me as I hoped they would."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"These stories are subtle and lush and refract immense light. There is no relationship, especially any regarding women, that is not examined with great care and great insight. Alice Munro is one of the best at capturing women and the ties that bind us together, and sometimes these ties are subtle, and I love how artfully she manages this over the course of this collection. Make sure that you read the stories in order so you can absorb the connections back to previous people and events. \\"Runaway\\" may very well be as strong as \\"Friend of My Youth.\\" This and Jennifer Paddock's brilliant novel-in-stories \\"A Secret Word\\" are easily the best books I've read this year. Easily."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"There is one story of mother and daughter that will absolutely nail your heart to the wall, especially if you are a parent. I won't go into detail, of course, but there is nothing unrealistic or sappy here. In fact, the stories are so well told, so real, that you walk away enhanced, you understand life a little better and you will be more careful in your relationships with family and friends. You also may feel a kinship with Canada and a life so opposite of Hollywood America. I ordered five more Munro books."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"These stories are mostly rather bleak. The prose is skillfully written, but a bit slow and descriptive for my tastes.I also found myself unsatisfied with the endings. They were all anti-climactic, and not in literary, make-you-think sort of way. Just in an unfinished, reached-my-word count sort of way. Some reviews say that this is to reflect real life, and the unfinishedness of real stories. There's probably truth to this. I just don't enjoy the style.Overall, I enjoyed the collection well enough, especially the unusual settings."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"These stories are so unassuming, so. . ., well, I don't want to say ordinary, so let's say quotidian. You don't realize how they are affecting you, until you finish them, and everything that has filled you up leaves you. Through the simplest words and action, she creates something so vivid and relatable. I can see why she's so famous.I loved the stories about Juliet. (CHANCE, SOON, SILENCE). The first story (RUNAWAY) was great as well. I was totally thrown on any motivations of the characters. She gave you just enough to try and figure everything out. Such subtlety is appreciated. Also, PASSION, was wonderful. The plot was a shocker, but the motivations, one's ability to act impulsively, in a dream-like state almost, was captured here. We have all certainly had inexplicable moments such as these. I think my favorite, plotwise, was \\"Tricks\\", seeing as I'm simultaneously reading Stephen King's THE DARK HALF.All in all---really wonderful stuff. I read this collection because I was so moved by THE LOVE OF A GOOD WOMAN. I'm adding something else to my list to read right now."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"I've never read Munro before, and purchased this one after seeing a rave review of \\"Runaway\\".I have only read two or three of the short pieces so far, and find Munro to be a pleasant read, allowing me to do some easy pass-timing."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Reading the prose of Alice Munro is like reading through glass into pure distillation of image. Her words disappear. Her words become window.Window into the lives of her characters. Window into our own lives.For me, the story that hit me like a sack in the stomach was Silence, easily my favorite of the stories in this collection. The story centers on a mother whose daughter makes a devastating decision. That's it, that simple. That's the turn that created what for me is a masterpiece.There are no plot contrivances. Nothing is plot-derived. There is only the gift of masterful storytelling and layered, complex characterization. Easy answers do not exist. There is no pat life. There is no rote happy ending after rote happy ending.Read her for her transparent prose. Read her for her gift of conveying the complexities of life in a language so deceptively plain you might think you could pull it off, too.For whatever reason, just read her."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"If I visited Canada, would look up an Alice Munro character. They are that fleshed out in a totally authentic way. The old axiom: What goes around, comes around\\" is manifest in these stories. What we are, and the behavior and words we produce in being what we are, will be forever with us. Oh, if we could but go back and \\"erase half a line\\"!"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro's collection was not uplifting, but it was unusual and worthwhile because of the author's uncanny ability to marry strong imagery and often unsettling glimpses into her characters' personal motivation. I was very impressed that she did not avoid introducing confused and muddled characters.Initially, it was difficult for me to adjust to the author's writing style (syntax), but as I moved through the book, it became a metaphor for the author's meanderings through a collection of fascinating psyches. The dialogue is good, but the strength of this author is how well she conveys the thoughts and emotions that are not always shared with other characters in the story. Not all the selections were equally impressive, but I found almost all provocative. Ms. Munro has the uncanny ability to command our attention for the duration of her storytelling.As for the publishing technique. It confused me that this book physically resembles a novel with numbered chapters. Most short story collections present title pages for each short story. This format did the author a disservice and confuses purchasers."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro is unsurpassed as a wordsmith. Her language is precise, her storytelling exacting, her style lyrical. I consider her among the ranks of Annie Proulx and Arundhati Roy as a great contemporary female talent.But her Runaway stories are so small and quiet that I find myself struggling to concentrate. They are beautifully told tales, but none too engaging.And I cannot help but notice the seeming gender gap between ratings on this site.I give her a 5 for style, but believe me, this record you can't dance to."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"In a word...wonderful!Alice Munro is a master at character development. Once you read your first Alice Munro you will be addicted. When I read \\"Runaway\\" I wished they were more then short stories - I wanted the characters and stories told to somehow all connect and tie up nicely at the end, but that's not how it works. Each is a short story and the ending is up to one's imagination. I guess that's kind of the fun of reading Alice Munro's work. Always a pleasure and treat to read her work."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"This is the first book by Munro I've read, and now I can see what all the fuss is about. Each story in this collection is a little gem. Munro is a master of the short story form. Her plot lines are simple yet unpredictable and gripping; her characters come alive with a few short stokes. What makes her writing so life-like is that you don't know everything about her characters. What you learn about them is revealed in a few slices of time or short vignettes. As in life, you don't always understand what motivates Munro's characters to do what they do. Munro shows you their actions and describes some of the thoughts they have, but she allows you form your own conclusions. She never \\"forces\\" anything, which is why her stories seem so naturalistic.Some of these stories are terribly sad, particularly the three stories about a woman named Juliet who runs away from her humdrum life as an academic. It starts out optimistically enough - a train ride which seems to offer unlimited possibilities for her to re-invent herself. But the last of these three stories \\"Silence\\", is one of the saddest and most memorable short stories I've ever read. In it, Juliet experiences what it means to \\"run away\\" from the perspective of the person left behind.Munro is a master of the telling detail. She is also a master of the unexpected and yet strangely life-like plot twist. Many of the plots turn on seeming chance happenstance. In this collection she seems almost obsessed with the role chance and caprice play in life.These stories are all highly readable. Some of them build up a degree of suspense more typical of detective stories. The language is simple and spare. Even so, Munro is capable of unobtrusively adding highly sophisticated touches - for example, a character that makes an annual pilgrimage to see a Shakespeare play has her own story crucially influenced by a \\"Shakespearean\\" plot device.I would highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys fine writing and beautifully crafted stories, and who isn't looking for happy endings or unambiguous explanations."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"There's something about Alice Munro. Like William Trevor, Anton Chekhov, James Joyce (in his few gems), she is able to strip her characters to the naked bone, to place them in circumstances--perfectly ordinary, never contrived or melodramatic--that push them to the wall, to that place where they must expose some deep part of their very selves, expose it, recognize it and finally--though not always--accept it. Her stories are always rich in personal detail and often, I can only read one per day. Like incidents that happen to your closest relatives and friends, the stories stay with you and you ruminate about them the next day.The first three stories are linked, indeed they could form a short novel. The others are stand-alone tales. \\"Tricks\\", about a young nurse who meets an exotic man from Montenegro when she takes the train in to Stratford for her annual Shakespeare play, is a stand-out among these stand outs.The last story, \\"Powers\\", leaves you almost shocked. Again, not until you've read the very last words, put the book down and let linger in your mind the closing reference to ashes, does it sink in that the story you've just read is truly one of horror."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"I was disappointed in this collection and was surprised to find so many critics raving about it. Her plot devices here seem forced and amateurish. (Most evident in the title story and in \\"Tricks.\\") Her writing has always been based on interesting coincidences and chance meetings years down the road, but they are becoming more and more unbelievable. Also, her themes are getting tired. They seem to be constricted to tales about cheating wives, spinsters, and poor farmgirls. For better Alice Munro, try \\"Friend of My Youth,\\" \\"Open Secrets\\" or any of her early collections. Three stars because she is still the best writer out there."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"This collection of stories, some which are actually related, are simply wonderful reading, excelletn rpose, artful, funny, mysterious and truly drawing the reader in. Anyone will find this collection good. The characters are truly coming alive, and the writing makes one unable to put down each story and yet yearn for more when theyu are finished. Highly recommended as a gift for anyone.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"\\"Runaway\\" is a compilation of short stories that can be very sad, I'll say that up front. There wasn't a happy ending in the bunch. Still, Alice Munrow captures the souls of the women in her stories, truly revealing their vulnerability, their hearts laid bare. As she does this, she seems to get inside your thoughts and makes you look closer at your own life.\\"Tricks\\", the most notable story, still occupies space in my mind.. It's a story of a chance meeting, hope, anticipations, despair, and then possibly, understanding. All this takes place between just a few short pages which I find amazing.I think this book is about discovering yourself. Alice Munrow has a knack for making you look deep inside yourself and ask some hard questions AND she does it while entertaining you. I highly recommend \\"Runaway\\" if you're the type to stay put and take at look at your own life."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro's stories are less about plot and more about mood --like no other author, she is able to evoke feelings with a single sentence -- to convey a character's despair, loneliness, sense of isolation and brief happiness with only a word or two. I can never quite grasp how she does it.These stories, which take place throughout Canada, are about people escaping, or trying to escape, their narrow lives. Three stories are entertwined with the same characters, and we get almost a novella that is impossible to put down. In each case, Munro manages to pull us in to the minds of her characters, even when, as is often the case, we have nothing whatsoever in common with them--and even though they are not always likeable.I won't detail the stories here because they need discovery. Simply open the book and fall into the pages and be thrilled by Munro's always brilliant writing."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Munro, and it far exceeded my expectations. That said, this wonderful collection is also more than capable of breaking your heart.The title story was my least favorite of the collection,instead loving the surprising and superior \\"Tricks\\", which left me with a lingering ache. All of the stories run on a somewhat familiar terrain of love, longing, regret,and betrayal, three of the eight centering on the same woman at different stages of her life. The stories are painful in their honest representations of the heart. Yet that's what also makes it such terrific writing"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Seventy-three this year, Alice Munro has been publishing short story collections every three or four years for half her life. Almost as Jane Austen claimed Regency England, she has claimed modern Canada for her own fictional kingdom.It's got to that stage where the anticipation of each new title is tinged with anxiety that her powers may have diminished. On the evidence of Runaway, she's hanging in there pretty well.I'm not sure that any one story matches much-studied Munro classics like \\"Meneseteung\\". Taken overall, the new book could go a decent couple of rounds with The Progress of Love, the benchmark of her middle years, or Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, her previous collection.You might half expect that approaching mortality would turn Munro towards characters more her own age. But the apparent trend is an increasing desire to draw out the final contradictions of life and family with wintry clarity. Every story carries a blunt one-word title, almost as if she's been sampling Frederick Barthelme's story-titles.Munro doesn't stoop to special pleading. While she can pick off the mediocre male from a hundred paces, she has no qualms about shining the harsh lights of human frailty and dissipating dignity on her own sex. To save the day, this demanding examination is usually conducted with an intelligent, native compassion rather than distant condescension.When Sylvia forges a semi-erotic friendship with her younger rural neighbour Carla, the runaway of the title story, neither emerges with the lustre of great advances in personal honour. The best that can be said is there is an edgy settling down, with new acknowledgments of personal weaknesses and pitfalls.\\"Runaway\\" makes telling use of, not a sacrificial lamb, but a sacrificial goat. That's mild stuff, compared with the sacrificial train passenger of \\"Chance\\", or the bleak case of mistaken identity in \\"Trespasses\\".\\"Chance\\" is the first of a trilogy for the character Juliet, who takes a chance on the surviving chap (Eric) that she has met previously on the train. Look at the ironic shades of contradictory feeling that Munro quickly achieves upon their reunion: \\"He advances on her and she feels herself ransacked from top to bottom, flooded with relief, assaulted by happiness. How astonishing this is. How close to dismay.\\"In the second story of the trilogy, where Juliet gains a daughter and misplaces Eric, Munro fleetingly appears to be channelling Flannery O'Connor, a writer she resembles not all that much. I mean, they both make effective fictional use of the halt and the lame, but Munro is untroubled by O'Connor's abiding obsession with the Holy Trinity.The trace of O'Connor is there in Munro's self-mockery, of her own predilection for unfortunate coincidences. Juliet is regaled with the disastrous life history of someone she doesn't want to know, and this is what Munro has Juliet think: \\"When the cleft palate appeared in the story what she had really wanted to do was complain. Too much.\\"Later in the same piece, Juliet is shamed into a humiliating argument with a diabetic but determined priest. The O'Connor-like touch is that Juliet's ego and intellect are flailed by the bumbling cleric's dumb certitude.Juliet arrives at her plateau of acceptance in the third story, \\"Silence\\". She endures that universal phase of existence that Munro does well, the slippery onset of decline in our briefly (so we imagine) notable lives and the resignation that (maybe) follows.Another long coincidence suggests Juliet's lost daughter may be alive and well. Juliet continues to long for contact. Typically of Munro, this hope is only to the extent that \\"people who know better hope for life after death, or for things of that sort\\".\\"Passion\\" and \\"Tricks\\" are reminiscent of earlier Munro stories and their settings, the former for its scary one-day picaresque around the backblocks of small-town Ontario, the latter for its device of placing the immigrant or \\"outlandish\\" person in sharp relief against that Ontario.Like \\"Trespasses\\", \\"Tricks\\" turns on a breathtakingly cruel instance of mistaken identity. Lest you complain, Munro has the main character remind you that Shakespeare often relied on twins and their mix-ups.Munro once pointed to the way \\"the skin of the moment can break open\\". She likes to study momentary turning points that change lives, sometimes appearing to combine different outcomes of these turning points in the one story.The longest story and highwire act of the collection, \\"Powers\\", returns to this game. Beginning with a routine Canadian courtship of 1927, it ends with a surreal scene in a faded hotel room of much later times, as the principal character Nancy seeks \\"not so much to live in the past as to open it up and get one good look at it\\".In between times, Nancy has loved (moderately) and lost her husband Wilf, introduced Wilf's cousin Ollie to the local psychic Tessa, and watched with utter disapproval as Ollie (who's got under Nancy's skin like a \\"low-grade fever\\") and Tessa elope.But which of their differently sketched fates have Ollie and Tessa really endured? I'm not sure if Munro absolutely requires you to choose any particular outcome. It is as if the different pathways may continue to co-exist in Nancy's mind.(Canberra Times, Saturday, 4 December 2004)"},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Alice Munro's Runaway is a rich and compelling collection. It took me longer to finish this book than I thought it would but I felt I had to stop after each story, absorb it, let it live within me for a few hours before I could go on to the next. It is a remarkable book.Three of the stories (three interconnected stories--\\"Chance\\", \\"Soon\\" & \\"Silence\\") I read previously in The New Yorker and thought them wonderful but they are not my favorites of this collection. My favorites are \\"Runaway\\", \\"Passion\\" and \\"Trespasses\\" (which I loved the most of the three).\\"Trespasses\\" moved me not only because the situation was odd and sad (a young girl finds out secrets about her parents--that there had been another baby who had died, that she might be adopted) but because that moment of chilhood slipping away and people, who were once trusted and believed unerring, are revealed as fallible, is so familiar to the human existence and yet Munro brings it to us in a new way. And this, at least in my mind, is what Munro does best--shines the light back on the reader. Tells us our own story but in another's words.All of these stories have something that makes them special and they all carry the common thread of what it means to be a woman/girl/human being--sometimes knowing, often scared, ultimately alone. The beautiful moments within each of the stories are those moments when Munro illuminates the thoughts of her characters and reveals what it is that makes them each unique, each sublime. Essentially, Munro tells us the secrets of her characters and in doing so she reveals to us our own hidden wants, fears, disgusts and loves."},{"Title":"Runaway","review":"Munro is an extremely gifted writer who has the unique talent of keeping a woman's life in focus from adolescence to senescence. She plumbs the depths of her characters' emotional lives and finds beautiful expressive language at the same time. In the first story in this collection, \\"Runaway,\\" a surprise ending shows how a husband can wreak revenge on his abused wife when she returns after leaving him unexpectedly.In the first of my favorite set of stories, \\"Chance,\\" Juliet, a young Classics teacher leading a stunted life in Ontario, takes a fateful train ride and encounters a man from B.C. whose wife is dying; she later starts an unorthodox relationship with him but learns he already has a woman, Christa. (Many of Munro's characters are teachers or scholars.) \\"In the town where she grew up her sort of intelligence was often put in the same category as a limp or an extra thumb, and people had been quick to point out the expected accompanying drawbacks--her inability to run a sewing machine or tie up a neat parcel, or notice that her slip was showing. What would become of her, was the question.\\" In a store, a woman says, \\"So that's the girl who talks Latin.\\"The story is continued in \\"Soon,\\" which concerns Juliet's trip home with her baby daughter, Penelope. It is 1969. She takes leave of Christa, who has become her friend. When they get there, Juliet finds her mother dying of heart trouble and her father tied down by manual labor after being fired as a teacher for being too outspoken. The story ends in \\"Silence,\\" with time speeded up. Penelope, first adolescent and then grown, disappears from her mother's life without explanation, and Juliet's live-in companion, Eric, drowns; Christa becomes her best friend but then falls ill. Munro explores both the heartaches and the walling-in of emotions these events cause, and how Juliet continues through the years remaining to her.The remaining stories in the collection tell of an encounter between a woman and a sexy alcoholic, a trip up a country road to scatter someone's ashes, two Shakespearean parodies about mix-up of twins, and the life-stream of a woman who marries the wrong man and whose friend has powers of second sight about the right one. Several stories contain women characters who seem hard and rigid and disapproving, but always for an inner reason, a burden of pain.Munro almost literally has her finger on the pulse of people's hearts. For that reason alone, I can't do justice to her work. It's just something in which you immerse yourself."},{"Title":"Creating Web Portals with BEA WebLogic","review":"Don't expect this to help much if you are planning to use the current version 8.1, as things have changed a great deal from 7.0 (and SP3 about to be released changes the content mgmt functions entirely)."},{"Title":"Creating Web Portals with BEA WebLogic","review":"This book is pretty horrible, but since it is the only one out there dedicated to weblogic portal I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1.Things wrong:This book isn't organized well at allNumerous errors that should have easily been caught (screen shots that are the same, things that say: create this domain named &quot;1&quot; now start domain &quot;6&quot;... and you are like, wtf?)Too many screenshots (I'd say about half the book is screen shots)Just plain bad.

Thankfully Block brought on some more collaborators to help the book along and perhaps it is the collaborative effort that makes this book less attrocious than Block's normal fare....Fortunately this won't get the traction he might have received from his Silverstream book because this one actually has competition.

I like how the information is condensed and in some cases presented. This book provides a good explanation of portal concepts and terminology which if you are new to Weblogic Portal, is extremely helpful. Also, I like the sections on Java and Ant. Ant is an essential build tool in any J2EE development and can be very helpful in Weblogic Portal Development.However, this book is poorly organized, the writing is weak and the examples are terrible.The writing in this book is very unprofessional and way to casual for a technical publication. This book was written as though the author was having a conversation with a co-worker or a friend. This makes the book extremely difficult to follow in places.Also, do not try the examples. This is the first book that I have ever said please do not try the examples. They are poorly planned and organized. Also, the instructions are pathetic at best. There is one section where all of the instructions refer to other parts of the book. Your frustration level will go off the charts, but I can say that if you work through these examples you will understand the concepts and materials much better. I honestly think the book could have been much better if the examples were more helpful. For example, you should have built a portal from start to finish that included much of the functionality that was referenced throughout the Portal.Additionally, the visuals do not follow the book very closely. More than one section the images do not correspond to the material and it is extremely confusing.If you have looked at the BEA documentation I would not recommend you buy this book.

I had to ask myself why my company should pay 90 - 100k for me when they could get the same thing for 40-50k. In short, I'd become 'sloppy'. Although my company continues to pay an annual bonus and has not yet reduced benefits, they are- afterall- running a business here and have to be conservative. So I decided to step up and meet expectations.I recently acquired this book and have found it extremely useful! This is the direction the industry is going. Not very many companies out there are doing this stuff. I would rate myself a beginner with J2EE technologies, but a mere 20 minutes into the book, I was able to follow the thorough, well documented examples and create a fully functional portal. The authors clearly demonstrate it doesn't have to be a rocket ship.I found this book to be a very easy read, clearly, concisely written with an appropriate touch of humor here and there. Most computer books are so dry and boring. The point is- how useful is that if you can't even stay awake reading it? Am I right or am I right? I found the prose here refreshing and resplendent. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is just starting out with J2EE development, is tired of having to write the same old Java code over and over again and would like to leverage the power and flexibility of the WebLogic Portal 7.0.

Throughout, he takes Constantine's own words with a grain of salt, especially about events before the Macedonian dynasty by applying a historical perspective to this entire period of Byzantine civilization (c. 800-1050)Political intrigues are explained in terms of the contemporary situations and also probable alternate hypotheses. And though it is a work of Academic scholarship, the writing is clear - the author takes great pains to explain in detail the unbelieveably complex (Byzantine) nature of the Imperial palace."},{"Title":"Constantine Porphyrogenitus and His World","review":"Arnold Toynbee's \\"Constantine Porphyrogenitus and his World\\" is one of the most comprehensive studies of any single period of Byzantine history ever written. This massive book is 768 pages long and it includes five detailed thematic maps. The title clearly illustrates Toynbee's scope. He wanted to provide readers with a study of the person Constantine Porphyrogenitus and snapshots of a what Constantine's world was like.\\"Constantine Porphyrogenius and his World\\" is divided into five separate parts:Part 1 is a biography of ninth century Emperor Constantine Porphyrogeniuts.Part 2 is a study of the East Rome Empire from the 700s to approximately the year 1000. In this section, Toynbee has written essays on trade, land ownership, taxation, the palace, Constantinople, the army-corps districts, autonomous city states, the army and the navy.Part 3 is a study of foreign relations. In this section, Toynbee has written articles on the history of the age, Bulgaria, the Eastern Muslims, Armenia and the Caucasus, the peoples in the northern steppes, the western Europeans and diplomacy.Part 4 is a study on Byzantine civilization from this era. Articles in this section include studies on the origins of Byzantine civilization, public administration, religion, aesthetics, and language.Part 5 is a detailed study on Constantine Porphyrogenitus' own works. This includes essays on Constantine's interests, purposes and sources of information.The books also includes annexes that look at the chronicles that recount the history of the period 813-959, an essay on two military texts \\"Strateghikon\\" and \\"Taktitka\\" and a study on the Paulicians and Bogomils.Toynbee deserves credit for his precision in the terminology that he uses. He takes pains to avoid using latinized or anglicized forms for proper names and concepts from the time. Even if this approach has been followed by few Byzantine historians, Toynbee clearly defines and identifies the confusing terms that appeared in the historical sources. Toynbee also has done an excellent job at placing this history in its context. He concisely identifies the origins of the themes he is studying and many of the lasting effects of these themes.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is seriously studying Byzantine history or the history of the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries. \\"Constantine Porphyrogenitus and his World\\" would be of interest to anyone who is looking for a general introductory work on Byzantine civilization. Finally, this is by far the best study on the Emperor Constantine Porphrogenitus and if you want to learn about him, read this book."},{"Title":"Neighbourhoods of Poverty: Urban Social Exclusion and Integration in Comparison","review":"The problem studied here describes how in a European city, the poor might cluster in neighbourhoods, and where this acts to further isolate them from employment and the mainstream society. While some cities in the book might be unfamiliar to an American reader, she should have no problem relating much of the discussion to American cities that she has visited.Interesting conclusions are found. For Dutch single mothers, social networks are seen as vital. Also, Holland has a welfare state that has largely prevented the formation of downtrodden neighbourhoods. Plus, the single mothers still took part in society, from child-related activities for example. While single males were far more likely to exclude themselves and have more serious behavioural problems like addiction or psychosis."},{"Title":"Daughter of a King","review":"I sat down with my family last night and read this book to them.

Even though we have stuggles and trials there is a path for us to follow to be able to reach that crystal palace. And no matter what we do our KING will always love us.It was read to me during a homemaking night and was not something that i expected to touch me in so many ways."},{"Title":"Daughter of a King","review":"This book will always have a special place in our family. It has a great message that you'll remember long after you put down the book."},{"Title":"Daughter of a King","review":"I borrowed this book from our library and read it to my children last night. I was absolutely amazed by the message. I have three children (6,2,1). My father went to the Crystal Palace this year, and although all my children met him, only my six-year-old will keep a few of the memories. As I read the book last night, my six-year-old reafirmed that he is a Prince, and his grandfather is with the King at the Crystal Palace.This is absolutely the best book on teaching children who they really are, and reminding us adults how we should behave. This is better than any self-help book, and a must for everyone with or without children."},{"Title":"Daughter of a King","review":"I absolutely love this book.

However, this book is a very bad example of a history test. All the questions are multiple choice with almost no explanations for the answers. So forget about learning any new stuff with this book. Also I noticed a typo (or maybe just an incorrect answer to a question). The question was to put Henry VIII's wifes in order from the 1st one he married to the last. This book has Henry marrying Anne of Cleves before Jane Seymore, which obviously is incorrect. This error made me wonder whether there were other incorrect answers in this book. My opinion is definatly to pass on this book because its not at all what it seems."},{"Title":"Internet Soul Mates: Finding the Love of Your Life Through the Internet","review":"With millions of people on the internet, and millions more joining the technology forefront each year, it only makes sense that age-old rituals of courting would eventually find their way to the computer screen.

J.P. Molnar has been Editor of two national newstand magazines, has written several book features and has more than 150 feature articles published in numerous periodicals. He has been a computer user since 1977, and has been surfing the internet since 1993."},{"Title":"Internet Soul Mates: Finding the Love of Your Life Through the Internet","review":"Internet Soulmates was an easy compass navigating a person through the labyrinth that is attempting to find someone on the internet. Its obvious that the author went through a lot...good or bad...and shares those experiences both in personal and instructional fashion. Reading Deanna's book saves time and money for those looking for a soulmate. There's also some really good humor in the book and its very easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Internet Soul Mates: Finding the Love of Your Life Through the Internet","review":"This straightforward text offers readers an honest and insightful view of internet dating. The future is here with the internet becoming a part of people's lives more each day. Before you realize it, old ineffeicient methods of finding a partner- soulmate will be long gone. For an up to date guide to the internet dating scene with references to the more traveled websites (free ones at that!) check out this book. It will guide you through the do's and dont's to help make your search for the &quot;ONE&quot; safe and efficient."},{"Title":"Internet Soul Mates: Finding the Love of Your Life Through the Internet","review":"The book is trivial and does not offer much in addition to what's already available from numerous websites. Most of the advice is based on common sense and logic that any adult in her/his right mind uses (or must use)every day. Years passed and much touted internet dating did not seem to fulfill its promise. An overwhelming majority of marriages and ordinary hook ups still result from conventional meet/date routine. Besides, did all the knowledge really help the author?"},{"Title":"Space and spirit;: Theories of the universe and the arguments for the existence of God (Donnellan lectures, June 1946)","review":"This is a profound little book by a profound thinker. Whittaker, a mathematical physicist and convert to Catholicism, engages the insights brought to us by science on space, time and causality, asking how they affect natural theology, and especially what they mean for a contemporary understanding of Thomas Aquinas' Five Ways. He rejects the philosophy according to which metaphysics and theology are simply independent of what science tells us about the world, and also displays an impressive knowledge of history of science. Science has of course made progress since this book was written, but the basics of modern cosmology, such as the expanding universe, relativity, and quantum physics were already known, so that the book is still relevant to the contemporary discourse.Because of the book's broad scope and accessible style, as well as the author's wide-ranging erudition, this book will be of interest both to the general educated reader as well as to scientists, philosophers and theologians."},{"Title":"Scourby KJV on Cassette Value Pack - Old Testament","review":"How hard can it be to make a decent audio tape of one man reading the Bible? The opposite side bleeds through and they often break between sides right in the middle (or worse, just before the end) of a verse. The 2 stars is just for Scourby's voice quality."},{"Title":"Scourby KJV on Cassette Value Pack - Old Testament","review":"After reading the only review available at the time, I was hesitant to order this tape, but I already had the New Testiment read by Alexander Scourby, so I felt confident that the review was due to a bad quality tape. I was very happy with the tapes when they arrived, the sound quality is excellent and I have enjoyed hearing it as I drive around. I highly recommend this set of tapes to anyone who wants to read the bible but doesn't have much time. You can listen to these tapes while you drive or do housework! Its great!!!"},{"Title":"Scourby KJV on Cassette Value Pack - Old Testament","review":"Great to listen to as a companion to your bible reading, for someone who is older or needs assistance reading printed text, and I love to listen in the car - to and from work - to agment my bible study.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"&quot;Picturing the Bomb&quot; by Rachel Fermi (granddaughter of Nobel Laureate and brilliant Physicist, Enrico Fermi) and Esther Samra is a completely fascinating and often haunting photographical documentary which presents the first images of The Manhattan Project. Many of the pictures are gathered from private collections of people who were actually participating in the secrecy. The book also contains never-before-published, de-classified military images. And, as a perfect complement to the photos, the accompanying text is equally compelling. For those who know the horror of the genie, this is a must for your collection."},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"This book is a little pricey, but the photographs inside this coffee-table book are incredible. Not the run of the mill technical photos, some of these came from private collections, showing a slice of life in and around these plants.It's actually kind of fun to take the book out and see how the landscape has changed over the years.PS- If you are solely looking for technical photos of devices assembly and production areas, you will be disappointed. Get Chuck Hansen's book instead."},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"An amazing collection of photos which I highly recommend for anyone with even a passing interest in the incredible Manhattan Project. It has the expected pictures of airplanes, bombs, buildings, and machines, but also has more human photographs of the people involved and their families."},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"This book does not just chronichle the making of the Atomic bomb, but it tells the story of the people who made it possible."},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"This book, shown to me by a LLL scientist, before I purchased, gave me such a insight, well beyond the Alamo museums, that enriches my understanding of the era, and the impact of the bomb.Extraordinary book. Everyone should get a chance to see it.Fermi's daughters collection of photographs is rare and revealing of moments in that period. To see pictures like this of the work that changed the political landscape of the planet is amazing."},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"OMG! It'sk amazing to me that two of the reviewers here just don't get it. The reason this book was put together was not to show the gore along with many interesting pictures of atomic bombs blasting. Did they not bother to actually read what the book was about? I think if I gave these two people a beautiful, just caught salmon, and asked them how they liked it, they'd say, \\"It tasted OK, but it made an absolutely terrible hammer.\\""},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"A nice view of the human side of the Los Alamos Project: It was more than just building a bomb, you know."},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"While this book does have pictures of the Manhattan Project, about only 1% of them are of actual nuclear-related stuff. Mostly it's pictures of people growing up on the Los Alamos project. I found only a few pictures of bombs exploding. The rest of the pictures are boring! This book is NOT worth buying!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Picturing the Bomb: Photographs from the Secret World of the Manhattan Project","review":"this book is the worst book i have ever seen in my entire life."},{"Title":"The Highly Adaptable Gospel: A Journey Through the Life of H. Baxter Liebler","review":"The book chronicles one man's burning desire to share Christ's message translated for another culture, another time. It contains inspiring lives of service, courage, and acceptance. It forms a gold ring setting for Father Liebler's own book, Boil My Heart for Me. I recommend them both."},{"Title":"The Highly Adaptable Gospel: A Journey Through the Life of H. Baxter Liebler","review":"Marjorie S. May has written an insightful book that fills one with the right notion of what a Christian missionary should be. It's biographical of Reverend H. Baxter Liebler's life and missionary work to the Navajo people, but more importantly reflects what a true Christian of faith should be of not only believing, but demonstrating within ones daily actions what faith plus works can accomplish when one surrenders completly to Jesus and to his great commission to preach, without self-righteousness, the \\"gospel\\" throughout the world."},{"Title":"Ruling America: A History of Wealth and Power in a Democracy","review":"This extremely stimulating, highly cohesive collection of essays focuses on a topic underappreciated in American history--the shifts in power from one elite group to another. The idea that small groups of very wealthy men play the major role in shaping the political dynamics of the US is every bit as subversive as the idea that the US has been the site of intense class struggles (the 'people's history' view). After reading it, my sense of the trajectory of American capitalism--from the merchant-slave owner alliance to the rise of industrial capitalism to the managerial revolution of the twentieth century to the recent shift to the South-Southwest--was renewed. Its one of those books you finish and think--how did I not know this already? It all seems so central, yet so neglected. Although elite history inevitably has a strong economic focus, this book by no means neglects gender, race, culture and other social historical themes. The elites are always seen as historical actors, shaped by and shaping their contexts, rather than mechanically performing class roles. Nor is elite rule presumed to be natural, inevitable, or unchallenged. While the book perhaps could have given more attention to elites at (or engaged with) such institutions as Hollywood, the news media, academia and other spaces for 'manufacturing consent', and perhaps underrates the importance of the consolidation of space for progressives in some of these institutions since the sixties, overall this is a very engaging collection I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Glossary Epistemology (Paragon House Glossary for Research, Reading and Writing)","review":"Very useful book for someone interested in philosophy and methodology of science as a professional career or master studies or for someone ho is preparing an article or even a theses in these fields."},{"Title":"Brazil - War on Children","review":"In her book \\"Brazil\\", Jan Rocha itemizes a good selection of interesting and important national problems but then bogs down in anachronistic ideology. I purchased the book as an introduction to the country of Brazil and as a guidepost into more detailed topics, as well as to see Oxfam's perspective on these various issues. The book does well in summarizing familiar problems such as authoritatian politics and the minority landed oligarchy as well as obscure ones such as attempts to relate a gatherers' economy of babassu nut collection to the twenty-first political economy.Problems within the book emerge when it tries to discuss these issues using a vocabulary somewhat related to 1960's Marxism. The \\"good guys\\" are the workers and aboriginal peoples who are shamelessly exploited by the \\"bad guys\\",the government-oligarchycoalition. The middle class is curiously omitted suggesting the inuendo that perhaps it does not exist at all. For example after mentionning the government policy of rapid industrialization starting in the 1950's the book seems to imply that it was done without a domestic market.No one denies that terrible attrocities have taken place in Brazil but this carping on negatives of the past fails to achieve a constructive purpose. The book mentions that the government set up a National Institute for Colonisation and Land Reform which has power to confiscate holdings of unproductive lands for redistribution (a very interesting idea for a developping country) but then it does not explain why it has seldom been used or even if it still exists.Perhaps the last chapter on Carnival (holiday) is the best one. In this one case the book changes tack and identifies a positive role of Carnival by involving people of various factions within national culture. If other chapters were as good, it would be a highly recommendable book but as it stands it limits itself to identifying national issues and then presents a somewhat anachronistic ideological polemic for those who might appreciate it."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"Wordware's line of Lightwave books is rapidly becoming an encyclopedic reference to the Lightwave system. This book may be the best one they've done so far.My copy just arrived today, but already I can see that this one is destined to be a classic.This is the first title I'm aware of that's dedicated to the topic of texturing, specifically for Lightwave. It takes a subject that's only covered lightly in the official documentation and expands it to 480 pages of in-depth information, advice and examples.The &quot;all-in-one&quot; Lightwave books always suffer from the problem of trying to cover in one book a multitude of topics, each of which one could make into a career, and each of which could (should) be expanded into a full-sized book of its own. For the topic of surfacing and texturing, this is that book.If you want to learn about texturing in Lightwave, forget about the manual, forget the other books you might have (for now), and GET THIS BOOK!G."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I already own Digital Texturing and Painting. I found it to be good but a bit difficult to apply. This book however offers theory and covers practical application as well. Many topics cover common mistakes and offers work-arounds. Being a Lightwave user, I found that the detailed descriptions and renders of the procedurals worth the price of the book alone. This book is a great way to get a jumpstart on texturing and a solid understanding of workflow for Lightwave3d texturing."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"It's interesting to read &quot;A reader&quot; and Kathy's review of this book. I wouldn't have bought it if I just go by their advice alone, it sounds like this book doesn't worth a dime in their opinion.But I did purchase the book before I read their advice, and I found it to be one of those texture book you want to own, especially if you use Lightwave. For other programs, it might not be as helpful, because it's still a LW based book. But it has information that other users of program would find helpful also.The author of this book teaches you why you should or shouldn't do on a texture map, and if you're serious about 3D, any beginner to intermediate users would find the theory and application of this book very helpful, because texture painting principles are fundemental skills common to all programs, not just LW, and this author does teach you those things by referring to Photoshop.The author gives detail explanation of what to look for when you paint your texture, focus on character's face painting, as well as ordinary objects. I must admit I learn a lot from this book alone on paining textures for characters that you can use in games or animation.The book is easy to read and follow. It sums up the author's texturing experience, and it saves especially beginner time from trial and error becasue this book does that for you already, so you can learn from someone who has experience in texturing that would give you a huge jump start.I would say this book is a must-have for LW users, and other program's user who want to learn theory and principles on painting texture would find this book helpful also.If you're serious about 3D texturing, and you want to better yourelf, I would suggest this book a must-buy.Off topic:Recently in newspaper, there is this debate as to who are the people posting reviews here, and it seems that publishers from other companies use this review function to knock down other's book in order to increase their own books' sale. I don't know if this is the case or not, but I think reader should keep this in mind when you read any reviews here."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I think the harsh reviews this book has received are childish and undeserved. The comments about Leigh on the forums has nothing to do with the book and are irrelevant. I consider myself to be an advanced user and I also teach Lightwave. Ive been using Lightwave since before it was Lightwave. I also have many years in the 3D industry.The book is targetted at beginners and intermediate users and more then delivers the goods. Leigh covers everything I can think of very thoroughly and in a logical fashion. The book is a nice balance between being informative enough even for an intermediate user but not too heavy with unecessary details that would certainly confuse a beginner. This book is definately better then the manual for explaining texturing and I would certainly use it to use to teach from. I dont agree with all of Leighs views on texturing but I would have to say that those disagreements are at a more advanced level and more to do with particular details rather then the good solid principles she covers. I didnt see much or anything in her book that I didnt agree with. I think its a good solid book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"Texture and shading knowledge is a key in a 3d world, and Leigh did a wonderful work to write a clean and well document book on how different parameters works, and how texture alter it.if you don't understand texturing and shading work in Lightwave, you will understand it after reading of that book. She did a good work on tutorials and interaction with daily work of texture artist.texture and shading not have segrets, need only to understand how they work in different software. i reed many books, but most of authors are very foggy on \\"why\\" and very generous on \\"do that\\", Leigh wrote why and where of texturing work.Wonderful book Leigh"},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I' ve been using Lightwave for about a year now, so I' m in the beginner/intermediate bracket and this is the perfect book for me. I started off just making models and I' ve now progressed to making models for a game mod. I now have to UV map and skin my models, which I never did before, because it looked scary ! I used to just use a quick procedural for dirt mainly and never had the confidence to make my own maps.However, along comes this book at just the right time for me. There' s lots of texturing books out there, but nothing really compares to a book specifically for the 3D package you are using.So ,what' s in this book ? Well, the author starts off with a quick overview of surfaces, trying to get us to study the surfaces around us in more detail ( The way light falls differently on different surfaces, the effects of weathering on materials and so on). After all, attention to detail is the difference between good maps and great maps.After a quick review of different lights, it then goes into extensive detail of the Surface Editor, explaining just about every button in there, with example pictures of what each one does beside it. Reflections, transparency, shaders, you name it, it' s in there ( the pages explaining how to use Surface Baker was particularly good. I' ll definitely be trying that on game models ). After 30 pages on procedurals, again each with pictures of what they look like, we get to the tutorials.First is gradients with 3 tutorials on that, then one on weight maps, a load more on image maps ( seamless textures, using photos for textures, colour, glossy, luminosity, diffuse and lots more, all explained with short tutorials on each one.)After another overview of the rest of Lightwaves buttons, we then learn about every kind of image map, each with thorough explanations of each one, and how to avoid mistakes beginners make when applying them. Then my favourite part of the book and which I found most useful, UV maps ! A total of 60 pages are devoted to that alone ! How to unwrap a head and fix stretching, planer, spherical, cylindrical, atlas, all have tutorials and are explained very well, plus an explanation of all of Lightwaves UV mapping buttons.Then to finish off, there' s yet more tutorials ! Texturing a cars body, painting a gun, rust, wood and finally one on painting a face.A huge amount of work has been put into this book and it shows. ( Screen grabbing all the pictures must have taken ages ! These are in B/W, but are reproduced on the CD ).This is an excellent book for beginners and intermediates and is packed with tutorials and loads of useful tips from the author, which will prevent easy ( usually frustrating ) mistakes.If you have this, plus Essential Lightwave, and the Character animation book from Timothy Albee, you have everything you need to learn and produce great animations.Thumbs up ! Highly recommended !"},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I was waiting for this book since my birthday, and when it arrived early June, all I did was run to my room and read it. Now mind you, I am very good at modeling and animation, but my knowledge of texturing humans is kind of sparse. After reading this book, back and front, I suddenly got the urge to draw characters and texture my organic models properly. With Leigh's direction, the writing was a great relation and those who understand the idea behind texturing (especially someone who is a young person). Some tutorials I have read on the net are good, but sometimes, it is not enough. Tutorials skip ahead and not tell you why, exploiting their veteran status in the field.After reading it again (I finished the whole book in one night) and using the demos on the CD, I am definitely recommending this book to anyone, beginner or advanced, and students, who really wants to learn about texturing models. Despite its title, and most of it is geared toward Lightwave, it can be helpful to any high end software program. The pictures in the book (black and white) are very great and well understood, as well as colored versions on the CD. The tutorials are great, but some of them are very involved...(I do wish the book had a unwrapping of human eyes tutorial but that is something unimportant here) Bottom line, the book is great for those who want to learn the features of Lightwave, which is a truly excellent program, but also to learn how to create believable environments.I also visit the CGTalk forums, and the work there reflects. Those who want dead on info on making believable textures, get this book!! GET IT!! You will not regret it..."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"This book really goes all out to explore the intricacies of Lightwave texturing, and does it at a level that beginners to advanced users can understand. It contains literally hundreds of well-disgrammed examples...should be a must-read for anyone serious about using Lightwave."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I am 1/4 through the book and I like it so far. The book starts with basic things, explaining what is what in the texture editor. She gives some crucial hints along the way as to what to do and what no to do, something that might be missted by beginners. For Example.. setting both reflection and diffusion at %100. You might know it, I might know it, but there are some who do not. As I said, the book starts at the very beginning of the topic. I do not know the rest of the book, but judging from the work that Leigh has done I expect some good stuff. The same goes for the comments saying that she does not have lifelong experience with texturing, blah blah. Well, look at her work first. And then, you do no needt much of the &quot;lifetime&quot; for an industry that is barely 10-15 years old (excluding those early visualization years, with nothing more than glassy spheres,checkered planes and such). Some people learn certain things quicker. If I could not learn good texturing in 10 years, it does not mean someone else could not.Leight has a specific style of writing. For example she seem to like to point out the &quot;mistakes&quot; that some beginners make. Also she is more interested in painting her own textures than using procedurals. To tell you the truth, to texture a living organism such as human or an animal, you will never do a good job with procedurals alone, but that is my opinion.Some readers apparently do not her style of writing or texturing techniques, but the book deserves at least 3 stars even if that style bothers you. Leave 1 star reviews for &quot;great&quot; books by mr. Shamms Mortier.If you are still unsure, go to your local book store. Hopefully it will have Leigh's texturing book in stock. Browse through it and if you like it, come back to amazon and buy it.

This book is an excellent resource and makes a great addition to your Lightwave library. It covers a broad range of topics and gives you an excellent foundation to develop your skillset from.

So from that perspective... this is definately a MHB'Must Have Book'Leigh most certainly is one of the most impressive texturing artist in the Lightwave community... ask most anyone in that community and they will tell you the same... her artwork has appeared on several lightwave specific magizine covers and articals... and other pubications both in print and on the net.Leigh's approach to presenting the matterial is well done and logically and calmly layed out. The text assumes little of the users ability other than a basic knowledge of Lightwave so that beginers can make just as much use of the information as anyone else...Some may say... &quot;all the matteral here can be found on the internet!Aaaaaaaa that maybe true grasshopper.... But when it is placed in one place in a printed text one no longer has to spend hours or days searching for it Only to find that the webpage that had itis now down for maintance due to some hackers virus...(books don't get viruses)(guess some people haven't figured that out either)(and they claim to be an Advanced user?)This book will teach you plenty...(even if it is not all) of the texturing tricks that will get you to the next level with Lightwave.It did me, And I'm not a spring chicken to Lightwave but neither do I concider myself an Advanced user either...And even though I have diffrent methods for accomplishing some of the texturing tricks that she teaches...The way in which she presented her methods were 'so' impressive...

On the positive side she does cover the basic concepts of shader settings and does so in a way that you can apply it to any 3D app youre using (Lightwave is old and obsolete 3D app, infact Leigh doesnt use Lightwave anymore). But I was a tad bit disappointed that it didnt go more into photoshop painting technics for creating textures (that might be an unfair critisism since this book is part of a Lightwave series). But the thing that really annoyed me about the book is that it was that the pics were all in B&W, and so color copys of the pics are included on the CD to be viewed on a computer. I mean why not just make this book an ebook and eliminate passing between a book and computer altogether?

(btw, if you are above learning, close this window).The writing style, while tending towards light and airy, is nonetheless logically laid out and concisely presented. I honestly do not know of another LW book with this much focus in material and writing.Leigh's effort shows through on every page, it is sincere and her presentation is complete.This book is a confident addition to your library, LW and CG, as it has been to mine for a while now."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"When this book first arrived, I thumbed thru it and thought, \\"Wow...great! I've found the missing link!\\" Being a relative newcomer to Lightwave and 3D, I often found the impressive array of Lightwave tools confusing and intimidating. However, with the help of this book, my brain finally bonded with Lightwave's surface editor and the other texturing tools that Lightwave ships with.The book is so well-written that you'll enjoy reading it because the author's unique and friendly personality shines throughout the pages. She covers texturing in Lightwave so thoroughly that you will close the back cover a much more confident person, with the assurance that you've read and absorbed the best texturing info available. I bought two other books on texturing before this one came out and, while both are good, neither went straight to the heart of Lightwave, its texturing options, and its UV tools the way this one did. There just isn't any way to express how useful and just plain fun this book is.I have a feeling that the people who wrote the negative reviews here have some sort of a bone to pick with the author, and I really don't think this is the right way or the right place to settle a peeve. Believe me, if you're a Lightwaver, you will REALLY enjoy this book and will deprive yourself if you pay attention to the negative nonsensical reviews you see here. The review by the guy who teaches Lightwave (and I hear he's a very well-respected member of the Lightwave community) is right on -- please take it to heart. I've read this book once, and now I'm reading it again, slowly, doing every tutorial. By the time I finish, I'll know procedurals, image maps, and UVs better than I ever dreamed. What more could one ask for?By the way, this is only the second book that has impressed me enough to take time to write a review. It is that good. And while I don't know the author personally (I'm not a friend sticking up for a friend), I do know that she's written detailed texturing tutorials that are displayed on the Newtek website. She's a true professional, and so is her work.Last minute comment -- the section on editing UV maps is particularly good. :-) I also enjoyed the section on gradients."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"Purchased this book 3 yrs ago.

I waited a long time for this book to come out after I first viewed the author's work on her web site and read her tutorials for dummies. It was worth waiting for.

I recommend it for all levels."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"After reading the negative comments that were left here on this book I felt compelled to share my opinion. This is a badly needed book. I've been working with Lightwave for two years now(so i guess I'm sort of an intermediate user), and while I've managed to create textures that sufficed in my projects, I've known that this was a weak spot in my work. Online tutorials are fine, and the author of this book has created some of the best, but what I want is a physical book I can curl up with and study and learn from. THIS BOOK IS IT!!! Thank you Leigh. This is exactly the general reference book on Lightwave texturing that I've been waiting for for the last two years. Leigh's writting style is very readable, and easy to digest. She takes a complicated subject and makes it understandable. I havn't had a chance to finish it yet, but from what I've read so far, I feel confident that all of my texturing questions will be answered.If you're looking for the best book on texturing in Lightwave that's available today, BUY THIS BOOK!!! Pay attention to the positive comments and disregard the negative ones."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I do indeed love this book, Leigh did an outstanding job on it, particularly in the fact that she did not assume that the reader had texturing knowledge from the start and took the time to explain texture theory in a manner that suited the beginner and veteran alike. Her writing style was forthright and to the point while still maintaining a delightful amount of wit and humor to help it along.The topics in the book are varied enough to provide aid regardless of your project and are presented in a logical progression... A helpful thing when most books tend to leap around. Most importantly however, is that she provides technique and tips without -too- much hand holding. Simply put, it is far and away the best book on the subject to date and I admire that she is so willing to share what she has learned.Having read the tutorials on line as well as books and courses by the other talented people mentioned in prior reviews, I stand by my opinon that this particular work is a must have in your library."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"This is an excellent, well detailed book that's intended (as stated on the cover) for beginner - intermediate users of Lightwave. I'm confused as to why anyone would give the book a bad review because they already knew some of the material in the book. It's a book for beginner/intermediate and contains information pertinent to those skill levels, although truth be told I'm sure there would be something here for all but the very best Lightwave texture artists...though those guys shouldn't need a book anyway.Leigh's writing style in easy to read and she covers the subjects that readers will most likely want to know. The section on skin texturing is particularly good. Recommended."},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I'm not sure that the &quot;reader from bellevue, WA&quot; knew how over-the-top his or her critique came off, how arrogant and vindictive it sounded to the neutral party, but I definitely don't think for a minute that they wrote that out of a sense of justice to a potential buyer and the goodness of their hearts. I'll admit, that I have only read the downloadable &quot;Texturing for Dummies&quot; series, but even that was written with clarity, humility, and enough technical details that will give most people in this industry at least something they don't know or have forgotten. The fact that her genuine gift of her time and talents, and the fact that she has tried very hard to make these tutorials accessible and free to everyone, despite language barriers or computer shortcomings, make me feel that I have to say something in defense. I have never been a &quot;CGtalk groupie&quot; of hers, and can admit that I found the title &quot;texturing goddess&quot; to be somewhat cocky at first. -But at least if you read anything she says or any thread she comments on you will find a lack of hubris, which is more than I can say for the author of this little gem:&quot;and then look at something by someone like myself or Timur or Can or Kursad (someone who REALLY does work in the REAL industry making movies and shows that people can actually see) &quot;We are in an industry that thrives on competition, but we really should try to teach, build people up, encourage, and contribute, because everybody benefits that way.

Leigh has done a great job building on an area of LightWave that always need more coverage. The approach is different than I would have taken, and that's ok - it's good for people to learn from different styles and techniques. I think the book could use more tutorials, but what's presented is certainly worth checking out. For what it's worth, I know a thing or two about writing LightWave books. The UV section is top notch, and for anyone wanting to know more about LightWave's texturing will benefit. Good job Leigh!"},{"Title":"LightWave 3D 8 Texturing (Wordware Game and Graphics Library)","review":"I really have mixed emotions about this book. I ordered this online but wish I had the opportunity to see it before making the decision to buy it. It does a good job covering basics but a good web search will yield as good or superior tutorials. The included files are quite mediocre and and just reinforces the impression that the author possesses an adequate level of skills in the 2DCG realm.After reading through the other reviews here it is quite apparent the author has enlisted her industry and web friends to blast anyone who presents an honest review. This book will work for beginners just fine so I give it an honest 2 stars with one of those stars for effort, not execution. For the intermediate and above crowd, look elsewhere for help.John Jordan's review is an good example of the market segment that this book might help, the 3D newbie. Leigh's weak abilities in the artistic department are far eclipsed by the magnitude of her shameless self promotional plugs and pathetic attempts to appear selfless. CGTalk has turned into a shell of its former self thanks to the efforts of book promoters such as Leigh Van duh Bile and her ilk."},{"Title":"Oil and Security in the Arabian Gulf","review":"There is no such place called Arabian Gulf. The historical name is Persian Gulf. Anybody who does not know that basic fact is not qualified to write a book. Please go back to high school and earn your diploma, Mr. Farid."},{"Title":"Warrior Moon","review":"Warrior Moon was a nice western historical romance with a Native American hero. I wasn't completely blown away but the story was full of action and kept me entertained.Vanessa is travelling with a wagon train on her way to a convent that her father is forcably placing her in because she refuses to marry the men he chose for her. She plans to run away whenever she can get away from her escorts so she can go home and save her 16 year-old sister from an unwanted marriage to an older man. She plans on taking both her younger sisters to San Fransisco to get away from her unloving father. One night along the river, she comes upon a three year-old Indian girl and a wounded warrior. She seizes the moment and takes off on the horses she finds, along with the young girl and the warrior.Lone Wolf hates the white men who over run his land because they killed his wife and mother. He used to be a scout for the army but stays away from whites after his wife was killed by white men after a railroad man offers money for dead Indians (yeah it was Vanessa's father - which of course causes problems). Lone Wolf's Kiowa village is attacked by white men, where his brother and sister-in-law are killed. He goes after his little niece despite being shot and wounded. While he is delirious from his wounds, Vanessa comes upon the two Kiowa. He can't do anything to stop her because of his wounds, so he is forced to head south with her toward the town where her sisters live when he needs to head north to his tribe. Vanessa refuses to turn around because she needs to save her sister from a horrible fate, but Lone Wolf knows he has a high chance of being killed by white men if he is seen travelling with a white woman but he has no choice but to go with her plans - at least until he regains his strength then he may just decide to kidnap this white woman and take her back to his village.This book had a lot of action going on. Vanessa and Lone Wolf (and the little niece) travel all over the place on the run from soldiers as they try to save her sisters from a selfish father. The basic conflict of the story was that Vanessa felt she needed to save her sisters despite the fact that Lone Wolf was certain he had a high chance of dying if he tried to help her out and he was worried that she could be hurt or killed - plus he was trying to come to terms with the fact he hated her father for being responsible for his wife's death and the fact that he cared for Vanessa because she was a good person who helped save his life. I wavered back and forth from feeling bad for Vanessa because she just wanted to help her sisters, to hoping that Lone Wolf would just kidnap her and take her to his village so she wouldn't get either of them killed. I enjoyed the romance between Lone Wolf and Vanessa but I felt like the impact of the romance was lessened by so many side characters being pulled into the story (the little niece, random grandmotherly Comanche woman who travels with them, the two sisters). One little thing did bother me a bit that I wanted to warn about: at one point Vanessa and Lone Wolf are captured by a fort commander who basically threatens Lone Wolf's life unless Vanessa pleases him. The commander kisses her and fondles her breasts, against her internal wishes of course, but she can't say anything because she is afraid the man will kill Lone Wolf. Nothing further than that happens but I didn't love that part and wanted to warn anyone that would be a deal breaker for. She didn't want it to happen but couldn't stop it without having Lone Wolf pay the price but it didn't go too far.So overall, the story was interesting and written well for the most part. Some small parts annoyed me but I liked the adventure and excitement of the fast-moving story. Most of the story was told while the couple rode around on horses, so I would consider this story a western/Native American romance, with some small parts actually occuring in Indian villages (Comanche and Kiowa to be exact). I think this book is worth reading despite the small issues which I have outlined if you enjoy western/Native American historical romances."},{"Title":"Warrior Moon","review":"The first thing that caught my eye was the cover. Yeah I know its sappy but I liked the fact that the cover didn't have a white man dressed as a indian like some of these new books do. The cover is passionate without being rauchy. The story inside is very original. Sara Orwig certainly knows how to write a book that keeps you on your toes. Very descriptive writing and you feel like you are right there watching it all happen. If you find the book, get it. A definite must read."},{"Title":"The Book of Bebb","review":"Read the four novels that make up The Book of Bebb, and you'll never forget The Rev. Leo Bebb, one of the best-drawn characters in modern American literature. He lives, he breathes, he exposes his private parts, he raises the dead, he stands before the congregation with a Bible in one hand, reminding them that &quot;charity&quot; is the greatest virtue---and he's got his other hand out to receive the bounty of that charity.A half-holy conman who seems sincere down to his questionable core, Bebb is a blend of Jimmy Swaggart, WC Fields, Walt Whitman, PT Barnum--and there may even be a dash of Huck Finn and Fielding's Tom Jones mixed in there somewhere.If you stop and think about it, isn't it amazing what people can and do believe? People worship everything from stone gods to trees and rocks to Elvis Presley and space aliens, and they've always had &quot;guides&quot; such as priests and ministers to lead the way. The Bebb stories encourage us to question what we believe, who we believe in, and how we can possibly put our faith in anyone or anything these days----when we're faced every day with further evidence that people and their feet of clay generally stink.These stories were written in the 1970s, and in many ways they look forward to the media-exploded days of the 1980s and 1990s, when tv programs and internet content virtually replaced the &quot;landscape&quot; of daily life in middle-America. Leo Bebb is essentially a charismatic, Bible-thumping evangelist from the 1940s wandering in the wilderness of late 20th-Century America. He reminds me of those ubiquitous radio preachers on AM radio coming out of Lubbock, Texas, or somewhere down south, imploring all within the reach of their syrupy drawls to accept the love of Jesus--and to send down the cold hard cash. Although there was something creepy and unsettling about those messages, there was also some strange comfort in knowing that somebody out there still found a reason to believe.I first read these four Bebb novels in 1991, and upon re-reading them in 2003 it strikes once again me that Buechner's stories and characters are timeless. More so now than in 1991, I think these are American stories about American characters who are trying to &quot;get ahead&quot; in a big country filled with a roughly mixed cocktail of races, cultures, traditions, and values. They're all busy with the business of life, but they're looking for something to believe in, even in such a crazy place as modern America. Every one of Buechner's characters seems to have one foot planted on the ground and one foot stepping tentatively toward the gates of heaven."},{"Title":"The Book of Bebb","review":"This is a find. Buechner is a fine writer with impeccable ears; but his special quality is a kind of humanity that gives merit to the meritless, rejoicing as he has us shake our head, chuckling at their goings-on. His religion is germane, and if this matter is quite different from G.K.Chesterton's, and his voice and ego less resonant, nevertheless there's an assurance here that reminds one of the latter. Fine work, and it's a heathen here that says so."},{"Title":"The Book of Bebb","review":"I read these books at at the same time I was dealing with reconciling my spiritulaity with my sexuality. Fredrick Buchner crafts such a lovely story with heroes so flawed and utterly lovable that you can't help but identify with every one.These characters became so important to me, that I had to put the final book down because I was so mad at one of them.Buchener has such a way with discription and characterization.I find these and maybe The Storm the easiest of his books to read.Lion Country (the first book of Bebb) really helped me at a tough time in my life, I really recommend it to anyone... it will make you laugh and cry at the same time."},{"Title":"The Book of Bebb","review":"This is Buechner at his best. There are unexpected twist and turns from beginning to end. He develops characters from religious to anti religious.

His plots are well written and the connections un fall able. He put a lot of effort and time into this novel. John Cassadays (Astonishing X-men, Desperado)work is marvelous, a bit rough at the beginning but his ever daunting potential was visible even then, this collection is evidence of his talent and his beautiful artistic development. The oversize pages filled with Cassadays pencils are alone worth the cost. This is a must have for any planetary fan, a hard bound collection of today's best stories. Snatch this up while you still can, 1st prints were limited and quickly made there way onto ebay for upward of $100 plus. Thank God I found one for the retail price.

So if your just starting to get into comics and/or do not have much knowledge of anything earlier than the 80s a lot of the content you may end up not getting, however for long time fans of comics you'll be in for a great time seeing homage from all the classics you have grown to enjoy over the years."},{"Title":"Absolute Planetary Book One","review":"I was so thrilled when I found out Volume One was being reprinted. As with many classic works of art, movies, literature, and comics, I sometimes don't discover them until some time after their publication.Upon reading the Planetary series I was blown away. It is easily my favorite comic series combining everything that I have come to love about story telling and adventure. Much to my dismay when originally searching for Volume One it was completely sold out and going for upwards of $300. My friend owned a copy that I just envied and when this collection was finally available again I made sure to pre order my copy.Beautifully put together with large gorgeous pages of art this collection is a must for any fan of the series and would doubtlessly be enjoyed by anyone who is into comics.I would give this a million stars if I could."},{"Title":"Absolute Planetary Book One","review":"Planetary is a maxie series from Wildstorm. Written by Warren Ellis and with art by John Cassaday it is a modern day classic. It ran for 27 issues and is a very interesting take on Archeology with 'enhanced' archeologists. The first volume contains the first 12 issues of the series and what a varied series of stories they are.You have a monster island where ostensibly Godzilla came from. You have a story about a certain Man Of Bronze. You have quantum computers, vampires and Lord Greystoke(?)! But my favorite story is the Hong Kong actioner starring a vengeful cop's ghost. Some fantastic art that evokes all of the action from a John Woo film. To give you an idea how worthwhile these Absolute editions are I went back and bought the comic that this story was in originally and it didn't have near the scope of the oversize pages. And no ads breaking up the flow!The stories are so different from each other that you wonder where it's all heading and I had to wait until the Absolute Planetary Volume Two was published to find out. (I knew it was coming so I just waited for it)It's well worth what I paid for it and it even went into a second printing when Volume Two was released. However it looks like the second printing is now out of print too. Which is a shame. Hopefully these will come back in a one volume omnibus edition for new readers."},{"Title":"Absolute Planetary Book One","review":"There's nothing new that can be said about this series.Masterpiece of a story from beginning to end.Gorgeous artwork.Tight, beautiful scripts.Intense stories worth your time.It's all true, but what is also true is that you must buy vol. 2 to get the whole story.

Great writer, no question. Great artist, without a doubt.A must have for any Planetary fan but lets get real here, is there anyone out there who is willing to pay the $1000.00 price for this or any Absolute Edition of any title? If there is then let me tell you about some Florida swampland I have for sale. What are people thinking when they list items like this at such ridiculous prices. I thought the video game for $500.00 was bad but this is beyond that. If you want to read the material then buy the paperbacks and if you want to spend a little more and own the individual issues then buy them and you will still not spend a fraction of what this seller is asking for this book. If we all refuse to buy from this type of seller then maybe they will realize that they have to offer reasonable prices or get stuck with their items."},{"Title":"Absolute Planetary Book One","review":"I bought this because I really, really love the Planetary series and I thought this was the next in the series. However, upon receipt, I found that it is just a reprinting of the first one or two graphic novels.Granted, the printing is gorgeous and vibrant and this would make a great collectors item, however, I was looking forward to the next graphics novel and was truly bummed.So, if you would like a large-size reprint of the early Planetary story arcs, go for it! If not, wait for the next graphic novel for the story's continuation."},{"Title":"Kingdom on the Mississippi Revisited: Nauvoo in Mormon History","review":"The authors did a good job of research and excellent writing to give us a sense of life in Nauvoo. Of course, some controversial subjects are broached, polygamy, masonry, etc. but these were a part of life in Nauvoo so to shrink away from discussing them would have been to completley distort Nauvoo during the 1840's. The footnotes were easy to find and follow and the bibliography was excellent. This book is reccomened to anyone interested in Mormon Church history, and is indispensable if you want to learn about or write about Nauvoo, Illinois."},{"Title":"Kingdom on the Mississippi Revisited: Nauvoo in Mormon History","review":"Following on fromNauvoo: KINGDOM ON THE MISSISSIPPIthis book is also a collection of chapters discussing different aspects of historical Nauvoo, but unlike the previous volume, each chapter is written by a different author.The chapters cover topics such as:* The Nauvoo Charter* The Nauvoo Legion* The Mormon Press* Polygamy* Politics* The Martyrdom* The Lion and the Lady: Brigham Young and Emma SmithAll are recommended topics to research.Planning to visit Nauvoo immediately after reading this book, I found the following passage from the footnotes of interest:p.116: \\"Times and Seasons 4 (November 15, 1842): 8. At this time, Joseph Smith maintained ownership of the printing office, only leaving it to Taylor and Woodruff for a period of five years. Taylor moved the printing office from the corner of Water and Bain streets to the building at Main and Kimball streets in May 1845. Taylor's decision to move the printing office is surprising, despite his announcement that the move was being made to enlarge the establishment, considering that he was certainly aware that time was running out for the Mormons in Nauvoo; the official decision concerning suspending publication of the period was made in October 1845. I believe Taylor's decision to move the printing office was a direct outcome of the antagonism between Emma Smith and Brigham Young. Joseph Smith sold John Taylor the printing establishment in 1844, but he retained ownership of the property at Water and Bain.\\"Having now just returned from a stay in Nauvoo, I was able to see the foundations/basement of the Times and Season building on Water and Bain. It's currently owned by the Community of Christ. The Mormon/LDS property that currently has a restored Times and Seasons printing office is on Main and Kimball, adjoining John Taylor's residence.Whatever your interest is on Nauvoo, this book will be sure to appeal."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Pure & Simple","review":"I have reviewed numerous books on pregnancy and birth, and this is one of the worst. The author presents a one-sided description of a &quot;typical&quot; pregnancy, labor and delivery which totally ignores many of the alternatives available to women. Additionally, many of her descriptions of &quot;common&quot; prenatal, labor and delivery procedures are wildly outdated in 1998. Women reading this book today are reading about their mothers' deliveries; they will not be gaining useful information for their own."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Pure & Simple","review":"This book told me exactly what I wanted to know!

I've recommended it to all my pregnant friends."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Pure & Simple","review":"Hotchner has never had a baby! She has made a name for herself as an &quot;expert&quot; in this field but this is a dated book filled with second-hand information and advice.

Of course, if you are working on such a business plan, you have to give yourself time. I think atleast six months. There is a LOT of data gathering required on your part. You can not simply copy everything the book says, word by word and insert it into your own business plan. You must be able to support your idea with strong financial and statistical data. Start your research ASAP.However, this book gives a great insight on how a Salon/Spa Business Plan should look like. My biggest advice: Pace yourself. If you need a Plan in a few weeks, I suggest get a consultant and be prepared to pay some heavy $$$.Otherwise, work each day on one section of the book. There are wonderful samples and scenerios. I have yet to see such a comprehensive Business Plan.Also, remember, have factual data to back up all your information.Good Luck!"},{"Title":"QuickPlan/Salon & Day Spa 2005 Comprehensive Business Plan(Book + CD-ROM)","review":"I ordered this whole package a few weeks ago and it hasn't dissapointed me yet.

The main value of the approach the author provides is that it's both effective and consistent with best practices in project estimating.In particular, the deliverables-based work breakdown structure approach that forms the foundation of the estimating process is one that I've been using for over a decade, and is the only sane basis, in my opinion, for establishing estimating relationships between what the project is supposed to produce, and what it takes to produce it.I'm continually surprised by the large number of project managers, including PMPs, who don't use deliverables-based WBS. I'm not surprised, however, by the wide disparity between estimates and actuals when this method is not used. For this reason alone the book is invaluable, but there is even more that makes this book essential to any project manager. For example, the resource breakdown structure approach (also known as the organizational breakdown structure), and how it relates to the WBS is not only essential to accurate project planning and estimating, but is also an integral part of earned value project management (now a part of the PMI PMBOK). I especially liked the chapter on estimating models, which will provide project managers with proven tools and techniques, and the chapter on external projects.Overall, this book should be on the desk of every project manager during the planning and estimating phase, and carefully followed. I also recommend using this book with Earned Value Project Management, 2nd Edition by Quentin W. Fleming and Joel M. Koppelman."},{"Title":"Project Estimating and Cost Management (Project Management Essential Library)","review":"Per reading the book, I found it brief and straightforward, but very helpful. I consider it as a quick cost management guide/handbook.

However, I was hoping for a bigger meal on the Earned Value topic.

When she photocopied Henry Beard's &quot;The End of the Raven,&quot; I was smitten for life. This is a wonderful little book. Beard keeps the original meter and rhyming scheme of the poems parodied and it is priceless to compare the two side by side.

Beard, as usual, is masterful in his parody. In this case he takes on great poetry ranging from &quot;Beowulf&quot; to &quot;Xanadu&quot; to &quot;Song of Myself&quot; and and &quot;Howl&quot;, not to mention every age and genre in between.Not only is the parody marvellous, but Beard captures the very soul and essence of the cat. (If you read nothing else, read &quot;The End of the Raven&quot;)As if that weren't enough, the book has also made me go back and reread many of the original works, most of which I haven't looked at in years, some of which I'd never read. Who knew that &quot;The Emperor of Tuna Fish&quot; would lead me to a deeper appreciation for the original work, &quot;The Emperor of Ice Cream&quot;?If you like poetry, or you like cats, or you like poetry written by cats, read this book."},{"Title":"Poetry for Cats: The Definitive Anthology of Distinguished Feline Verse","review":"Readers of Poetry for Cats: The Definitive Anthology of Distinguished Feline Verse by Henry Beard will notice how much influence humans have on cats. Cats will not enjoy having this pointed out. They work hard to protect their free will and try to dictate the terms of their relationships with humans. You can not just pick up a cat and expect it to be happy being held; you have to wait until the cat is ready. Cats will not play with toys just because you want to play. Cats appear to think independently, but their poetry betrays them.Here is a bit of verse written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's cat:I chased a mouse beneath the stair,It went to ground, I knew not where;For, so swiftly it ran, my sightCould not follow it in its flight.Sound familiar?There is more. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's cat wrote the following:In Xanadu did Kubla KatA splendid sofa-bed decreeWith silken cushions soft and fatA perfect feline habitatSet on a gilt settee.Here is another sample, this time by William Shakespeare's cat:To go outside, and there perchance to stayOr to remain within: that is the question:Whether \`tis better for a cat to sufferThe cuffs and buffets of inclement weatherThat nature rains on those who roam abroadOr take a nap upon a scrap of carpet ...Have you noticed a trend? It appears that cats listen more than they let on, and they even identify with the humans with whom they relate. They certainly borrow verse as freely as they claim their favorite chairs.Cats do deserve some credit for knowing what poetry to borrow and adapt as their own. They are able to turn bits of Chaucer, Keats, Frost, or Ginsberg into works that serve their purposes, such as catching goldfish, breaking vases, or berating Whitman for sleeping too late. In near unison they raise their voices to complain about their vets.One thing that surprises me about Poetry for Cats is that Henry Beard never reveals the cats' names. I can not imagine that Emily Dickinson had a nameless cat!Poetry for Cats is an attractive book with colorful illustrations and is still in print after eleven years. I found our copy when inventorying the poetry collection. I am afraid few people have borrowed it lately, so I am going to put it on display. The cats need to be heard."},{"Title":"Poetry for Cats: The Definitive Anthology of Distinguished Feline Verse","review":"The only thing wrong with this book is that one has to both love cats and be educated in poetry. (In other words, there's no one else I know who can appreciate this book!) I like some of Henry Beard's poems even better than I do the originals. I'm especially glad that he chose to interpret some of my favorite poems (e.g., &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,&quot; and &quot;Xanadu.&quot;) Henry Beard is extremely talented; this sort of thing is very hard to do.

This is a MUST for anyone and everyone who loves cats and poetry."},{"Title":"Poetry for Cats: The Definitive Anthology of Distinguished Feline Verse","review":"This is an amazingly clever book! Beard takes famous poems and changes them to fit the cat perspective, making a poem that is often and well done as the original famous piece.

For example, take Poe's raven, which the cat wants to eat. Or, TS Elliot, where the cat measures out his life in cat food tins.

Showing both a love of poetry and a love of the feline, this book appeals on several levels.English teachers could use verses from this book to quiz their students -- whose cat wrote this poem? What is the poem on which this verse is based, etc.I wish there were another volume. What would Beard do with The Highwayman, or The Cremation of Sam Magee? Do I dare wonder how he would remake Maya Angelou's I'll Rise?I am buying another copy, this one for my mother, whom I called as soon as I got in the house after unwrapping the book -- still holding on to my purse and keys.

Every time I pick it up, I change my mind about what the best poem is.I actually remember lines from these poems sometimes, in circumstances where less happily placed people would recall lines from the originalpoems !By the way, 'Beowulf' is about the least wonderful, perhaps because the original was of no interest to me; too bad that that is the one Amazon used as the excerpt.I've read some of these as \\"friendly email\\" forwards, with no attribution.

The poems are funny, and they're all a perfect match for the original verse that they parody."},{"Title":"Letters of Jane Austen,","review":"\\"Letters of Jane Austen\\" contains the famous English author's surviving personal correspondence, beginning around age twenty and extending nearly to her early death at age 41. The collection will probably have the most meaning to readers who are already familiar with her life and her novels, which provide the necessary context for fully appreciating her letters.A number of things about the content of the letters, many of which were addressed to her sister Cassandra, may stand out to the reader. Jane Austen was obviously a gifted writer and a keen student of human nature, and this is highlighted in some of the letters, which can be rather wickedly witty about family, friends and neighbors. If many of the letter topics are commonplace, they provide a sense that Jane Austen never achieved financial security in her lifetime, whether through marrriage or her writing, and remained unhappily dependent on her family. It becomes obvious in the course of the letters that her writing was the most important thing in her life, and that she was a dutiful member of her immediate family, but you can find her sometime wistfully wishing for more. Perhaps most of all, there is a sense of the real Jane Austen present in the letters, even if she tends to be guarded about her inner-most thoughts. This reviewer wishes Cassandra had not been quite so thorough in weeding Jane's letters at her death. \\"Letters of Jane Austen\\" is highly recommended to her dedicated fans."},{"Title":"Letters of Jane Austen,","review":"I'm a Janeite, so this was my kind of book. I think it would be too slow and repetitive for anyone not in love with Jane Austen, her people and her time and place. I liked being in on her somewhat snide evaluations of people she meets and situations she encounters, and the letters do soften the 'authoress,' Jane Austen, for me and let me see more of the daughter and sister, Jane Austen. I loved the little details of daily life, writing to her sister and asking for two pair of stockings or some gloves from a particular shop or supplier, the contemplation of new dresses, the yardage to be purchased and then given to the dressmaker, the women of the family sitting in the parlor at their 'work,' making a dozen shirts (by hand with tiny stitches) for a brother soon to go to sea, the breakfasts, teas, dinners - with the food and drink seldom described. You'd think they didn't eat! But then, this is England, not France. Anyway, the book is a time travel vehicle. People die. Babies are born. Mothers die. Fathers remarry. There are constant flirtations and courtings. There is the endless finagling for the right mate, someone of equal status with money, and not too awful. Jane and her sister don't seem to take the deaths very hard. I suppose with someone always dying, and untimely death being so much harder to avoid,it was a matter of course.Jane's own death is only apparent to us by the cessation of the letters after a period of letters in which she alludes to, but never complains about, a growing disability and fatigue (and I suppose pain). She, who was always out on a fine morning walking somewhere, miles and miles across the countryside or hours and hours in town and city, tells her sister that she is no longer able to walk out and has to be helped to sit outdoors in the garden. I don't think she was yet 50 when she died. I also know that she had work in progress when she died. What have we missed.I loved this book, couldn't put it down. Just the right amount of explanation and information from the editor."},{"Title":"Acoustic Guitar Tab White Pages","review":"This book is jam packed with lots and lots of songs.

This is one of the best values out there by far. I have played music for 25 years, have perfect pitch, went to music college, and still struggle to hear exactly what is being played at times. It's not always easy to find accurate sheet music either. Most free websites where guitar tab is posted by the authors are usually incredibly inaccurate, even when they say they know for sure that it is correct. Trust me, it's not. I own two of these books now and like them as much today as when I got them. Simple information like finding out the artist is using a capo or an alternate tuning can save you countless hours of wasted time trying to figure out how something is played. Yes, it is like a phone book, hence the title, \\"White Pages.\\" However I don't find the print to be too small or the pages to be too thin, as another reviewer has reported. And while it is very detailed, so what. Nobody's forcing anyone to play note for note if they don't want to. The chords and rhythms are listed. You can play as generally or as detailed as you want.The bottom line is that people will gladly spend $30 or more on a half-hour lesson for a teacher to teach them 1 of these songs, but they have problems spending the equivalent or less for a book that has 150 detailed songs with accurate tabs. That's less than .20 a song! You still with me? I use these books for only a handful of songs I wanted to learn, and still, it cost less than that 1 guitar lesson.

Why do I make this assumption?1) Many of these songs don't even feature acoustic guitar throughout the song, the note-for-note transcriptions must be completely rearranged to be adapted as solo acoustic guitar arrangements (in the cases where the songs can even be rearranged for acoustic guitar).Just a few examples to this point:Yngwie Malmsteen's \\"Black Star\\"Firehouse \\"Don't Treat Me Bad\\"Peter Frampton \\"Show Me the Way\\"Ozzy and Lita Ford \\"Close My Eyes Forever\\"Triumph \\"Fight the Good Fight\\"2) This book does not contain acoustic guitar standards that one might expect.a) Not a single Led Zeppelin song.b) No STP, Pink Floyd, REM, Bon Jovi, Hendrix, Phish, Radiohead, Talking Heads, Sting or Rushc) Just 1 song each by popular acoustic artists such as Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Eagles and the Grateful Dead. 2 by James Taylor.d) very few Windham Hill players represented.e) Zero classical guitar arrangements (unless \\"Dust in the Wind\\" is your idea of classical-style guitar)Truth be told, there may be enough transcriptions of songs you will enjoy to make the book worth the $30 price tag; but certainly, this was a MISSED OPPORTUNITY for Hal Leonard to compile a definitive collection of the best songs featuring acoustic guitar."},{"Title":"Acoustic Guitar Tab White Pages","review":"This is a great selection of songs for the price. The only fatal flaw is that the tabs are TOO detailed. Some people may like to know every single missed note, mistake, or partial strum in the song, but for me, I find that the book sacrifices practicality for the sake of accuracy. I much prefer a little less detailed (and easier to use) tabs like those in Warner Bros. \\"Greater Guitar White Pages\\"."},{"Title":"Acoustic Guitar Tab White Pages","review":"Very disappointing book. The book is thick as an oversized phone book which makes it hard to keep open. The cover and pages are so thin that they tear very easily. Although there are some accurate tabs, there are also some inaccurate or incomplete. What i dislike the most is the songs that use a capo like \\"Here Comes The Sun\\". The song is capoed at the 7th fret, so when the notes that read 7 they instruct you to hit all the 7 notes as open. You basicly have to rewrite the entire tab which is useless to me. There are several songs tabbed that way, although about 2 of them are tabbed the regular way. \\"Let's Live For Today\\" Tune Down 1 1/2 steps, \\"American Woman\\" is an open G tuning, a lot of BS. On the other hand there are a lot of songs that are good tabs and very useful, just don't expect the entire book to be good. Overall a good book but needs work. Be sure to have some good reading glasses."},{"Title":"Acoustic Guitar Tab White Pages","review":"For the amount of songs included, the book lacks recent quality songs. A lot of the songs were of no interest to me and I rarely use the book. The format was reasonable although I am sure it could be improved. If you can't use the Internet to obtain your tabs, perhaps you would like this large, awkward, small-type, book of old songs."},{"Title":"Prince of the Quotidian","review":"An odd little book, this is more of a journal in verse than a collection of independent poems. It was published at about the same time that Farrar, Straus and Giroux published Muldoon's THE ANNALS OF CHILE, and the style here is quite similar to that book's long poem &quot;Yarrow.&quot; Like &quot;Yarrow,&quot; this sequence is highly allusive and makes plenty of inside personal jokes as well; you don't so much hope to understand it as just go along for the ride. What mitigates the opacity somewhat is Muldoon's playful approach to form: the entries often fall into sonnets, and there's always some kind of rhyme scheme to trace. Muldoon's trademark playful pararhyming is very much on display here, as when he criticizes an Irish production for making Chekhov &quot;more Irish / than a rush.&quot; Anyone who already enjoys Muldoon should read this, but it certainly shouldn't be the first thing you read by him."},{"Title":"The Power Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"Lance Caine is a policeman turn P.I.

The book is probably too shallow in depth for someone who wants to actually major in the subject matter. Nonetheless, the book serves its intended purpuse well to introduce biotechnology at a reaonably sophisticated level to the student. The book starts with the basics of organic chemistry principles and expands them to biochemistry. Well done!All the important technological and commercial concepts relevant to biotechnology are present and explaned well through text as well as diagrams. Perhaps one aspect that science books don't emphasize is writting style. The books is extremely clear and well written and can probably serve as an example of good technical writting style. I highly recommend the book to anyone who is serious about wanting to understand Biotechnology. As long as you hand Freshmand chemistry this book should serve you."},{"Title":"Biotechnology: Demystifying the Concepts","review":"If you are looking for a clear and interesting summary of many key concepts of Biotechnology, this book is for you. The author does a nice job of distilling the important concepts for both the scientist and layman alike. For the scientist, the book provides a nice review of the basics, and for the layman, it explains many difficult principles. At the end of each chapter the author also provides a lively discussion of some interesting practical applications and problems solved by Biotechnology."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"I enjoy Suzanne Forster's books but each time I read one, especially like Angel Face, I wish she put a little more into them. Her plot(s) seem to be solid, such as Angel Face's was. Serial killer in doubt; a single gorgeous rich doctor tracks her down in Mexico out of intrigue. OK I could buy the plot, but I just feel as if the writing doesn't get beneath the surface of the plot to make me believe in it. I mean I totally thought Angela Lowe was off her rocker when she had Jordon all tied up and was &quot;torturing&quot; him. I mean you look at that, and some books make you believe that even the impossible can come true, but it seemed too much like a male fantasy and not what a skittish, amnesiac female would do. And what was with the fruit juice??? I just couldn't buy that Jordon could love Angela, maybe lust after her body, but not love her-- she seemed like such a nut case and most people make wide leeway for crazy people, especially hunky single doctors (the saw-bones ones anyway).I thought Blush had excellent potential but even that did not live up to the expectation that I thought it could have...but then Suzanne is a published author and I am not.I like Suzanne Forster, I just wish she had more ink on the paper. I hope to read something excellent from her soon and recount my beliefs on her stories."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"I have enjoyed Suzanne Forster's books in the past, so I was thrilled to see this in the store. However, it's convoluted plot was so unbelievable that I had trouble turning the pages. The whole Mexico scenario was absurd. This book has made me place Ms. Forster's future novels on my &quot;checkout from the library&quot; list - rather than buying her products from the store. Save your money!"},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"This is my first and last book by Suzanne Forster. Had heard good things about past books and thought that I would give this one a try.Bizarre characterizations and an absurdly convuluted plot made this book painful to read. It just kept getting worse!If I could give zero stars, I would."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"An embarrassing misfire from Suzanne Forster who gave us sexually-charged read like her Blush and Innocence. ANGEL FACE as her latest work involves Dr. Jordan Carpenter who gets entangled with a killer Angel Face. He is informed by CIA agent Edwin Truitt that he is deemed the next target by the lust murderer who has slained off other doctors. She is rumoured to be disturbed from her abused past and entices her prey with her innocence. Angela Lowe works at SmartTech a researching company who specializes in its invention of a system that taps into the mind of violent serial killer. Haunted by fragments of her pasts, she decides to piece them out through Jordan who is cautious of her begiling identity as Angel Face....ANGEL FACE lacks the credibility to fuel its suspense. Her knowledge of clinical psychology explodes and bombards the reader, taking him to several unnecessary plot twists. Though erotically titillating at times with the jungle scene between Jordan and Angela, the plot tends to be confusing and ends up in a sputtering mess even to the point when the explanation is done. As such the reader is busy figuring out the plot rather than focusing his attention on Jordan and Angela.It tries to be avant-garde but the contrived twists make ANGEL FACE confusing and absurd to even consider this read angelic. Forster's penchance for building erotic tension is thus a wasted effort here to bolster the romance. ANGEL FACE could have been so much more."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"The CIA arrived on the doorstep of Jordan Carpenter, a brilliant surgeon, claiming he was the target of a serial killer named 'Angel Face.' One look at her picture, and Jordan was enthralled. Thereafter, his every thought centered around this vision. How could she have killed? The police could not be involved. Angela Lowe performed research for SmartTech, mapping the brain's workings as a part of a study on psychological profiling to determine when killers might kill. She had lost a year of her life and wasn't sure of anything from that period. Jordan agreed to help the CIA after finding a dead doctor clutching a defibrillator. When Angela arrived at Jordan's door claiming he was a research subject, Jordan attacked her, and she acted like a wounded bird. He began to question the CIA's veracity and hunted Angela into the Mexican rain forests where she was confronting her memories. The story takes us into the mind of a confused woman and a lonely man who fall hopelessly in love. Somewhere along the road, several conflicting subplots leave the reader confused and the credibility becomes questionable."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"I was absorbed in the first several chapters, but wasn't sure where the author was going with the plot. Once I passed halfway through the book. I was glad that I stayed with it until the end.CIA agent Edwin Truitt went to see Jordan Carpenter, a cardiologist well known for his patented inventions. Truitt told Jordan that the CIA needed his help. There is a serial killer, Angel Face, on the loose who has been targeting high profile doctors. The CIA kept local law enforcement and the FBI out of the loop. Jordan said, he wasn't interested. On his way out the door, Truitt gave Jordan Angel Face's dossier.Angela Lowe works for Smart Tech lab as a research assistant. Smart Tech is well-guarded and known for their secrecy. Very few employees working at Smart Tech are actually aware of the lab's real research. CIA agent Truitt is trying to frame Angela for the serial murders.When Jordan was in medical school, he wrote a paper on a remote sensor for monitoring the electrical impulses of the heart. The paper was never published. Jordan was concern that it might get into the wrong hands. One of his colleagues at Smart Tech stole his idea.The author finally put the pieces together. I've read several of Suzanne Forster's books. Her older books have a distinctive writing style and are inclined to drift. Angel Face was written in 2001. Suzanne Forster has since improved compared to her earlier writings."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"Don't bother reading this book. I thought it was a waste of time. Had lots of potential, but ended up being a terrible read. It appears that Forster wanted to throw her readers off in terms of figuring out who the serial killer was, but ended up just completely ruining the development of her characters. Very confusing. Plotline consisted of a couple main events haphardzardly thrown together. Ending seemed abrupt and definitely not expected, in a bad way. This novel needs some serious revisions."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"Heart surgeon, Jordon Carpenter has been told by a CIA agent that a woman is going to murder him because he's on her physician hit list. When a close call makes it clear that the agent is right, Jordon decides to take action and pursue the woman known as Angel Face. When he catches up with suspect Angela Lowe, it appears that years of her memories have been erased although, bit by bit, they're starting to return. As they do, things begin to heat up between Angela and Jordon. After all, this is romantic suspense.So, the question is, what would you do with a plot about a woman who might be a serial killer, but she just can't remember? The idea could have been taken in a number of more plausible directions than author Suzanne Forster chose for this novel, however, she did a good job of portraying main characters as neither all evil or all good. They definitely fall into a murky gray area and spiral down into animalistic survival mode which kept me turning the pages. This was the first Forster novel I've read and I've heard this isn't her best work. Would I read another book by Suzanne Forster? Sure, but not right away and not when there are so many authors I've yet to read."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"I haven't read all of Suzanne Forster's work, but I've read a lot of it, and I think Angel Face is her best book yet. Smart, fast-paced and sexy, this is exactly the kind of book that I love to read. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes her romances intelligent and hot! Suzanne Forster is becoming one of my favorite authors. I hope she keeps it up."},{"Title":"Angel Face","review":"Though a legend for his cardiothoraciac surgery which is on the cutting edge of the field, fortyish Dr. Jordan Carpenter has all the problems that stereotype bachelors. However, he soon has a new set of trouble when CIA Agent Edwin Truitt enlists his help in a matter of national security that at first hearing sounds more like a FBI case concerning a serial killer. The culprit, a former operative, beautiful twenty-seven years old &#65533;ANGEL FACE&#65533; has gathered information that could cause a world war even as she targets doctors for death. Jordan is number four on her death list, making him the next target.SmartTech&#65533;s biopsychologist Angela Lowe is comparing the brain patterns of geniuses and maniacs. She begins fieldwork by interviewing some of her subjects including Jordan. He realizes she is Angel Face yet finds he obsessively desires her in spite of the obvious danger she poses. She reciprocates his needs, but fears the threat he poses to her survival and the gaps in her memory that might be more than just fantasized homicides and Angela does not want to kill the doctor that she begins to love.ANGEL FACE is an exhilarating thriller that never slows down as readers, just like Jordan does, will wonder how the radiant Angela Lowe can be a cold-hearted killing machine. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action and several twists that amplify the action and insight into the characters. The technology enhances the cutting edge of the plot so those fans of medical chills, serial kills, and romantic suspense thrills share an invigorating tale that showcases Suzanne Forster&#65533;s writing skills.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Sourcebook to Public Record Information, Seventh Edition","review":"I am a Private Detective and own my own business,I think this book is easy and great!I recommend it for anyone in my profession.Well worth the money on all the research time you will save."},{"Title":"Marry Me, Cowboy","review":"Riding High by Janet DaileyDeke Flanders - He's a cool-headed, long-legged, heart stopping stunt cowboy who's about to take the hardest fall of his life - for Victoria Thornton, an arrogant actress he'd never even expected to like...The Man From Southern Cross by Margaret WayDavid Mountford - He's handsome, rich, a little cynical about women - and as master of the legendary cattle station Southern Cross, he's one of the most powerful men in the Australian outback.

I had an old copy of this book on my shelf from when I was a child, so I gave it to her. But she didn't want to really use it because it was old. So I found a used paperback in good condition on Amazon (new copies are no longer in print). It had a 25 cent sticker on the front, and a bar code which couldn't be removed without tearing the cover, so I put stickers over them and covered them with book tape. I read it again before giving it to her, and it is such an inspiring story! I found it interesting that she was a very strong-willed person (even in the 1800's), and didn't accept Christ until she was in college, although her family and friends were mostly Christians. As a teacher, and a single female on the mission field in China, she is still a great role model to read about, and the book's title is certainly appropriate!"},{"Title":"Hockey's Greatest Teams","review":"Typical of how bad this book is can be found in Podnieks' decision to exclude the 1980s New York Islanders from his list of hockey's greatest teams.

The author makes social commentary on many levels: society, culture, and the personal. Every person reading this book will enjoy it as they will see a person or particular situation which they can identify with.

But, Manolo is afraid of bulls; he thinks bullfighting is cruel to bulls. Manolo has to fight his first bull at eleven. Everybody expects him to be as good a bullfighter as Juan Olivar, but Manolo's a coward, and he knows it.This book contains many Spanish bullfighting terms. This story is well written and always fascinating and interesting. This book often makes you think what you would do if you were Manolo and in his circumstances. When it is time for Manolo to fight his first bull, it is exciting, gripping, and intense.Overall, this is a wonderful book and I give it four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Book Review: Shadow of a BullDo you think you would have enough courage to fight in a bullfight? Well, Manolo did. Manolo's father was one of the greatest bullfighters to ever walk the face of the Earth, and everyone expected Manolo to be the same. However, Manolo could not perform anywhere near his father's standards, and often wished he did not have to live up to those expectations. When he saw his first bullfight Manolo started to enjoy bullfighting more, and realized he could be as good as father. He practiced every day and got better, and better. Finally, he fought in his first bullfight. He did very well with the cape, but did not perform as well in his other competitions. Then an old man gave Manolo the choice to either become a doctor or a bullfighter. This was a very difficult choice for Manolo to make.I guess you will have to read the book to find out what he chose.In my opinion, Shadow of a Bull was a good book for several reasons. First of all, it was a quick easy reader. Second of all, I think that the author did a wonderful job describing the bullfight and the Spanish culture. The reader feels like he is at the bullfights cheering on Manolo. Next, I think that many people have faced intimidating challenges similar to the Manolo's. This makes it easy to sympathize with Manolo throughout the book. Finally, in addition to being a book about Spanish culture and bullfighting, Shadow of a Bull is a fable. The lesson to be learned from this book is that hard work pays off and that working hard is the only way to achieve goals. That is a very important lesson to learn in life. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Shadow of a Bull is a book about a boy named Manolo Olivar who is forced by the people of Arcangel to follow his father's path as a bullfighter. Everyone in the town of Arcangel expected him to fight a bull at the age of 12, just like his father had. He believed that he couldn't overcome his fear of the fight, and that he could not find the courage and strength to fight his first bull. His friend named Juan Garcia always went to the pastures to cape wild bulls(do passes with them). Manolo asked him if he could come and watch him cape the bulls. At first, Juan was hesitant and refused to take Manolo with him, but, after convincing Juan, they decided to meet a few days later to go to the pastures. Manolo got to see how Juan put his bravery and strength to test. He felt that he might be ready to fight his first bull. Manolo wanted to show the people how good Juan was at fighting bulls so he asked the Count if he could cape some cows after Manolo was done with his bull. The Count agreed and said he could cape the cows, but that he couldn't help Manolo with his bull. During Manolo's fight with the bull he said that he did not want to be a bullfighter and said that this was Juan's bull. So Juan started fighting the pull and did some magnificent passes. The crowd shouted \\"Ole!\\" and Juan had tears in his eyes. Manolo had given up what he was destined to do and had given that opportunity to Juan who pleased the crowd much more than Manolo could have done.I enjoyed this book because it was fun to hear about the gorings of the bull fighters. Manolo was always scared to be gored by one of those big, sharp, bull horns. \\"In Spain, however, people have found a way of cheating death. They summon it to appear in the afternoon in the bull ring,and they make it face a man. Death-a fighting bull with horns as weapons-is killed by a bullfighter. And the people are there watching death being cheated of its right.\\" Manolo feared death. He was not sure if he could cheat it like others could in the ring. I also would be scared if I had to fight a half-ton bull.I also disliked this book because it was very boring in the first half. I would suggest this book to people that enjoy having a sad, but interesting ending. It would be enjoyable to read about how the bullfighters fought if the reader likes to hear about how animals can be killed with no chance to escape. I found it upsetting to read about how animals are cruelly tortured just for the entertainment of a crowd.My favorite part of the book was when the doctor was showing Manolo the gore wound from a bull. It was very descriptive and explained very well how the wound looked. It seemed a little bit of fairness that bullfighters had been injured by the bull because humans usually injure them.This book is great for young readers and adolescent readers(grades 4-7) and even older. This book is one of the best I have read. I recommend it to readers who want to learn about another culture or who want to find out more about bullfighting."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"We've all done things we didn't want to do just to make other people happy.

Six men, friends of his father's, take Manolo to many bullfights and teach him everything there is to know about the sport. Manolo knows what the whole town wants from him. He just doesn't know if he is capable to give it to them. But in the end, his dream comes true in a way that pleases both him and the town when he becomes the doctor he wanted to be.

When Manolo's father is killed in the ring, the people look to Manolo to become the man his father was. Manolo does not want to be a bullfighter. But he does not want to disappoint his mother and his father's friends and all the people of his town. He is afraid, paradoxically, of both the bull and of being a coward. He can find no way out.The author is somehow able to share with the reader the beauty and the horror of bullfighting. I was surprised to find that I could see bullfighting in a new way, as an art, as a heroic act, though I continue to feel revulsion as well."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"A cultural history lesson about Spain disguised as a story, but a good story nonetheless. Manolo Olivar looks just like his father, a famous bullfighter killed when Manolo was small. Everyone in the Andalusian town of Arcangel just knows Manolo is destined to be a great bullfighter like his father. Everyone, that is, except Manolo himself. When taken to his first bullfight at age nine, young Manolo sympathized with the bull rather than with the man facing the danger (\\"He wanted to cry out for the bull and his pain\\"). Now, nervously facing his first fight as a matador, Manolo prays to the Virgin Mary not for his own safety, but for the animal's: \\"Please don't let them make me kill the bull.\\"He is no coward; he simply lacks afici&oacute;n, defined by the author as \\"intense love for bullfighting.\\" This boy is not destined to be a killer, but a healer. After facing down his fears, and finally deciding to speak up for himself, Manolo announces that instead of becoming a bullfighter, he will study to be a doctor.We never learn much about Manolo besides his feelings about bullfighting. The author does not describe his home, mother, siblings, or school, though we know he has them all. Manolo is a merely the blank slate upon which is inscribed a verbal portrait of Spanish bullfighting culture. And yet the simple story does not get lost -- this boy on the verge of manhood must prove himself to be physically and morally courageous, or suffer social humiliation.On every page there are specialized Spanish words pertaining to bullfighting; a useful glossary at the end defines these terms and gives a pronunciation key. This book would be most appreciated by young male readers who will someday enjoy reading Ernest Hemingway, especially Death in the Afternoon and For Whom the Bell Tolls. No illustrations."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"When a boy, Manolo Olivar, is born, all the people of Archangel expect him to become a great bullfighter like his father, Juan Olivar.

When he fights his bulland makes an unexpected faulty move with his muleta, he starts to realize that he needs to tell his spectators his decision.This book was very interesting and full of suspense. I liked it very much, and I rate it four stars. Maia Wojciechowska used many Spanish words in her creative and enlarged vocabulary.

I wish Maia Wojciechowaska told a little more information about Juan Garcia's fight, but other than that i thought the book was pretty good"},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Shadow of a Bull is about a boy called Manolo whose father was a famous bullfighter (torero) from Arcangel, Spain. Like many children of today, he is expected to follow in his father's footsteps. As the story unfolds, it becomes evident that Manolo has a very difficult decision to make. In our opinion this is a book that we recommend reading as a group because it led to many meaningful discussions."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"I thougt that it was an ok book because it was a exciting,cool and fun book because my class got to do fun projeckes."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Story is so slow it's painful. But you get to learn all the intricacies of bull fighting that you never wanted to know it the first place. A coming of age story that includes the glorified details of sectioned animal cruelty. You get to listen to old men trying to convince a kid to be a bull fighter even though they saw his dad killed by a bull. Do yourself a favor, read a different book."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"ok first I wanna say that this book was totally boring no suspense what so ever! Who wants to read a book with a glossary in the back??? Manolo is the son of the greatest matodor in spain who was gored during a bullfight. Now everyone in Spain wants Manolo to be a bull fighter (come on peeps the kid is like 10 and there teaching him to fight bulls? Thats kinda violent isn't it?) Manolo dosn't have an ounce of courage (I guess you would say that he's a \\"pretty boy\\") he dosn't want to fight the bull. On the day of his bull fight he gives the bull to some one who really deserves to fight. I don't think some one should write a children's book on bullfighting because it is a violent sport it is full of blood and death that shouldn't be tought to children."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Although written in the language that a 9-10 year old can easily read, the subject matter really should be more interesting to an older child. The story deals with one's fears and dreams, and more important, the road to the fulfillment of dreams....A subject more suitable for children, say, 14 or older. I would otherwise give this book a 5 star, but because of this mismatch of subject matter and depth of language, I gave it only a four. That being said, the story is interesting and well written. It shows children a different world and a different culture, which serves the purpose of my buying this book for my daughters."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"This book is about a boy named Manolo, and he lives in a town called Archangel. Manolo's father was a famous bullfighter. Then he died while he was bullfighting. Everyone in Archangel now calls Manolo's father their hero because he was such a good bullfighter. Now the people of Archangel are depending on Manolo to be a great bullfighter, just like his father was. So the people are going to make manolo fight at 12 years old. Manolo is really dreading this day, but he knows it will come sometime. When the day comes that he finally has to fight his bull, he decides that he really does not want to be a bull fighter like his father. So Manolo decides that he is not going to fight his bull and that he wants to become a doctor.I really liked this book because it was very exciting. Manolo thought that he was a coward at the beginning of the book, but in the end, he proved to be a very brave boy, and that is what I really enjoyed about the book, that he was not afraid to do what he really wanted to do."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"In the beginning, Manolo's father is dead because he was gored and died. Everybody expects Manolo to be a great bullfighter like his dad. When he meets with the Count, he learns he was to fight his bull a year early. At the tienta, he talks with Castillo before the fight. When he's out in the ring, he does really good with teh cape, but the bull rams the muleta. Manolo gets the muleta back and gives it to Juan Garcia. Manolo wants to become a doctor.I liked the book because it's about a boy who is expected to do someething, but has a different way he wants to spend his life. I also like good they describe the bull fight. I like how the writer uses Spanish words. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Manolo a boy who's had a dream that he would become a bullfighter. The more he grew the more he would look like his father. His dad was a bullfighter. Manolo is a coward he couldn't stay in the ring for even fifteen seconds no five seconds!!! Manolo loves his dad but he doesn't love bullfighting. He wants to make his dad's dream come true but his was too scared. Manolo is worried about his choice. He doesn't want to make the same mistake his dad made.Will he follow his dad's footsteps or will he be scared all his life?"},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Manolo's struggle to figure out who he is, other than the son of a famous bullfighter, makes for a haunting story. Part of the pleasure is discovering that one's destiny may be, in fact, to choose a path that leads in an entirely unexpected direction. The somber, ghostly illustrations add to the sense of mystery. Not a &quot;fun&quot; book -- A vivid and powerful story that I believe will be especially meaningful for boys, and most likely boys between 9 and 12 or so."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"I really like this book because I like bull fighting.

I used it as a read-aloud for 8th graders. We had some great discussions about the importance of making your own choices and decisions in life. We cannot be happy if we allow the wants of others--friends or family--to force us to be who we are not. A good discussion vehicle for parents and children."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"I think this book is very very interesting. I would give the book five stars because the carictars are ver nice and realistic.I liked this book because it really made me think about the book and the peopl in it. I think this book would be good for fifth graders and fourth graders. so I would give this book five stars."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Maia Wojciechowska is my aunt and is a wonderfully creative writer. This book speaks to the human spirit in a marvelous and challenging way. It gives children a window into the Spanish soul and spirit and crosses cultures with quiet widsom and thoughtfulness. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"I thought that the book \\"Shadow of a Bull\\" was a very good book. I thought it was interesting, because it was about this kid named Manalo that was afraid of bulls, but he had to fight them anyways. Some parts were interesting, because you could see how he was training, and all of the hard work it takes to be a great bull fighter. All in all, I thought that this book was a good, and interesting book to read.This book was about this kid nmed Manolo. He had to become a great bull fighter, because his dad was the best bull fighter in Spain, and everyone wanted Manolo to be just like His dad. He had to do a lot of training to become a great bull fighter, and he went to a lot of bull fights, so that he could study all of the moves that the good bull fighter made. He like the bull fights, and he thought that they were interesting, but he did not like the end of the bull fights. He did not like them, because they would have to kill the bulls. He went through all of this training, and he would have become a great bull fighter, until he decided that he did not want to be a bull fighter anymore. He wanted his friend Juan to take his place, and he wanted to become a docter. He wanted to become a docter, because if anything would have happened to Juan, he could have helped him.I think that it would be a great book to read for people to read, because it was a very interesting book. I think that people that like interesting books, and sports books will like it the most, because that is what the story is about, bull fighting,(a sport) and it is very interesting. I think that people should read this book, because I thought it was a very good book, and because I think that other people will like the book as much as I did, and maybe even more than I did. I thought that it was a great book, and I think that people should read it, because it was a great book.Matt"},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Manolo's struggle to figure out who he is, other than the son of a famous bullfighter, makes for a haunting story.
