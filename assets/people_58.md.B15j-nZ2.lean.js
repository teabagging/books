While I fancy myself well read this is one of the \\"classics\\" that I had ignored until my high school age daughter performed the role of Grace Pool in the musical. It so interested me that I decided to read the book and once I started I literally could not put it down. What a fascinating story! Themes of abuse, bitterness, friendship, betrayal, disappointment, integrity, forgiveness, love, etc. The story is full of intricate plot lines and wonderful and memorable characters. By the end of the book you know these people and you are rejoicing, empathizing, laughing and weeping with them. If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" do yourself a favor, turn off the TV, and settle down for a enjoyable and poignant reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I ordered this book along with Pride and Prejudice. They are more beautiful in person that in the pictures. Very well made and durable and the paper is thick and high quality so they will hold up even if you read them over and over as I do with my favorites. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels. The story is such a wonderful mix of classic romance but with splashes of the dark and supernatural. I highly recommend these gorgeous penguine classics to everybody and I can't wait to order the rest of them for myself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"On October 16th, of 1847, \\"Jane Eyre: An Autobiography\\", edited by Currier Bell (pseudonym of Charlotte Bront) was published. It created some controversy at the time, as many believed it was written by a man. The novel was very popular when published, but critical reaction to it varied. Today, it is clearly a classic, the development of a young woman, who does not fit into the stereotype of a nineteenth century woman. She is not submissive, and she struggles to avoid being dependent on others. The original publication was in three volumes, but this Penguin Classics edition is based on the third edition of Jane Eyre, and it is the last edition which Charlotte Bront edited and corrected.The story covers Jane's life from her childhood until her marriage. The childhood chapters can be split into two sections, those where Jane, an orphan, was being raised by her Uncle's family, but her uncle has passed away and her aunt does not like her, but was forced to promise to take care of her. The key parts of this section are Jane's being rejected by the closest thing she has to a family, her morality, and her independence, i.e. her refusal to conform. The second part of her childhood is when she is sent to attend a charity school, called Lowood, where the pupils have to make do with substandard food and clothing. Here Jane finds one teacher who treats her, and the other students, well, Miss Maria Temple. One of the key things in this section is the difference between religion and morality, symbolized by Mr. Brocklehurst a clergyman who is mostly responsible for the appalling conditions at Lowood, and Jane and Miss Temple on the side of morality. Also key is Jane's witnessing her friend, Helen Burns, dying from a typhus epidemic, in spite of her goodness and her submission to the standards imposed by Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Scatcherd, a teacher as cruel as Miss Temple is kind.The story then picks up many years later, with Jane in position as a teacher at Lowood, but looking to move on. She advertises for a position as a governess and is hired by Mrs. Fairfax. She is to take care of Ad&egrave;le Varens, a girl who is being taken care of by Mr. Rochester, the master of Thornfield Manor where Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper. This section has a lot to do with class, as well as morality. There is the difficulty of Jane falling in love with someone of a different class. There is also the looking down on Jane as being of a lower class, by Mr. Rochester's peers. The morality questions are here to, in the comparison of the higher classes verses that of the lower class. Even Mr. Rochester's behavior is in question, in the events leading up to Jane leaving. Jane also finds out that she does have family left, and when it appears that she is to have everything, she sends a letter to her father's brother. It is this attempt to reconnect with family that causes her to lose nearly everything as it destroys what she thought she was about to have.The next section details Jane's life after leaving Thornfield Manor. Here she loses almost everything, and is on death's door when she is on the doorstep of Moor House. The Rivers, St. John, Diana, and Mary. It is from this state of having nothing from which she recovers almost everything she could want. Here she recovers her health, she is employed again and regains much of her independence. St. John is in love with a woman, but he will not ask her because he is driven to devote his life to religion. He does find out Jane's true identity though, and this results in Jane learning she has family, and wealth that she didn't know she had. She is pressured by St. John to marry him and join him in his missionary life, but she knows that he doesn't love her. She rejects St. John, and instead goes to find her one love, Mr. Rochester. She now has wealth and family, and she learns that tragedies in Mr. Rochester's life have made what was once impossible possible.It is a long and winding road which Jane travels in this novel. Probably best classified as a gothic romance, it deals with numerous issues and the strength of Jane's character serves as a good role model for young women, and for that matter anyone. The Penguin Classics edition is filled with supporting documentation as always. There is a wonderful introduction by Stevie Davies, along with a Chronology, suggestions for further reading, notes on the text, opinions of the press, and wonderful textual notes which enhance the reading experience and understanding of the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Never being a great fan of the Victorian period of English literature, I have always steered clear of the sisters Bronte, Jane Austin, and others of their ilk. It is amazing how much we miss when blinded by prejudice. I not only liked Jane Eyre immensely, but was very impressed by the literary abilities of Charlotte Bronte and regretted that I had not read the novel sooner. Although Bronte did not have the formal education and did not share the literary traditions enjoyed by some of her male colleagues, she grew up in a household in which storytelling was prominent and understood that the first task of any writer is the ability to tell a good story. Jane Eyre is a wonderful creation, a story that keeps the reader's interest from the first, and one in which Bronte introduces to the reading public one of the first truly modern heroines.Charlotte Bronte's novel is a complex and structured work and contains within it elements of romance, picaresque wanderings and a preoccupation for the Gothic themes of mystery and the supernatural. But to describe the work simply as a very good Gothic novel would be to ignore the remarkable characterization that Bronte achieves in the creation of the character of Jane Eyre. Bronte's character is quite unique when compared to other female heroines of the era. Jane is not beautiful and does not enjoy any of the privileges of wealth or social position, and it is clear from the beginning that if Jane is to make her way in the world she will have to do it with a combination of hard work and intelligence, and not be afraid to question accepted social conventions. The decision of Bronte to narrate the tale through the eyes of Jane bonds the reader and the main character together creating an intimacy that is first rate. We share all her hardships and experiences from Gateshead to the final reunion with Mr. Rochester, and sympathize with her moral dilemmas and her indignant stand against religious hypocrisy (a feeling strong enough to have her expound more fully in the preface to the second edition of her novel: \\"[The world] may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose - to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it - to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but, hate as it will, it is indebted to him\\").Although the creation of the character of Jane is Bronte's greatest achievement, she is possessed with the talent to write a story that is exciting, mysterious and ultimately rewarding - in other words, a pure classic. Bronte may not possess in full the literary style of some of her contemporaries, but she writes with assurance and surprises the reader with some extraordinary passages, beautiful examples that combine nostalgia, religious mysticism and poetic rhythm into a wonderful prose. The influence of the book is still alive over a century later. Jean Rhys uses the novel as the point of departure for her Wide Sargasso Sea, and groups as divergent as Marxists, feminists, and Horatio Alger types all use the book as part of their lexicon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Let me just be out with it: I love Jane Eyre. It is my mom's favorite novel of all times and definitely in my (constantly changing) top 5. The Dover Thrift Edition is a wonderfully inexpensive way to get wonderful literature into people's hands, so I am pro-Dover, all the way. But to speak to the novel itself, it's a classic that's been remade into films so many times because it is a great story artfully told. Jane is one of my all-time favorite literary characters, and almost definitely my favorite female one. If you hate romance novels which have the prerequisite of a jaw-droppingly beautiful heroine, let me introduce you to Miss Eyre (though if she were alive today, she might insist on Ms.) Jane is described as \\"plain\\" throughout the novel, and this not-terribly-flattering adjective applies to her on several levels (her appearance, her plain-speaking manner, her direct way of dealing with problems). Because of the first-person narration and the abundance of details of her early life, the reader is drawn into a close relationship with Jane, and to know her is to love her. Here is someone I readily admire with her pluck and nerve tempered by a healthy dose of humility. Jane seems like such a real person as we get right inside her thoughts and see her deepest longings, doubts, and fears. To me the most telling scene is (hopefully not too much of a spoiler) when Jane unfavorably compares herself to Mr. Rochester's presumed sweetheart, the beautiful Blanche Ingraham. To cure herself of any flights of romantic fantasy she may be tempted to indulge in over her boss, she forces herself to make two very realistic drawings, one of herself and one of Blanche, and study them closely, hoping to cure herself of the foolish notion that a man might prefer her to gorgeous Blanche. Wow, what a woman! How many of us have the strength of will or character to study our weaknesses in as strong a light as possible in order to disabuse ourselves of notions we fear may be dangerous? Jane certainly doesn't suffer from the too-common (modern?) disease of self-importance, and we see how this, combined with her certain moral compass, guide her to do the right thing(s) even when they are not in any way fun or pleasant. Pick up a copy of Jane Eyre if you haven't read it before and give one of British literature's most interesting creations the chance to win you over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Some modern readers may find it hard to believe that this little Gothic novel created quite the scandal in its day. The novel is based on an orphan by the name of Jane Eyre, who is raised by her aunt, the cold-hearted and cruel Mrs Reed. Jane's early childhood is one marked by violence and neglect. Early on, however, the readers learn that little Jane Eyre has a fiery spirit that refuses to become a victim of its oppressive enviroment. She boldly lashes out at those who mean to demean her and constantly remind of her station in life.When Jane fondest wish comes true, she leaves behind her wretched existence at Gateshead House and arrives at Lowood school. Jane's life at the orphan boarding school proves just as trying as her time at Gateshead. Behind the walls of Lowood, Jane suffers many privations and witnesses many acts of cruelty. She remains at Loowood for eight years, first as a pupil then as a teacher. Jane's urgent need for change prompts her to seek a position as a governess. She finds such a position at Thornfield Hall, the home of Edward Rochester, who the narrator falls deeply in love with.The character of Jane Eyre is extremely modern. Readers today will have little problem identifying with her thoughts and wishes. Although of low social standing, Jane speaks her mind to those who mean to subdue her. She reminds her aunt of her promise to look after her when she abuses her as a child. She defies the teachers at Lowood. She refuses to become Mr Rochester's mistress. Jane choses her own happiness over what is expected of her, not a very attractive quality in women in Victorian society, but one modern readers can sympathize withCharlotte Bronte used several personal life experiences as inspiration for this novel. Like Jane, Charlotte attended a boarding school, where she experienced many of the tribulations Jane suffered. The death of Helen Burns at Lowood from tuberculosis was inspired by the death of her sisters Elizabeth and Maria, at The Clergy Daughter's School from the same disease. Jane Eyre is one of the best classics. It's dark and tragic, yet emotional and even amusing at times. Definitely one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Although this novel was required reading for me, I really enjoyed it. The plot was semi- precictable, however the way that the plot was unveiled was creative and twisted. I enjoyed the realistic character of Jane with her insecurities and imperfect appearance.

I would reccomend this book to girls, not necesarily boys. Good luck with your choice!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A Favorite! This is a must have classic.

However, I finally revisited the book after many years and enjoyed it much more this time around.Jane Eyre is a young, determined girl who is determined to find her proper place in the world. As an orphan who was brought up by her cruel aunt, Jane is sent away to boarding school at a young age, where she and the other students suffer under the hand of an evil headmaster. Things improve at the school when the institution's poor conditions are brought to light following a typhus epidemic, and Jane finishes her schooling and then remains at the facility as a teacher for several years.Although she's content working at the school, Jane still thinks that life has something else in store for her. She accepts a governess position at Thornfield Manor, where she is employed by the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite his rather surly disposition, Jane finds herself falling in love with Rochester, and is stunned when he returns her affections and proposes marriage. Unfortunately, the wedding never takes place due to a massive secret that Rochester unsuccessfully tries to keep hidden. Jane ultimately flees Thornfield and arrives at another manor called Marsh End, where many surprises await her. Another man eventually proposes marriage to Jane, but she must listen to her heart and return to the one place where she's ever truly felt at home.Jane possesses great strength, self-worth and personal dignity. She's a woman who stays true to her principles throughout her entire life, regardless of the many challenges thrown into her path. Also, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a love story of sorts, and it has a very romantic ending, which I always enjoy.I still think there are parts of this novel that really drag, but I appreciate it a lot more than I did when I was younger. \\"Jane Eyre\\" doesn't come close to \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" in my opinion (Emily was SO the better Bronte!), but it definitely stands on its own as one of the first truly feminist novels ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This was the first book I read by Charlotte Bronte, and after I finished it I immediately got Villette, then The Professor, and Shirley, and others!

She seems to be a true Christian, free from a religious mind-set, and with hopeful views of humanity. I think she is very intelligent, and a little ahead of her time. I love her language and the flow of her writing. The book is romantic but a bit dark, which was a bit refreshing actually. (Although nowhere near as dark as her sister's Wuthering Heights). Read it, it is great, and don't stop at just this book. Shirley is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Contrary to popular fiction of her day, Bront is keen to keep reminding us that Jane Eyre is no beauty, irregular in feature, and plain. That Rochester is dark, brooding, and not handsome, with a deficient moral history.Can such imperfects unite? Can earthy limits find heaven in love and devotion? Often he calls her by her own name. Other times he calls her by another name, an invention of endearment. What does he call her? From calling him Sir she moves to a name born of equality and devotion. What does she say? New naming is not so strange, as in Revelation 3:12: \\"I will write upon him my new name.\\"Can we ordinary persons unite? Can we couples live with each other's limitations, and be happy and joyful?

But to fully appreciate this book requires that you be a \\"mature\\" reader. And also realize that this book was written in another era, where society and standards were much different than today.I originally read this book years ago for my highschool literature class. Although I didn't dis-like the book, I didn't exactly like it either. It did not have much of an impact on me. I think I was too immature (lacking in life experiences) to relate to and understand some of the strong emotions and the complex sides of human nature portrayed in the book.Reading this book years later as a mature adult, I was deeply touched by the story of Jane Eyre. You experience a variety of emotions: abandonment, despair, love, romance, mystery, danger, heartache. And Jane Eyre was really a character ahead of her time - Although content to conform to the standards expected of a woman in her time period, Jane had an independent mind and spirit. She would not do something against her will, heart, or conscience. She was not afraid to speak her mind. She had strong Christian moral beliefs and would not waver from them. She is a heroine to be admired and respected.So much more could be said, but I will leave it at that. If you were disapointed by Jane Eyre if you read it as a teenager, try reading it again as an adult."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Quite arguably one of the greatest British novels ever penned, Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is so all-around-wonderful, it's no wonder that it's been adapted into 5+ movies.We first meet Bronte's Jane as a child, young and abused, in the care of her aunt. We immediately take Jane under our wing, feeling more her personal protector with each turn of the page. Then, one day, Jane is a woman. Though retaining many of her childlike tendencies, Jane is determined to be independent: leaving her old boarding school victorious and free, she begins a governess position at the manor home of the elusive and mysterious Mr. Edward Rochester. It is Jane who tames Rochester's brooding and arrogant heart, reducing him to schoolboyish desperation.So deliciously provactive is &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; that it is impossible not to devour it within days; my own worn-with-love copy sits next to a dog-eared &quot;Villette.&quot;It is sometimes speculated that Charlotte Bronte exercised her complicated mind through the written word; &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is beautiful evidence of that.As the story slows to its conclusion, you will find yourself lost: hungry for more of Jane, more of Rochester, and more of the magic that is &quot;Eyre.&quot; Quench that thirst with more Bronte (perhaps Emily's &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; or some of Anne's poetry?) or, if you're like me, a second read of the irresistible &quot;Jane.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is probably one of my top ten fave books of all time.

The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love.

At nearly each and every turn within its pages, there is some rule, some assumption of character and plot destroyed. In JANE EYRE, women fight back against tyrannical husbands, governesses \`look above their stations', mothers are absent and men are punished for their subjugation of women. Not content to only poke at society through the safety of a fictional character, Bronte also confronts literary conventions, constructing JANE EYRE as a Bildungsroman about a WOMAN, and an UNATTRACTIVE woman to boot. Is nothing sacred? NO. And this is what makes JANE EYRE such a wonderful read. Looking for just great wit, nascent feminism and in general a pretty good story addled with a few boring inanities about day-to-day life? Go buy a Jane Austen novel. JANE EYRE is nearly the antithesis of orderly Austen, a passionate display of feelings and emotions that would have made Austen's EMMA blush, a full-blown rebellion against the societal constraints upon women.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties...they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves...\\" Within these few scathing lines is contained almost the entire sociological crux of the novel. For Jane, though outwardly calm as \\"women are supposed to be\\", is often raging inside at various acts of injustice perpetrated upon her. Sometimes she releases her feelings and vents, other times she swallows it \\"as women are supposed to\\" do. At this period of time, women in the upper class were mostly ornaments. When men spoke of their accomplishments, they meant things like a woman's ability to speak French, or her grace while playing a piano. Her business acumen would most likely not be counted an accomplishment, but a detraction, a manifestation of too spirited a personality, or too lively a mind. Hopeful mammas made sure that their little girls learned all the correct dances, could play an instrument and sing, or embroider, NOT complete ledgers. Bronte is urging that her fellow women not be confined to the pursuit of such activities, but allowed to exercise their minds and emotions in whatever direction they might want to...and in 1841!It's a wild ride that never ceases to be entertaining. Don't miss JANE EYRE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. I mean what more could a girl want out of a book. ...

Read this a million times, and I promise that not once, you will get tired of it. *Not once* So after you get this message, go out ... and buy this book! If you don't it will be the *BIGGEST* mistake that you could possibly make ... but this is a *realy GOOD book*"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I received this book for a gift when I was twelve and found it incredibly boring. I am now eighteen and for lack of any other books to read picked it up again. To my suprise I could not put it down! The character of Jane Eyre was both inspiring and identifiable. Charlotte Bronte's best novel no doubt, the plot was excellently well crafted. Although a few parts are obvious, this classic romantic novel kept me turning pages furiously!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Susan Ericksen does an excellent job of narrating this audiobook. Her reading voice is pleasant and natural-sounding and she conveys just the right amount of emotion. She also manages to vary the tone of her voice just enough that can differentiate between characters but not so much that she sounds foolish.The only drawback to this audio book is that it is recorded on two tracks. That means you have to listen to each tape twice, setting it either to the full right or full left speaker of your stereo. Although this does cut back on the number of tapes, I didn't like having all the sound come from one side of my car."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; it is obvious to tell that the author, Charlotte Bronte is the sister of Emily Bronte. The dark tone and twisted love story are all to analogous traits of Emily's Bronte's story, &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot; Much like Charlotte, Jane is an unattractive girl, who grows up in a school for girls where the accomidations are all but comfortable. She grows to be very inteligent, however, is not the most sought after girl in England. She becomes a governess for a man named Mr. Rochester. Jane is in love with Mr. Rochester, but his dark secrets and overbearing temper are almost too much for Jane to live with. Of all the Bronte books, Jane Eyre is among the finest. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester is interesting and encapturing, but the life of Jane, and her triumphs are far more compelling. Jane Eyre is a classic, that should be read at least once, if not more, by every girl who is searching for a place in this world. The expierences Jane has on her road to becoming a woman are a very interesting reflection of Charlotte Bronte's encounters. Perhaps this is what makes the story so interesting?!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"To be honest, I haven't read many classics, but this is by far my favorite book ever. I was assigned to read it for school and am now completely obsessed. I have three different copies of the story, but my first copy was this cover.What makes this book endurable and able to plow through for the first one-hundred-thirty pages and then keep reading for the next three-hundred-forty-one is the characterization. You love Jane, you hate Mr. Brocklehurst, and I don't know about anybody else, but I loved Mr. Rochester, Helen Burns, and Diana and hated St. John Rivers and Mrs. Reed. All characters stir feelings of either love or hate in you. This truly is the first, and the best, soap opera in the world!I was told by some that they thought the ending lacked - ha ha! The ending couldn't have been better in my opinion. I, personally, didn't see it coming. When Jane was actually contemplating marrying St. John Rivers, I openly yelled \\"No! No! You can't marry him! You love Mr. Rochester whether he's married to a lunatic or not! Don't marry the moron! He's forcing you into it!\\"This book evoked emotions from me I've never gotten before while reading a book. It evoked emotions I never even got watching a movie. Well, maybe it did, only they were excrutiatingly amplified. It was painful to read of Jane leaving Thornfield, even more painful to watch this self-respecting woman beg for food, and yet uplifting to read of her scorning St. John's idea of love and Mrs. Fairfax's label of \\"beggar.\\"All in all, whether you're assigned to read it or not, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is overly well worth its 461 pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Dear Anti-Bronte readersI beg you, don't review the books that you read in English class. I noticed that you tend to get to be prejudiced against the book... What do you mean that it's a child's foolery? What do you mean that the author had nothing better to do? Do you know that Bronte was very ill from the beginning of her life and the literature was the only thing that could keep her going up to her short life? Do you know that her beautiful symbolisms and enormous passion for life, let aside the unique plot and attractive characters, reflect her deep understanding of history and literature? She is a thoroughly educated and intelligent author. Her conversations are deliberately yet unconsciously designed. A choice of a word, a sentense is one by one patient, full of love, and &quot;complete beauty, like a Greek statue of Apollo... (quoted from the book)&quot; I can't praise this book enough, I'm usually very tough on literatures... I even think Kafka's Metamorphosis, with its moving plot and unique characters, is 4.5 out 5 stars... So read more and get some real experience, before you do actual reviewing. Your childish rates and opinions might turn away and repel some readers thus reduce their life to the level of yours."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It was a book my Grandmother told me I should read. I just decided to buy it on impulse really, not knowing what I was getting myself into. I opened the book and was immedeately swept into Jane Eyre's world. My mind played out all of the scenes as I read, only a truly masterful piece of work could create images so strongly right from the start. Charlotte Bronte creates a masterful work of art on the pages of this book.When the book begins, you are taken into Jane's childhood, and given a sense of what it's like to have no love, and no hope of the future. You can actually see the pain on Jane's face. Then at Lowood, you learn with her, and grow with her. Finally, on the night she arrives at Thornfield Hall you are overcome with anticipation for Jane. What is this life going to be like? Then when Edward Rochester appears, you hate him. You can't believe that he talks to her that way. After a while though, things soften, and Miss Bronte introduces a new feeling. Love. The painting seems complete when Jane and Mr. Rochester confess their feelings, and you wonder, what could possibly be better than this? The ending,(which I won't give away)is absolutely breathtaking. I cried for a half an hour when I read it. It was at four in the morning mind you,(the book was so good I could not put it down.)The characters in the novel are whole, they seem like real people. Charlotte Bronte uses her pen to paint a wonderful picture, one can not help but be engulfed in the color. The book has lasted almost 200 years, I see no reason why it could not last forever. If you ever want to read a classic love story that defines the power of women in literature, then Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is it. I'm 16 years old, and if a teenager can be moved to tears while reading, it must be quite a piece of literature. I walked away feeling like I had taken an amazing journey, and found a new friend in Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic of English literature and, although it's easy to see why, I do feel the author missed some opportunities to make this very good book even better.The character of Jane Eyre is a very believable and sympathetic protagonist. No, she's not perfect, as a child or as an adult, and this is all to the the good. She is warm and caring with a tremendous capacity for love to which, understandably, she's afraid to give free rein.Jane's years as a child, both with her relatives and at school, are interesting, but only to a point. They seemed to drag and I was so glad when she finally graduated and the story &quot;really began.&quot;It was during the middle section of the book, during Jane's time in Mr. Rochester's employ, that I felt Bronte missed several good opportunities to &quot;up&quot; both the suspense and the reader's interest. For example, we learn too quickly who Mrs. Rochester is and why she does the things she does. I think Bronte should have built this section up more slowly.After Jane leaves the Rochester estate, her meeting with her &quot;new&quot; family is extremely far-fetched. I know, readers weren't as demanding in Bronte's day as they are now, but still, I thought this was the weakest section of the book and the least interesting by far.Overall, I think &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that clearly showcases the class distinctions of the times. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, when Jane is still a child and in the chapters that take place during her employment in the Rochester household.&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a book that's dated, of course. Times change and reading tastes do, too. If one keeps this in mind, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; should prove to be both a memorable and enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Have you ever wanted someone to notice your personality instead of focusing on your outer appearance? If so, then you can relate to the title character in Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte. Jane, a plain but spirited governess, falls in love with her arrogant employer, Mr. Edward Rochester.Alas, Jane has a bitter rival, the beautiful and accomplished, Baroness Blanche Ingram. As Jane teaches Adele, Mr. Rochester's illegetimate ward, she gains the notice of St. John, a missionary. This classic takes you through her life- from governess to heiress.If you like a challenging read, you will definately enjoy Jane Eyre. This book is highly recommended to young adult readers. This novel is full of advanced vocabulary and even French conversations! But you don't have to be bilingual to love this remarkable story.This classic has an emontional and romantic voice. Jane is very much in love with Mr. Rochester, as you can see by this quote: &quot;[He] was becoming to me, my whole world; almost my hope of heaven. He stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun. I could not, in those days, see God for His creature: of whom I had made an idol.As you can see, Jane Eyre is a complicated novel, but worth the time it takes to read it. This classic, once published under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, will make an excellent addition to any young reader's personal library."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have read this book over and over! It is a wonderful novel on the human condition. It gives hope to any who desires to rise above thier station in life. Bronte does a wonderful job depicting each and every one of her characters. The happy ending though somewhat unrealistic is very heart felt. It makes me want to be a better, smarter, more pure person each time I read it. I strongly recommend this to everyone. It keeps your attention and is always an inspiration."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"My first attempt at a popular classic of that period, and I must admit, that I started to read it with some apprehension. I was worried that I would find it too daunting - how wrong I was! At one point in the book, Jane enters into the Billiards Room in Thornfield Hall to speak to Mr Rochester, I was there too. I smelt the musty, stale pipe smoke, observed the dimly lit room, and heard the russle of the ladies starched skirts.For my first attempt at such a novel, I wasn't let down, in fact I was disappointed when the book ended, wanting to stay in the life of Jane Eyre. It now makes me want to read more of Charlotte Bronte's work!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book was SO wonderful! I was unsure about it at first because just the size of it intimidated me, but it had so many good values in it, and such a wonderful plot that just drew you in from the beginning.

I read on a whim, it was one of the books in my bookshelf that I had not yet read, so I took it down and started to read. Within a few minutes I was so wrapped up in this novel that I did not leave my bedroom for 3 hours. Jane Eyre was a terrific tale of romance and bad luck. I have read it countless of times now, and every single time I have cried. I would definately reccommend this book to anyone! Please, please, please read! You will not regret it, I swear!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I had steered clear from Jane Eyre because I had imagined it was some frivilous Victorian-era romance novel, suitable only to junior high school girls. Well I'm glad I invested the time to prove that was wrong!Jane Eyre is, ultimately, a story of human values and the serious choices in life we all must make from time to time. While not an especially plausible story, it is moving and thought-provoking. I certainly think it would make for required reading for all teenagers; it delivers an excellent message (IMHO) contrary to what seems an obsession of young(er) people of money, good-looks, and &quot;independence at all costs&quot;.As a slight demerit, Jane Eyre isn't the best written novel. Some of the characterizations are weak, and the novel lacks the powerful prose of the works from George Eliott. And the story is a bit wobbly in the beginning. But put all this aside and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane was such a brave woman throughout her misfortunes .She began as a womanly child, professing to ignore her troubles and trying to love life for its worth .She deserved LOVE."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book during my senior year in high school, and I loved it. I read it once a year, and I also have the movie. This is a very captivating book. The descriptions are very vivid and full of life. The love that grew between Jane and Edward survived many hardships, and their romance is one to dream about. Even though the book was written long ago, it still fits in with modern life. It is very easy to lose yourself in this wonderfully written book. This is a book that I think everyone should read. I know I plan to reread it many times during the course of my life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read the book Jane Eyre once when I was in 5th or 6th grade (or possible the summer in-between...?) and I absolutely LOVED it. I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I recently finished reading the book Jane Eyre. It was really good! Even though the vocabulary is somewhat challenging, it was worth it (even if you need a dictionary:)! I enjoyed reading it because it was well-written. Charlotte Bronte has a way of writing descriptions of characters and dialogue with humor. It's also nice to read a book and to be able to say it was worth reading. It doesn't have unpleasant surprises or unnecessary details of violence. It doesn't dwell on violence, either. Though Jane has a rather depressing time in her early life, she doesn't dwell on being unhappy (She kind of reminds me of Cinderella). Read Jane Eyre to find out if her determination to remain virtuous will be stronger than her desire to be with the man she loves and admires!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"JANE EYRE has been my favorite book since my adolesence (I am not so old, though). I have admired the strenght, independence, kindness, gentleness, high class of mind and spirit of Jane Eyre ever since I was 13. Charlotte Bronte's writing stile I love as well--it is a stile of a true writer and artist that she really was. It is enjoyment as well as self-improvement that this book offeres to the reader. Don't miss it! It is so different from nowadays' garbage that we all come across so often!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I picked up a copy of Jane Eyre at a used book store. I have a collection of old books. I buy them for the age and cover art and then read them. I've heard of Jane Eyre, but have never read it. Its an amazing book. I read it in two days and have been thinking about it every day for the last three weeks.Reading other people's reviews is interesting, but if I hear it's a \\"woman power\\" feminist book one more time I'm going to scream! I'm sorry, I think it's way more advanced and classy than the tired old 1960s woman's movement stuff. If Jane Eyre was a modern feminist, she'd be spending her time trying to knock Mr.Rochester out!If you enjoy Jane Eyre, you should also read 'First Violin' and 'Forever Amber'. They aren't well known, but feature similar gut-wrenching romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I confess it. I bought this copy of Jane Eyre for the cover art.I have always loved the story of Jane Eyre since I was a teen. Everything interested me - the gothic atmosphere, the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester, the mystery of what exactly was locked away in Thornfield...Most of all, I loved Jane as a character. She's not blessed with beauty or wealth, but she is determined to be independant and live her own life. She overcomes hardships, abuse, and grief to live on her own terms. Best of all, she finally does find love. Naturally, that road doesn't run smoothly, but the ending is as it should be.Yes, I have loved Jane Eyre from the very first reading, but never managed to hold on to my own copy. Finally, I decided that I needed to add it to my shelves and started to search for a copy to call my own. One thing that did irriate me were all the various covers of this book. Yes, Jane Eyre is a classic, but I really think all the portraits of women in period garb was overkill. What happened to giving the novel a regular, uncomplicated cover? Honestly, this book is too good to have people turn away because of the \\"classic\\" look. Let's face it - people do judge books based on the covers. Honestly, all the covers I saw of other editions of this novel just flat out annoyed me.I saw this cover and loved it instantly. Superficial? Sure. However, this edition is worth the extra money in my mind. I often loan books to friends and they never want to read the \\"classics\\" because the covers look too old fashioned. If it is old, no one really wants to give the book a chance. Jane Eyre stands the test of time. Not everyone can overcome the sight that is on the surface, so this edition works. (And since the popularity of the Twilight series, other classics have been reprinted with pretty coveres with lovely flowers to draw in younger readers - i.e. Pride and Prejudice and Romeo and Juliet - It is only fair that Jane Eyre gets an upgrade too!)The cover is beautiful and captures the eye. I already know and love the story, but I hope this cover will draw in new readers and create new fans of Bronte's work.I realize many may not really agree with my opinion, but I do get pretty bored of all the classics having to have certain covers that commiunicate the fact that they were written in times past. If a novel stands the test of time, why does that cover art have to be stuck in the past? This particular cover isn't overly modern, but not too period in appearance.I saw the cover, thought it was a beautiful fit for Jane Eyre and had to have it. Now I will concentrate on enjoying re-reading this classic over and over again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I wanted to read Jane Eyre since a long time but couldn't make myself do it. Firstly, because I find classics really difficult to read. Secondly, it's too long. The 490 pages copy I have has very small font and everything is kind of crowded with the next chapter starting on the same page the previous one ends.So when I picked up the book to read I was expecting a very difficult read. But the first 100 pages were a breeze.*contains spoilers*Jane Eyre is an orphan who is living with her aunt, who is not a very compassionate woman, nor are her cousins. She suffers a lot in that house. Jane is a spirited girl, she believes she should be treated fairly and even knows there is injustice in the way her Aunt and her cousins treat her. She also believes in speaking her mind.The Aunt gets tired of her and sends her to an orphanage school at the age of 10 where she spends the next 8 years of her life.' I loved the life she described in the school. This section I found very similar to Anne of green gables. Not that there was anything similar in their circumstances but I found their natures quite similar.\\"A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.\\"Jane works for 2 years as a teacher in the same school before she gets bored with the monotony and decides to explore something else. She applies for the post of a governess and gets a letter from Mrs. Fairfax. When Jane reaches there she finds out that Adele, her pupil is Mr. Rochester's ward and Mrs. Fairfax is the housekeeper.Mr. Rochester is the hero of course. As romance builds up, Rochester proposes to her and on the day of their marriage she finds out that he is already married, albeit to a lunatic. She leaves the house the same night without informing anyone and loses touch with him. She builds a life for herself as a village school teacher and in the end returns to find Rochester blind and his wife dead.What I really liked about the book was that the author seemed to talk to the readers directly. She addresses the readers pulling them into the story very quickly.I found the book a little too descriptive and the language, although very beautiful, very tedious a times.At the very end, when Jane learns of Rochester's ill fate from the manager of the Inn, she decides to go and meet him. I was so excited at this point, I could hardly stay still. I wanted to find out what happened instantly. But again, there were so many descriptions of the path and of the house, I was really irritated.I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.I mean hello? At this point I wasn't really interested in reading about whether there were flowers in the path or not. I was way too impatient and I admit I skipped a lot from that chapter.*****end spoiler******And Rochester? I think he spoke too much. At one point I wanted to say, \`Oh stop talking already'. I thought he was selfish and manipulative. I realized that I will love the book more when I read it for the second time. As I already know the story I won't skip anything and I am sure I will appreciate the language even more.Although I loved the book and although it's supposed to be one of the greatest love stories, Pride and Prejudice is still on top of my list. And Darcy is still the yummiest of all the literary heroes."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person!

It is no wonder this tale has been dubbed a classic and remains in popular demand today. It is a wonder to be taken back to a time where people actually stood for their morals and what was right, although this lends to the most frustrating element of the story. The plot between Jane and Mr. Rochester, at its core, is one that subsequent love stories of our time try to emulate (dare I say even the Twilight series borrow from Jane Eyre's sorrow, struggle, and passion). As an avid book reader, this one is placed at the top of my list and in my heart!A true must read for all women!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is currently my favorite novel. I suggest it to anyone and everyone. Jane Eyre was always so interesting and absolutely never boring. Each part of the novel was so enjoyable to read because I got to experience Jane's experiences and adventures with her simultaneously. The whole novel was so youthful and vivacious. I always was yearning for more. And the characters in the novel were so complex, yet identical to the complexity that each individual possesses. This novel is definitely a classic that is entertaining and well-written. Bronte exhibits a sense of expertise with her writing. I adored her writing stylistically. All of her words flowed so fluidly, which I think was conducive to my strong liking for this novel. In the end, I think that anyone would really find this book as an incredible read. I STRONGLY suggest that this novel is read immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The story is the same, but Dame Darcy's gothic illustrations provide a unique perspective on the characters and scenes, making another read through the timeless Bronte novel a must. If you're a Bronte fan, a gothic fan, or simply a fan of the classics, this book won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It seems to me Bronte's schooling of her own mind rather than the schooling depicted in the book (which are the same thing) depend more or less likely on your inclination to the subject of respect.The willingness to let go all sanity and resume mental thought at a moment's whim is the virtue displayed here.Like most books of this type, not much thought is given to plot or to the romance of being in a plot as much as to the figures at play here, right and wrong, moral and honest, truth and lie-sayer. I would probably say this is the best way for a young girl to grow up, having written a work like this. This is more a study in her life than in the life of a person blessed with any gifts. Growing up modest has taught her something: that she made modesty.The gift of the unique insight of creation in each and every line is apparent and is a unique challenge to the reader to contemplate the meaning of suffering she has placed into every line."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre told by any other author would be a tale told to elicit tears, or sometimes a smile. As it is the book is so sincere and frank it seems to weep in your hands, and requires no acknowledgment from you. Indeed, Jane Eyre is very likely above such avowal even were you to tender it. To me this otherwise magnificent piece served as a reminder of my dispassion, indolence, insincerity, and how hot it will be when I'm eternally burning in hell."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'm reading this novel for my AP English class, and it's okay so far (I'm about 50 pages short of finishing the book). Bronte definitely has a way with words, and Jane's story, though in some parts a bit unrealistic, certainly makes for a good read. However, the dialogue is a little confusing sometimes because the author uses the wrong pronouns (like: &quot;Would she like a morsel of bread?&quot; when it ought to be &quot;Would YOU like a morsel of bread?&quot;)This happens pretty often near the end, and it's terribly annoying. These flaws not withstanding, however, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; will appeal to anyone who enjoys the romance and soap-opera plots of Victorian literature paired with some gothic characteristics (crazy Bertha screaming and doing mischief in her locked cell)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As many people may know, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is the story of an orphaned girl who has an evil aunt that locks her away in an eerie red room where her uncle died in. Being the protagonist of the novel, Jane breaks away from her aunt's oppression and stands up for herself. As Jane lives life away from her aunt, she realizes that the outside world is just as strenuous. Against many odds, Jane pushes forward with her life. She finds a job as a governess and falls in love with her employer and he loves her back, but of course with Jane's luck, more obstacles are hurdled at her.Being set during the Victorian period, social status already plays a big obstacle in Jane's life. When obstacles, though some highly unlikely, beyond social class prevent her from marrying the love her life, Jane must establish her own code of ethics. What is wrong and what is right? What can she do and what can she not do?The novel may seem to focus much on the aspect of Jane's love life, but there's much more to it than that. Throughout Jane's love story, there's always eerie things going on, for example the shrieking yell coming from a room no one is allowed in and that's just the beginning. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a book that has many different aspects and a hint of gothic fiction. There's love, mystery, strength, courage, and faith. It's the journey of a lost female on the road of identifying herself. This is a classic that should not be passed up especially if you're a person who believes that love prevails against all odds. This classic is a refreshing book to read; it's not every day that you find such a strong female character in literature.Even though the only complain I have to offer is the lengthiness and the endless dialogue, this novel is worth it all. Read along with Jane's story as she discovers what she has to offer the world and herself. The story will have you at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. The main question, however, will Jane get her happy ending?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is really good. It is one of my favorites.

It's a different experience reading as an adult! I wish I could say I loved it but I just can't. Charlotte Bronte used so many words and descriptors when much less would have done just fine. (Have a dictionary handy. Many of the words used in Jane Eyre are archaic and need definition. Otherwise much of what Bronte is trying to convey is lost. This is not a criticism - just part of reading Jane Eyre.)I have 2 main difficulties with Jane Eyre. First, it was difficult for me to see either Mr. Rochester or St. John Rivers as desirable. Both were manipulative control freaks. Secondly, there are some \\"coincidences\\" (specifically with regard to the Rivers family) that seem so entirely unlikely that it's distracting. (As a side note, I question whether Jane's time with the Rivers was necessary to advance the story. That section of the book seemed especially plodding.)Last but not least, Jane Eyre is deeply religious. This is not a bad thing, but much of the book is spent sermonizing. This, too, adds to its length.I came away from Jane Eyre disappointed but also appreciative of Jane's amazing (if flawed) journey."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'm going to rate the quality of the Kindle Edition since this seems to be the only place to do so. I won't go into the story since there's a perfectly good sysnopsis on the description page and several well written reivews on the work itself. The kindle edition was good to say the least. I did find a few spelling errors that were annoying, but none more so than the heroine, Jane, repeatedly being referred to as 'Janet' throughout the entire novel; I find this to be unacceptable. I do not know if this occurs in the print-versions as this was my first encounter with the story. Had there been less (or no) spelling errors as well as the correct name reference to the main character, I would have given it 5 stars on content alone---although it still creeps me out that 19 year olds and 40 year olds so frequently ended up marrying in that day and age, but I just had to put it out of my mind when reading. Otherwise it was a good read and I look forward to reading more works by the Bronte sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyere is my absolute favorite book and I was thrilled when I found the book marked as collector's edition and leather bound.

So glad I made this purchase!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The main theme of Jane Eyre is that happiness and contentment can be found during our lives on earth. This is shown in the fact that Jane led a very discontented and sad childhood, but she found happiness in her relationship with Mr. Rochester. This theme also came out very strongly through Jane's cousin John. He was so dedicated to serving God and being a missionary that he asked Jane to marry him because he thought she was a hard worker. He didn't love her, but he believed that serving God came before his own happiness. The book makes it seem as though this is wrong, because in the end John goes to India by himself and does not enjoy the rest of his life. It is presented as though Jane did the fulfilling and satisfying thing by marrying Mr. Rochester, and John did the good but unhappy thing by becoming a missionary in India. Obviously, it is not good to marry someone that you don't love, but Charlotte Bronte seems to take this to the extreme by saying that unless you get married to the person you love, you will not lead a satisfied life. In truth, if you lead a life dedicated to serving and praising God, you will have a satisfied life. It is not just people and circumstances that can make us happy, but a close relationship with God. Nevertheless, I thought that Jane Eyre was a very good book. There was always a little hint of mystery to keep the reader interested, and the book presented some interesting ideas to think about. Jane Eyre did a good job of presenting Charlotte Bronte's ideas, and it is a very well-written, descriptive book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer. She looks to the future and begins to overcome the unhappiness that has plagued her all her life, but Rochester's shady past comes back and brings everything down again.But unlike in the author's sister Emily's Wuthering Heights, this sadness neither dominates nor concludes the book when all is resolved in a happy, if somewhat bittersweet, ending.The real brilliance of Jane Eyre lies in the characters - we can all see ourselves, or our aspirations, reflected in Jane, who overcomes her circumstances to find happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the rarest kind of novel - one that conveys boundless emotion without stumbling too far into darkness and misery.Plain and poor, Jane works as a governess in the house of Mr Rochester, a brooding and temperamental man with a dark secret, and eventually falls in love with her wealthy employer.

The book starts off with Jane, a lonely ten year old abandoned by her aunt in a prison-like boarding school. It continues as Jane finds an occupation as a governess fro a little French girl. But, beware as Jane is falling madly in love with Mr. Rochester (her master as she calls him-is it just me or is I Dream of Jeanie popoing into my head), who has a secret terrible enough to destroy Jane and himself too. I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up). Even though nine year olds can read this book, to fully understand the passion and adult situations you must be a little more mature. To really fully understand Jane Eyre you must read past the words and into the heart of little troubled Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's true this book, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, is extremely boring for the first fifty to seventy pages, but the plot line needs that much set up because it is so difficult. Once one has made it past those pages, hold on for the ride of a lifetime because it is a complicated and complete novel. Charlotte Bront&egrave; is an extremely effective writer. Her explicit detail is apparent after the first page. She carries this aspect of writing throughout the novel in describing both her surroundings and the people she meets. Because of her writing style, one learns more about the characters in this novel than in most modern novels, this enhances the enjoyment and knowledge gained from this book. The detail used in this novel helps make it easier to relate to the main character Jane Eyre. Since this book is written in the first person, it is very important that one is able to connect with the main character who is also the narrator.This novel's plot is so complex that one almost never wants to put it down after those first fifty pages. The setup, though boring, is completely necessary to the rest of the novel and the rest of the plot. The most important parts of the plot are often right after a slow spot in the book. I believe this is just to emphasis these points. Included in a way such as that is the portion near the beginning where Jane stands up to her aunt who she is living with. This part is the beginning of Jane's strong headed and straightforward attitude, which was very uncharacteristic of a woman at the time this novel was written.Also, the time at Lowood Academy when Jane's friend Helen dies of consumption is one of the points in which the novel starts to slow down and an important item is introduced. Jane goes through many changes in atmosphere throughout the novel, some by choice, some not. This gives us more opportunity to relate to her because throughout our lives we all will have to deal with changes in location, surroundings, and relationships. The ways in which Jane reacts to her changes will in one way or another affect us for the rest of our lives. The plot has many different places where it is so entangled both by Jane's feelings and the actions of the other characters. This is to represent the times in our lives where things seem complicated.It is easy to relate to the main character, Jane Eyre, which makes it a good novel to represent our life and take advice from. This is a classic because it has survived the trials and tribulations of time and is still considered an excellent book to take advice from and to learn about what has happened in the live of people of the past. Each of us can step into Jane's shoes at one point or another and see things as she sees them. It makes one feel connected to the novel and understand what is going on much better than a novel which does not have the first person interpretation and emotions in it. Because the narrator is a young girl growing up it is harder for males, such as me, to relate to portions of the novel, though it is just as easy to relate to other portions. Also, because of the difference in time periods, it is harder to relate to exact problems, though the problems can be generalized so as to be more relevant.Overall, this novel is a great work in which many people can receive hours of enjoyment and thought. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is thought to be \\"mature\\" enough to read it with full comprehension because it is a novel that has bearing on many issues both of the mind and of the world."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The day after I watched the 1983 BBC Version of Jane Eyre on video, I went to the library and borrowed the book.

Jane Eyre is the perfect example of love emitting from internal thoughts and experiences rather than exterior imagery. One would think the story to be a simple one, but it is so much more than the ordinary love story! Yes, Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester, the wealthy employer, do fall in love. However, it is the dramatic turn in the story that touches the reader most. What does happen in the end to these oh-so-real characters? At times, it seems very unpredictable. The story is worth the time of reading the book. It is unlike any other!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Few people probably need an introduction to this novel, given its popular appeal and long circulation. But some words are needed to explain its importance.At a simple level, the novel is the archetypal 'soap opera'; indeed, one can see virtually every plot found in 'Days of Our Lives' or something similar flowing through this work. But Charlotte Bronte's genius makes this wonderful work so much better than a mere one dimensional soap opera.The protagonist displays a keen intellect, a penetrating psychological understanding of those around her, and amazing powers of description. Whether it is the depressing institution of Lowood, or the passing away of Jane Eyre's childhood friend before her eyes, the scenery, the atmosphere, the emotional power, and the raw beauty of the language shine through.Bronte also makes use of the 'Gothic' element in her novel, particularly in the mysterious, mad wife of Edward Rochester, 'Bertha Mason', a sinister figure who is mad and tries to kill Rochester at every opportunity. The atmosphere in the novel is dark, spooky, and has a strong hint of the supernatural; Eyre's descriptions of the Moon often come into this.The characters themselves (apart from the caricature of Bertha Mason) are also psychologically and morally complex. Eyre pursues her career as a governess and eventually Rochester himself often using dubious means, and Rochester himself is far from a heroic figure. Who is good, or evil? Even the end offers no resolution of this (though Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea suggests Rochester is the nasty one).Although Gothic romances are not my favorite literary genre, this book is worth recommending simply for the sheer genius of the author.Charlotte Bronte, one of the finest novelists in the 19th century realist tradition,"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre, I (and I think many others) was taken in by the odd combination of romance and ominous overtones that makes Jane Eyre such a unique book. Of course, the Victorian-era writing and social commentary also made an impression.But upon reflection, underneath all of this is a story of people with difficult lives learning to find and accept each other and hopefully coming to peace and happiness despite long odds. Maybe my second reading just comes from a twenty-first century mind reading things into a nineteenth century book that just aren't there. But to me, the book does have the feel of a modern story of hardship as well as a Victorian story of people trying to overcome their backgrounds to find love.Jane Eyre tells the life story of an orphaned girl sent away to a harsh boarding school by a cruel aunt. Despite the harsh nature of the school, Jane thrived at the school since she is finally out from her aunt's crushing dislike for her. She graduated and took a job as a governess for a girl in the care of a mysterious man who spent much of his time traveling abroad, Mr. Rochester.At first, the two do not like each other. This is compounded by the fact that Jane thinks she is plain looking and not worthy of his company. But the two develop a peculiar friendship, and there are many signs that their feelings are deeper. But Mr. Rochester is busy courting other ladies at the time. Mr. Rochester also seems to have a secret that he will not divulge to Jane but may have serious consequences for her.Jane's job as a governess and the friendship that develops make it seem that the book will quickly become a Jane Austen book (which of course, would not have been a bad thing) in which the man and woman from different classes find love with one another, but from the point of the friendship blooming, Jane Eyre takes a few remarkable twists and turns that I had not expected and that make for real page-turning.But it is as much the quiet desperation of both Jane and Mr. Rochester and their struggle to find each other despite this that makes Jane Eyre a book truly worth reading and treasuring."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This novel was quite a bit better than I expected.

Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it.

I liked the Biblical references that are littered throughout the story but the book gives very little insight as to whether there is any real religion observed. From this angle, the book seems to go at a pious anti-piety, as odd as that may sound. The book also seems to show some beginnings of feminism, which I am not a fan of, since it is anti-Biblical.

She starts out in the home of her aunt and three cousins all of whom despise her. She was left there as a young girl with her caring uncle when both of her parents died. Her uncle died shortly later and Jane was left in less than desirable conditions. After a blood-curdling incident her frustrated aunt sends her off to boarding school where, for the most part, she is treated worse than she was in her aunt's home. From there she becomes a governess and takes care of a little girl for a man whom she later falls in love with. This is where the story really gets interesting as several twists and turns take the couple towards an unexpected ending.Charlotte Bronte, the author, has a writing style typical of the romance period. Her vivid descriptions, while being wonderfully picturesque, can at times be lengthy. There are so many images of gardens and mountains and sunsets that the plot often gets lost somewhere along the way. The story can also become frustrating at times. I often longed to yell at the characters and set them in the right direction as they slowly picked their way through the tangled mess they were enveloped in.Bronte's heart was in the right place with this one. The story is one of a great love and an extraordinary woman. Jane Eyre is a one in a million kind of girl whose life story is definitely one worth telling. However, it is one that could have been told much more simply. There are parts of the novel that don't seem to have any real purpose other than to fill pages. They don't give away anything as to how she is going to end up. It merely confuses and frustrates the reader into utter boredom.

Some may compare that kind of behavior with today's much more open and free male/fremale relations and not understand the impediments to verbal and physical demonstration of your love back in those days. However, I think that added so deliciously to the sexual tension.Mostly, I find this to be about a particular female who has an incredibly admirable personality. Independent, clever, modest yet feisty, she sets a great example for true feminism to come. We need to pay attention to the hardships she faced, and the ways in which she handled them. It sets an example for us to be better people and to face our own modern day challenges with ethics and fortitude.The characters were clearly delineated and we would have no trouble identifying them if they were to come to life.

The older I get, the more I like it. A real classic. Everyone should read, or 're-read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The first time I was introduced to this book was in college. Back then, I had the attention span of a gnat, so rather than give Jane Eyre a try, I opted for Cliffs Notes. (Yeah, I know ... sacrilege)Anyway, fast forward to now. I finally read it, and my God, what a beautiful piece of literature! The first part outlining young Jane's struggles had me flipping the pages till one in the morning. Then when she got to Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, the page turning didn't stop till at least 3 A.M. I savored every paragraph, every word. It was like crack to me. lolI was so enthralled with this story that I wrote a post on it when I hadn't even finished reading the book! I'd reached a section that moved me so much I had to write about it because of its beauty. It showed the core of just who Jane was as a heroine. Here's a snippet:WARNING .... SPOILERS.........Last night, I read something that really moved me, so much that I must've re-read it three times. It was an introspective passage that poignantly demonstrated the beauty and complexity of Jane's mind. Oh, how I wish my heroines were this self-aware and confident!In discussing her opinion of Blanche Ingram (the gold-digging skank who Mr. Rochester is using to make Jane jealous), our heroine goes into great detail about why she cannot bring herself to be jealous of Miss Ingram. Jane isn't a character in denial. She's a strong, logical, thoughtful and methodical woman, one who knows her own mind. After reading this passage, I realized that although I was over halfway through the novel, I never really knew Jane until that moment.Anyway, while this may be a long excerpt, it's well-worth the read:---------------------------\\"I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me-because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction-because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady-because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her-because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\\"There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;-the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her.\\"Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character-watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly. Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity-this guardedness of his-this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one's defects-this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her, that my ever- torturing pain arose.\\"---------------------------.....Jane's pain came not from any imagined self-deficiency ... because as far as she was concerned, the pretty Miss Ingram was an empty satin dress---not worthy of jealousy or anything else. Least of all Mr. Rochester. Hence Jane's pain. The mere fact that he would go for a vapid boob like Miss Ingram was the root of Jane's torment.Hard to be jealous of someone you feel is intellectually and spiritually beneath both you and the man you love. This is why I love Jane as a heroine! While not a raving beauty, she has a quiet and unshakable confidence that's very appealing. No wonder Mr. Rochester fell for her.Writers, if you want to see how to create a compelling heroine, look no further. The lesson is in this book!Suffice it to say, Jane Eyre is my all time favorite heroine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have loved this book every since I first read it back in high school.

Plus the fact that along with this ability, these old classics are available for free (at least for the most part).(Spoiler alert)I would say that with a few of the old english titles now under my belt, the authors of the time leave a lot to incredibility in order to advance their plots. In the case of Jane Eyre, this came up with a majorly coincidental meeting of a man and a letter in the town of Maderia (or some such spelling). Also, of a rather psychic lament being heard by the story's protagonist. Also of a chance meeting of the protagonist, on the verge of dying of starvation and privations; finding herself on the doorstep of some long lost relatives.Guess they had a lot of faith back then that God's will, will out.

If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Many people consider Jane Eyre to be Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece (with a minority preferring Villette). I have to agree- Jane Eyre is my number one of her novels, by far.We all know the story by this point. A governess falls in love with her employer to find out he has a dark secret...dun dun dun! It's very much a Romantic as well as romantic novel. It's very different from anything Jane Austen ever wrote, that's for sure! (Charlotte was not a fan of dear Jane, by the way).The first time I read this book, as a freshman in high school, I didn't get into it until after Jane got to Thornfield. I found the parts with Jane as a child draggy. Now I get sucked into the story right from the beginning. Young Jane is a fiery, passionate creature who's not afraid to speak her mind. Lowood makes her take on a more controlled, reserved front but she never loses her inner passions. I find Jane so strong and still a realistic character- I just love her.It's not a totally perfect book but it's close. It's only little nitpicks that bug me- like all the coincidences. Rochester isn't exactly my favorite character but I totally get the connection and the love between them and on a literary level I do like him. On a personal level, I don't- but it works in a book. I appreciate how he has to suffer for his sins and really has to earn his happy ending."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A good, solid transcription to Kindle.

Anyone who has ever read it should be able to clearly notice it's underlying message about redemption and second chances. I personally love that Jane is not some beautiful, perfect heroine, but is flawed and considered &#34;plain&#34; by her peers. Her personality and attitude are what entices Mr. Rochester to fall in love with her, not what she looks like. Their love overcomes so many obstacles, it's ridiculous.

Family, love, relationship, friendship, on one hand; and on the other, backstabbing, scheming, rivalry, heartbreaks etc. All such things apparently do not lose their meaning and value over time, unlike technology, social establishments, cultural distinctions and class differentiation, to name but a few. The author masterly describes human nature in its various negative and positive aspects, thus subtly inferring the moral of the story, filled with action, tregady, drama, struggle, romance, affection and ultimate achievement. The main characters, who eventually fall in love through loads of trouble, are heroic in their development, however, realistic, emerging and aspiring, unselfish and memorable; whereas being quite natural modest and sincere since the very beginning.Overall, there is a lot of wisdom and sense in this lovely book. Something for anyone who is truly interested in personal improvement, good manners, real feelings and emotional intelligence, and last but not least, immaculate language and style."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"From the very beginning I couldn't put this book down. It was a beautifully written story of love, strength and courage. The characters were so real I could feel their every emotion as if I personally knew them.

I am just sad it took me so long to read it. Very well written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this years ago and have seen several movie versions. I like watching the movies but reading it is the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a classical literary work that encompasses a variety of genres from mystery to romance. The novel is told from the perspective of Jane Eyre, a young woman orphaned as a child, who struggles to find her place in the world. Traveling among many occupations, Jane finds herself as a governess and begins to develop feelings for her employer, the rude mannered Mr. Rochester. However, Jane discovers that his country estate holds frightening secrets among a mysterious past.This Gothic romance encompasses many themes that are relevant to society today which not only makes the novel relatable, but also intriguing. The reader becomes wrapped in Bronte's descriptions as the story unfolds and takes unexpected turns and twists. From the beginning, Jane struggles to find those who love and accept her as a human being. Throughout her life Jane is oppressed by others who tell her that she is not good enough and is constantly put down even when she tries to change her situation. She is told that she is too ugly, too poor, and ultimately too powerless to overcome obstacles, but she tries regardless. In every situation presented, Bront touches on relationships with people. As human beings ourselves, we are able to relate to these struggles and the ways which we attempt to survive difficult moments within life.Jane Eyre represents these themes and continues to affect readers even today. This novel presents the emotions and desires of everyday people while also including an exciting, thought provoking plot. Jane Eyre is one of those novels that will travel with you over time. Personally, rereading the book at different points in my life has allowed me to read with a different perspective which I may not have considered before.I would also recommend reading Wide Sargasso Sea if you enjoyed Jane Eyre. This other novel written by Jean Rhys tells the story of Bertha and defends some of the judgments that could be made of Bertha in Jane Eyre. The novel also questions whether Bertha's mental state was altered before even arriving at Rochester's estate. It is a very interesting companion book to read after having read Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"What can you say about this book that hasn't already been said.

As if to add on to this little personal hell, my teacher made us mark and annotate every single page in this book and I knew that this was going to make me hate this book even more. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I love it! Without a doubt it was my favorite book of the year and I would even consider it the best book of my high school career. As with most novels, it took a bit of time to get into, especially with this book as it is so long. I wouldn't necessarily describe this novel as a \\"quick read\\" but that only adds to the magnificent effect of the novel.

I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it. Its language is beautiful - refined, fragrant, and surprisingly fresh. The dialogs and descriptions are memorable and visual. Above all, the novel introduces us to two main characters, a young orphan- pale, thin, \\"almost un-earthy\\" but determined, strong-willed, kind and reasonable Jane and Mr. Edward Rochester - sardonic, powerful, passionate, and tormented master of Thornfield. The story of their impossible love has attracted millions of readers not only in the English speaking countries but all over the world. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been adapted to TV and big screen 18 times. The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Samantha Morton, Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, have played the couple that had to overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society, laws, religion, by the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The illustrations are appealing and really portray the emotion of the story.My mom sent me this book as a present, and I immediately loved it; but that is perhaps because I have slightly gothic/victorian tastes and because the drawings remind me of myself.

And it's true. I started reading it once when I was younger, but I wasn't quite ready for it yet and I couldn't get past the first chapter. When I picked it up again a couple of years later, I fell for it. I remember hating Mrs. Reed and her children - especially John - with such a passion, I wished I could reach through the book and wring their necks until they gained some sense. Mr. Brocklehurst, too. And being terrified when she was stuck in the red room. I've reread it at least five times since then, and it always seems that I come across a scene or a character that I've forgotten about in the year or two since I read it last. In college, I wrote a paper on it and came across interpretations that I'd never even began to consider, prompting careful rereading of most of the chapters once again. I think it was the first real \\"literary\\" book I read as a kid, and possibly the first book that made me feel so strongly for the characters (whether it was hate or love) - that just may be why nothing has been able to replace it as my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"one of my favorite books from the long list of the ol' required high school reading. I fell in love with Jane immediately, though it took a while for me to appreciate the novel on a whole. I came back to the novel again in more recent years, and I have enjoyed it more and more with each read. Having heard it as a book on tape while on bedrest brought the story to life even more and made the mysterious Bertha and the dark and moody Mr. Rochester that much more intense. This is so much more than a romantic tale between an unfortunate governess and her brooding employer; it is truly the story of a young woman coming into her own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"How can I put into words how much I love this book? I read it for the first time when I was 12, and at 26, it still has the power to stir me as it once did. It has everything one could possibly want in a book. Romance, lust, horrid relatives, a brooding hero, near-death experiences, and to top it off, a mad woman in the attic. I have read literally hundreds and hundreds of books, some more than once, and still Jane Eyre remains my favorite. It is , in my opinion, a must-read in everyone's lifetime. The best of the Bronte sisters work, let alone Charlotte's, you cannot possibly be disappionted at reading this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre - Illustrated novel by Charlotte BronteThis ebook is a golden treasure to add to your library.

Written in the first person, the excellent writing of the author Charlotte Bronte is both beautiful to read and gripping in its story telling power.What I found of particular interest was the moral character of Ms Eyre. There is a sense of absolute honesty about her, an honesty both to herself and in her sense towards other people that makes her truly stand out. For instance, Jane went through extreme hardships to do what she thought was morally a right thing to do, including relinquishing her lover. And then, when she has barely come out of extreme poverty, she finds out that her rich Uncle has left her a lot of money. She shows her character here by willingly sharing her inheritance with her newly discovered cousins.And the way that she loves Rochester is simply too beautiful for me to describe here in words. Read the book, and let Charlotte Bronte describe it to you in her eloquent and heart rendering prose."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This was an adorable little book that was very affordable.

The book mark was also a nice touch."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In our current culture filled with technical language, slang, and gross misuse of the English language, Jane Eyre is a refreshing and brilliant view into 19th century England and pure unadultered English. It is a scintillating story told from a feminist perspective at the time, yet it is completely applicable to the 21st century. It should be required reading for all women, young and old, urban and rural, single and married. A delightful read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised.

I still have that copy, in good condition. The novel was wordy and yet not boring. The book to me was not only a classic but beyond what words can describe. I'm in 11 grade and I've read it about five times. I still cry whenever I read it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This classic (yes I coin the phrase out of my own true feelings about the book - not because it is old) sincerely touched me and found me out to be a romance reader after avoiding such themes as much as possible. The book, extremely unique in style, speaks across all time and place - THAT is why it is a classic. One of my favorite tools that Bronte uses is the way she adresses the reader as 'reader.' It gives the uniquivocal sense that you are sitting in the room with her as she tells this tale to you of a little orphan girl (or could be boy) who seeks out her destiny in fortune, misfortune and fate. The only fault that she perhaps could have avoided is in editing. There are a few strange grammatical quirks and there are many lines that could have been shortened or cut out entirely. However, I highly recommend it to any reader of any age with an open mind to start and finish a true CLASSIC."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Erye, by Charlotte Bronte, is an excelente book. The characters are very well developed. Jane, for example, expounded upon the world her naivity and youthfullness. Her character was that of a dew-kissed lilly-- clean, pure, and forthright. Mr. Rochester was very similar to a bull dog. He had a surreptious character that leaves you wondering about his motives. His growling countenance intimidates and frightens the reader. This book contains numerous metaphors for life-- hardly ostentatious, so the reader must infer to discover these valuable lessons to life. A classical must read, Jane Eyre is not a dustcollector for any bookshelf. You will read it multiple times, appreciating it more as you get older._________________________________________________________________*Note: There is a slight part which may put the reader to sleep. Still, it is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is my next favorite Austen after &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot;. Beautifully written.

Though Jane and Mr. Rochester differ in age...They fall in love and are to be married. But fate intervenes.This has got to be the best book in the world. Jane is a wonderful woman with strong character and a inquiring mind. She reminds me slightly of myself.Many people seem to shun this book because it is so old and speaks in a slightly different English than we are used to. It is not a hard read at all. Once you get into the book, everything makes sense. Once again, this is the best book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As a high school teacher, I have heard many students complaining about Jane Eyre.

It is marked by an intelligent pessimism as opposed to a silly optimism which is also a marked point in most of Thomas Hardy's work. You go through the psychological struggles of Jane Eyre, an orphan first with the oppressive regime at the Lowood School and later with her employer Mr. Rochester and her cousin St.John Rivers. It is strong in the depiction of the environment in which the novel takes place and it also succeeds in making an argument about colonialism and psychology. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I put off reading this book for years - it was sitting on the dusty shelf in my schoolroom, by the Austens, Dickens and Shakespeare and looked like the driest book in the world. However, like those other books, Jane Eyre has stood the test of time, and there's a good reason for that. So 10 years after I left school I finally went ahead and read it, and was delighted to find that it is one of the best written and romantic stories you will ever read. Jane is orphaned at an early age, has a sad and lonely childhood, finds a job and a chance at romance, only to have it all dashed away and she is apparently left destitute....but it's not over yet. Treat yourself to this book, curl up and enjoy the wonderful descriptive prose and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is probably one of my top ten fave books of all time. The love story in it was (in my opinion) very intense a lot of the time (the part where she comes back just kills me every time). I can understand how you would not like this book if you don't like cheesy love stories (and, trust me, the ending is VERY cheesy) but it's just a wonderful book in all. The parts where Jane is not with Rochester can be tedious sometimes but, fortunately, since I've read it, I can skip those parts and just read the good ones. When Jane leaves Rochester, Bronte describes it in such a way that it makes the reader feel as if they were leaveng their one true love. The only thing that gets me is the age difference between Rochester and Jane but I don't stress over it. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good romantic pick-me-up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the few books I can say I absolutely adore.Charlotte Bronte is the one author I have found that can REALLY put passion into a novel.She writes like she has lived it even though she led a secluded life.Jane Eyre is so full of passion &amp; you have to love it. The way the characters speak to one another is unbelievable due to this passion. The romance is beautiful because of the way Jane &amp; Rochester speak to one another &amp; how full of emotions &amp; love for each other , not because of sex, like modern day romance novels . Bronte was a genius &amp; this is one of those books that I can call a favorite &amp; one I'll read over &amp; over again. it is one of the most beautiful &amp; passionate &amp; romantic novels ever written that has class &amp; you're bound to love it.You just gotta read it !!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Let's get one thing straight..I LOATHE romance novels. My Grandmother reads hundreds of those Fabio-plastered, heaving cleavage covered paperbacks...but NOT ME. Don't get me wrong, I loved Gone with the Wind...but as I explored a few more of the more classic romances ie..Emma, Wuthering Heights, or Sense and Sensibility..I found the movies much more appealing. Then along comes Jane Eyre. She is not buxom and airheaded and dashingly beautiful. She is plain, modest, and smart...That's right! a more modern woman!! Jane does not faint at the sight of a handsome man, nor does she swoon over expensive clothes....Let me tell you a little more about Jane Eyre..... As a child, Jane was left an orphan with her brutal aunt and cousins. Treated unfairly and taunted buy the other children she soon developed a quick-witted tongue. After receiving an honest verbal lashing from Jane, her aunt packed her few belongings and pretty much &quot;shipped&quot; the young girl off to a dreadful and gloomy school called &quot;Lowood&quot;. At Lowood, Jane quickly learned to bite her tongue through strict discipline from the Headmaster.(Lowood often reminds me of the discplinary school David Copperfield received some beatings in.) Here at school Jane is educated and cared for but never loved. She stays on at Lowood to become a teacher herself, but soon finds a position in a far away town to be a private counsel and teacher to a young girl Adele. Adele is the young French, beautiful and very spoiled ward to a great man known as Mr. Rochester. Jane soon learns that Mr. Rochester is very mysterious and aloof ..he often leaves her and Adele alone for months at a time on business travel. When he is at home Jane finds herself drawn to him, his strange conversation style and his knowledge of good books. He is by no means a HANDSOME man but attracts a great deal of attention because of his financial means. I Loved this book for many reasons. I loved the contrast between Jane and Adele...Adele is spoiled, loved and beautiful....Jane the opposite. And the MYSTERIES! Where does Mr. Rochester go? WHO is Adele? Why are there screams late in the darkness of the manor? Who could it be? And the best mystery of all? What will become of Mr. Rochester and Jane? Romance? Jane never OUTWARDLY desires to be a distinguished lady like the beautiful women Mr. Rochester frequently entertaines. But as a reader you feel she deserves such a posion. You will find yourself page tuning faster and faster as you secretly wish for modest Jane Eyre to succeed and and achieve status and the love she deserves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I recently saw the Broadway musical of Jane Eyre and was inspired to read the book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Jane seems so real as a character that I wish I could meet her. What an amazing heroine! The reader roots for her success all through the book. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is one of the best in all of literature. In high school the classics I had to read were usually so dull (including Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte) that I tend to stear clear of classics now, even though I am a voracious reader, but Jane Eyre is so fast paced that it hardly seems like a classic. I couldn't put it down! Don't read this story because its touted as being about female empowermant and don't avoid it for the same reason. Wether you are male or female, read this book, because it is a great story with great characters you will remember for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Contrary to the MGM film of the 40's, this book does not begin with, \\"My name is Jane Eyre...\\" Instead, we get an opening chapter about a little girl who is cruelly treated by an abominable family, and her attempts to stay afloat. The Jane Eyre of the novel is a spirited young woman, who yearns to be able to experience life despite the limitations society has placed upon women. This book is a wonderful read. Bronte's 19th century England is not the neo-classical world of manners and balls that permeate Jane Austin's universe; rather, the world of Jane Eyre one of ragged romanticism that plays out against the harsh elements, and the world seems as primitive indoors as it does outside. Bronte writes in a very lucid, revelatory style, and the first person narrative does a lot to help draw you into this story. Even if you know the secret in the attic, there is so much more about this novel that you may not know about.The biggest surprise about this novel once I read it was that Jane's story does not end with the revelation of Rochester's dark gothic secret (even though this was written several years after Austen's Northanger Abbey, it's fun to read the two books in conjunction). I am surprised that most film and stage versions of this novel rarely include the important last third of the book. But I'll let you discover the developments to Jane's character on your own. The ending is a tear-jerker (but in a great way). This is definitely the book to read on the front porch of a summer cottage, or in front of a fire on a winter night. Mystery, romance, intrigue, religion, and feminism... it's all in here. And it's worth the read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This was the best book I have ever read and I cried when it was over. I wish Charlotte Bronte had written more books. This is my new favorite book, and my standard for all books I've ever read and ever will read. I sincerely reccommend it to everyone who loves suspensful love stories."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I am 14 years old, and I really enjoyed reading this book. I read it first four years ago and was particularly impressed with the quality of the writing and the ideas displayed. Charlotte Bronte very cleverly used her book as an outlet for her own feelings and experiences as a woman which, in her day, were not considered or acknowledged. Unfortunately, while reading some of the other reviews on this page and elsewhere, I have noticed that some people are still discriminatory and insensitive towards female writers and believe that their views can simply be dismissed as soppy and foolish. I do not think that this is right. The fact that a person can write about his or her life using such great detail and keeping such an objective view of it as Charlotte Bronte did should not be dismissed as monotonous or boring, but rather should be acknowledged as a talent and as a result of hard work. It also shows that it cannot be easy to analyse your own life in such a way that you can understand and write about every detail of it. Charlotte Bronte's writing of Jane Eyre reflects her own character; that she wanted, like Jane, to be independent and go out into the world, and I think that it is this element of independence in many women that defies the assumed 'authority' and 'superiority' of the opposite gender and therefore they resent feminists speaking out. All in all, I think that Jane Eyre is an excellent novel and that it should not be labelled as some foolish, whimsical piece of writing that is only respected because it was written more than a century ago. The quality and status of a book and its author should not be undermined by the period of time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"an amazing and enthraling tale about love. it tells us to never give up in hope. many twists and turns,and leads to strange places. charlotte bronte has captured love and mystery in one fantastic tale."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"haha im into horror books.. but we had to do an Historical Fiction book report recently and i remember my mom buying me this book saying i should read it in high school, im in 7th grade, I have to say this is probably the best book i have ever read, although after she left mr.Rochester i wanted to stop because i thought it would just be depressing. but im glad i went on.

This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read isSelected Works of the Bronte Sisters (Wordsworth Special Editions) (Wordsworth Special Editions), so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them. Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"We were forced to read Jane Eyre in high school. My teacher was so derisive of Jane and the choices she made that I was turned off.I reread this in my 20's and OMG, what I missed!

Jane is a friend to keep."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"OK, so this is not Wuthering Heights, all drama and stormy characters. So what? Jane Eyre is still a very good book. Its main attraction is the superb description of Jane's problematic life and the character's in the book. A good story must draw the readers into it, making them feel like they're witnessing the action firsthand, and Jane Eyre does it beautifully. I didn't like much the main character at first, until she proved to be smarter then she had appeared first. This is a classic everyone should read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is wonderful-there is simply no other word for it. From the very beginning, the story sweeps you up and holds you captive. On the first page, Jane is sure to win you over, and keep you on her side throughout the entire book. Told in elegant English, the story feels real and the characters seem to leap out of the pages. When I read Jane Eyre, I felt the lonely misery of her childhood, endured the sufferings of Lowood School, and shivered in the dark as strange noises issued from the attic of Mr. Rochester's house. I too rejoiced at the prospect of marriage to Mr. Rochester, and was filled with dark despair when the secret of the locked third story room was revealed. This book is truly a masterpiece that I would encourage everyone, even teenagers and young adults to read.

All this experiences whitch Jane had had in her live are written in this book very honest. I think that the writer of this book is a person who knows and understand the problems of people who have a special live.

When she becomes a woman, her life gets very exciting and full of adventures.I don't want to give away anything more about the book.

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It is amazing that only 8 people have reviewed this book so far.

Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot.

At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie.

An Autobiography\\" under the nom de plume of \\"Currer Bell\\". The novel is told in first person narrative and goes through five distinct stages in Jane's life. In spite of many dark elements the novel has strong elements of right vs. wrong as well as morality.The orphan Jane Eyre, brought up by an duty bound aunt by marriage is having a miserable childhood. The family is spoiled and socially fixated, considering the orphan in their mists beneath them and bans Jane from her cousins. After an incident with her cousin John, Jane is sent to a school called Lowood where the moral pillar of her time finds herself subject to the hypocritical minister who runs the place. Jane endures the school even though she has been branded a liar and subject to a starvation diet as well as other miseries - but she remains faithful to standards which would break any other mortal.Reaching adulthood, Jane leaves Lowood to become a governess for Mr. Rocchester at his home called Thornhill. Mr. Rochester wins Jane's love and respect even though she knows he is harboring a secret. Rochester asks for Jane's hand in marriage, even though she keeps remind him what a poor, plain girl she is. At the last moment the marriage is thwarted, Jane flees Thorhill all alone and without a penny to her name. However, Jane finds her way back to society and moves up the social ladder only to make her way back to Mr. Rochester to discover his painful secret.I can certainly see why \\"Jane Eyre\\" is considered a classic. Bront's use of strong language , rhetorical brilliance and lovely narrative are certainly impressive. The author also had the guts to tackle many social issues head on, something that we, at this voyeuristic age, seem to take for granted. Even though this book was not meant to be historical, several decades later I found it captivating to read about the day-to-day living of 1800's England.The book described the fascinating social ladder of the 1800's where governesses (nannies/teachers) were far below their employers, yet often better educated. I felt that Jane's assertions to Rochester that she is his equal was something that was simply frowned upon a society which thrives on ambiguities.I found myself increasingly interested in the outcome of the story, the Rochester secrets, Jane's wit and eventual outcome. The personal story of Jane Eyre is very absorbing and well written. Bront's observations are poignant and engaging, her storytelling, when she's not of on a tangent, is admirable.But,oh the tangents... as much as absorbing as the book was, when the characters start going off on departures about religion and morality I almost felt as if I was being scolded. The huge amount of storytelling which is meant to be nothing but a filler got to be annoying after a hundred pages or so. The only conflict in the book is between Jane and Rochester, the rest of the book is filled with Jane being Jane, preaching to the reader about morality, virtues, temptations which might have some charm, but certainly isn't interesting.My favorite book, Don Quixote is known for its unbalanced structure, but the Quixote chapters are completely separate from the stories within a story parts. In \\"Jane Eyre\\" Bront tells the tale in logical progression which is structured around the protagonist. However, the consistency of the narrative is done at the expense of the overall strength of the whole."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"What can I say about this work that has not already been said in the many reviews that came before? It is truly one of the greats of English literature, and re-reading it as an adult is a pleasure that reaps even more rewards than when I read it as a girl.My only warning is for those who are reading it in the Kindle edition. The good points are that it is nicely formatted and almost free of spelling errors. The negatives are that it has no Table of Contents, linked or otherwise; and although it claims to be illustrated, no illustrations were included in the version I read.For pure reading pleasure, this novel has few equals.

The protagonist, Jane, is narrating her biography, and the chronicle commences when she was ten years old, growing up with her cruel aunt and equally cruel cousins, who make her childhood miserable. She could hardly wait to get out of their grip to a school for orphanages, run by a saintly woman. There she befriends a girl, Amy, a noble and true friend, dying of consumption. Jane thrives in the school, later becoming a teacher for two years.But the real drama unfolds when she gets a job as a tutor for a young girl, Adel, a protege of Mr. Rochester, a wealthy bachelor. They fall in love and Mr. Rochester proposes marriage. But he forgets to tell Jane a minor point that he was already married to a insane woman, locked up in the same manor! Jane bolts home and a new adventure unfolds, meets her long lost cousins, finds enormous fortune and dodges her cousin's advances to marry and go on to India to preach! She wants none of this austere life. She misses her love and returns to her old digs but to her great dismay, discovers that the old house is burned to the ground and Mr. Rochester who is now blind, has left town. She runs to find him.It is a great story, nicely woven with unforgettable characters. The prose is eloquent and flows like well honed poetry. She was a century or so ahead of her time when it came to Women's rights and their place in the society. It is hard to believe that author of this classic novel was a unmarried young woman, who had a sister, who penned \\"Wuthereing Heights\\", another tour de force. Only annoying aspect of the book was the religious righteousness, however, that was de rigueur during Victorian era.It is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'll confess I wasn't particularly looking forward to \\"Jane Eyre\\" when I started. I wanted to read it because I should read it, and because it's a travesty I haven't read it - until now. I assumed it would be dry, at times forcefully witty - a hunt for a man and a conquest. That sort of thing.Not a bit of it!Charlotte Bront creates in Jane a character with whom I find much in common: her manner of thought, her silented spirit, her tendency to love fully and passionately - to sketch, to think, to be content within herself.As a child she is abused by her stepmother and detested for her untamed spirit. She's sent away to school where her dear (and first) friend Helen Burns teaches her to stand bravely under reprimand - and to focus her courage.As Jane advances in school she becomes mellowed - but still the passion broods beneath. The story carries into her young adulthood when she becomes a teacher (at the same school where she grew up) and determines to see what there is in life beyond teaching and solitude and walls. So the orphan woman-child advertises for a governess position and is quickly hired at the home of the restless and gruff Edward Rochester - a man who finds Jane's controlled attitude, her level stare, her unfailing honesty and scathing intelligence enchanting. As their love develops, Jane realizes a secret about Edward that cannot be loved away, and she tears herself bodily from him, a terrified, frightened, heartbroken girl-woman once again homeless.I've no wish to spoil it for those who haven't read it, but suffice it to say, this fourth classic in all that I have read in my life surely inspires me to read more of its kind! I had no idea a Victorian woman would create a story with such passion. I feel moved to write, moved to create, and at a level with Bront that far exceeds death or time. She is a writer, a fervent spirit, and I stand here, nearly two centuries after her death, feeling shoulder-to-shoulder with her. She gives that much of herself to the work. I cried both at the last segment where she is a child, and the end of the novel itself (something I can't recall ever doing while reading.)Having read formula fiction all my life, I'm in particular impressed with Bront's power of description.Bront breaks norm often by flipping to the present tense, creating a quickness of spirit that contrasts remarkably with the more doleful passages. I find her writing comfortable - for want of a better word. Reading her tale was a pleasure - at times deep with wisdom, at times amusing with spirit, at times very doleful. She tours the human plane of emotion, twisting the plot quite more feverishly than I'd anticipated. Several times I sat forward in astonishment as the plot twisted and volted.So much symbolism in this novel, and captured so beautifully, like a still life - the virgin moon, the burning, lustful fires that destroy, fade out, then flicker anew atop candles before a fading portrait of love beautified as the novel draws to a close. In particular I'm struck by the irony in the way Jane and Mr. Rochester meet - and the way the story closes.I fell in love with Rochester quickly - I don't know why. He is rude, arrogant, and self-interested. Yet his changeable (nearly childlike) spirit - and his admiration for all that is reprehensible in Jane to everyone else - captured my heart.Bront writes both as a Romantic and a Victorian - challenging the church, female diffidence, and \`the norm' - and presenting her prose as richly as a woman in love and as candidly as a man of her generation before the court. A writer caught between worlds--and isn't that the richest place to be as a writer?5 out of 5 stars for Jane Eyre. I gave to Bront sleepless nights - and that's no embellishment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the world's best-loved classic novels for so many reasons.It's an exciting piece of feminist literature written at a time when feminist literature was little known and even more poorly accepted. That it is a semi-autobiographical novel written by a staunchly, independent female author who herself was struggling to survive by her own wits and means and stand on her own two feet makes the story all the more poignant and compelling. While it is a prime example of Gothic romance peppered with the typical fixtures of a Gothic novel - the spectral Thornfield manor that seems to attain a life of its own; the allusions to mythological characters such as ghosts and vampires; the uncanny timing of such weather phenomenon as lightning or a chilling, drenching downpour to accompany major events in the novel - it also breaks new ground in that it avoids some of the typical conventions of Victorian literature. And, finally, it is a piece of masterful story-telling built around larger than life characters that for over 150 years has enchanted readers of all ages and thrilled watchers of numerous television and movie adaptations.For those few of you that have yet to read this wonderful novel, the story can be summarized quickly enough. A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' Nicholas Nickleby when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Bront has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Bront has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century.

This is the cloth bound version or the book with the lovely attached ribbon bookmark. This is a very lovely version of this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the story of a young girl who grows up and is forever contrary to her society. The book foreshadows the penalties that society gives for such opposition, but Jane still remains opposed to the role society wants her to have. In Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte uses foreshadowing, symbolism, and conflict to show her society how a woman can overcome the conventions of her society to live a happy and full life.An example of foreshadowing comes during Jane's engagement. First there is the splitting of the chestnut tree (page 226), soon after Rochester and Jane become engaged: \\"Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.\\" This event foreshadows how the upcoming wedding between Jane and Rochester will divide the two, sending one away, because they are not ready for marriage. It is not until Jane and Rochester both overcome the conventions of their society that they can have a happy marriage.The most dramatic example of foreshadowing comes right after Jane's dreams. After waking from her disturbing dreams, Jane sees a light in her room and finds a grotesque female figure standing over her (250). The figure is Bertha Mason, who came to terrify Jane out of marriage. After rending Jane's veil in two, Bertha leaves and Jane collapses. The rending of the veil foreshadows the obstacle still in front of Jane's upcoming marriage, and it is not until this obstacle is dealt with that Jane can marry.Aside from foreshadowing, Charlotte Bronte uses symbolism, mostly of birds, to show how Jane's society confines her. For example, Jane's surname comes from the word for a bird's nest, aerie. Rochester gives an additional example of the bird symbolism on page 232 when he says \\"Jane, be still, don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Rochester says this when he is trying to convince Jane that they can be married. At this time Jane is struggling with the barriers that her society places on their union. Jane is the bird that society traps in a cage, keeping her away from the man she wants to marry. Eventually, Jane does find a way to overcome her cage and obtain happiness with Rochester.Bronte also uses people to symbolize certain aspects of her society. Mr. Brocklehurst, for example, is the epitome of hypocrisy, as shown during his inspection of Lowood. While surveying the girls in the school, Mr. Brocklehurst condemns one for having naturally curly hair, a vanity of the world in his opinion, and yet Brocklehurst goes so far as to buy curled wigs for his wife and daughters. In addition to this, Brocklehurst manages the funds of Lowood and never allocates enough money to keep the girls sufficiently warm or well fed. Instead of teaching the girls to live pious and frugal lives, he leaves them weakened in front of the onslaught of winter illnesses. These characteristics of Mr. Brocklehurst make him a symbol of the typical man from Jane's society. Jane's ability to overcome the wrongs he does to her shows her society how to rise above society and obtain a happy life.Throughout this book, Jane clashes with the conventions of her society until she rises above them. The greatest example of Jane's opposition to her society is in her successful marriage to Rochester. \\"Reader, I married him,\\" Jane says on page 397. Jane does not say that they were married, or that Rochester proposed to her again. Instead, she states that she took the active role and married Rochester. Such assertion from a woman went against the standard role of women in Bronte's time. Jane opposes the role that society has established for her and rises above it, obtaining the thing that truly made her happy.Charlotte Bronte focuses on overcoming the conventions of her society by having Jane Eyre oppose and surmount them. Foreshadowing shows how society will react to such opposition, such as when Jane and Rochester are initially engaged. Symbolism also helps to illustrate the confines of convention; they cage Jane just like a bird. And the various clashes between Jane and other characters, even her society, further illustrated the limitations of conventionality. But opposing and overcoming the conventionality of society can lead to true and lasting happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte discusses one the most important issues we face today in our society--namely a girl's struggle to be loved but also to be socially and mentally independent. Jane Eyre is a lonely, miserable child, who finally becomes a happy, satisfied wife. She does so only after struggling and suffering as a child and later as a young woman. Although the content is very interesting for most, I believe that Bronte could have fitted it in 280 instead of 480 pages.Jane initially maintains her romantic relationships superficial since, according to her, they will result in her lack of independence. Jane's romances with Rochester and St. John are not essentially based on true love, and thus, do not flourish. Rochester is interested in Jane because of her intelligence and piano skills; however, Jane believes that the great social differences between her and Rochester make her unworthy of this relation. A marriage would mean abiding by a husband's orders and the household's chores, which definitely is not her connotation of love. Jane's undeveloped romantic relationships fortify her desire for independence and romance simultaneously.Only by becoming socially and economically equal to Rochester does Jane finally seek a deep, lasting romantic relationship, fulfilling Bronte's assertion that a rational balance between emotions and desires is required to become happy. Jane's acquaintance with her cousins provides her the emotional support she seeks throughout the novel. An added support is Jane's inheritance of her wealthy uncle, which makes her not only socially but also economically equal to Rochester. Now that Jane is economically, socially, and emotionally autonomous, she can accept Rochester's proposal.In Jane Eyre, Jane discovers the secret of having a happy life through rationally balancing her desires for independence and her emotions towards Rochester and St. John. Nowadays, many young women struggle to achieve this balance. Therefore, I greatly encourage any who face that same problem to read this book. Maybe you will find your solution in one of the pages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a pretty good book, as far as it captures Jane's character and tells a decent story of romance. Although i have to say that the plot isn't really the tightest, the righting and foreshadowing is very fine, and the play between the narrator describing herself and others.Like Jane herself says, she is not really an angel, and really is more of a woman's woman than otherwise, just by the way the plot turns out. On the one hand she defends her virtue, and her \\"station\\", in a reasonable sort of way, but the narrator of course is the character, and she gets a bit self-righteous and indignant at times without much good cause. The \\"idea\\" of love kind of turns out to be just what will make the best story. Of course a good story is hard to write, but this is why I say it has the feel of an indignant biography.Other than that I wouldn't knock this book too much. The opening 10 chapters and Helen Burns are very touching and you'll see the character, try to survive and lose all of the sweetness that a Helen Burns has over time, which is kind of sad in a way. The book is good though b/c it shows the reasons for her emotional decline from Helen's sort of pure beautiful spirituality into a real sort of adult. I'm not a historian of this period or anything, but it seems like this book is pretty good."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read it for the first time when I was studing english and loved the book.

Defenseless. Powerless. This is the reality of Jane Eyre, a young orphan girl forced to cope with the callous world around her as a child. After the death of her parents, Jane is forced to reside with her cruel aunt, Mrs. Reed, who despises her, and consequently sends Jane away to Lowood, a boarding school with little resources and poor housing conditions. Despite malnutrition and a harsh atmosphere, Jane strives to make her mark at the school, eventually becoming a teacher. Before she realizes it, Jane tries to escape from her old life and embarks on a new journey as a governess under the employment of a secretive and guarded gentleman. As Jane falls in love with her mysterious employer, she struggles to safeguard the little confidentiality she has left to protect herself from the secrecy and ill-will of others. Although Jane cautiously guards her heart instead of exposing her soul, a revelation of truth eventually catches up to her, causing more harm than the wrath of the deepest secrets. Jane finds herself trapped between truth and lies as she faces her past, her situation, and herself in a world where all odds are against her. Jane Eyre has remained a classic in literature because Bront illustrates the necessity of secrets in life, therefore supporting the tendency of human nature to occasionally slip in a guilt-free secret or two into one's life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones. Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story. Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story. It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane. By the end I felt I knew her.The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault. There are many places in the book that could have been shortened. I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.It is a lovely story. I recommend it if you hunger for a love story. It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I think Jane Eyre is a book full of love and point. The book starts off with Jane, a lonely ten year old abandoned by her aunt in a prison-like boarding school. It continues as Jane finds an occupation as a governess fro a little French girl. But, beware as Jane is falling madly in love with Mr. Rochester (her master as she calls him-is it just me or is I Dream of Jeanie popoing into my head), who has a secret terrible enough to destroy Jane and himself too. I recommemd this book for the older more mature reader (13 and up). Even though nine year olds can read this book, to fully understand the passion and adult situations you must be a little more mature. To really fully understand Jane Eyre you must read past the words and into the heart of little troubled Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was a book that I thought was very wel written and I think that if you are an ambitious enough reader, that you can ignore the age suggestins on any type of book. This book backs up my theory. I read this book an my own free time, and I, a nine year old girl, fully enjoyed it. This book is a nice mix of romance and classic liturature and I recomend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've never read a piece of work by the Brontes' till I stumbled on this book. I looked at the beautiful cover and said, this looks interesting. I know you are not suppose to judge a book by its cover, so before I got it, I read the first chapter. I was instantly in a world of my own which only inhabited a young girl named, Jane Eyre. I got it out as fast as I could and started to get far away from the world, in this book. I read it constantly, not wanting to put it down. I was surrounded by mystery and passion and thrills all at the same time. The characters were so life-like that I felt like I was standing right next to them, observing them from every angle. It was the most, thrilling experience I've ever had from a book besides 'Little Women.' The writing, it's so creative and follows the rules of realism and describation and the beautiful flow of language. I just couldn't believe that the whole story was fiction and was made up in the author's mind. It seems that it actually happened. This book is a classic and if you haven't read it yet, you are just missing out. I would like anyone who wants to be inspired to write read Ms. Charlotte Bronte's words. Since I'm a writer, it has helped me so much. But, if you are not a writer, I would still recommend it to readers who like to be immersed in books. Everyone should read this!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"While I do admit that I did not read this book of my own free will (It was on my summer reading list), I really liked this book. When I started reading it I found it more than a little boring and wanted to throw in the towel. But, as I got to the heart of the novel I found myself in a thrilling love story with a strange twist. It really wasn't that hard to understand once I got used to the language. This book may be more appealing to females than males due to the female heroine. I honestly couldn't put it down and breezed through it in less than a week. I even read it twice! It is a great mixture of romance and horor and I recomend it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is amaizing. It's the ideal book for any romantic who thinks love is something of the past. Jane Eyre is a homely governess who falls in love with the master of the house. Jane has come from very good family, but because of a someone pain in the butt aunt, is sent to away to boarding school. The story is quite simple actually. Homely girl meets rich man. Homely girl entices rich man with innocence and natural beaty. Rich man dumps blond for homely girl. I'm not going to pretend that every word in this book kept you wanting more, it actually took me close to 200 pages to get interested, but its well worth the wait!!!! Jane is sent from her aunts house to live at a boarding school. She is brave and outspoken after living with her aunt after her mothers death and is not quite welcomed with open arms at her new home. Her only friend dies a short time after Jane's arrival and life isn't everything Jane wanted. She completes school and stays for several years to be a teacher herself. She responds to an ad in the paper about a governess. She is given the position and begins to work for the man she falls in love with."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Although this book's words are quite hard to understand, the plot of this story is amazing.

Charlotte Bronte was a genius. When I read this book, I AM Jane; I feel her anguish, her pain, her excruciating love for Rochester. I feel her desolation when she dreams of him and wakes up alone. Every girl should read this book. As a matter of fact, guys should read this too. Definitely a 10!!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One word sums it up: WOW!

Reading it the second time not only helped me to understand it more, but to like even more. Jane Eyre is a wonderful book that comes from out of the blue. To me when I first heard I had to read it as a freshman, it was just another one of those classics that they made you read. However, as the stroy progressed I really enjoyed learning about how Jane delt with everything. Not only did I begin to dislike the people that Jane disliked, but I began to start looking at everyday situation and wonder how she might handle them. Overall, it was a wonderfully written book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I am a 15 year old freshman who was required to read this book for an honors class. At first I was annoyed at the lengh and appearence of &quot;another boring classic&quot; that I would hate. Once I started to read Jane Eyre I was immediatly drawn in. The descriptions of seens, though long and tedious, were magnificent. The story line itself realy touched me. I found myself dislikeing all the characters that Jane disliked and having a grudge against all the characters who were unjust to Jane. I found jane to be a kind of idol. Her courage to speak up for herself and never let anyone walk all over her was really encouraging to me. By the end of the book I was in love with Mr. Rochester and felt my own ties with Thornfeild, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, and all the others. I encourage people to read this book! What I thought was going to be a boring assignment turned into a pleasure. Me, a person who really dislikes reading, found myself reading every night. I hope kids and adults alike read this book and enjoy it. It was somewhat of a challenge for me, but it was well worth it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Very descriptive, held my attention from first page to the end. I was able to see through Jane Eyre's eyes, her world of living as an orphan in England in the 1800s, the cruel and heartless people in her life, her selfish aunt who didn't keep her promise to her dying brother to rear her as her own. Throughout the novel, Jane was resourceful, nurturous and intelligent. She became a governess for a rich employer who had his insane wife imprisoned. Jane fell in love with him, suffered tragedies of a broken heart, trials of running from her past, a new identity. She discovered loving friends and family, became rich, and marries her former employer. Every time she had a taste of happiness it was taken from her. I cried and got angry."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I always tell people: \\"ask any girl if they liked Jane Eyre. The answer is sure to be a yes.\\" The story has been outlined through many forms of media, including the stage and the silverscreen. But the experience of reading Bronte's exquisitely detailed, and passionate writing is to be found on the pages.The sexual tension between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the pan-ultimate Byronic hero, is exciting, and Jane's growth as a woman is relational to her position with Mr. Rochester.The gem of the story is its subversiveness, however. Bronte was audacious in Jane's defiance of religious and aristocratic authorities, challenging the traditions that defined British society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book on a sort of whim, because I'd been harboring a copy about a hundred years old (cloth cover, and kind of cool in it's own right), and because I had just read 'The Eyre Affair' by Jasper Fforde. In his story, the plot for Jane Eyre gets 're-written' to have a 'newer and more popular ending'. While Jasper Fforde is as loopy as Douglas Adams, that is another review. He seizes on something great though, which is the last section of the book where Jane has gone off from Rochester, and (under terrible pressure) is next to assenting to go off to India with her cousin to work herself to death and bear his children. In the Fforde story, that is how Jayne Eyre ends, until his heroine Thursday Next comes in and sets things on a different path. But enough of that. It's worth mentioning that I was intrigued by the glimpse I got of the story from a single remove. I am very glad I was compelled to read it. I found Jane Eyre very enjoyable, and as I mentioned very modern in many of it's features, from plot movement,to the confidential nature of the narrator's speech, to a certain darker caste, which, while gothic certainly, is also the color of the paper that nearly every screenplay and t.v. script is written on today. The rush & dash of the romance is first rate, and I am sure it was ground breaking when it was written. I look forward to reading a morsel more from each of the Bell (Eyre) sisters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre in 8th grade and re-read it this month as I turned 40. I was struck by how beautifully written it was, and the depth of the feelings conveyed. This was a reminder that the quality of thought and writing of the classics of English and American literature is far superior to so much of what gets churned out today. And, the interest and excitement of the storyline is not lost in the process. If this was assigned to you in jr or high school English class, re-read this great book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is one of the greatest classic in literature, the only downside is that it is a little long.

Charlotte Bronte is so convincing in her description of Jane's love for Mr Rochester that if anyone ever asks me again \`what is love?' then I will tell him or her to read Jane Eyre.The plotline is just marvellous but I won't go into that for fear of spoiling it for future readers.Charlotte Bronte knows how to write a hero. Jane is so brave, strong and compassionate and loveable. Mr Rochester is mysterious and cynical and attractive.I recommend this book it is so heart warming."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"My copy refers to the 1997 edition of Jane Eyre, Penguin Classics. A landmark on the road to my understanding of female authors. Clean type, wide margins easily read, they chose to make the book slightly wider than thicker so it is comfy to hold.Entering the world of the immortal emotion in a setting long past, not being a scholar, does pose problems.Penguin provides valuable auxilliary notes explaining the context quite well.For instance,I had not known that Thackery was struggling with publishing then and that C.B. was taking solace and courage from his battles.Do other publishings of the classics:Norton,Dover, Bantam, etc. relate to the public as well?I whish my fellow customers or Amazon in its info blurb were more sensitive to how the book they review is made,and how the text is supported."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Of all of the books that I have had to read in high school, I have never enjoyed one as much as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" Charlotte Bronte has created a touching, beautiful heroine: one who finds herself and her one true love. As I read, I couldn't help but find myself rooting for Jane and Mr. Rochester...I so wanted them to be together!Although slow to pick up and drawn out in spots, this novel is nonetheless an enjoyable read. The happy ending makes it all worthwhile--and you will find yourself rejoicing along with Jane and Edward when they finally come together, unobstructed by outside circumstances.

It's one of the best books I've ever read. This has much depth and meaning to it, and has many underlying meanings. The book is beautifully and lushly written. The multi-faceted characters give this book much depth. Strong-willed Jane, Enigmatic Rochester, Kind Fairfax, gleeful Adele, Terrifying Bertha Mason, Stoic St. John, among other characters give this book a variety of characters and all are unforgettable characters.

Two years later, we read it again in English, and I liked it even more.This book portrays it's main character as a strong, outspoken, smart and independent woman, written in a time when it was unconventional to do so. While the book is over 100 years old, it is not outdated because it's message is something that people can relate to today.Because it is wordy and not exactly fast, easy reading, some people disregard the book as being boring. However, if you give it a chance, you will probably find that it is suspenseful and exciting.There are many surprises. Just when you think that something is going to happen, some strange twist of fate changes the course of the story. It's also mysteroius and even funny.Ultimately the book has a positive message. Jane is an incredibly strong character who shows what it means to be true to yourself.Many people have to read this book, whether they want to or not. Other people choose to read it. Even if you don't want to read it, appreciate the writing style and open your mind to it. You might like it. I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is a classic rags to riches story, with some twists thrown in. Bronte captures the horrors of Jane's family (I use the term loosely) and the physical, as well as emotional, hardships she had to endure throughout the whole of her childhood and ultimatly her life until the end of the novel. The book is much more readable than the indominably beautiful heroine who only briefly suffers and finds superficial happiness in the one she loves. Jane's love for Mr. Rochester goes deeper than the surface for she does not even glance at the startling deformities of his body, but tries to heal the deformities of his soul when she returns to him. To her credit she succeeds and finds a happiness which few ever experience or imagine."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"i normally dont write reviews but felt i had to after a previous reviewer wrote she did know any men who loved this book. it is a classic for any gender and the theme of principle over emotion and the struggle between the two is in my opinion what makes this book so special."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book a couple of months ago and really enjoyed it.

Don't let me put you off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"About a year ago, my book group read, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; Jean Rhys' 'pre-quel' to &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; In book group, we are frequently forced to give notice to the fact that a book varies with the age of the reader and that there are childhood books that belong to childhood while there are other books that grow with you throughout your life. With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to REread Jane Eyre. About half way through the book, I realized that I had never read it before: this was my first read! Interestingly, the woman who led the discussion on Wide Sargasso Sea had the identical experience. So did another. We decided that it was more than the movie in which the still only babyfat Orson Welles wished himself to be the romantic hero: Jane Eyre was so much a part of Western Culture that without actually having read the book, we knew it. Charlotte Bronte, writing at the very beginning of the 19th century, was a much better writer than many who followed her. George Sand's writing is more pretentious and more closely tied to the 18th century. While &quot;Little Women&quot; is a wonderful book to revisit, Louisa May Alcott's potboilers are tiresome. I can not get into Dickens or James Fenimore Cooper. Until you come upon writers who bridge the gap between the 19th and 20th centuries -- Edith Wharton springs to mind -- no one is quite as readable as Charlotte, unless it is one of her sisters.That is not to say that the plot holds up. It is riddled with co-incidence that nearly undermines Bronte's intentions. However, her characters live and have dimension, even if their circumstances do not. So often, the infamous &quot;canon&quot; is criticized as being full of dead white European males. Charlotte is a woman whose work has shaped our thoughts and influenced us for nearly 200 years. I would say that Charlotte Bronte is part of the Western canon."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this in my youth and have recently read and enjoyed many authors especially Francine Rivers.

Me too don't see why it was so highly rated. If you want something good, that leads you to know the character's personality, go read Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Written in 1847 by the woman writer Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre remains a classic of 19th century literature. This novel was one of the finest of its time and what made it all the more incredible was that it was written by a woman. Charlotte Bronte and her sisters, the Brontes, were British women who grew up in Yorkshire, the English countryside. To kill time when they were bored in the domestic and boarding-school ambiance, they wrote great works of literature. It's a must read for young women, but also for men and young males (preferably in the high school or college level) Jane Eyre is ultimately a literary novel and only a literary-minded intellectual can truly enjoy it for the masterpiece that it is. It ranks among the greatest works of English fiction, taking its place with the other male greats- Shakespeare and Charles Dickens. Curl up, warm up some tea or coffee, put on some mood music and read this incredibly engaging book. In this edition, we get commentary and preface by noted scholars.Jane Eyre has been scrutinized time and again. It is understood by many that the heroine Jane is Charlotte Bronte herself. It's partially autobiographical in some portions- Charlotte Bronte did grow up in lowly conditions and was in boarding school that was cold and freezing. Charlotte did love a married man who was older than her, though nothing came of it of course. Jane Eyre, a feisty, spirited young orphan, is taken away from her home where her wicked aunt and cousins mistreat her. She is taken to a boarding school for girls until she comes of age. She lands a job as a governess for the eccentric and mysterious Mr. Rochester, who is hardly ever at home and takes care of his daughter Adele, teaching her to read and write, etc. But the mystery surrounding Mr. Rochester's past becomes a present reality in Jane Eyre's own life. Furthermore, Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre fall in love. A novel that is inspired by Gothic fiction, it is strewn with Gothic, supernatural and suspenseful atmosphere and symbolism. The tree that is struck by lightning is a warning for Jane Eyre to leave Mr. Rochester's mansion, the strange cries in the attic later turn out to be Mr. Rochester's first wife, the crazed Bertha. A fire destroys the mansion and Mr. Rochester ends up diabled and blind. Bittersweet though the ending is, Jane Eyre and the blind Mr. Rochester marry and live happily, after much water under the bridge. This novel is a long read and should take up at least a whole summer, but it's very worth reading. It's a classic. Time and again, it will appear on the list of reading material for high school and college courses. And a bit of advice- dont' just read it to pass a class, get into the story. You will score even more points."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The novel is about a cheap gal called Jane Air who is out looking for the perfect guy to marry, one with a tonne of cash.

If you are confident in yourself and your abilities, then you will succeed in carrying out a happy and successful life much like Jane Eyre.

If you ignore that advice, you might conclude that a woman&#8217;s ideal role is something akin to slavery: total submission to the other gender.Yuk!The two men Jane involves herself with are certainly egomaniacs. Perhaps I&#8217;ve gone too far&#8212;maybe they&#8217;re just maniacs. Maniacs that Jane is more than willing dedicate her life to. The eccentricities of their personalities don&#8217;t bother her at all. What was Bront thinking of?A comparable near contemporary female character is Lizzie Hexam [Our Mutual Friend (Dickens, 1864-65)]. Like Jane, Lizzie was strong. Like Jane, Lizzie submitted herself to a dominant male, Eugene Wrayburn. Perhaps a significant difference is that the man Lizzie served, if not a perfect human, was worlds more appealing (at least to me) than either Eyre&#8217;s Edward Rochester or St. John Rivers.The last third of this book is all the more disappointing because of the quality of the two thirds that preceded it. Jane began as a woman with intellectual curiosity and strength of character. The life and future she ends with are anything but hopeful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have seen most all of the movie versions of this book however they can never compare to the complete novel.

I read it every year or so, because I learn something new every time. It is poignant and unforgettable. It is one of the few novels wherein the author speaks to the reader as if he or she is a dear friend and this is a story she simply must tell. I love it. It is bittersweet, mysterious, and a little supernatural. I wish it had been required reading in high school.... thankfully, I picked it up and read it on my own.

Heraunt, Mrs. Reed, later sends Jane to a school called Lowood, whereshe bonds with a girl named Helen. After she finishes school, shereceives a job as a governess in a place called Thornfield for a younggirl named Adele. Jane begins to fall in love with the owner ofThornfield, Mr. Rochester, but with much controversy. She discoversmany secrets about his past life that puts a strain in theirrelationship. All in all, I felt this novel was aseptic, boresome, anddry.If you are seeking a dull, dry novel to read, this is a book foryou. I was always waiting for something exhilarating to occur, but itnever did. If Jane Eyre does seem interesting, I suggest renting themovie, it isn't half bad because many of the tedious parts of the novelwere cut out. I felt the novel was too descriptive, and made you fallasleep.I suggest this novel to someone looking for something to putthem asleep, or maybe someone with insomnia.

When you read this book, with my 3 stars you'll be agreeing.So go on and order this book about Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"or engaging, or involving, or insightful or brilliant.Jane Eyre is not a book that is celebrated because of its overwhelming greatness, but because it was 'dared' to be written in the 19th century- by a woman, no less, and contained female sexuality at a time when any sexuality was rather frowned upon.Well, I am all for the courage and the steps forward taken in writing this book, but that doesnt mean its particularly interesting, absorbing, or anything else that makes it worth your while, or anyone elses.I can, and have, read such classics as 'A Tale and Two Cities', other works by Dickens, 'The Scarlet Pimpernel', etc. All those books were of the same period but at least were quite interesting and over all a great experience.Jane Eyre is neither.All of the dreary symbology (chestnut tree, mad wives, mansions burning down) and all of the prophetic dreams do nothing to prop this book up. Charlotte Bronte makes ghosts seem dull and spirits and fairies positively mind-numbing. All of Jane Eyre's encounters are couched in a style thats drier and staler than moldy bread. Fire? Murder? wild spirits? its all here. But none of it is the least bit worthwhile to read.In the end, we have a heroine that has wandered from place to place and eventually settles down ith her past love, Rochester, once he has 'redeemed' himself by his courage in trying to save his mad wife (in the attempt he loses his sight and an arm).In typically fairy tale fashion, Rochester gains his sight back. I have a suspicion that he would have grown another arm if we gave hima few more years.The book that Jane Eyre reminds me most of is 'The Scarlet Letter'. If anything, this is more boring.This dull, mind-numbing book is about as entertaining as watching fungus grow. The fact that its riddled with 'deep symbology' makes it not one bit more interesting."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Excuse me? Is this edition a joke?I enjoyed Jane Eyre quite thoroughly, and I will not summarize the plot here. It has been done elsewhere. This review concerns this particular edition.Perhaps I might be harsh, but it looks to me as if Dame Darcy paid a fifth grader to do the illustrations in this book. She could use some serious formal training. Perhaps she was attempting to capture some type of gothic element in her illustrations, but these poor, poor drawings do not enhance (in fact they serve as a detriment to) the beautiful language of charlotte bronte's work. They really are quite terrible, heavy-handed drawings; Darcy really should bruch up on her pen work.Perhaps they were executed under serious time constraints? Perhaps all she had access to were cheap bic pens and a half used crayola water color set? Perhaps Penguin books was looking for an illustrator to do these illustrations for dirt cheap and she? There aren't really any other excuses for the quality of the paltry illustrations in this edition."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When this book came it was supposed to be &#34;gently used&#34; but as I was reading it, the binding kept falling apart.

My sister and I decided a few years ago to read some of the 'classics' we had overlooked. Jane Eyre was our first selection. We are forever grateful we did not pass through this life without reading it. Oh, what we would have missed!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Oh how I love this novel! Jane Eyre is one of those novels that I can read over and over again and get something new out of it every time. I consider it to be one of the most readable classics, one I can just pick up and lose myself in it without even thinking about it. To me, that's a testament to how well it holds up, there aren't too many classics I can say that about because I find so many of them to be rather plodding.This time around, I found myself to be much more emotional about the trials that Jane goes through. I've gone through quite a few emotional events since the last time I read this one, and that undoubtedly affected my reading of many of the situations Jane is in. I openly wept when reading about her treatment during early childhood at Gateshead and later at Lowell School.As we get towards the middle section of the book, and Jane finds such happiness at Thornfield, I was so elated to witness her journey again. Yet, because I knew where it was going, I found myself deliberately slowing down, as if I could prevent more pain for her simply by reading the story so slowly. Of course, this didn't work and I was soon crying along with Jane again as another misfortune befell her. At some point, I just want poor Jane to catch a break!I think the thing that struck me most during this reading was how incredibly frustrated I was with St. John. Normally my frustration in this book is directed towards Mr. Rochester, he seems so fickle at times and difficult to read. Speaking of, I wasn't ever sure...is Rochester his actual name, or is that his estate/title? I think Fairfax is his real surname but I could be wrong. Those Brits always confuse me with this stuff!Anyway, back to St. John. He really is a good man, you can see it oozing from him, but he is so incredibly stubborn I wanted to reach into the pages and just slap him! I get that things were different back when this was written, and that what Jane proposed to him really just wasn't feasible. My frustration stems from his inability to just let the whole thing go!Given that he basically knows the entirety of Jane's story, I think it's really manipulative of him to continually try to convince her to do what he wants. He's not a stupid man, he knows that Jane longs to be involved with other people and is eager to please due to her childhood being so grim. And rather than taking a truly Christian path by wishing her the best when she makes her own choice, he continues to try and guilt her into doing things his way, even to the detriment of her own health, without any real concern for what may be best for her personally. Maybe it's my own ambivalent religious beliefs that make this more difficult for me, because I just don't believe that Jane should have to give up the things she believes may make her happy simply because St. John believes she *could* be a good servant to the lord. Needless to say, I agree with the choices Jane makes in the end, as she was finally able to do as she pleased.Because this is a reread for me, I knew all the major plot points ahead of time, and I think that knowledge added to the frustration I felt for St. John. With each reading, I feel like I understand Jane a little more, and feel for her more deeply, so I can almost experience the pain she goes through to the point that her conversations with these important people really affect me on an intimate level. I felt my own happiness being ripped away at the same time that Jane did, and that makes her all the more real to me.I've lost count of how many times I've read this novel, but this one really cemented it as my all time favorite classic, and one of the books I recommend to people when they ask for something new to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It was nice to be able to read this classic for free.

Interestingly, I had always thought the part between the time she leaves Thornfield and returns was rather less vivid than the rest. Turns out most contemporary reviewers thought so as well.

Jane Eyre was a little orphanage girl, that lived with a family she did not love. Jane didn't feel as if that was her home. Jane says, \\"I was like nobody there. If they did not love me, in fact, as little as I did them.\\" There was to main people that had hurt her the most physically and mentally, Master Reed and Mrs. Reed . Master Reed was a cruel young boy. He liked to criticize, make fun of, and hurt Jane. He thought he was the boss and owned everything in the house. In the book it says that Jane was reading a book and he came along and asked, \\"Why are you touching my stuff? Everything in here will belong to me one day.\\" She responded, \\"I'm only reading a book.\\" He made her look away and threw the book to her head. Master Reed didn't get in trouble at all, because he was Mrs. Reed precious son.Another thing that interested me is that she was a girl that wanted to be different. No matter how people looked down at her, or ridiculed her, she was always determined to be someone in life. Mrs. Reed was very cruel to Jane because she was trying every way possible to put her in school or send her away. Jane began to think that she wasn't good enough for that family. They had downgraded her so much, that Jane began to think bad about herself. Jane began to think to herself, \\" What thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? She wanted someone to care about her and show her love. This novel would be good for a person looking for motivation or a book that is very inspiring.

Jane Eyre is a curious, intelligent and emotionally volatile girl, who we witness grow up into a woman, seeking to make connections with the world around her. There are so many great elements to this story that, considering how long ago it was written, seem novel and suggestive of feminism. Jane Eyre does not take crap from anyone, and is very honest, candid and assertive about this. She is devoted to making a life for herself without anyone else's help. She listens to her instincts, and let them guide her through the course of her life, not matter what the perceived cost may be.I found this story compelling. Even though the subject matter wasn't gripping or exhilarating, the manner in which it was written was enough to keep me interested every page of the way. The word choice and flow were so well done that I feel like I'm floating down the stream of consciousness that the author expertly disseminates through her passion and skill. Very rarely do I feel so brought into a story principally through its substance.

Needless to say, I never finished it. Then a few years ago I read Jasper Fforde's hilarious book, The Eyre Affair, which uses Jane Eyre as a backdrop, and I decided to pick up the book again.When I began reading, I got frustrated with the excessive description and the unlikable characters at the beginning of the book. But I pushed through, and by the time I was half finished, I couldn't put the book down. On the surface Jane Eyre is a compelling love story, but underneath it is a heavy handed take on the scripture \\"if your right hand causes you to sin, then cut it off. And if your eye causes you to sin, then gouge it out.\\" Despite the excessive description of trees and sunsets, Jane Eyre gives readers much to think about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've read Jane Eyre many times over the years, but this time on my Kindle.

Everyone has gone into the gist of the tale but I will tell you what I find most facinating.Charlotte Bronte wrote this in the first half of the 1800's. It's amazing that a woman in that century would be so bold & outspoken. Not only is Charlotte of this character but so is our heroine, Jane Eyre. In the year 2012 not many would find her personality unique but when reading consider that age in which this was written. A tad slow but that can be overlooked when getting to know Jane's character & wit. It's never too late for a classic - go ahead and take a chance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It was hard for me to love this book because I had trouble relating to Jane Eyre. She was a well rounded character...and every page of her story was vivid and interesting...but I just never really adored her as a character.She is not weak...she's more gentle...strong in character...but gentle...delicate and fierce in character. It's a bit hard to explain...but that's the reason I found it hard to relate.It was also tough because she at 18 yrs is so much like a girl and she falls in love with a man. It's well written...believable and I guess romantic...but it's hard to think of it that way because I never felt for Jane or Mr. Rochester or even some of the background characters enough to be enthralled by their stories.I did like little Adele though (partly because she was French and partly because she always spoke her mind. The author did a great job making her sound like a real kid.So I suggest you try this book, but I'll admit it wasn't my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Read this novel for the third time since my teens and enjoyed it again just as much as I did the first or second time. Jane Erye is about a woman's struggle to to claim independence and self-respect in a closed society that had not yet accepted these ideas for women. Jane Eyre was an orphan and poor. She met each obstacle in her life as a student and governess with courage and spirit. As a governess, she fell in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester, who had a terrible secret from his past; however, their bond was so strong that it overcame even this obstacle.

I thought it was interesting how this book has a little bit of a dark side. I liked that, I felt that it gave the book more depth and made it more interesting to read.

I do remember reading Wuthering Heights ~~ but that was in college. Jane Eyre is much more romantic than Wuthering Heights ~~ it is a Cinderella Tale with a happy ending too!Jane was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by a cold-hearted aunt and terrible cousins before being shipped off to an institution. Jane makes the best of her lowly lot in life and decided to take a chance of living life to the fullest by taking a governess job for Mr. Rochester. Little does she know how much life would change because of that decision!The trials and tribulations that beset Jane are those that every woman can identify with. The joy and fear of falling in love with Mr. Rochester (Edward) is inspiring. The tragic secret that Edward failed to disclose to Jane ~~ sending her away is so sad. Jane finds herself again in a town many miles away from her beloved ~~ and finds her family after all these years. Only the unrequited love for Edward was the mar on the beautiful paradise she has found. She does find love again and grows into this splendid woman who is strong and independent ~~ and yet, still very feminine.I strongly believe that everyone should read this classic as Charlotte Bronte wrote a thought-provoking novel filled with description and conversations. It is a moral book ~~ designed to make the reader think of what is right and what is wrong. Jane stood up for her belief at the cost of her love ~~ though it was one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. And love finds her again.This is a book that makes you believe that if you have faith, things will come right and true for you. Even if it wasn't already a classic, it should be. How many books have withstood the test of time? This one is a golden treasure to add to your library!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The free Kindle version is fine if you aren't reading the book for study purposes and if you know a tiny hint of French. In fact, I'm of the opinion that reading 160+ year old books on Kindle has the distinct advantage of access to the built-in English dictionary. You can look up archaic words immediately without losing your page, thanks to the 'back' button. I didn't mind the fact that there were no page breaks between chapters as one previous reviewer did. In fact the novel was so gripping and compelling that the very fact that there were even chapters to break it up left me feeling somewhat impatient!The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 probably has more to do with Kindle books in general rather than this book in particular. It reads as easily as any other book I've read on Kindle. But it's the kind of novel where you want to flip back to a certain section and re-read a portion just because of what is currently being said by the characters, and there is no way to do that. As for the French passages I had mentioned earlier, they are really very few in number and even if you don't know any French, don't let it stop you from reading this novel. They're all things said by one character or another, often repeated in English. (Thank you, Charlotte Bront)! None of it is important to the plot or to the characters themselves.Charlotte Bront shows herself to be an incredibly masterful writer in \\"Jane Eyre.\\" There were times when I just stopped to admire the style with which she conveyed something and the techniques she used. She is also incredibly insightful into human nature. The main character is an introverted person and all of her thoughts, beautifully laid out, make her into one of the most compelling characters in literature. Although it may be difficult to see this, I do think that the author was showing her feminist colors, such as they were in those days, when she conjured up Jane Eyre.Thanks for making these classic books available for free on Kindle!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As much as I know this is a classic, and I feel a review a tad redundant, I've just read the magnificent Jane Eyre for the first time, and I'm so utterly enamoured, I simply must wax poetic about it a while!Where to start. I've just finished reading Charlotte Bront's Gothic masterpiece for the first time, and I feel a mixture of breathless and speechless.Chronicling the life of the orphaned Jane Eyre, the novel begins with a truly upsetting account of what can only be called horrific child abuse. We encounter Jane as she strikes back at her childhood tormentor--her cousin John--for the first time, after quietly enduring teasing, beating, and the hatred of her only family (her dead uncle's wife, and her 3 cousins) for the whole of her short 10 years. As punishment, she is confined to the 'Red Room', the room in which her uncle died. As the sun sets, and she's left in darkness, the terrified child has a panic attack, and her aunt advantageously uses the event to have Jane sent away to Lowood School--a change of scene to save her nerves.We watch Jane grow into a passionate young woman, develop self-respect, a distaste for injustice, and her own strong sense of right and wrong. After completing her education, and working two years at Lowood as a teacher, Jane hungers for a new situation in life, so advertises in the paper, and is invited to take up a post as governess for a child, at a wealthy, private residence. Here we experience part spooky mystery, part love story, and see the world of Thornfield Manor through fiery and fascinating Jane's eyes.Jane Eyre is many things--a journey of self discovery, a love story, and a surprisingly progressive tale for its day. It holds some strongly feminist ideas, or perhaps more than feminist, ideas about justice, class systems, and equality. It's Jane, a relative 'commoner' who shows more backbone and self-respect than many of her high-bred 'superiors'. Social standing, graces, and superficial manners all come second to intelligence, self-respect, actually having character, and one's own mind.It's mentioned--and constantly reiterated that neither Jane, nor her suitor, are physically much to look at. The idea of true beauty coming from within, and beauty being in the eye of the beholder is another strong theme here. Jane as a character is in strong contrast with others, such as the beautiful, yet shallow and capricious Georgiana Reed, or cruel and superficial Blanche Ingram. Where these women are admired in the highest regard in their upper class society, despite their lack of character, Jane is despised, but she is the better human being. I love that she KNOWS it, also.We're also presented with a wonderful array of unique and colourful characters, very few of whom seem black and white. Rochester, most obviously, struggling to justify his actions before God and society, every bit as much as to his own self; wanting to be good, wanting to be a better man, but really--let's be honest--failing. He's resigned to the fact he can't be better without outside influence. We have a role reversal here: rather than our male hero being a knight in shining armour to a damsel in distress, Rochester views Jane as his saviour. Then characters like Bessie: sweet, but with a temper that will turn as quickly as the wind. She's neither good, nor bad. The adorable, but admittedly vapid, Mademoiselle Ad&egrave;le, and above all Jane, who lives by her own rules and sense of morality, rather than those of society... and really, who's are better, here?. There are still clich&eacute;s here, though. The lunatic wife, the wicked stepmother and stepsisters (In the shape of aunt and cousins)... But at the time, were these clich&eacute;s at the time this was written?Amidst all the romance and wonderful characters, it's easy to forget the wonderful gothic thriller/mystery at the heart of Thornfield, and for anyone new to the story, its heartbreaking conclusion. And the romantic tension between Jane and Rochester? It's as palpable--if not more so--than any modern romance I've read (here's looking at you Twilight), but for once we're dealing with a girl with backbone. This is nothing like a Jane Austen love story. We're not dealing with manners and moving within the bounds of acceptable society--this is unrequited love, people.On an aside, for those who've readA Room of One's Own (Annotated), and Wolfe's criticism of both Charlotte Bront and Jane Eyre, it's interesting to see parallels between the two works: that a woman doesn't need a man to define her; that having one's own means is essential for any woman who wants to create (or maintain an independent mind); that it's the value of human being's heart and mind--not outward appearances--that is what gives them value (I'm thinking about Judith and William Shakespeare, here). Jane is every bit as good as Mrs and the Misses Reeds, the Ingrams, and indeed, a number of the men of this book. She is the intellectual equal of Rochester, and perhaps superior of St John, regardless of her sex.Despite the time since it was written, Jane Eyre is not hard to read. I often struggle with older novel but it's far easier than Dracula, which was an effort for me, though not necessarily a good comparison. It's hugely entertaining, in parts absolutely heartbreaking, and there is a good reason why it remains popular, and a 'classic' over a hundred years later. It's an extraordinary work of fiction, beautifully written, and with just as much to enjoy now as it did when it was first published."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, a girl of no importance and the daughter of an unapproved match, lives a troubled life for her first ten years under her aunt's roof. Her parents died when she was a baby and she was left as Aunt Reed's charge with no other living relatives that she knew of. When her aunt can no longer stand Jane any more, she sends her to a boarding school where the rules are strict and the headmaster is every bit the tyrant Aunt Reed was. But Jane conquers, becomes a teacher, and then wishes to become a private tutor. After her ad is received and her application accepted, Jane finds herself in the home of a mysterious and strange man, Mr. Rochester, who has put his ward, Adele, under Jane's tutelage. But then Jane finds herself falling deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, who she could not imagine would love her in return. This, and the strange happenings in Thornfield Hall, give Jane cause to doubt her future. And when Mr. Rochester's dark secret reveals itself, Jane must question her love and discover what she must do with her life before she can find the happiness she never had.____________________________________This is one of those \\"Can words describe?\\" books. And while I feel there aren't very many words that do an adequate job, I will try my best.Can you believe that I haven't read this book yet? I can't. For years, people have been telling me, \\"Sierra, you have to read this book.\\" \\"Sierra, this is one of the best books I've ever read.\\" \\"Oh my GOSH! You haven't read Jane Eyre?!\\" \\"What are you waiting for, you, the reader, of all people?\\"So here I am, having read (devoured) the long awaited book that has been loved, cried and giggled over by hordes. And I'm here to tell you people who have not yet read this book - \\"What. In the world. Are. You. Waiting for?!\\" (I know...I'm one to talk...but now I know how everyone else feels! haha!)Throughout the course of the book, I got choked up. But there was too much ahead to slow down, stop, and actually cry. However...when I got to the last chapter, I lost it. Tears came and the two-year-old little boy I was babysitting put down his yogurt and stared at me, head cocked to the side, probably completely confused as to why I was smiling and crying at the same time. After all the heartache and sadness, and even the little bits of joy in between, the happiness of the end just overwhelmed me. It was just too beautiful to not feel that way - there was so much emotion in my heart that I felt it would almost burst.Jane is a character I look up to - I want to be like her. Her decisiveness, her courage, her resolution, her faith...it amazed me, and amazes me still, even after the book has been set back on the shelf. She knew what she had to do and she did it - no matter the cost. And the way she loved everyone so unconditionally - especially Mr. Rochester - continually surprised me. Her kind heart, her gentle but firm manner, and her intense love... Wow. I also loved her close study of human nature and how she described and saw people - why she was intrigued by them.Mr. Rochester himself is quite a character. Going into this story, I was NOT expecting him to be the least like he was - physically ugly and mentally independent. He was strange, but yet so perfect for the story. In all my travels through literature, I've never met a character like him, and I doubt I ever will again. That character will always be embodied by Mr. Rochester alone. I easily fell for him as Jane did; her love for him was pure; she never once judged him for his faults; she loved him all the more for them. The reader cannot help but feeling the same. I loved seeing his pride break down, slowly but surely, and the way he described the experience after. It was just amazing.As far as the story line and the writing... Both were equally magnificent. The story captured me from the first, especially when I expected the novel to begin when she was older. But I loved every bit of it - every second was glorious, and painful and lovely. I cared for Jane so much that it didn't matter what she was doing - I wanted to read about her. And Mr. Rochester and St. John and Adele and everyone else. The writing was incredible, down to the very last word. I loved how she wrote most of the time in past tense, and then sometimes slipped smoothly into present tense, showing the reader exactly what it felt like, to be doing instead of remembering. I'm actually not a huge fan of present tense, but this was so perfect I just couldn't resist liking it.Favorite character: Mr. Rochester because of his originality...and how much I loved his character within the first few pages of his introduction.Favorite aspect: DUH! The love story, of course! Totally intriguing the way it was played out, the intensity of Mr. Rochester's secret hanging over it part of the time, the rest being Jane's own doubts about Mr. Rochester's nature or her sadness over him being engaged to a woman who would not and could not love him - and who he had no passion for either. Oh my gosh this story had me in its clutches and didn't let me go!!!There are no single words to describe this book. Magnificent and heart-pounding and gut-wrenching are about the best I can do. They are true - as true as true can be - but there is something about the book that can only be felt and understood by reading it yourself. It's not anything that can be described - it's an experience. One that I can't wait to relive again and again and again!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I remember watching the movie as a young girl and how the story never really left me. I was not dissappointed in the book at all. This is one of those stories that just become a part of you...like one reviewer said, you just want it to continue. I'm not sure why books from this time period cannot say the name of an actual place...you'll see something like @Shire. Strange....but other than that a truely great read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"*** This is a review of the Penguin Classic version with Rebecca Solomon's \\"The Governess\\" on the cover, with introduction and notes by Michael Mason ****** SPOILER ALERT ***First, the book. I'd give it 3.5 stars. I think it is a well written autobiography of a poor, plain but fiercely independent girl. You do feel sympathy for that girl and her moral and emotional struggle. However, there are some elements in this book that I do not like:1. The author's constant addressing of the \\"reader\\" is just peculiar. Most part of the book is written in first person voice, but every now and then she felt the urge to pause and remind the \\"reader\\" (thus switching to second person), this rather takes the reader out of the flow of the narrative. I personally do not like this.2. The two main male characters are wholly unlikable, even repulsive. Rochester comes across as a rude, sullen, selfish, deceptive and manipulative character. On the last point, I am referring to the episode of him, in order to arouse Jane's jealousy, pretending to have fallen in love with another prettier girl. And of course much can be said about his deceptiveness and selfishness. It is indeed hard to understand why Jane would fall for this guy, except that he is really the very first male person she encounters in the real world. As to St. John Rivers, he is simply a religious nutcase, all he talks about is his missionary work, showing no human compassion to even his own sisters. Yet, although Jane eventually rejects him, the author pains him in a saintly aura.3. The constant references to scripture is really irksome.Nonetheless, I do think the personality of the main character is believable and depicted vividly, that's why I would give it 3.5 stars (good but not great).Now on the introduction and notes by Michael Mason, I think they are atrocious. First in the introduction he arrogantly suggests that the general reader cannot \\"get\\" serious literature, only professional critics like him holds the canonical interpretation (I paraphrase). Here's news to Mr. Mason: we have a brain and we can think for ourselves too, thank you very much. But if the introduction is mildly annoying, the notes are just ridiculous. There are chunks of conversation in the book in French, but he never bothers to translate them; however he *constantly* FORWARD-references plot elements. For example, before we find out who Rochester's maniac wife is, he already mentions her name and what she's going to the next day; at another point when Jane had a dream about Thornfield on fire, he says something like \\"considering what happened next, this is so accurate that it is like a 'second vision'\\" (I paraphrase again). This is called \\"RUINING THE BOOK\\", as some other reviewer said (I believe he or she was referring to Mason's notes), this is like an annoying friend constantly telling you what's going to happen next when you watch a movie. This is so frustrating at times I wish Mr. Mason was standing next to me so I can whack him with the book (and shove his \\"canonical view\\" of serious literature down his throat)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the subject of many AP required reading lists, perhaps strikes discontent to those who read the novel in high school. A better appreciation for this classic will probably be gained reading it later in life.Bronte seemed to have modeled the character and conditions of Jane Eyre around her own life, so the novel has some biographical elements. Jane Eyre, after a difficult childhood quite Dickensesque in nature, eventually lands a job as a governess of Thornfield Hall as she approaches adulthood. Jane works here for awhile, and begins to adapt to her new station in life. Her employer, Mr. Rochester, comes and goes from Thornfield, but eventually news comes back that he is to marry the beautiful but snobbish Miss Ingram. As time wears on, however, there is an indication that Rochester marrying Miss Ingram might only be a ruse for him to actually find the secrets of Jane's heart. Jane struggles back and forth between her feelings for Rochester as her employer, and him as a man. Eventually Rochester asks Jane to marry him, but he has some baggage in his past that he is able to keep from Jane until the moment they are to be married. Jane then discovers the truth: Rochester is married to a woman named Bertha, who is insane and resides locked in the basement of Thornfield. Jane knows she cannot marry now, and leaves Thornfield to pursue a new life. Romanticized in nature, events suggest that this is not the end of Rochester and Jane, and that they will cross paths sometime later. How and under what circumstances you discover in the book's second half.One theme Bronte explores is the importance of equality within backgrounds and classes. Jane changes her station by beginning in poverty and living as a governess only to eventually be able to gain a sense of independence. Jane, despite struggles, is often conscientious and fair to others, which is juxtaposed by Miss Ingram and her family, who loathe the site of governesses, thinking them to be unintelligent and worthless.There is also a sense that Jane, although first seeing herself as lower to others, builds self-confidence and understands herself as equal to others, especially Rochester: \\"I was an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.\\" When she discovers and matures, this gives dimension and depth to her character.Perhaps Jane Eyre has as much to do with illustrating a heroine's ability to be a free thinker, independent, and even a bit brash at points, which could be viewed as atypical of female protagonists during this time. We experience Jane's introspective outlook on all things by the first person narration, and Jane displays a depth to her character, especially when she is skeptical about Rochester's first proposal of marriage, which seems too \\"fairy tale\\" to be true. She doesn't give in because it seems like the proper thing to do, or the easiest. She refuses to marry Rochester earlier in the novel out of principle, and despite his pleas, she sticks to her guns, even though she knows it will be a rough go in life for both her and Rochester.Character depth is illustrated in both Jane and Rochester's change from beginning to end. Rochester has moments of \\"blindness\\" in the novel. First, he is \\"blind\\" to humility and life responsibilities in the first half of the book at Thornfield Hall. Later in the novel, he is physically blind after the tragic accident that leaves Thornfield a ruin, but, has learned a sense of sympathy and humility that he didn't have earlier. Jane also undergoes a transition from her outlook on life: she believes and knows by novel's end that she is equals to her peers.While a bit overly romanticized at points, Bronte's novel has fantastic character development. The scene when Jane battles with her conscience while leaving Thornfield is epically captured by Bronte: \\"He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge..\\" Although Jane feels a sense of tragedy at this moment, she is not afraid to stick to what her intuition tells her is right, and she uses her faith as her instrument to guide her fate.Over all, Bronte captures a powerful and moving story of a \\"plain\\" girl who overcomes difficult moments to find faith and healing in life. I felt that it was a strong story, but tended to drag during Jane's stay at St. John's after leaving Thornfield. The story seems to get \\"stuck in the mud\\", and many moments of Jane's narration become repetitive. However, it doesn't detract from an otherwise powerful, impressive classic."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is book #6 on theThe Well-Educated Mind's list of must-read novels, and it immediately draws comparison to the two prior selections,Pride and PrejudiceandOliver Twist. Both Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre were written by female authors and feature strong female protagonists. Elizabeth Bennett and Jane Eyre are both very feisty and committed to finding romantic love in a time when that wasn't always the basis for marriages. The major difference between the two books, though, is that Pride and Prejudice is far more subtle, with the \\"action\\" taking place largely within the lead character's thoughts and emotions, while a whole lot of exciting, external action happens in Jane Eyre. That's not to say one is better than the other, only that they are different in this way while being somewhat similar in overall theme.Like Oliver Twist, Jane Eyre is an orphan. \\"Luckily\\" for her, though, she wasn't abandoned to a work house but adopted by a well-to-do uncle. I say \\"luckily\\" in quotes because the uncle dies when she's one (this isn't a spoiler, I promise) and she's then left in the care of her hateful aunt, who shows her no love or mercy for the ten years Jane lives with her. Jane is the victim of vicious beatings at the hands of her older cousin John, too. But the difference between her and Oliver Twist is that she fights back -- she's spunky, not just a miserable sad sack like Oliver (I hated that character and the entire book). When her aunt says that Jane is unfit to associate with her cousins, Jane shots back \\"They're unfit to associate with me!\\" When asked by a preacher what she needs to do to avoid going to Hell, Jane says, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die.\\"The level of abuse young Jane suffers is far less onerous than that of Oliver, and therefore more believable. She inhabits a world of realistic characters, not stereotypes. I felt bad for Jane; I just rolled my eyes and said \\"Oh brother\\" whenever Oliver was absurdly mistreated.But Jane doesn't stay a child in the story for long -- soon enough she's an adult young woman with new kinds of problems. And of course, she falls in love... The love-story component of this book is probably the best I've ever read, and there are a few chapters composed solely of dialog between two lovers that are absolutely beautiful to read. This IS, however, an action-oriented story, and the plot is both believable and engaging. The story is well-paced, too: Twice when I felt things were just beginning to get a bit tedious there were abrupt changes of scenery that kept me tuned in. I loved this book! While not quite as good asGulliver's Travelsor Pride and Prejudice, this might just be the third best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"i thoroughly enjoyed this book. i must admit they have some pretty BIG words! but it aint nothing a dictionary cant fix. i never did use a dictionary though and i got by well.the story in this book is just amazing! i have NEVER read a book like this before and i have read a lot of books. if u read this book u will not be disappointed!in fact you'll probably want to read it again. after i was through i basically read it again just looking and comparing stuff. its so beautifully written. i've never read any other charlotte bronte books but im planning on it.if u get this book u will definitely enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Published in 1847 under the pseudonym Currier Bell, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has definitely become a timeless classic. Even now, over 150 years after its debut, Jane Eyre's popularity amongst scholars and avid readers has not wavered. However, nowadays, its use of old language and portrayal of a time long past has made it less appealing to the general public.Jane Eyre, the protagonist of the story, is an orphan cared by her aunt, whose whole family views her as an onerous responsibility pushed upon them at her uncle's deathbed. After a few incidents with her taunting cousins, Jane is shipped off to Lowood, a school run by a hypocritical minister. Despite the hardships she had to endure at Lowood, Jane graduates and eventually leaves Lowood to become a governess. At Thornhill, she meets and falls in love with her master, the cold and mysterious Mr. Rochester. However, when it seems that happiness is finally within reach, Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's dark secret that puts a halt to their relationship. But of course, due to her high morals and strong determination to stick to them, all ends well for Jane and Mr. Rochester.While this piece is a story of finding love and happiness, Bronte utilizes Jane's experiences (which are based partly off her experiences in school and as a governess) to criticize the inferiority with which women were viewed at the time. Although Jane is more educated, well-mannered, and morally superior to her master, her status is still considered far beneath his. The Rivers sisters is also representation of how Bronte feels women should be: poised, knowledgeable, and talented.It is no wonder that Charlotte Bronte is known for her ability to make characters and situations come alive. Bronte's vivid and lively narration makes Jane a loveable and relatable character. Through the details of her narration and the fitting syntax structure, her readers are able to clearly grasp the struggles, decisions, and dilemmas that Jane faces constantly. When Jane fought hunger and the cold at Lowood, when she choose to leave behind her ticket to \\"happiness,\\" when she came into inheritance at the Rivers's home and returned to Thornhill, Bronte took us with her. The imagery is also plenty and a great aid in visualizing the setting, especially the mysterious Thornhill.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Maybe it is because I am just a sucker for romances or maybe it is because I generally love historical fiction, but I did not agree with my peers when they said that the story was boring. I admit, the plot does become a bit dragged on at some points, like Jane's time at Lowood and her stay with the Rivers. Overall though, I still say that Jane Eyre is definitely one of my more favorite ones that I read last year.If you don't mind historical fiction and can get your head around the archaic diction, then I highly recommend Jane Eyre. Especially if you are a sucker for romances like me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlote Bronte is a beautiful writer who brings the reader for an emotional ride. You'll cry for Jane and laugh with her. I am only sixteen and I first read this book when I was fourteen. I fell in love with it and since then have read it many times.

It is also the kind of book to read on a winter's day while sipping hot cocoa."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This novel is one of the most expressionistic novels I have ever read. It clearly conveys the love between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester as Jane Eyre emerges into womanhood.

Jane Eyre is a great book by Charlotte Bronte and I will treasuer it where I go, and reread and reread it over and over. It's spectacular."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I will probably read this book again. I borrowed it from a friend and will most likely get my own copy. I liked Jane Eyre as a main character better than Catherine from Wuthering Heights because Jane was more compassionate. I also liked her because of her intriguing personality. From the beginning she sets herself as different from other people, more hardy and thoughtful. Her stay at Lowood is interesting, mainly because of her relationship with Helen and the contrast between the two. Her romance with Mr. Rochester is original. Some of that is due to the fact that Jane falls in love without being made foolish by it. Her stay with the Rivers family was sort of frustrating, because her character was suppressed by St. John. I really didn't like him. The ending was very good except for the last few paragraphs which dwell on St. John. But, that aside, Jane Eyre is a wonderful book, deserving to be read and reread by everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As a child of the eighties, when reading recently published books and seeing movies, I've grown accustomed to &quot;love&quot; being graphically depicted sexual attraction that eventually turns into romance. How refreshing it is to read Jane Eyre, where the order is reversed! A portrayal of love like this is hard to come by. In Jane Eyre, everything is pure, and the love is passionate without anything you'd be embarrassed to tell your parents about. The characters are likeable - I found myself rooting for the protagonsits, hoping Jane and Mr. Rochester would wind up togther no matter how many obstacles they may come across. Yeah, there are a lot of descriptions, but surprisingly, there was even a little adventure.

I too read this book for school, but began about six months before it was due. I think it is truly one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, with strong messages about human behavior..Jane, despite difficult beginnings in her life, became the strongest, most loving charcter in the book. Who really cares that she fell in love with an &quot;old guy?&quot; Here's a newsflash..he was only in his thirties or forties, and that isn't so old. Jane found love, and that's a bigger accomplishment than a lot of us can claim. Try Jane Eyre again some other time if you're up against a deadline..details are not evil, description is not boring. If the rest of the world says Jane Eyre is a classic, although you are entitled to your own opinion, there's a good chance it is. And one more thing-&quot;renting the movie&quot; and buying &quot;Cliffs Notes&quot; are not alternative options to reading a novel. To think that taking shortcuts in reading for school assignments is an advantage, is to fool yourself.

The fact that this captivating novel was written by a 19th century women only enhances it's genius. Charlotte Bronte acted as a trailblazer for all the women authors that would follow her; her unique style of writting and the essence of her characters stimulates the interests of every individual who reads even one line. Jane Eyre is a romantic novel about an innocent girl's voyage through life. The main character,Jane, is a orphan who we are introduced to as she is living in a house full of cruelty. The home belongs to a sour, cold women called Mrs. Reed and her three aggressive children. &quot;He bullied me and punished me ; not two or three times a week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually : every nerve I had feared hom, and every morsel of flesh on my bones shrank when he came near.&quot; Mrs. Reed's son John's treatment of jane caused harsh and long-lasting effects. The family's unjustifiable hatred for Jane results in her being sent to a distant school. Lowood is a cold, and gloomy institution for girls. Its routines are militay, its teachings are restrictive, and its conditions are horrible. She attends this school for eight years during which she excels in her studies as well as in sense. Despite the unsettled environment of Lowood, Jane enjoys her time spent there and more importantly cherishes the friendships made there. This is the place where Jane meets her first true friend Helen Burns. It is through helen's example that jane learns to be patient, diligent and expressive. &quot;Her (Helen) soul sat on her lips and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.&quot; After eight years, Jane desires to move on in life. jane is now educated, confident and ready for change. After advertising for a teaching position, Jane accepts an offer to be a governess at Thornfield. Thornfield is a grand, old estate surrounded by the lonely moors of England. Her motive for going to Thornfield is to instruct the vibrant, young pupil Adele. The immense events and heart wrenching romance that she encounters there change her intentions quite dramatically. Jane's relationship wiht the dark and tortured owner of Thornfield, Mr. Rochester, forms the foundation of Jane's womanhood. The most unique aspect of this romance is the heroine's response to love. the majority of romance novels present a similar picture of love's hold on womane. they become increasingly more like the men they love and less like themselves. they grow weaker, more compliant and vulnerable. However, this novel's heroine does not conform but rather defies the expected. Jane discovers her love for another through the discovery of the love for herself. &quot;Women feel just as men feel.&quot; It would be pure arrogance and a literary sin if I were to describe what happens within the hidden walls of Thornfield. For this novel's majety lies not only within it's story but in the actual words of Charlotte Bronte. The way she can so vividly depict a scene or how she so clearly desribes love is a wonder. &quot;I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspects, and life in its colour: and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the front of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&quot; Charlotte Bronte had the gift of being able to capture emotion and reflect it on paper; making the image more enticing than the subject. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a hunger for passion, a thirst for excitement and a desire for intellect. You are not only given complete enjoyment from this novel, but a life lesson as well. This lesson implies that the only thing that matters is that you are true to yourself and to what you love. This is a lesson that you can carry with you on your own journey through life, as Jane Eyre did."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic \\"A Room of One's Own.\\" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after \\"Jane Eyre\\", \\"Shirley,\\" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic \\"Madame Bovary\\" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.This is simply a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a brilliant novel!

Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole.

The book Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a strong woman named Jane and her growth from a rejected orphan to a strong and independent woman. After living like a servant in her cruel aunt's home, Jane is sent off to receive an education at a poor institute for orphans. After witnessing the death of her best friend and surviving six more years there, Jane becomes a teacher and eventually a governess at the Thornfield Manor under the master, Edward Rochester.Unlike many stories about love, in this one it is Jane's intellect and passion that is what attracts Edward Rochester. They fall deeply in love, but the discovery of Edward's insane wife causes Jane to run away. Charlotte Bronte uses her talent with words to vividly describe Jane's pain.\\"Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent expectant woman---almost a bride---was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow...My hopes were all dead---struck with a subtle doom\\" (314).Homeless, penniless, and near death Jane somehow finds work and a place to stay. Her path of self-discovery continues in the finding of her cousins and her inheritance of her uncle's fortune.She finally returns to Edward to find him staying with his servants. The once wealthy businessman had become wifeless, homeless, blind, and crippled from a fire. Jane and Edward's love had not diluted in their time apart but grew stronger. The story ends happily with Jane and Edward's marriage and birth of a son.This book is written with such detail and emotion, you instantly connect with the young woman. The depth and compassion of this book draws the reader in and teaches him/her about determination and self-worth. Her morality and strength, in a time when women were not accepted for their minds, makes Jane stand out from other heroines. When she is at the point of near death from hunger and fatigue, she will not give up.\\"While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do other wise: for who will receive me? But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and the sense of desolation-this total prostration of hope...And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh, Providence! Sustain me a little longer!\\" (351).Jane Eyre is a classic book, but the text is quite long and at times can seem to trail off. There are points in the book that don't move and slow down the story. During one conversation between Jane and Edward the story feels like it's dragging on.\\"'Sententious sage! So it is: but I sear by my household god not to abuse it.'\`You are human and fallible.'\`I am: so are you-what then?'\`The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely entrusted'\\" (144).Over all, the book is excellent. It is captivating and powerful. It is a long read, but worth the time. I would recommend this book to everyone, not only women. Regardless of the gender of the hero, this book shows what one can accomplish no matter what obstacles life throws your way."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" shortly after high school and was completely mesmerized by it.

Jane is the ultimate heroine: she's independant, doesn't bow down to what the \\"ideal woman\\" should be and doesn't let anything (or anyone) compromise her principles, even the man she loves. The book appeals to the reader both emotionally and intellectually. The emotional aspect of the book is what I love about it. When Rochester tells Jane of his feelings for her, I can the passion of the characters. And later, when Jane leaves him, the agony of the characters is palpable.\\"Jane Eyre\\" always seems to fall under \\"Wuthering Heights\\" shadow. \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I believe, is the better novel.

I got more enjoyment out of mocking the work with friends than reading it. So there you have it. I would rather fornicate with sheep than re-read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"No one reads JANE EYRE for the plot or for the fine sense of irony that her sister Emily Bronte showed. They do read Charlotte Bronte for how she overcomes an admitted use of heavy-handed Gothic romanticism that includes all the traditional trappings of gloomy castles, Byronic satanic heroes, crazed prisoners, and even a shrieking telepathic message. If JANE EYRE had no more than these Gothic trappings, then it is not likely that I, or anyone else for that matter, would be discussing its literary merits. What sets Jane EYRE apart for its earlier and more heavy-handed predecessors was a sense of palpable realism that rings true with events that harken back to Charlotte Bronte's life that ran parallel with that of Jane Eyre's. This realism stems from experiences that Charlotte had in a school that was perilously close to Dickens' school in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY and Jane's school in Lowood. Further, the mistreatment that Jane underwent at Gateshead Hall must have originated from similar such savageries in her early youth. It is a tribute to Charlotte Bronte's realism that she could make her readers feel the pathos and sentimentalism of an outraged childhood.When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a powerful story of struggle and of love. Jane lives a difficult early life, and struggles to find a place just right for her to settle down. She starts out living with an emotionally abusive aunt and cousins who do not understand her. From there she is shipped to boarding school, where she is a student and later becomes a teacher. Here she is always hungry, and living conditions are not the best. Jane then becomes a governess for a little girl in a home called Thornfield Hall. It is here where she begins a somewhat strange and unconventional relationship with the master of her house, Mr. Rochester. The love that develops between them goes against all of the conventions of their time, and is almost lost. The last part of the book is beautiful and well fitting with the rest of the story.Charlotte Bronte uses amazing, flowing language that in itself makes the book terrific.

I chose this book because I was curious to see if it was anything like Wuthering Heights (a book I rather enjoyed) writen by the other Bronte sister.Jane Eyre is a conflicted love story. It follows the life of, surprisingly, a woman named Jane. She lives a harsh childhood, first in the hands of an unloving aunt and her abusive son and then later in the confines of the deteriorating Lowood school. She resides at the school for 8 years and realizes that she wants to experience more of the world outside of the Lowood school. Jane then works as a nanny at a place called Thornfield where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester.This love story is complicated and conflicted in that the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane is forbidden on more than one level.Jane Eyre was much more than I had expected. Although I enjoyed Wuthering Heights, I found Jane Eyre to be much more engaging. At many times, while reading this novel, I found myself completely frustrated yet intrigued and eager to continue at the same time. Bronte evokes such emotion in this novel, from the harsh realities of Jane's childhood to the whirlwind romance between her and her master. I found Mr. Rochester's courtship of Jane to be the most entertaining. I found Jane's confusion and reluctance to be frustrating, yet thought-provoking. And I found the separation of the two to be vexing and upsetting. Ironically, I found the ending to be strange, yet fitting in a story of constant ups and downs. It was an overall great read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I never thought myself the type to write a review for a book, but Jane Eyre presents itself as an exception.

I figured, oh just another boring book. WOW! was I completely mistaken. ALthough long, Jane Eyre could have been 1,000 pages and I still would have read every page, with joy. The growth Jane Eyre, the novels main character and Protagonist, goes through throughout the novel is amazing. Born into an unloving world, with rejection and anger at every corner, Jane is forced to keep herself company and therefore, her only friend is herself. Adopted by her uncle, who soon dies, Jane is forced to live with her aunt Reed. I dont want to summarize about all this stuff, I am going to get down to the nitty-gritty. The novel mainly centers around Jane and her love for Rochester. When Jane becomes eighteen, she is hired to govern at the mansion of Rochesters, and to guide and teach his daughter, Adele. The marvelous love story between Jane and Rochester is as intense as anything you will ever read. At times while reading the novel, I would have to put the novel down and take in what I was reading. The passion and heart exhibited by these two characters was at times unbearable. If you want to read a true novel, full of power and emotion, read Jane Eyre- the best novel ever written. :-)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I chose to read this novel over my spring break and it turned out that reading it was about the only thing I could do. Upon picking up the gargantuan book I was a bit wary of the read, but after reading the first paragraph I was enchanted and further lured on. Bronte did a wonderful - no - fascinating job of creating such a strong, honest, and demanding character as Jane Eyre. Even as an orphaned child, in the care of her abhored aunt Reed, Jane displays such an immense amount of passion and creativity. These characteristics are further refined and blended with a touch of integrity as Jane suffers through the ill-treatment and neglect that she receives at Lowood, a charity school that Mrs. Reed sends her to so to be corrected of her faults. After having spent nearly eight years enduring the ghastly conditions of Lowood, Jane leaves her old life behind so to fill the position of governess at Thornfield Hall. During here stay at the mansion, she is confronted by something she has been completely ignorant of before - love. Her dark and strong, though not handsome, master, Mr. Rochester, causes a hearty seed to implant itself within the unmoving foundation of her soul. This seed of love flourishes and intertwines Jane's emotion's with those of beloved Mr. Rochester. Though love is said to withstand and conquer all, a mysterious and horrifying obstacle challenges the bond that has developed between Jane and Mr.Rochester. As the battle is carried out, Jane's soul and destiny are both tried and tested, thus forming a truly moving and unforgetable novel. Charlotte Bronte's writing is one of intense passion - not just the violent emotion of love, but that of faithfulness and devotion to ones' self and to others. As you travel from page to page of Jane Eyre's life, you will be forced to take into consideration your own character and moral values. Although it was a rather extented read, I do not regret for one moment the time I spent indulging myself in this enticing piece of profound literature. I sincerely believe that all who take on the task of reading this novel will benefit by it in one aspect of their life or another."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I cringe as I read the reviews here that were written by children who were forced to read this in school. I can imagine feeling similarly if I had to trudge through this very long, mature novel with its outdated language and flowery descriptions as a teenager. However, as an adult, I loved the book. I do think it is overly long and could have done without some of the passages that describe the scenery. The best parts of this book are in Jane's elaborate, vivid thoughts and her interactions with the various people she meets. In a book that is less good, I would've taken away a star for the excessive scenic descriptions, but the best things about this book make up for that.Since there are already hundreds of reviews up here that go into what the story is about, I won't bother. What I will say is I am not generally a sentimental nor easily moved person, but I found this story very moving. I don't know if I'd recommend it to many men, and I'd probably not recommend it to anyone under 24. As an adult woman who spends much of her time lost in thought and doesn't always follow the most obvious path, I found it to be an excellent, engaging, and emotional read and am very glad I stuck with it until the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"There are many excellent books written about the human heart, but few writers master the artistry needed to combine both thought and dialog into a free flowing story that, filled with mystery and torment, capture the imagination as does Charlotte Bronte's tale of love and desire struggling upstream against the elements of life station, society's pressure, and mistakes made in youth that never lie in peace no matter how much time passes.Such is the novel Jane Eyre. I knew it was a Classic, and acknowledged it; I had seen several versions of the movies made of it, but did not recall having ever read the book as an adult. Written in 1847, it seemed something to watch on film, but not explore in the written word, as many such novels are difficult to read. Nothing could have been farther from the truth, and I was given an extraordinary literary experience once again by chance. It is particularly interesting given that this book was written by a woman at a time when license was thin; she managed not only to pull it off, but gave up nothing in the process while taking the reader to the smoldering destiny of what she intended to deliver.Jane Eyre is a hauntingly beautiful tale of a plain but highly mature and intelligent girl, shunned and unwanted by her family in her youth, much like the fairy tale of Cinderella. The reason for this travesty is finally delivered in the epilogue, yet it's integral importance yields completely to the unlikely romance that she finds as a result of it.She, frightened and alone but possessed of a courage and confidence that she will somehow prevail against her odds, is arranged a position as a governess for a mysterious, often absent gentleman of means who needs a tutor for his little girl. Upon arriving, she immediately senses there is a sinister intrigue surrounding the big house and it's inhabitants, but is too conscious of her place to be too inquisitive; beyond that, her sense of honor and integrity prevents any covert investigation on her part. But it is a place to flee from on occasion, and one night she leaves to send a letter out in the next town, which is a long walk through a dusky, cold winter's evening. There, on a lonely bridle path, she unwittingly meets the owner of the Estate, Edward Rochester - as he returns homeward, although in no glamorous way to be sure, as he has fallen off his horse and sprained his leg, all within her immediate vision. She come to his aid, helps him to his feet; and the first of the fateful encounters between a world-weary yet vital man and a much younger, guileless, yet very capable woman has come to be.The author waxes splendid in her descriptive paragraphs of the countryside and surroundings; of the morning mist shrouding the walks under the cherry trees in the old gardens surrounding the mansion; of moonlight shining in windows at night adding visuals as if by magic. But that's the periphery; the undercurrent of something else is running dark and deep. There is a secret hidden on the upper story, one that is closely guarded, yet threatens to expose itself continually, with the potential to destroy not only Mr. Rochester himself, but any chance for happiness he may decide to take.Rochester senses something out of the ordinary in the governess he has inherited by chance to educate and care for his child. The flighty little girl is the irritating and very tangible link to his past that brings him continual reminders of his \\"error\\" - yet has somehow been the vessel that brings about his emotional emancipation - through the hiring of Jane. And as Jane becomes acquainted with her benefactor, she realizes that despite his eccentricities, he is above other men in many, many ways, for even in her protected environment she has noticed his encouragement of equality for her; encouragement to speak her mind and reveal her thoughts to him. She is reluctant to do so, because she is wary of the differences in station between them, and realizes he has ultimate and enduring power over her. He cleverly attempts to seek out and determine ahead of time each of his moves toward his desires so that he may emerge to the next level unscathed.The idea flow is exquisite; articulate without a misstep anywhere in connecting her intricate plot with the characters and the moments that filter unerringly down to create the mood and the sensuality between the two unlikely lovers that are caught up in the vortex. The night the Gypsy arrives unbidden to the big house is a perfect example.The scene Jane endures with the \\"gypsy\\" in the parlor is truly one of a kind; I don't believe I have ever read anything quite it's equal for astonishing originality. The depth of emotional insight, passion, and fear of rejection and/or discovery is intensely woven into this particular part of the story in an unforgettable exchange of dialog and mental dueling; a subtle, ingenious breaking of barriers, of discovery without risk.Turn charlotte Bronte loose with word software on a computer with the literary license of today and one can't help but wonder just what form it would have taken. For certain though, it could not have been more masterfully written than was the \\"original.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've seen meritorious film adaptations of JANE EYRE but never got around to actually reading the book until now. What I found was a strong-willed story that moves like a high-speed freight-train even in some long-winded passages. In the tradition of the best 19th century English fiction, the book possesses a sharp social eye, tinkers with narrative technique for great effect, endows settings with a character all their own, and deploys verbal and dramatic irony with abandon. It tells a whopper of a romance between two extraordinary people from the perspective of the title character, who survives every kind of hardship life has to throw her way but who never loses herself, even when she falls for Mr. Wrong-and-Right-at-the-same-time.This book must have knocked the socks off early Victorian England. Our heroine goes to great lengths to establish that she and Mr. Wrong/Right do not conform to the beauty standards of their world, and yet they are most attractive characters. Jane insists on being the captain of her fate, no subserviance to men, not even the one she loves. Mr. Wrong/Right who is no angel is still sympathetic. Probably the most startling theme Bronte sounds countermands her generation's zeigeist: don't marry for money, security and respectability, go for the soulmate no matter the cost. This is pretty bold stuff for the daughter of a clergyman.I won't get into the plot because the danger of spoilers lies in every twist. I will say that one of its climatic points bequeathed me a nightmare, such is the writer's spell. The film adaptations by their very nature cannot convey the written voice and by necessity they must conflate some characters and events to accommodate the flow of action. Watch the Orson Welles or the recent PBS version, both of which are nifty, but don't substitute them for the book, especially if you have to write a book report or pass a test on it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"First I've read this amazing story.

This is a great story of a young woman that overcomes obstacles and challenges and rises triumphant in the end.

How many of them do you actually remember? Well, if Jane Eyre was one of those long-forgotten books, pick up a copy. To read it as an adult is a joy: it's a sweeping, disturbing, intense, thrilling, very romantic gothic love story, written in the voice of a very intense, almost claustrophobically self-aware young heroine. Jane is no Ophelia - she's a complicated, remarkable character, and a very strong female character in a genre that usually draws women as beautiful victims at best.There's something for everyone in this book: Windswept castles, difficult and neurotic family members, dark secrets about tragic former lovers, good triumphing over evil, all that good juicy stuff that makes a great romantic story. What elevates Jane Eyre is Bronte's remarkable style & skill and her sharp and complex characterizations.Trust me on this: If you don't remember it from your teens, you should give it a try now. Here is one novel that more than lives up to it's 'classic' status."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read \\"Jane Eyre\\" in eighth grade and have read it every few years since. It is one of my favorite novels, and so much more than a gothic romance to me, although that's how I probably would have defined it at age 13. I have always been struck, haunted in a way, by the characters - Jane and Mr. Rochester. They take on new depth every time I meet them...and their's is a love story for the ages.Charlotte Bronte's first published novel, and her most noted work, is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story. Jane is plain, poor, alone and unprotected, but due to her fierce independence and strong will she grows and is able to defy society's expectations of her. This is definitely feminist literature, published in 1847, way before the beginning of any feminist movement. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the novel has had such a wide following since it first came on the market. It is also one of the first gothic romances published and defines the genre.Jane Eyre, who is our narrator, was born into a poor family. Her parents died when she was a small child and the little girl was sent to live with her Uncle and Aunt Reed at Gateshead. Jane's Uncle truly cared for her and showed his affection openly, but Mrs. Reed seemed to hate the orphan, and neglected her while she pampered and spoiled her own children. This unfair treatment emphasized Jane's status as an unwanted outsider. She was often punished harshly. On one occasion her nasty cousin Jack picked a fight with her. Jane tried to defend herself and was locked in the terrifying \\"Red Room\\" as a result. Jane's Uncle Reed had died in this room a little while before, and Mrs. Reed knew how frightened she was of the chamber. Since Jane is the narrator, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the child's feelings, her heightened emotional state at being imprisoned. Indeed, she seems almost like an hysterical child, filled with terror and rage. She repeatedly calls her condition in life \\"unjust\\" and is filled with bitterness. Looking into the mirror Jane sees a distorted image of herself. She views her reflection and sees a \\"strange little figure,\\" or \\"tiny phantom.\\" Jane has not learned yet to subordinate her passions to her reason. Her passions still erupt unchecked. Her isolation in the Red Room is a presentiment of her later isolation from almost every society and community. This powerful, beautifully written scene never fails to move me.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane away to the Lowood School, a poor institution run by Mr. Brocklehurst, who believed that suffering made grand people. All the children there were neglected, except to receive harsh punishment when any mistake was made. At Lowood, Jane met Helen Burns, a young woman a little older than Jane, who guided her with vision, light and love for the rest of her life. Jane's need for love was so great. It really becomes obvious in this first friendship. Helen later died from fever, in Jane's arms. Her illness and death could have been avoided if more attention had been paid to the youths. Jane stayed at Lowood for ten years, eight as a student and two as a teacher. Tired and depressed by her surroundings, Jane applied for the position of governess and found employment at Thornfield. The mansion is owned by a gentleman named Edward Fairfax Rochester. Her job there was to teach his ward, an adorable little French girl, Adele. Over a long period the moody, inscrutable Rochester confides in Jane and she in him. The two form an unlikely friendship and eventually fall in love. Again, Jane's need for love comes to the fore, as does her passionate nature. She blooms. A dark, gothic figure, Rochester also has a heart filled with the hope of true love and future happiness with Jane. Ironically, he has brought all his misery, past and future, on himself.All is not as it seems at Thornfield. There is a strange, ominous woman servant, Grace Poole, who lives and works in an attic room. She keeps to herself and is rarely seen. From the first, however, Jane has sensed bizarre happenings at night, when everyone is asleep .There are wild cries along with violent attempts on Rochester's life by a seemingly unknown person. Jane wonders why no one investigates Mrs. Poole. Then a strange man visits Thornfield and mysteriously disappears with Mr. Rochester. Late that night Jane is asked to sit with the man while the lord of the house seeks a doctor's help. The man has been seriously wounded and is weak from loss of blood. He leaves by coach, in a sorry state, first thing in the morning. Jane's questions are not answered directly. This visit will have dire consequences on all involved. An explosive secret revealed will destroy all the joyful plans that Jane and Rochester have made. Jane, once more will face poverty and isolation.Charlotte Bronte's heroine Jane Eyre, may not have been graced with beauty or money, but she had a spirit of fire and was filled with integrity and a sense of independence - character traits that never waned in spite of all the oppression she encountered in life. Ms. Bronte brings to the fore in \\"Jane Eyre\\" such issues as: the relations between men and women in the mid-19 century, women's equality, the treatment of children and of women, religious faith and hypocrisy (and the difference between the two), the realization of selfhood, and the nature of love and passion. This is a powerhouse of a novel filled with romance, mystery and passions. It is at once startlingly fresh and a portrait of the times. Ms. Bronte will make your heart beat faster, your pulse race and your eyes fill with tears. The Best!!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is about as unprepossessing a heroine as one could hope to find. Not only is she an orphan, she's extremely plain, her manners are stilted, and her relatives hate and bully her. Jane's one chance at freedom is the charity school her aunt sends her to. After buckling down, she finally manages to scrape up enough accomplishments to take on a position as a governess. What she finds as governess, though, is a mysterious manor and its even more mysterious owner, Mr. Rochester, who takes a strange fancy to her. Will Jane find love at last? Or will the secrets she reveals destroy all hope of happiness?\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the most well known gothic romance classics, and for good reason. This book enchanted me as a teenager and introduced me to the genre as a whole. A must-read for anyone who likes romance or mysteries. Bella and Edward are pale shadows of Jane and Mr. Rochester."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Don't get me wrong, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"There is so much to be said for this novel that it's difficult to know where to begin. It is a superb evocation of a time and place; it is a complex, detailed character study; it has a believable and compelling plot; and, more than anything else, it is a magnificent love story.Of course, love stories are the common denominator of human existence and have been the subject of literature since mankind first put charcoal to rock, so the fact that Jane Eyre is a love story is nothing terribly significant. No, what makes this novel so special is the thoughtfulness with which its narrator, Jane Eyre herself, documents her love affair. She is extremely intelligent, she carefully analyzes her feelings and actions, and she is scrupulously honest with both herself and her reader. This is what sets it apart: it is the depth of these thoughts and feelings that make the novel interesting. Beyond that, though, it is the character of Jane, slowly revealed, that makes the novel a delight.The plot is Jane's story. Orphaned, she is sent to live with her cruel aunt and cousins. At the age of ten she is sent away for good to a charity school, at which she gets her education, but which is run in such a miserly fashion that many of the students there actually die of disease and starvation. Jane survives, and at the age of eighteen, is able to secure a position as a governess to a child in a great house of England: Thornfield Hall. It is owned by Edward Rochester, the man who will become the centerpiece of her life.How the two begin to slowly realize their affection for one another, how they then cautiously begin to act on their feelings, and how they must then surmount the obstacles in their path--both societal and self-inflicted--are what make up the bulk of the novel. There are at least a few surprises along the way. The strong-willed Jane's moral code requires that she respond to these difficulties in certain ways. It is to the novel's and the author's great credit that these decisions are never simply made; Jane agonizes over them in heart-wrenching fashion. As in life, the standards one chooses to live by can be difficult to maintain.This defining tension is what drives the novel, but that it is delivered in such a skillful and assured way is what raises it to its lofty status. The dialogue, particularly, is fantastic. It is the stuff of an actor's dream: much of it can be interpreted in several different ways. Jane describes Rochester as being moody and tempestuous, and he often is, but at the same time--particularly after Jane agrees to marry him--he is hilariously wry and bemused. Jane comes across as being earnest and pleading, but she can be very playful and is often flirtatious. As mentioned above, these are deep, achingly human characters.The setting is also very evocative. The English countryside, class system and moral understanding were obviously familiar to those who read the book in Ms. Bronte's day, and probably familiar to many of us in this day and age. Nevertheless, Ms. Bronte took the time to document these things carefully. The descriptions of Rochester's home, the lanes in front if it and its orchards and fields; the destitute and grimly cold school for girls; and the small country town where Jane makes the acquaintance of a small group of benefactors towards the end of the novel are all a testament to life as it existed at this distant time and age.The novel is looked upon as a classic and should be. Ms. Bronte not only created a beautiful piece having to do with the nature of love--personal to her but universal in nature--but did so in such a spectacular way that she actually makes the reader feel this love, both for her creation, and for her."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This turned out to be an exceptional book though I didn't think so in the beginning. By what seems the hundredth page, I had decided it was a feminine version of David Copperfield but not as interesting. By the hundred and fiftieth page, I was completely discouraged and was sure it had turned into the very romantic mush I detest (a lot of what she feels about him and what he feels about her, and so on). Somewhere soon after that, I fell in and was absorbed. It became a tremendously good book with a fantastic plot and a good pace. I read for hours and hours at a sitting enjoying every single minute of it and only stopped when something absolutely forced me. Excellent, excellent!Jane Eyre is an orphaned child under the guardianship of her maternal aunt. Not liked by her aunt and not able to get along with her cousins, Jane is sent to Lowood School for the children of the poor (it is a charity school) to be taught the fundamentals and, more importantly, to be conditioned for a life of poor expectations. Lowood changes the strong willed, impetuous Jane into a woman of uncommon restraint. When she accepts a post as governess to Adele at Thornfield Hall, she attracts the attention of Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who has the desire to reclaim himself from a sordid past. He comes to believe that Jane has the power to transform him and help him to realize himself in the better light that he has not heretofore been able to achieve on his own. But his secrets are not far away and peculiar events at Thornfield make the reader question his advances. Sworn not to ask about who or what is in the room on the third floor, Jane's iron resolve begins to falter with the dreamlike romance and the reader begins to trepiditiously hope for her happiness. When Mr. Rochester is unable to keep his past under wraps, however, Jane is forced onto a path that will require all of her internal resources to survive but will ultimately put her in the position to make choices for herself rather than just choose among available options. The question is, with her conditioning, can she lead with her heart instead of her head?My only legitimate greivance, and given only in the vein of humour, is that is seems like Jane would have taught Adele some English. The child speaks only in French and myself not being able to read French, I did not understand anything the child ever said. Luckily, her exuberance and intent still comes through and the reader can develop a softness for the child without understanding her dialogue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I will agree that this performance is given with sensitivity to the voice of Jane Eyre and of Charlotte Bronte, but alas it's an abridged version. The above listing does not give any indication of this, consequently I was very disappointed when it arrived. I personally have no use for abridged books. When I pick up a book (print or audio) I want to experience the entire book. Abridged books always leave me feeling cheated, wondering what did I miss?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was ten and reread it every decade as a special treat to myself. It is one of the great classics of English literature. It is, essentially, a Cinderella story, and I STRONGLY recommend it as an andidote to the Woman-Hear-Me-Roar (or is it &quot;Girl Power&quot;?) stuff being pushed on young ladies nowadays as a means to making the sex strong. The story begins when the heroine, Jane Eyre, is a young orphan of about nine, and follows her through school and her career as a governess in a wealthy but mysterious man's home. She falls in love, learns of an impediment to her immediate gratification, does the right thing and suffers for her pains, but in the end is rewarded for her suffering. Very irrelevant to the late twentieth century, obviously. Charlotte Bronte (the author) is frquently encountered around the same time in life one encounters Dickens--youth--but, like Dickens, she most definitely wrote for adults. Therefore, the book is probably a difficult read for all but the most tenacious middle schooler, but as it begins from the very real, very painful point of view of a powerless child, it has a good hook to draw in the young reader. Its literary style is Romantic, with the liberal use of semi-colons, inverted sentences, and detailed descriptions. This book is a MUST for all well-educated young ladies--the next step after Little Women and before the Jane Austen novels. And sorry for the gender stereotyping; I'm sure there are boys and men out there who read this book and loved it, but I never met one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I recently saw a preview for a Jane Eyre movie soon to come out... and after having just gotten a Kindle, I thought I would read the book before I see the movie. A wonderful bonus... when I went to download it, it was free!Don't let the title of my review discourage you from reading it... This is a wonderful story--- more about overcoming horrible tribulations and finding peace and love through perseverance.The first page or two kind of threw me, as this novel was written in the mid 1800's. I was worried the language would make it too difficult to comprehend, but I was wrong. By the third page I was hooked, and hardly put it down the next 3 days until I finished it. This book grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go, even after you've finished it. It is definitely one of those novels that leaves you wanting more of these people. It is so well written, you feel submersed into their world-- and can picture every detail with great clarity, and feel every emotion.My only regret with this book is that I never read it till now.

Peters on Jane's otherness etc(Which I found listed in the table of contents on bn.com). The extras and the nice cover were my only reasons for buying it, seeing as I already own a copy of the Barnes & Noble classics version of the book.Now to my surprise and disappointment all the extras that I looked forward to reading seemed to be jam packed into two pages and not really all that interesting.But there is hope,if you buy the ebook version you get a copy of the screenplay by Moira Buffini(Which is why it gets 4 stars).

However, I started it again a few days ago and completely fell in love. I love the prose, the plot, everything. I just can't keep myself away from it. Bronte's writing style is so poetic and beautiful that the story itself could be absolute trash and I would still love this book.Thankfully, though, the novel is not a load of tosh and the story itself is engaging beyond belief. Jane is left with her uncle's wife when he forces her to care for her when he dies. She's cared for about like Harry is at the Dursleys and escapes to school. Unfortunately for Jane, Hogwarts does not await her, but a rather dreary school. She remains here for 8 years, first as a pupil, then a teacher. She later gains employment for a gentleman who pays her twice her wages at Lowood and there she meets the love of her life. Unfortunate events prevent them from marrying and she continues to seek a happy place and make her way. I won't give away more.If you like Austen you will love this book. It's got the characterization and insight of Austen's books with the adventure of a more modern novel.

Jane Eyre, who is shunted around due to her &#34;unladylike&#34; intelligence and strong sense of self, discovers love with her employer-the strange and moody Mr. Rochester. He is hiding a secret though, and it will threaten Jane's chance of happiness. Unlike many &#34;love&#34; stories from past and present however, Jane uses her inner-strength to succeed on her own, and sets the example for future &#34;strong women&#34; stories that have developed since this groundbreaking novel was written.The wordy descriptions and redundancy of some of the writing clearly dates this novel as a &#34;classic&#34; but do not let that scare you from reading. Having read this more than once, I like to skim much of it, including descriptions of her early years at the school Jane is sent to, for standing up for herself at the home she were she grew up. The descriptions DO set the mood for everything, but are still overly-wordy, which was the norm for this period of writing. One exception to this, is the novel &#34;Ivanhoe,&#34; set during the time of Robin Hood and written during the time of Queen Victoria's birth. Otherwise, as with the Bronte's works, you will deal with a lot of seemingly-useless descriptive paragraphs. AGain, it does set the mood though, and the writing itself is beautiful, even if it doesn't always forward the purpose of the story.This story is haunting, much like &#34;Wuthering Heights&#34; but I prefer &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; any day for the sheer strength of the heroine, and the surprisingly moving passion of the star-crossed lovers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A good classic.

It never ceases to amaze how great the classics are."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, you are drawn into a personal narrative that from the start is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Many things have been written about Jane Eyre as a character, but to me there is no doubt that her intense character compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imaginging it).The 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain circumscribed roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). With Jane, you have a particular set of codes of behaviour that are radically established and are uncompromising about the male-dominated status quo: to cope with all circumstances without significant protest; not to give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; to speak up in situations involving the most appalling difficulties, when it matters; don't give in to compromise that will drag your own personality down to nothingness; ultimately, remain true to yourself. Such coda are radical not only in 19th century literature, but all literature before.Jane Eyre is a revolution in thinking and morality as far as male and female relationships are concerned. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking.Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I loved this book so much, I have started everyone I know reading it!!

The book came in wonderful condition (considering its age). Could not be happier with this purchase!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Although classics are largely respected books for their ability to withstand the test of time, in most cases, these classics often seem overly erudite for most students. JANE EYRE seemed to, at first, embody the rather intimidating characteristics of a classic, but I later learned that it was my lack of experience, not my lack of old-English proficiency that hindered my true respect and understanding for the novel.Compared to other classics, such as the novels of Charles Dickinson, JANE EYRE presents itself in a more approachable style of writing. This helps readers of many different English proficiency levels be able to understand Jane Eyre's tragic events and unusual acquaintances.Despite the fact that many can grasp the literal meaning of the story, it takes a lot more experience and wisdom to be able to fully understand the underlying messages. Some themes that were hidden were the limitations of women in society and the conflict that people have to accept themselves.JANE EYRE, quite truthfully, was a rather slow and sometimes dull read for me. Although my first read was disappointing, I'm sure that I will be able to learn more from the novel when reading it in the future when I encountered different events and experiences. This unending learning that can be earned from reading classics is probably what justifies their endurance through continuous changes in culture and language. I highly encourage readers to read JANE EYRE periodically throughout their life because a new side of this book will be revealed every time it is read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"For me, the book was a little slow getting started.

However, although the pace in this book certainly does slow down at times, it is usually fast. And exciting. With a touch of suspense.

Prepare yourself to go slowly at first to absorb the heroic character of Jane Eyre as she survives the not-to-be-gotten-around class system of 19th C England. By today's standards, she is not only fiercely independent and incredibly intelligent; she is morally superior. Suspense builds and delivers even if you have seen the movie. What a love story!

Indeed, it probably would not have challenged her!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Because people who don't like this book are stupid poopheads. It's just that simple.

Actually, I wrote it several months ago. However, I found one review that disturbed me. The reviewer said, and I quote, &quot;Thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionbale female readers.&quot;Okay, now here is my opinion on that statement. I have read Jane Austen and I absolutely adore all of her novels (Mansfield Park I cannot speak for, I have never read it.) However, I find that her heroines are not to be admired. Take for instance, Anne Elliot in Persuasion who spends 8 years in a state of depression and makes her self ugly because she made a mistake. Or Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, who is much to prejudiced to even hear Mr. Darcy's side of the story. And don't forget Catherine Morland in Northanger Abbey who almost scares herself to death romantizing every little detail in an old house just because she has read too much. Then there is Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility who is so concerned with dying for love that she can't see that the man of her dreams is right in front of her face and she falls in love with some jerk. And last, but not least, Elinor Dashwood, Marianne's elder sister, who closes up her emotions inside and because of that eventually snaps. Jane Eyre, on the other hand is a heroine to be admired, for she shows us all that even in the worst situations of life (which she experienced) you can still be strong. Jane Austen's characters may live the fairytale &quot;happily ever after&quot; life, but they do not prove as strong as Jane Eyre in the least."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is my absolute favorite book! WARNING:it starts out slow, but stay with it and you will find this to be an excellent book. If you like classics and romance (clean romance) this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I think Jane Eyre is a wonderful book because of its characters. The book shows great love between two different people."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have previously reviewed Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair and stated that although I had never read Jane Eyre, I enjoyed Fforde's take on it. I had also prided myself on never having read recreationally anything that could be considered literature that wasn't required for school. I started Jane Eyre with the attitude that I'll read it until I get bored, then stop. I didn't get bored. Charlotte Bronte created a masterpiece that kept me enthralled from start to finish. There was crime, passion, mystery and women's rights rolled into one effort. For the era in which it was written, Jane Eyre was an amazing book showing a woman of intelligence and strong character. Now I have to reread The Eyre Affair to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I had never seen any of the movies before I read the book, but I wanted to see what all the fuss was about since the newestJane Eyre [Blu-ray] came out.Jane Eyrehas now become one of my favorite novels. It's great literature, written very beautifully and in which every sentence, every chapter is important to the events in the book. When Jane Eyre begins telling the reader her story, you're immediately drawn in. The book wasn't that difficult for me to read--I occasionally had to look up some words on my Kindle's built in dictionary and I know absolutely no French (some characters speak sentences/words in French, but it's very minor), however this didn't take away from the beauty of the book at all.The whole romance between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester is amazing. It's definitely not trashy...it's classy and sophisticated...it's romantic.Charlotte Bronte evens manages to weave in a deep mystery at Thornfield Hall, done VERY successfully. I love mysteries and I had my own hypothesis of \\"who-done-it\\" and why, and was WRONG. I love that.I don't want to give anything away, if you're a new reader like I was. The movies do not even compare to the book (I went to compare as soon as I finished the book); the book is so much better, it's a delicious classic to read. I was very sad to finally put the book down when I was finished. Jane Eyre is a must read, and definitely a re-read. One of my top favorite books now.For Kindle readers: There are little to no errors in the Kindle Edition ofJane Eyre. Reading on the kindle definitely took out the anxiety factor of reading a thick book. No TOC. The only thing that slightly bothered me was instead of having the whole name of a city/town/county that ended in \\"shire\\" it was presented as \\"---shire\\". But not a huge dealbreaker considering it's free. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be presented or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have to say I am truly surprised. This is the third time I've read Jane Eyre, and yet the first time I've found anything positive about the experience. I read it once as an 11/12 year old because my mother bought me a lovely red leather-bound edition (apparently she loved the book and thought I would too). I hated it- too hard to read, too much philosophical rambling, no action, annoying heroine, etc. I read it for the second time as a freshman in high school because it was required. I no longer found it hard to read, but I still found Jane annoying and unsympathetic, and I still hated the book.Fast forward to this year and my decision to revisit the classics, including giving Jane Eyre one last try before forever consigning it to the \\"I just don't understand how people can like this book\\" pile. All I can say is thank goodness I gave it that one last try because the book is a masterpiece. All the philosophical rambling that bored me before is now a central element to the text, superior in many way to the storyline itself. I see now that there is a lot of action for a book of its time, and Jane is certainly not annoying so much as she is inspirational. I mean, she is still a bit pious for my taste, but even so she rebels strongly against the conventions of her time to try to live a life that she finds both emotionally and spiritually satisfying.All of the things that annoyed me when I read this book as a child are the elements that resonate most strongly with me as an adult. I read this book too early, and was too dismissive of it at the time. Like with Anna Karenina, I saw everything in black and white with the merciless clarity of a teenager; I now understand how wonderfully shaded with grey life (and good literature) often is. If you haven't read Jane Eyre since high school, I highly recommend giving it another try- definitely a 5 star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I remember that I read Jane Eyre back in high school... This time, it was completely different!! I can only guess that, as a teen, I was impatient for action, and skipped over large parts, not taking the time to truly read the book.This is a very absorbing tale! Yes, it is clear that it was written from a very non-modern outlook, and that it is not completely timeless. However, it is also clear just how different this character is from the norms of her time. The characters and their personalities are clearly drawn, and it is easy to see that they broke the mold then, and that they still break the mold now.I ended up re-reading the book immediately after finishing it.

I have read this book during all different phases of my life and I find that through every reading I am completely affected with the story even though I know exactly what is going to happen.The premise of the book everyone knows, our story is about the life of Jane Eyre through her childhood living at the home of her aunt who doesn't love or want to keep her to her adult years as governesses for the ward of Mr. Rochester of Thornfield Hall. Jane develops a relationship with her employer that soon blossoms into a fierce love but Mr. Rochester has a secret that he is keeping from Jane that threatens to rip everything apart leaving Jane utterly homeless and alone.This book has been talked about time and time again and I think one of the main reasons it stands the testament of time is that Charlotte Bronte creates a heroine who is so easy to sympathize with and Jane's connections with her audience is felt throughout the entire book and begins on the first page. This to me is the best thing about the book because we know exactly how Jane thinks, and feels and we come to love and adore her for her plainness, intelligence, and spirit. Of course it also helps that our hero Mr. Rochester is so attractive with his brooding, temperamental personality but he is one of my favorite male characters in all of literature because he is so developed I can picture him perfectly in my mind. Every young woman dreams of meeting their Mr. Rochester because he loves Jane with a passion that is hard to believe could exist. So I highly recommend reading this novel because I think it deserves all of the attention it gets. Charlotte Bronte is a master storyteller and uses such elements of horror to create a timeless gothic romance novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Though it took me a while to find the time to read this lengthy tome, I am so glad I did, because I absolutely adore this novel. I loved the story, the characters, the blend of romance, mystery, and gothic elements--in short, I loved everything about it!The story is a fictional memoir, which narrates the life of Jane Eyre from the age of 10 to about age 19. We follow Jane from her miserable childhood living with an aunt and three cousins to her sojourn in a charitable boarding school for girls, and then to her station as a governess (at age 18) in the country estate of Mr. Rochester. I will not spoil any of the plot twists (if you don't already know them), for there are several and they make the story truly compelling. Jane herself is an immensely likeable protagonist, right from the start. Even at the tender age of 10, she is full of spirited passion, which makes her real and believable. She grows up before her reader's very eyes, and for me, it was a pleasure to watch her development as a person and character.It has been a long while since a \\"classic\\" work has so absorbed my attentions and thoughts. Once I found the time to read it, I raced to reach the book's conclusion, and then I was sad when I finished the final page--which to me is always the mark of a truly great book! I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Jane Eyre\\" to any lover of literature, and to any and all romantic souls...it (and Jane) will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Hands down one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read, I mean this book is somewhere in my Top 3 and I've read a lot of books. At first glance, some people might think this is a cheesy love story, but it's not. It is very much a love story but actually a REALLY GOOD one!! I love the main character Jane Eyre and how she's able to be humble and respectful, at the same time growing in the story and speaking her mind when she needs to, standing up for herself. The story flows soooo well and takes you on a journey that is brave, devastating and beautiful all at the same time.Charlotte Bronte, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't written too many novels, but she didn't even need to. This book stands on its own and I can call her one of my favorite writers of all time, solely based off this one book. Just incredible stuff all around, incredible writing, story, description, imagery - this book has everything you want from a piece of literature. Please get it and you'll be thrilled you did! I can guarantee this book will become one of your favorites of all time :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the great gothic romance classics of all time. This novel was written and published in the 1840's, well before women were conceived to be \\"gifted\\" enough to command an audience. In fact, all the Bronte sisters published under male pseundoyms (Currier Bell, Acton Bell, etc.) in order to be considered serious writers.This novel is a story about enduring character and its ability to strive for the unattainable and inconceivable. A poor orphan raised by an aunt and uncle, Jane is schooled in a loveless environment of neglect. She graduates from this dreary environment and is hired by Rochester to tutor his ward, Adele.The employer-employee relationship between Rochester and Jane grows into a solid friendship. From there, it graduates to love. Unfortunately, there is a shadow over this relationship that precludes a happy ending and Rochester's past comes to haunt him. Fortunately, Jane's strength and enduring character help Rochester surmount his painful past. Her love nurtures Rochester in his darkest hours.This book has continued to be one of my favorites over the years. The Kindle version is free, so if anyone is looking for an excellent book to add to their Kindle collection, I heartily recommend this."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was orphaned at an age where she didn't remember her parents and was raised by a real she-wolf of a mean aunt. She is sent away to a very strict school which sad to say, was an improvement on her aunt's residence. Read this book while dieting, you will appreciate the small portions you have consumed when Jane is grateful for having a whole slice of bread to herself.Jane does not lead an easy life, yet grows to be a charming, well educated, unassuming woman. Karma repays her for her lack of privilege growing up. This drama is incredibly entertaining, easy to read, a little predictable ... but not entirely. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a true classic. The romance in this story is spellbinding. Jane is an amazing woman of courage and honor. Her story is a must read for classical romance lovers!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A cherished classic. It is said thatwhen women are in distress,theyturn to Jane Austen. The same can besaid of Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have always loved Jane Eyre. I read it about 10 times when I was in high school. It is a good book, especially for those who like love stories."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I bought this as a gift for my mother. The clssics have always been in our house but all of her's are worn paperbacks, that are probably over 20 years old. So when I stumbled across these beautifully covered books I was so excited. I wanted to buy all of them and I hope they aren't a limited edition, because I would build a library of classics with these. The book comes with a built in bookmark and the cover is a perfect fit for this beautiful story!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I always heard of this book but never read it. When I saw the 2011 Jane Eyre with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, I had to read the book because I was hooked.Charlotte Bronte has such talent for words. She brings you to Jane's life, her experiences, her thoughts, her feelings with such clarity that you feel like you are actually there. The narrative proceeds with great pace, just right, not too slow nor too fast. She'll take you to those great houses....those \\" Halls \\" ... Manor ....those big beautiful homes we see only in travel books.... But she has put life in them. So we see what it is like to actually live there. And what a \\" life\\" she has put in those houses!Charlotte narrated a life that is so full of passion! Among others.....grief from death, isolation,, fear, courage, sympathy, faith in the goodness of others, and Love! Mr. Rochester is a very attractive character...full of life.The dynamic between a young 18 year old girl and a 38 year old man is realistic enough. The young inexperienced girl had to earn \\"life out there in the real world\\" before she can actually be on the same level , (somehow) as Mr. Rochester. This is not the typical beautiful underdog being saved by a handsome powerful man. It is more about 2 people completing each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have read this book a number of times and am always intrigued by the plot. This is also a vocabulary-building book if you enjoy learning new words."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Even I find it a little hard to believe that I only just now read this classic, and specifically because it was for book club. Even more surprising is that after all this time, I was unaware of how the book ended, so the entire conclusion was unspoiled for me. I am not a huge fan of literature from this period, although I could appreciate the gothic atmosphere and the very puritanical British-ness. Jane is a profound character and it's no wonder she is a favorite literary figure. Her determination is inspiring and I very much enjoyed witnessing her evolution. I don't think I can say much more about this most fundamental novel, other than it was so much better than I expected."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre 5 times, I learn more and more things. I've noticed new things about ST. JOhn Rivers, Mr. Brocklehurst, etc.I'd highly recommend it for people of whatever interest: romantic-types, looking-for-meaning-in-life types, intersting books, etc.Actually, I became Christian after reading that book. While all the people associated with Christianity are shown in a negative light, Jane's search for freedom and willingness to forego comfort for truth inspired me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is an age-old book that remains a favourite. There is language and an intriguing plot so the reader is left captivated from beginning to end. Worth a read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I defy anyone to read this book without always being one step ahead. Despite being well written I found it altogether too difficult to relate to the characters, or to get truly engrossed in the plot. Overrated."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is such a great book. It is long (by today's standards) but there is such real feeling and flowing language. It's easy to get lost in this book. I both want to finish it so I know the ending, and have it go on longer, because it was such an engrossing read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Read it for school. It was alright for a gothic novel and better than others I've had to read like Rebecca."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Never did read the book as I love the movie, decided to give it a shot. Got the kindle for my android phone (free) and when I am waiting, it is a nice read without having to carry along a book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Excited to start reading it on my tablet. Ordered it and was easy to do on my new tablet. Thanks"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Even though it's not Pride and Prejudice, it's always good to read a classic. At least she gets the guy in the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Catching up on the classics and love this on my Kindle - allows me to read at my pace. No late fee to the library."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was slow at the start for me personally, but I grew engrossed in Jane's adventures and devoured the book earnestly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Good story. Difficult to read this wordy book. Old use of wording (some not even in the dictionary) make it at times trying to understand."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'm glad to have the book on time. And the cover of the book is the same as listed. This was for our kids so it's nice to have cheap and good book for many of our kids who will be using this book for their school."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first listened to this audio version of Jane Eyre -- one of my all-time favorite books -- by checking it out from the library. I liked it so much that I wanted a copy of it for my permanent collection, and was very pleased to find it for sale on Amazon. Susan Erickson's superb narration does what so few readers are able to do -- make a wonderful classic even better. This is one that I will doubtless listen to again and again, whenever I am in the mood to immerse myself in this beautiful story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I do most of my shopping on amazon and this is a great book to read and a beautiful color on the outside of the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Had to read this book for lit class..for me it was too much information..it talks about all of her life(child-adult) in too much detail..okay yes her stay with her aunt and her time at school was important but goodness get on with the story..a summary of that time would've been nice..the book is still good and this is a good copy to get"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!

And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.This particular edition is illustrated by Dame Darcy (who looks pretty interesting if the back cover is any indicator), and it's definitely a good supplement to the book -- dark, a little creepy, yet also vaguely quirky in a childlike way.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie.

Yet Jane Eyre transcends the thrilling parts of the book to become one of English's greatest novels.The novel is not without weakness; the entire St. John section is a bit overdramatic and somewhat contrived; yet it is essential to the novel not only for the symmetry but also to contrast a life that would only satisfy the flesh and sacrifice the soul (Mr. Rochester's proposal) versus a life sacrificing the flesh entirely for the sake of the soul (St. John.) Jane Eyre never falters from her conviction that, to be whole and true to oneself, both the spiritual and the carnal sides must be fulfilled. This was a daring proposal in Victorian England, and Jane Eyre was labeled \\"coarse\\" by one critic. Even more daring was that this philosophy was espoused by a woman writer, which is why Charlotte Bronte wrote the book under a gender-neutral pseudonym (Currer Bell.)Why should you read this classic? Initially, Jane Eyre can be enjoyed for its well-told and enjoyable story--very romantic and exciting. What makes Jane Eyre an enduring classic is that you can read it and re-read it many times over for the perfection of its structure. I have a hard time choosing between Jane Eyre and Eliot's Middlemarch as \\"best English novel.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is as perfect as a book can be. It's the wonderful, multi-layered story of a poor orphan who falls in love with a man of the British upper class.Jane Eyre is a fully-fleshed out character who is, in many ways, more modern than her nineteenth century counterparts. She is definitely a character to &quot;fall in love with&quot; and one that is truly unforgettable.Although some of the events in Jane Eyre are more than a little far-fetched, the plot is so enjoyable we can easily forgive Bronte a few minor faults. The pages simply fly by as we want to learn more about Jane and Mr. Rochester and their ultimate fate, both together and apart.Jane Eyre is a classic in every sense of the word and extraordinarily enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"but definitely for the more educated. If you don't appreciate literature, I would say...don't read it, you won't like it. I love it...it is my favourite book of all time, hands down, but from what I have read and heard from others, it seems that the a person merely looking for a feministic book, or something easy to read that dosn't take much intellect, would not like it at all. As far as the content.... Charlotte Bronte had such a grasp of the wonderful pathos that love can fill a person with, it's incredible. The characters are well-portrayed, and you really get to know Jane and Mr. Rochester, which is more I can say than many works of it's day. I would say that Jane Eyre is one of the ultimate triuphs of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The search for freedom is a common underlying theme that can be found in many novels. Charlotte Bronte really emphasized this theme in Jane Eyre. This novel illustrates the path a strong young woman takes in her search for contentment. As she travels from place to place it becomes obvious that she is seeking a true home. The repetition of bird motifs throughout the novel is a device that accentuates the theme of freedom. In paying close attention to these motifs one can see that Jane is actually equated with a bird. Like a bird Jane Eyre is constantly in flight in search of her dreams. Her \\"spirit followed on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to and ideal Heaven\\" (333). The comparison of Jane to a bird, when understood, is very important to the overall meaning of the novel. At the time Charlotte Bronte wrote the novel her ideas were pretty radical, considering that it was unheard of for a woman to be independent and free willed, which are the key aspects of Jane Eyre's character. The romanticism and feminism of this novel is inspirational. I strongly recommend Jane Eyre to any woman who is not afraid to follow her own dreams."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As an orphan, Jane has no money and no one to care for her. After enduring hardships with an aunt who doesn't love her and struggling at a strict boarding school, Jane has come to a place where she may be able to find happiness and love. This novel starts out slow, but the action picks up, developing the romance and the mystery in the novel. Charlotte Bronte uses imagery and numerous allusions in the novel. The most notable allusion is the bird allusions. This bird motif suggests freedom or independence, specifically, the independence of Jane. This theme, on a broader scheme, suggests women's independence, a subject that is not uncommon, but unorthodox at this time period. Another common allusion is a biblical allusion. These set a religious tone in the novel. Not only does Bronte allude to the Bible, she also uses religion to play a role in the development of Jane, most notably the religious boarding school and St. John Rivers. These things seem to have a negative effect on Jane, which cause her to sometimes stray a bit from religion. Even though she is negatively effected by those two elements, Jane still has religious morals that are found in the novel. Jane is honest and is not afraid to speak her mind to anyone. One can find many elements that make this book enjoyable and well worth reading. Even though starting out slow, the action intensifies with plot twists and suspense that make one rush to finish this novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Don't let the title of this review deceive you. I really enjoyed this book, very much. It does, however, follow a strikingly familiar formula, as do many of the &quot;strong heroine&quot; novels of the nineteenth century.Jane Eyre is a girl orphaned at a young age. She endures a very Dickensian treatment at the all-girls orphanage she is relegated to by her less than sympathetic relations, after being branded a trouble-maker, and having a bad character, and a deceitful dispostion.She survives the orphanage, only to be enlisted in the employ of a Mr. Rochester, as tutor and nanny to his charge, Adela. She is at once intrigued, if not a bit repelled by his brusque nature, and yet finds herself falling in love with him.Jane is caught up in the mystery of the 'tenant' on the third floor, a dangerous, diabolical person who places Jane's life, as well as Rochester's, in jeopardy, as Jane goes about her duties, all the while growing more and more amorous of Rochester.Eventually the identity of the 'tenant' is revealed, and Jane must chose between love and sense of duty. Being the forthright person that she is, she of course chooses duty, much to the heartbreak of both herself and Rochester, who has grown as enamored of this plain, headstrong creature as she has of him.Jane Eyre plays out in a very formulaic manner, much like many novels of the same ilk, but it is a wonderful read. The characters are engaging and entertaining. The story holds a few twists and turns, and delivers a very well-realized conclusion.For anyone who had this book thrust upon them in their teens, give it another try. For those who did not, it is well worth a first look."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Reviewers may say that as an author, Charlotte Bronte does not quite equal the best classical writers, or that her plot is too contrived, or that her dialogue is too stilted. None of these things matters, because in Jane Eyre, Bronte created a character whom I believe has no equal in fiction.Jane Eyre is a survivor in an age much more merciless than today. Condemned and degraded as a little girl by adults she trusted, she never loses her grip on her self-respect. Although she is reviled by her guardians and boarding school authorities, she retains not only her belief in herself but her innate goodness. Instead of returning harsh treatment with bitterness, she develops a character containing equal parts of toughness and kind benevolence.Her integrity is perceived by an employer whose deepest need is to recapture his own integrity, which he believes lost. Jane's guarded response to him forms much of the book's plot. Jane emerges quietly triumphant in a world in which she encountered hostility and love and ignorance and enlightenment, and met it all head on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"...and that's saying a lot coming from me. I read about 2 books a week but none has captured me the way &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; has. Many of the reviewers here have said that the vocabulary is difficult but this is what makes Charlotte Bronte such a fabulous writer. She was a poet before a novelist and all of her dialogue is written in prose. I've seen the Orson Welles version of this movie but a movie couldn't possibly do justice to this book. Ms Bronte not only relates us to Jane Eyre but with the prosaic descriptions she allows the reader to feel what Jane Eyre feels. Also, the book is timeless...unrequited love, jealousy, rage, passion..will never go out of style which is why even readers 100 years from now will still be unable to put this book down. I've recommended this book to my daughter as my mother has recommended this book to me and as her mother recommended to her. I know this book will continue being passed from generation to generation and I plan on reading it a second time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is the book that hooked me on reading! It has everything that I enjoy reading about: strong female characters, mysterious and preternatural occurrences, secret romances, and indelible love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre whisks you away to a world of thoughtful detail and slowly evolving love. Although at times the journey is excruciatingly slow, Bronte makes up for that with her strong-willed heroine, Jane.Jane is not your average heroine. At first glance she is a quiet, boring, and tractable girl, but underneath lays an increasingly strong, virtuous, and independent young woman. After years of knowing only a quiet obedience and a passive submission, Jane finally discovers her true nature when she stands up to the Reeds and demands release from their cruel care. In another display of personal strength, through an effort of pure will and a moral code that allows no compromise, Jane gives up security and a life time of happiness and leaves Mr. Rochester to embark on an uncertain path which promises hardship and grief. Jane's moral integrity along with her steadfast and courageous character is what made this story famous. Jane reveals these qualities again and again in the unfolding story, which makes her more and more admirable. She foregoes marriage to St. John and honorable service as a missionary to stick to her beliefs. Also, Jane does not conform to the expectations of the time. Jane is not content to be used once and then forgotten. Originally, Jane was dependent on Mr. Rochester, playing the traditional subordinate female role. However, in the end when they are finally together forever, Mr. Rochester becomes dependent on Jane, and that is just how she likes it. She wants to play an active and vital role in her husband's life. Bronte did an excellent job creating an admirable character in Jane Eyre.When Jane arrives at Thornfield, serving as a poor and lowly governess, she immediately falls in love with her wealthy master. Bronte enriches the reader's experience of their love with long passages describing Jane's conflicting emotions. Such endearing moments add credibility to the author's claims about Jane's strength of character. As their relationship unfolds, tantalizing hints and subtle foreshadowing grip the audience in suspense and hope that perhaps Mr. Rochester loves Jane too. For instance, Mr. Rochester says, \\"'Goodnight my --\\", and Bronte adds, \\"He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me\\". Although cheesy, such moments are effective in holding the reader's attention.Despite the novel's many charms and merits, at times I found myself wanting to rip my hair out at its agonizingly slow pace. My annoyance and impatience were magnified towards the story's end when Jane joins the River's household. Perhaps Bronte slows the story down purposely to contrast the speed and excitement of Jane and Rochester's relationship to its opposite in Jane and St. John's plodding relationship. Whatever the reason, the story takes a downward plunge as soon as Jane steps inside River's door.I also had a problem with the ending. Bronte concludes by quoting St. John's letter, \\"Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus!\\" This is Jane's book, possibly Mr. Rochester's, but never St. John's! The last words are hardly relevant to the story. Sure, faith in God is a reoccurring theme, but hardly last word material. Bronte made a mistake; she should have either ended with Jane or Mr. Rochester saying something about love. Isn't love what this whole story is about!?Still, the good outweighs the bad in Jane Eyre, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who craves a dark love story between two very unlikely characters and possesses enormous patience should pick this book up immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"...after 160+ years.THE STORY:I read Jane Eyre every 3-4 years because its truly the grading curve for so many writers of the genre. There are times even now when I read the book and I'll say to myself, \\"I LOVE this book!\\"When you think of the date in which it was written in and the author's limited worldly experience and resources, you can't help but appreciate her sharp wit and thoughtful insight into each character. In addition to that, Bront has a way of transporting you into Thornfield's dark eerie halls alongside Jane. It's truly a remarkable story!THE BARNES AND NOBLES CLASSICS EDITION:As for this particular edition, for quite some time I had been encouraging a friend to read Jane Eyre. The compact size was perfect for her to carry around in her bag for long grocery store lines, commuter rides, etc. She finished all 608 pages in one day because she loved it! It also has a great introduction filled with historical and bibliographical information on Ms. Bront to truly transport the reader into the mind and time of Jane Eyre.**If you simply want more Mr. Rochester and Jane after reading this, I suggest seeing the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke made for TV version by the BBC. Out of all versions (and I've seen all) it is the TRUEST adaptation of Bronte's work and doesn't dumb down her beautiful prose (what the author is most famous for) with modern day slang, nor does it take liberties with Bronte's Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre to bring them down to Hollywood's standards.

The book itself is one that cannot be put down in pure fear that while you are not reading a tradegy will befall our Jane. The majestry of the characters that Charlotte Bronte offers us is near perfection. With this it is also good to see a refreshing and different perspective of the upper class and its ways during this time period.

Reading Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; did not change that statistic. While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least. It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it. I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It was still well written and CB is good at keeping her readers interested in the characters and the plotting of the story. The ending was rather a bit too predictable for me and after investing two sleepless nights into this book, I was extreamly disappointed in the ending of this story. It is also a romance novel. I am not a great fan of romance novles without a complicated and intensely created plot so this element of the book did not appeal to me at all. I should've read this book as a young adult, as this is the audience the book is geared to. I would've enjoyed it more then. But if you are a fan of romance novels with many trials and tribulations of course thrown in, this is an elegant tale for you.Now in assessing the art of this book. When I first looked through this book and read it I was not happy, though not disappointed in the artwork. After reading this book and looking at the artwork of other versions of this story, I was a little miffed. The artwork is mostly of Jane Eyre, and none of the artwork really captured her features and personality at all. This cast a darkned element over the book and almost \\"forced\\" a victorian viewpoint of this story. I think the artwork of other versions are much better by comparrison."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Of all classic female authors (Jane Austin, Mary Shelly, for instance), and of all classic novels with a female protagonist, I find Charlotte Bronte as the most brilliant, and Jane Eyre to be the most memorable. I first read this book when i was a freshman in highschool, and loved it. Now I'm reading it as an upcoming college freshman. I not only still love it as I did then, but I'm deeply moved. I'm touched by how I personally connect with Jane Eyre, who not only has the wit, intelligence, honesty, and flourishing independence that constitutes the spirit of many female characters, like that from Jane Austin, but who stands the test of time as more than just a witty, intelligent female. Jane Eyre is a woman, a woman that all can relate to. Also, I love how the novel itself was written. Charlotte Bronte weaves in all the elements of a good story--suspense, passion, mystery, gothicism-- while entwining emotions like love, hate, death, regret, sadness, rebirth, and forgiveness. This is more than just a gothic novel, more than just a novel with a statement about Victorian society. It's a novel with heart, courage, and a journey that never ends in the heart, mind, and spirit. This is what real literature is all about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love nineteenth century British literature as much as anyone. This book, however, is mediocre at best. The symbolism is blatant and contrived to the point of being distracting. In fact, the whole story is extremely contrived, even for a romance. Neither are Charlotte's characters endearing enough to make the novel worthwhile. Jane, Rochester, and Adele are all a bit annoying rather than charming or good or even evil. And I have no idea why this novel would be considered Gothic, the only thing that qualifies that idea is all the ridiculous magic that's going on. Actually, the second half of the novel reads more like an Austen husband hunt with a little bit of weirdness thrown in.The Lowood section is redeeming, however. The description smacks of Dickens, chiding the English for their treatment of the helpless. The characters of the Brocklehursts are beautifully rendered hypocrites.Emily's Wuthering Heights is by far the better read if you're after a Bronte. All of her characters have depth so that even the villains become loved. Wuthering Heights is also fairly contrived and full of obvious symbolism, but unlike Jane Eyre, the mechanics of the story add to it rather than distracting from it. Above all, the pathos and darkness are delightful, especially coming from a nineteenth century British woman. Charlotte herself wrote in the preface to WH that she didn't understand why Emily had to write something so dark. My opinion is that Charlotte could have used a little bit of that darkness herself. Read WH if you want something really complex to savor; JE just makes a good beach read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is purely an exciting romance about a lost orphanted shy humbled female by the name of plain Jane.

For once, here is a woman who is intelligent, independent, vulnerable, wise, naive, cold, passionate, practical and creative all at same time. She is not someone who is easily placed in a nice, neat category and labeled, and those who call her \\"depressed\\" really miss the point. Although the language may not be modern the topics that Charlotte Bronte discusses are very relevant. What really surprises me is that so many people feel so threatened by such an \\"old\\" book. Why is the theme that you have to follow your own heart rather than the dictates of society so confrontational a subject to some people? It has nothing to do with either sex or gender, just a very human desire for freedom. Maybe some of the book's critics should wait a few years and re-read it when it isn't a required reading.

It's incredible what a gifted writer can produce, i.e. a fictional character who'd come to be more &quot;real&quot; to you than actual people in your lives, and far more unforgettable. &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is not just for females - I exhort all males to jump in and lose yourself in this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Though I did enjoy Jane Eyre, I found that the author, in my opinion, sometimes took an extremely long time to get through something. At one point, the author actually says 'I need but a few lines to expain the next 5 years of my life' or something to the effect of that, and she take at least 3 pages doing it. I don't have the largest attention span, and sometimes Jane Eyre just took too long for me to keep going."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Although it's not as good as Wuthering Heights, the story of Jane and Rochester is a good one. Jane, after having an uphappy childhood, deserves the love and happiness she feels with Rochester.

It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in. In my opinion, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a must read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The novel chronicles the tragic life of a young girl named Jane Eyre.

So don't let that put you off!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Words simply can't express how much I love this book. I have Three different copies of the book, I own all of the movie versions that I could find of it (Four, as of now). To say that I am a fan is a huge understatement.Jane is such a great character, a survivor in every sense of the word. She loves her man, but he doesn't own her, no no! She's her own woman, and she makes sure that he knows it. One of my favorite scenes of the book is when Edward is trying to force gifts on Jane, and she gets increasingly annoyed about it. He sees that she is upset and tries to sweet talk her, but she brushes him off completely. You go girl.The emotions in this story are gut wrenching, especially the scene after the botched wedding ceremony. I feel for Jane and understand her despair, but I weep openly for Edward. All he has ever wanted in life is to find someone he can love who will love him back, and just when he finds her she's ripped away. Oh, my! I'm getting teary-eyed just thinking about it!READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a timeless work that, once investigated outside of your high school english class, has the power to pull you into a world defined by social classes and the acts humans will perform for love.As you enter the world of Jane you realize that love and strength are intertwined deeply. You become aware that love is never simple and only the strong will survive. I will only go into the briefest details because to give anything away would be to steal a very meaningful experiance from the reader.The first time I read this novel I didn't really see the depth of the piece. You follow a young woman striking out into the world working a lower class job for an upper class family. As the governess at Thornfield Hall Jane becomes entangled with Mr. Rochester's dark secrets, and she also begins to find her heart intangled with his in a way that would disrupt the social order of the time. Yet, as you progress through this story you understand every choice Jane must make, even ones that seem so difficult and painful.Yes, at times it's melodramatic and very dark. Once you place yourself in Jane, a very plain young woman who lives a very hard life, you will find yourself searching within the passages and dissapearing into the English countryside.I love to loose myself with in these passages time and time again. I want to have the strength of Jane - this book has truly effected me and I recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I am a 12 year old girl who reads classic books.

It was not at all what I expected from an old English novel writen in 1847. I now see why it has been around so long. It is not stuffy and wieghted down with endless babble about manners as most English novels are. It moves along at a speed that keeps you enthralled. Jane Eyre is in a class by inself and has everything you could want in a novel: mystery, intrigue, romance, action, and endless, strong, intelligent drama. Jane Eyre captures your heart. You root for her happeness and truely believe she deserves true love. Revolutionary and richly imagined, Jane Eyre is at least a century ahead of its time; an ultimately triuphant work of genius. Enormous in scope, and vastly entertaining, it is one of the best love stories ever told."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Struggle, survival, compassion and romance: these eternal elements will make this novel an enduring presence. Ms. Bronte must have been quite courageous to write about a free spirited woman like Jane Eyre in Victorian Era. Even though there are so many memorable scenes in this book, what stands out most is the romance between Jane and Edward. The pathos underlying this romance reminds me of the desperate love that Hunchback of Notre Dam professed towards Esmeralda. The lyrical beauty of Bronte's English enhances the appeal of this timeless piece of artwork."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the reasons Jane Eyre is such an enduring piece of literary excellence is because of it's simple theme, in a book of numerous themes battling for #1, is of the ability of one human being with absolutely nothing to rise above hell and survive. Yet anyone can write about that, but only a true talent can make you give a damn about it all.Going back to those other themes, they consist of feminism, morality, personal blindness, social reform, and more. A plethora of characters that you'll despise or love or feel like kicking at one moment and hugging the next, it's a breathtaking array of humanity drenched in dysfunction, and one woman who's known nothing else and with great difficulty can still find those rungs on the ladder.Jane is appealing because of her complexities and endurance. Bronte's contemporary audiences found Jane a bit of an enigma, she's a moral strength in the toughest sense but so independent and (has been called) the first feminist in literature. Bronte gives us ample opportunity to see what the social climate was back then, and it only adds to the atmosphere of difficulty for Jane's saga as a poor governess in a male dominated world. Yet Jane is realistic because we see how she evolves from being an free spirited child to a beaten down teenager/adult who strives only to escape to follow her dreams and follow God's word, and eventually the governess who must come to terms with the man she loves and the dark secret that he carries. That's Rochester, who represents everything Jane isn't. He's immoral, crude, nasty, and is inexplicably held down by a bundle of secrets and one rather large one that keeps him a captive of his own life. They have one thing in common, they have thick shells they don't know how to get rid of.And yet Bronte weaves us a story that is full of passion and shows us the cracks in the dams that keep these characters apart, and as the numerous events and intrigues take place, we see how they grow and finally come to terms with their reality and whatever tragic consequences must occur. And at the root of it is Jane who leads us through decision and pain and her intense desire to just be a good and fully human person in a society and situation that won't allow her to.Jane Eyre is a book about us, and is an inspiring book even 160+ years later, not just because of the quality of Bronte's talent, or the brilliant plot weaving and what not, but because it's a masterpiece look at the strength of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I loved this book. It's one of those books you can read over and over, and never get tired of it. It's a wonderful love story full of exciting twists. The Bronte sisters are a couple of my heros. I would encourage anyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I had recently been channel surfing and saw that Jane Eyre was going to be on television. I was curious, being an English Lit major and never having read anything by the Bronte sisters, I figured I would watch the movie and see if the story line was anything interesting. I loved it. So, that night I ran to the store and bought the book. The book was ten times more vivid and wonderfully told than the movie (as was expected). I was delighted to revist the characters that I had briefly been introduced to through the movie. C.B. tells the tale wonderfully through the life of Jane. Her trials become your trials. Her love becomes your love. It was very intense and riveting. I can't wait to read it again in a few years!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I loved this book because I felt the struggle Jane Eyre went through, being an abused, poor orphan forced to reside all year around at the Lowell School under a harsh headmaster. Then being forced to endure the harshness of her employer, Mr. Rochester.I pitied Mr. Rochester because he was &quot;stuck&quot; with a mad woman he locked on the top floor with Mrs. Pool. In a sense, it was sort of like a living death. As long as she remained alive, he could not remarry or have a family. I loved it when Orson Wells played this role because his large, brilliant, black eyes really showed his torment in the film. Joan Fontaine as Jane Eyre was no slouch either. Her blank stare after ten years at the Lowell school was great. I really felt their emotions in the book too, especially after Jane Eyre's friend at Lowell died of pneumonia and when her wedding ceremony was cancelled after discovering Mr. Rochester was already married.The tense part in the book and film was when Mr. Rochester's bed was set ablaze by his wife. I don't know how a man could let his mentally ill wife remain under the same roof with a child and so many lit candles to be knocked over but Mr. Rochster did it. I mean, the man must be as daft as his wife.I thought this book was a thrilling read because both of the main characters over came their problems. Yes there were consequences, but they were temporary. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I found Jane Eyre to be a delightful read and a book that can be read again and again. It is the story of a young orphan girl who struggles to find her place in society. The story begins with Jane as child living with her aunt and cousins. Jane is a spirited girl and is disliked by all, especially her aunt, who constantly belittles her, despite the fact that Jane's cousins are horrific. Jane's only friend is the maid, who gives her comfort from time to time.Finally it gets to the point where Jane fights back and her aunt chooses to send her to boarding school. Lowood is a place of discipline and seriousness. The girls are educated in harsh conditions. It is here that Jane makes her first friend and learns much from her. After many years at school, Jane decides she wants to work and make money. There are not many options for a woman of her time who desires a career, but she lands a job as a governess for a young, French girl. Jane enjoys teaching and looking after her, but she also longs for something more in life.After being there for some time, Jane finally meets Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who spends little time there. He is a short, rather ugly man and Jane piques his interest as a girl with intelligence. After numerous encounters, they profess their mutual affection and plan on getting married. Although Jane loves him, she cannot ignore their obvious class difference.On the day of their wedding it is revealed that Rochester is already married to Bertha; a crazy Jamaican woman living on the top floor of the house. Jane is shocked and decides she cannot marry Rochester despite his pleas. She packs up her things and runs away.Jane spends time homeless and starving until strangers take her in. St. John is a missionary who is later revealed as Jane's cousin. The death of Jane's uncle leaves her with a fortune, turning her into a financially independent woman. Despite the fact that he's her cousin, St. John asks Jane to marry him and accompany him to India to do missionary work. What does Jane decide? Read the book and find out!Jane Eyre is novel filled with passion and symbolism. Fire appears time and time again, symbolizing the heat that exists in Jane's life. I found Jane to be a strong and admirable woman, though there are times when her sensibility gets a bit annoying. Rochester is a little odd as well, but together I find them charming. This story is unique because the heroine is a plain, poor girl who triumphs over class barriers, which is why she is so likable. She is not a beauty queen who is swept off into the horizon by prince charming. Altogether, a passionate story of courage and triumph."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has been hailed by many to be the original romance novel and after reading it, I am inclined to agree.Jane is an abused, forgotten child who is sent away to a boarding school after standing up for herself against her cruel cousins and unjust aunt. While at school, Jane learns disicpline and becomes a very religious person.When Jane finally leaves the boarding school, it is for a governess position at the home of Rochester. She teaches the child in his care, Adele.Through the story, she and Rochester face many dilemmas in their search for true love. A true love that is right in front of their noses.If you like romance novels or if you just want to rediscover your hope for love, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is one of my favourite books ever! I must have read it about a thousand times and I'm still not fed up of it. For those of you who are under the impression that this is a boring, dried up dull book, you could not be more wrong. I have never read a book so rich, so passionate and so moving. The love of Jane and Mr.Rochester is wonderfully depicted by Charlotte Bronte into true love's deepest and richest form. Her language is vivid, descriptive and romantic, and the dialogue (especially between the two protagonists)is poetic and eloquent. This is a book for all tastes, and the characters are so well portayed that they come alive in the imagination and stay there. I actually found myself crying towards the end. And Jane, though she appears meek and mild, is actually resolute and fiery and follows her religious principles dutifully to the extent of losing her only happiness. She is, in short, possessed of a strength and fortitude both reamrkable and admirable. As for Mr.Rochester,he is an archetypal Byronic hero: dark,enigmatic,cynical,sardonic and sternly attractive, suffering from some mysterious sorrow which renders him aloof and forbidding and forms the basis for the 'secret of the attic. This book has everything: romance, tragedy, intrigue and humour and is a classic in the true sense of the word."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In the novel Jane Eyre, Bronte wants the reader to perceive the main character, Jane Eyre, as an independent young woman trying to make her way through life by herself. Jane is even given a line &quot;I do not think, sir you have the right to command me, merely because you are older than I...&quot;(139) to help understand her independent way of thinking. Bronte tries to give and describe Jane through feminist characteristics. Throughout the novel, however, Bronte uses a literary motif of birds. In this motif everytime Jane is compared to a bird it is a bird such as a turtle dove which can be compared as weak and delicate to that of a raven which is how the main male character is described. This novel is an enjoyable one and I would recommend it to anyone who reads only for pleasure purposes. If you try to find a deeper meaning in this novel you may get confused on how the author really wants the reader to portray the main characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is a classic, loved by many, and may be just the book for you. But for me, i found it rather dull, and while i like fiction, historical fiction, i found this to drag on."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the best novels of all time, and a true feminist classic.Of course there were plenty of people in the 19th century who complained that Jane Eyre was too liberated, too Girl-Power. I suppose humanity will never be free of conservatives and their never-ending quest to jail us all in rigid little gender cages."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a suspensful novel that includes new excitements on every page. It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing. Will Jane ever find this one last element to make her life perfect?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was 9 at the recommendation of my 4th grade teacher. After that, I would always say that it was my favorite book. At 25, I looked back and wondered if I had really understood the book at age nine. So I reread it, and realized how deeply I had understood. The character of Jane had seeped into my subconcious as a role model against whom I unwittingly checked myself. She is level-headed, but not rigid. She falls into things, but is conscious while falling. She is neither a namby-pamby nor a Polyanna. She stands up for herself, while still respecting others. On top of all of that, she is very real. Her mental journey is recognizable to me, more so the older I get. The book is also swooningly romantic at times. Mr. Rochester is wonderful and arrogant, and vunerable, and grouchy. The conversations they have are beautiful, and fully engaging. This book will live inside me until the end of my days, and I'm so grateful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui. I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence. Oh, well, I guess its too late to mention the criticism to Charlotte!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Let me first note that I am still in high school but I didn't read this as an assignment. So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words. Please take my word for it and read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'm not sure what made me - at 37 - decide to read Jane Eyre. It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled. I've started it before and never penetrated too far. But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic \\"tale of woe\\", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like \\"she gives me my meed liberally\\" and \\"collecting all she says with assiduity\\", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.\\"Am I hideous, Jane?\\"\\"Very, sir: you always were, you know.\\"\\"St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.\\"(Aside.) \\"Damn him!\\"--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (\\"a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects\\") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The \\"madwoman in the attic\\" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time. Jane would be considered somewhat feisty by today's standards."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This was my first Charlotte Bronte novel, and I want to read it again and again!

I was always afraid that I would not be able to understand the language of the time well enough to enjoy the story..WAS I SORELY WRONG! I am a beginner reader and I did just fine after the first 30 pages. This was such a dark read that I do not recommend it for everyone but I enjoy dark, gothic love stories. I also love Mr. Rochesters way of drawing out Jane from her own self imprisonment of her spirit. I suggest everyone to read this atleast once and then see the new movie out! I just saw the movie today and it was the best yet!! Mia played the part of Jane SOOO WELL!!

The language is beautifully woven, showing the character's feelings and giving way to shocking occurrances. The tale is not quite original but it does strike the heart--showing society at the time while weaving the tale--the plots just grasp you harder and harder within each chapter--like glue, if you don't try to get out of it, you can't get out--carefully developing the plot with questions, the language, and subtle events that makes the book--not quite original--but giving it a place of its own in the romance genre, getting better and better every time. It is really quite the satisfying experience. Personally, I--not being a picky person--don't have a problem with the printing. The story is enough to change your life if you can be easily shaken by such fictional romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a really great book, however not for young kids. i read this book when i was in 7th grade.

Jane Eyre is an eloquently written, surprising, and captivating novel. The beauty of this tale is sometimes overlooked because of the time period from which it hails. However, one must not allow the restrains of the time period in which this novel was written restrict one from reading it. For, not only does Jane defy the roles set for her by the society of her time, but this novel, written under a pseudonym by Charlotte Bronte defies the rules of a novel for its time.The novel is revolutionary in its own singularly, and by what is captured on its pages.This is a must-read for anyone. A classic that is a necessary addition to every library.This book is above any star-rating system."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Spiritual and supernatural themes can be traced throughout the novel-&iexcl;Jane Eyre&iexcl;, my most favorate novel which shows me how to keep my courage, independence and self-respect in life. Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class.

Even though it's a \\"classic\\" it's not intimidating like, say, Moby Dick. It has a perfect balance of everything - tragedy without melodrama, a wicked family without the modern day drug/alcohol problems, romance without mushiness, and a happy ending without sappy triteness. If you really (for some weird reason) can't get into it, rent the movie. Then read the book - you'll truly appreciate its greatness...."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Not that bad is truely an understatement. This novel is a classic, all respects to the word. I, a man, find this book to be one of my favorites.The book is strong in creativity, contains a remarkable flow from word to word, and has a grand notion of human emotion. What gives this book these qualities? READ IT!!! The three qualities revolve with each other. Creating a self powering novel that easily controls the moments of you emotion through the revealing of the plot to the audience with superb timing.Only one problem, a little too ironic at times, don't ya think.My small speal isn't even close to giving the novel any justice.&quot;It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, &quot;the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.&quot;I primarily choose this because of its connectiveness to the traits mentioned prior and because it won't ruin the book. Maybe this will be the first thing you read before reading the rest of the book. Or atleast I hope so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is a two-fer.

And the mystery of Thornfield and of Mr. Rochester will keep you turning each of the pages until you are completely immersed in the story.

It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Not intended for the melancholy, this classic literature is full of hope, full of love that you rarely find in writings those days. Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has been my favorite since I first read it way back in middle school, the 6th grade I believe. I loved it then and I continue to love it. Jane is a remarkable heroine, she is not beautiful or charming, she is quite and bookish. She goes from a smart abused child to a smart stronge young woman. She has hope and bravery when she has no reason to believe in happy endings and that is why I love her. I do love her, for being to my mind one of the strongest female characters written and she does it all without batting her eyes. Not even once. This book may be listed as a romance, but it is also a mystery and a drama. I would highly recommended it for character building."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"We had to choose between 5 novels in my english 10 honors class and I choose this one.

I personally loved this story at parts the book does drage on with Bronte's many many descriptions.

Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try.

There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night. These are said to be the doings of a drunken servant named Grace Poole.Jane then receives a letter from Gateshead Hall, telling her that Mrs. Reed is requesting Jane to come visit her on her death bed. There she learns that a distant Uncle Eyre wished to adopt Jane, but Mrs. Reed replied saying that Jane died in the Typhus epidemic.Jane returns from Gateshead Hall 3 weeks late because of funeral arrangements for her aunt to an anxious Mr. Rochester, who feared her to never return. Later, in the garden, he asks Jane to marry him, and she gladly accepts, to the dismay of Mrs. Fairfax.The wedding was interrupted by a man who announced that Mr. Rochester was already married! Mr. Rochester then confesses as he brings the wedding attendees up to his attic. There he shows everyone his \\"wife:\\" Bertha Mason, an insane and deadly violent woman, looked over by Grace Poole. She is kept there because Mr. Rochester doesn't have the heart to send her to an asylum.In her dismay, Jane runs away from Thornfeild Hall.

The whole plot and the literature is so descriptive and beautiful... I could not let it down. The author grasps you into the story, with the delightful romance and the plot elements here and there, it is put together very coherently. Everyone of Jane's decisions are vital to the progression of this novel. The excellent narration was one my favorite highlights in this novel. Not to mention, unforgettable characters, haunting moments, and love themes all will make us think introspectively. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a woman who has an ability to survive in life as a woman with little education, no money, and no family. Living with a distant family who shows disrespect and hatred for her. She struggles till she achieves her goal which is being an independent respected strong woman.she refuses to succumb her independence even when she fell in love with Rochester, therefore she left him and when she returned she was much stronger and had her own money.It's a very nice book ,a work of art that you can't put down until you finish it"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is definitely on my list of top novels. I have read it quite a few times and I have enjoyed it each time. Actually Charlotte Bronte was being quite daring in creating this heroine. Jane was a new development in fiction during the time of the writing of this novel (1847). Jane was intelligent, passionate and totally unconventional. The other characters in this novel are just as memorable. Who can forget Rochester - broody, moody, and somewhat sinister? The plot of the book is exciting and it carries the reader along with a sense of urgency. This is an enduring novel that I continue to love and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A true classic. In this not so typical love story, the heroine, Jane Eyre is unlike any other. As opposed to the archetypal heroine, Jane is simple in both demeanor and appearance. She is a modest young woman who has been raised with much turmoil and tragedy, but despite this is able to deeply care for others. A deep and mysterious romance develops between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the man whom employs her as a governess. But will it last? Will a mystifying secret destroy their relationship and leave Jane with another emotional scar? This book is quite the page-turner, you will not be able to put it down for the anticipation of what comes next. Bronte evokes strong, intimate emotions within the reader that give hope and motivation to love in life to the fullest. The character of Jane proves that any one can be a heroine, no matter what your physical appearance or character, that any woman is capable of being loved and of vast romance. A must-read-feel-good-book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the greatest novels of all time, Jane Eyre satisfies all the essentials that a great romance novel needs, plus more.This novel brings to life the ordinary day with new twists and turns around every corner.Jane Eyre is in first-person, therefore you feel what the character feels and go through what she goes through. Deep emotions come out as a result of the life she leads and how she reacts and deals with the struggles she faces. Along with struggles and hardships Jane Eyre also experiences happy situations.A must-read, no one should ever go through life not having read this book.

This novel is just that good!So what are you waiting for, click on the book and order it now. I guarentee that you will not be sorry you bought it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I thought this was a nice book. The main character is unlike most heroines. She is plain and simple, not very elegant or beautiful. It is fun to read about two characters, Jane Eyre, with her kind and charming but simple personality and the moody and mysterious Mr. Rochester. It can be a bit long with details but this book keeps you interested. I especially liked that Charlotte Bronte told you all about each character and how they grow and change or do not change.

A great novel and a beautiful love story, truly a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a great book. The only complaint I have is I think because it's the kindle version, sometimes I feel like I'm missing things here and there. For example, they keep mentioning a place called ***Shire....But all I can see is ***Shire. Anyway, not sure if it's like that in the hardcopy book, haven't checked. But I'm sure it has something to do with it being an electronic version. But, LOVE THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"If you love historical romances and classic literature, put JANE EYRE on your reading list. Superb characterization and setting, with an excellent pace of plot. Many readers might be a bit wary of picking up a classic, but JANE EYRE is a good place to start. It has an engaging and easily accessible voice. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially to young women above the age of twelve who want a clean love story and Christian readers who seek an inspirational message. A good choice for pleasure reading, book groups, or for school!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Excellent read - there is nothing like a good period novel - I would recommend this book to all Bronte readers who love a suspense, thriller and romance all in one!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The title says \\"Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics)\\" edited by Q. D. Leavis, and it's free for the Kindle. As I suspected, this is false advertising; it is not the Penguin Classics edition. It's the original out-of-copyright edition, with no professional editing, footnotes, or other scholarly apparatus. You get what you pay for. See \\"The Terrible Price of Free\\" for more about this issue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I recently watched a film version of Wuthering Heights which, strangely enough, reminded me how much I love Jane Eyre. I used to groan when I was in school and I was faced with the prospect of reading one of the \\"classics,\\" but Jane Eyre always stuck out as the one I loved. Jane is a heroine we can all relate to.. she's plain, mousey, and she's had a difficult life, but she also has an underlying fire. She meets her match in Rochester, a gruff man with many secrets. It is depressing, but also redeeming. Sad, but also romantic. If you like the book, also check out the movie version with Michael Fassbender and Mia (I'm not even going to attempt her last name)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I rate this book excellent as this is wat I felt as I flittered along in its story line. They do not call this a \\"classic treasure\\" for nothing, let me say. As I finished the conclusion, I still wanted more.

Thank you Charlotte Bronte..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"one of the best, well writen, witty, heart wrenching, passionate, smart, wonderful and enlightening books i have read.

I wish i had known her trully for now i think she is one of the best writers and my favorite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a title set in times where the rich had nothing but literature, so the language is going to be long-winded, and the plot is irregular for its time. It contains some aspects of our modern literature but the antics from its time of origin.As a book for AP English, I would rather have selected another book, but this is not the worst. Most readers will fare better in this book for school rather than the infamous \\"Invisible Man\\" and other commonly used senior lit. books.Be prepared for a long read, as JE is definitely longer than what a modern book usually will be. Otherwise, read away - this book has its own unique style that is interesting in all its own."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I had to read this book for school, and I was relatively impressed with it. The plot developed way too slowly for my liking though, and I found myself quickly reading through the \\"stuffing\\" to get to the juicy parts. Throughout the novel the reader gets to know the characters involved very well, and even though they aren't very realistic, they are pleasantly developed, and fun to watch grow; Jane, the main character, proved to be the most satisfying character to follow and watch grow. However, this book is written in Victorian style language, and I found this style to be incredibly boring and difficult to read through or understand at times, but the themes and motifs embedded within this novel are effectively incorporated, and they kept the reader interested in analyzing the text. As for the ending of the book, I must say that I was very satisfied; with most of the intense emotional action happening towards the end of the novel I'm not surprised Bronte found a nice, and pleasant way to end her story. Overall, this book is great for classroom discussions, or to just sit down and read for fun. Enjoy :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is very inspiring piece of literature and motivates women to uprise against the society. I thought this book is very interesting but in some parts they are dull scenes. The language is well written; however, not modernize. The sentence structure is very long winded and contains a lot of imagery and metaphoric phrases. I hope to the outcome of Jane's life in the future, but I thought that its not very appropriate now in our modern society.The characters i think is well develop in the novel, but the only thing that don't convince me is the unfortunate events that the characters done in the novel is not very realistic. Other than that I thought that this book if a fine piece of classic literature so I praise the author Charlotte Bronta for it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read Jane Eyre for the first time in my early 30's. I could not put it down. It is one of those few books where the author's voice gets in your head. I recently downloaded it so that I could revisit it. A marvelous book for anyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In British literature, my favorite writers are Bronte sisters.Bronte sisters are the genius that their names were known to by a few novels in the world.The heroine Jane Eyre in Charlotte Bronte's novel was brought up by a mean aunt.Therefore Jane Eyre received terrible bullying.The problem of the bullying becomes the great problem in Japan now.In a school a few children sometimes are bullied, and to my surprise, a few parents in Japan abuse their children.The first scene of Jane Eyre is her unhappy life's departureI watch deep depth of human existence there.That chief director who took care of Jane Eyre must be crazy , if we consider by modern sense.It is odd that he is a Christian .Because Christ taught love and impressed the human. And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are \\"The sorrow of young Werther\\", French \\"The lily of the valley\\", Russian \\"Anna Karenina\\" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered \\"Light in August\\" of Faulkner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It had been years since I read this book. I enjoyed it immensely. No wonder it is a classic and will be forever!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read JE in Spanish when I was 11 or 12 - my memory seldom serves me well. Years passed but JE didn't - have no idea how many times I read it! After some years of studying, I was able to read - and enjoy - Bronte in English. That was sublime! My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his \\"best earthly companion\\".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear. He did not know how to do things differently - out of love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I love this book! Easily my favorite book to date.

As a 28 year old guy I'm not usually accustomed to picking something like this up, but at the encouragement of my wife and the audio book available I was welcome to the opportunity of reading/ listening to it. All in all I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking to expand their language and or their list of great books to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Many of us read Jane Eyre in school, and perhaps found the dialects, moody setting, and pace a challenge. What a refreshing experience to re-read the book as an adult, with a lifetime of experiences to add to our understanding.The wispersync function allowed me to continue on with the narrative on long commutes when I couldn't continue reading, and the quality of the audio is wonderful. I encourage anyone who has dismissed Jane Eyre as a book relegated to their past to investigate it for insights into feminism, patriarchy, class, suffering, and forgiveness. I think they will find the human heart has not changed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read Jane Eyre as a young girl and never forgot it. When I purchased my Kindle I thought of this novel I had so enjoyed reading and decided to treat myself to another read. I will most likely read again before I go..."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As a writer with an MA in literature, I of course read this book as a adolescent and as part of courses in Victorian English writing. The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen. I definitely recommend it for winter reading, when there is time to snuggle up to a wood stove or fireplace with a cup of cocoa or a glass of wine and immerse oneself in another era. Probably not for male readers unless they are English majors or really appreciate women."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Still a classic! I enjoyed the English of the 1840's. Some of the chapters, however, were a little long and became a bit tedious. Did the really talk like that? With the Kindle dictionary, I had to look up at least three unknown words per page to find out the old-style language."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is the 3rd time I've read this book. As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier. Basically, the plot is a bodice ripper without the ribald sexual description (thank God).There is something contained, passionless and distant about Jane that disconnects as you read from the larger narrative,none the less I recommend this book as a good read - just don't expect Wuthering Heights"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Why did I wait until I was 57 years old to read this book?

It is a wonderful book and a great love story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"by far my favorite book of all time.

I can really say that the time spent with Jane Eyre was a bright spot in my summer."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I bought this book as an audio CD for a trip I was taking with my son. Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love. What am I missing?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I was just looking for a free classic to read for fun this summer; this book far exceeded my expectations. While others are reading 50 Shades of Grey, this strangely twisted love story is far more agreeable with my taste. It honestly touched me, and I will continue to reread it for years to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I downloaded this book after I kept seeing it mentioned in the Fifty Shades series. This book is 'old school' but very ineteresting and I'm glad to say I have now read it. It was difficult for me to put down at times and at times I needed to put it down just to process what I had read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading for the sake of reading and who can handle 'deep' reading. If you've not read a lot of classic books this is a good start to add one to your list."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Although I hate to douse such a highly acclaimed story with a lowly single star rating, I can say with certainty that &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; was by far the worst novel I have ever read.I can see how followers of Romantic love stories would find this legnthy tome a lovely and engaging read. However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I also had to read this book for school, during summer. I can respect the fact that it was a classic but it just was not a book that I enjoyed. It had many unneeded parts and tended to repeat itself. It was especially boring when Jane landed at Moor House. If you are a hopeless romantic then go for it, but I prefer exciting books. The other book I had to read was Lord of the Flies and I liked it much better. So....there^^;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre may be enjoyed by older adults (with a bigger vocabulary, I should add), but I had to read this sophomore year and absolutely hated it. This book is very hard to read, and I wouldn't recommend it to any young readers who doesn't have a teacher to help explain. Although it may be a classic, it is one tough book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"There isn't much to say about this book. Other that I had a group assignment a few months ago to read this, and then present it to our fellow peers. Lets see, how can I put this into words? Well, it was pretty self torturing. Page after page was about fifty billion paragraphs of Charlotte Bronte describing a landscape or the \\"confusing\\" emotions that Miss. Eyre was having towards her boss. Although, it must have been tough writing a book which displays a woman of independence and such, Ms. Bronte is a decent writer... the book would have just been more enjoyable if there was splashes of complete randomness.As for myself, I really do not plan on reading this book, ever again. Unless some Iraqi solider is torturing me with an ablazed iron rod and screaming at me to tell him about the great collections of Charlotte Bronte and her infamous book, \\"Jane Eyre\\"."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"because this book deserves it. I first read it in the 9th grade, and it was literally a struggle to the very end. Summoning all my effort, I laboriously read this book with a lack of interest unsurpassed to this very day. It was useful only when I had trouble falling asleep.Each page of this dull, overly dramatic book felt like an eternity. There are pages upon pages of meaningless and increasingly uninteresting rambling. Plain Jane gains no sympathy from me. Apparently, she enjoys suffering, as evidenced by her constantly changing opinions and the way she strives to make her life more difficult when handed easier options. (Ex: When the guy finally admits his love for her, she goes off into the rain, poor and near-death, upon the advising of some voices she hears.)The plot is long and unbelievable. For example, how can you hide a woman in your house for years, a woman who, by the way, screams, throws fits, and sets things on fire? And nobody notices this? The ending is no better -- sappy and contrived, it left me ill.Absolutely hideous, I would not even recommend this to the worst of my enemies. This book fails to become even briefly captivating. It starts off horribly and, impossible as it may seem, only gets worse throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be \\"Plain Jane\\", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre, I was glad to be done with this book. Most women enjoy and appreciate Jane Eyre, but since I am 15 I have a different opinion.Jane Eyre is 641 pages of a woman trying to find herself. Jane, the main character, goes to a charitable school for 1/4 of the book. During school, nothing really happens. Yes, Jane and her classmates are treated poorly, but it didn't hold my attention. The book does pick up until after Jane leaves school.From there Jane meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. The only thing about their relationship is Jane is 19 or 20 and Mr. Rochester is almost 40. I felt that I could not relate to these characters because today such an age difference is looked down upon by people. Of course Jane and Mr. Rochester plan to get married, but Jane finds out about Mr. Rochester's deepest darkest secret. THEN SHE RUNS AWAY! What a stupid girl. Jane may have been an independent woman, but big deal; so many women today are independent. Is that why so many people love this book? When Jane runs away, this part of Jane Eyre is so unbelievably boring. Jane meets her cousins, but realizes that she still loves Mr. Rochester. Not much happens except Mr. Rochester is blind. Jane and Mr. Rochester get married and live happily ever after.You might love this book, but as I said before I am only 15 and can not appreciate Jane Eyre, the character and the book. If you are a teenager like me do not read Jane Eyre or even waste your time. Maybe if you are older and found your true love, you might love every minute of this book. I recommend if you are young, read a book that takes place during the present, not the past."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever. The plot, dare we call it that, winds slowly through the 400+ pages of this so-called classic. If you must read it for school-don't. You'd be better off guessing on the test than being utterly confused and bored to tears."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book should not be placed in the same class with other &quot;classic&quot; authors who deserve their place. This book is a bore, the main character is a whiny cry-baby and the book goes nowhere for a long time. Jane has a very thick skull and all the obvious things fly over her head. This book should not be a classic, and I do not understand why it is one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Do you like drama, excitement, action, and adventure? If so, do not read this book! Jane Eyre is a little English girl who is forced to live with her relatives that hate her. At the age of eight, she is forced to move to an orphan school where she has no friends and is continually abused. The book slowly drags through her life at school until she graduates. After spending eight years at school she becomes a governess for a little French brat out in the country. While living at the manor and tutoring the girl, Jane falls in love with the master of the manor. Mr. Rochester is an older man who has traveled all over the world searching for happiness. The rest of the book spends time explaining the controversy between their personalities and how they deal with each other's love. I give this book points for originality, but it needs a more gripping storyline. Only read this book if you need more reading material."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a really good book. It's a little hard to read because Charlotte Bronte describes everything in such great detail, but that adds to the image of the book.

It probably had a good moral and all that stuff, but there was about 150 pages of excess crap that I, personally, didn't care about! It was just a teeny bit to long.....!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This novel is not as it appears to be. English teachers may praise it, your girlfriends may gush over Rochester, and others \\"critically acclaim\\" it but I have studied it as a piece of literature as well as an entertaining classic. It is not as fabulous as they say.The protagonist is a quivering (and excuse the term but I am at a lost for another word at the moment) nitwit who yearns to be loved. Jane is an orphan who feels as if she would die if nobody loved her and yes, it sounds simplistic but this is exactly what she says. She comes under the employment of Rochester and becomes a governess to a little girl. Meanwhile, she dreams of flaming beds and hears strange noises from the floor above. The splitting of the oak tree during Jane's engagement to Rochester is just rubbish as a symbol of separation and tragedy. The real tragedy though, is the secret that Rochester keeps and for which, Jane accepts.I am amused by how several people believe that Jane Eyre is a feminist novel. I found Jane to be very comfortable lodged in traditional ideals although she makes an attempt to strike out with her own will. It was a struggle to finish the novel (had to, or I would fail my English exam) and to pretend to my enthusiastic teacher that I loved it. If you want real feminism without archaic English, read Carol Shield's 'Unless'. If you want melodramatic romance with just a hint of literature, read 'Wuthering Heights'. If you think that Jane is a misguided feminist, you certainly have to read Jean Rhy's 'Wide Sargasso Sea' who portrays Rochester's secret as a terrible colonial crime.I can understand that some people love this kind of stuff but there are types of people who hate 'Jane Eyre' - they're usually into contemporary novels, ask for their heroes or heroine to yearn for something more than love and for somebody to love them, and need metaphors that are more subtle that freakin' splittin' oak trees."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read. But read it while you are young like me (I'm in my mid-teens), or else, if you become an avid book reader, you will find nothing but faults."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Like all great literature JANE EYRE can be read again and again revealing new truths and raising fresh questions. For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Definitely Not What I Expected: Jane EyreJane Eyre is a novel set in 1800's England. It is about a young girl, Jane, who wants to escape her horrible life with her aunt and abusive cousins. Her parents died when she was a little girl. She wants to go to school and eventually teach. Jane is a smart girl who loves to read, but is not very fond of her appearance. Jane Eyre tells the tale of a woman's experiences in life, about men, friendship, and hardship. When taking a job as a governess, Jane stumbles upon a love she did not intend, and a mystery she's determined to solve.Although Jane Eyre is not exactly my cup of tea there were some positive points to the book. The character Jane Eyre is a very good role model for young women. She is not some stunningly gorgeous princess in a castle, she's very real in the sense that she has insecurities like everyone else. She may struggle with her appearance, but she is very smart and articulate, and does not rely on men to take care of her. She's very independent and uses her brains, not her looks to get what she wants. Appearance is something almost every adolescent girl has struggled with, despite what time period they've grown up in. Jane Eyre presents a positive message to girls.Unfortunately, the rest of the novel was not quite as inspiring. In general, I found Jane Eyre to be very dull and boring, and far too long. The literature style was very bland. When reading Jane Eyre the voice in my head became monotonous, I was ready to fall asleep! With so much detail when describing the characters or setting, it seems like it takes Charlotte Bronte two or three pages just to describe a chair.Extremely long and boring at times, Jane Eyre captures the time period well, almost too well with the amount of detailed description on every page. The character Jane is very interesting, complex, and well-written, but she needs a different author to put her into a better story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"These days there are a lot of these 'trashy' romance novels being published.

They're so good that I wish that I was there in England during the 16th &amp; 17th century. Jane Eyre was one of my all-time favourites, thoough I didn't realise it back then when I 1st read it. I had the misfortune of reading the abridged version &amp; I'm sure many of the beautiful English phrases would've been deleted. I don't really remember the whole story in detail, but I do recall a brief outline. It's about a lady Jane Eyre, who falls in love with Mr.Rochester(I THINK he's her employer, I'm not really sure) But later, it's revealed that Mr. Rochester has a wife, who is also mentally deranged. I really don't remember what happens in the end, but I DO remember one thing. At the beginning, when the novel unfolds, I thought it was kind of scary. There were these wierd sounds coming from above, but later it was all explained.(I won't tell u how. You've got 2 read it &amp; find out!)

However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops!

Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it.

It had references, a brief little biography, and quotes...it is so wonderful and I enjoy reading it to my friends. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It seems that the basic purpose of the character Jane Eyre is to suffer nobly and then eventually succeed. Both elements are highly problematic as presented. Her noble suffering acts to undermine her actual character, making someone that reacts the same to most of the challenges--stoic, determined, largely silent, resigned. This required attitude makes her too much of a blank slate, too reactive, with insufficient personal details to be memorable or seem like a complex psychological portrait. One gathers that Bronte was trying to subvert common norms in representation of woman, by making Jane a lot plainer and less accomplished than was the usual style. She may have made a major improvement in this, and as discussed below there are some interesting elements to all this, but the basic result undercuts the character's agency too much. Jane can work as a symbol, she does not work as a person, and the novel is too deeply linked to her consciousness for that to be a passable loss.As well there are major pacing issues and apparent questions on the larger arc, with much of the first hundred pages and the last hundred and fifty being off-tangent to the necessary interactions for the particular story. Still, it was hardly the worst or most difficult work to get through. For much of the first two hundred pages I found it moderately enjoyable, without thinking it was very good. I was reading it as a dark comedy, framed by a blank protagonist in a fundamentally ridiculous situation. The humor--genuine though presumably unintended--came from the contrast of the stylized language forms and general etiquette focus and how cruelly people acts. See in particular the treatment of Jane in the devil child scene, in the way that's she stiffly defends herself as opposed to how the school argues she's a literal follower of the devil, and how that's a bad thing. Amusing, in a twisted sense, at least as I took it.Where I stopped being able to do this was precisely the point that the horrid and creepy Mr. Rochester became crucial to the story. He was a fundamentally twisted, harsh and disturbing person in his own right, and the eventual arc of the book where Jane does marry him and this is apparently a good thing fatally undermines the book. The way Jane plods on is problematic in itself, but it's what he ultimately plods to that is truly wrong. Rochester's focus on pride and control, his lies, his age, his borderline-deranged manner of fixating on women, the fact we have only his own word on the true story with his first wife, all these make Jane's eventual marriage with him very far from a happy thing. Yet the book seems insistent to regard it in this light, as if Rochester's injury has in itself transformed his character enough that Jane waiting on him for the rest of his life a satisfying resolution. It's the ending scenario that makes the conclusion of the author and the whole structure of the narrative less than even good.Nevertheless, the novel is an accomplishment in a number of ways. That it exists at all, that early in the nineteenth century a woman could be published. Furthermore, it's extraordinary that she was able to include so centrally in her work a protest and anger against the systemic condition of women of her time, and that both elements have been perpetuated down into the present. Creepy as some of the above subtext is, that's a worthwhile development amidst what was a pretty terrifyingly close-minded century.There's also some interesting stuff at work with religion, class and attitudes in the nineteenth century context, Jane occupying a bit of a hybrid position in all of these, not affluent nor truly destitute, not tightly religious or a firm skeptic. The hybridity of her position is very revealing to a lot of norms that we might not see in novels of the period, as her very existence in the text portrays social structures even while it undermines them. Jane Eyre the character and book are transgressive in certain ways, then, and the way this plays out is interesting. Yet, I find this appealing and informative more in my hat as historian than as a reader. The book is quite revealing of the cultural context of the author, but that's going to be the case for almost every book ever published, and it's notably less effective in framing the context for its invented narrative, cast of characters, and atmosphere. I could forgive a lot more in this book, and even come to value much of it, if it weren't for that ending that pushes the whole thing into a disturbed romance. However the book does, and so let it rest.Jane Eyre reminds me of and is better than: Bronte's Wuthering HeightsJane Eyre reminds me of and is worse than: Shelly's Frankenstein"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've never understood why everyone lavishes so much praise on this book. It is the most overrated book ever.One of the most fundamental things a book has to do is hold the reader's interest, and in this aspect, Jane Eyre fails. To be fair, it is utterly gripping throughout the first ten chapters. After that, the quality of the book falls off sharply. The rapid pace becomes boring repition of having to go through thirty pages of nothing to get to a page or two where something actually happens, then another 30 pages of nothing.It's kind of a shame really, for a book that started out as well as this one to crash and burn the way it does. But it happens, and what we are left with is a dreadfully boring book that continues to have praise heaped on it for reasons I will probably never fathom."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte talks about a young lady, Jane that reminds me of Cinderella. Both of her parents died when she was little, so she was raised by her wealthy Aunt Mrs. Reed. Like Cinderella, Mrs. Reed favors her own children rather than Jane. This book shows how the need for Love can cause so many complications in Jane's life.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane off to a school named Lowood. This gave Jane a chance to be independent and live her own life. She soon made a good friend named Helen, who always encouraged her when she feels down. When Jane found out that Helen is sick from a disease called consumption, she rushes to see her. Helen soon died in Jane's arms, which made her feel sad because she had just lost a good friend. There was no one there to make Jane feel better anymore. This was the first complication in her life.After a couple years at Lowood, she became one of their teachers. After two years of being a teacher at Lowood, she wanted to experience something new, so she arrives at Thornfield to teach an eight-year-old French girl Adele. Mr. Rochester was the owner of Thornfield. Jane saves Mr. Rochester from a fire caused by a servant and secretly falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When Mr. Rochester brought back a beautiful young woman Blanche to his house, Jane developed a huge tub of jealousy towards her. Jane couldn't stop thinking what would happen with Mr. Rochester and Blanche. Jane was forced to attend a party where Blanche and her mom were there also. They didn't treat her very nicely causing her to leave the party. While watching Mr. Rochester and Blanche together, she thinks they would get married soon. This made Jane think that she should maybe let go of the feelings she had for Mr. Rochester. Her love for Mr. Rochester was the second complication in her life.Jane founds out later on that her Aunt Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke. Jane tries to relieve the hatred her aunt has for her, but she didn't want to and soon died. This made Jane sad because she barely had a chance to talk with her aunt and say good-bye. Jane didn't want things to end how it did with her aunt because it's not a good feeling knowing someone still hates you after they die. This is another complication to her life.Mr. Rochester bumps into Jane in the garden, and they started walking together. Mr. Rochester tells Jane that he is thinking about asking Blanche to marry him. This caused Jane to turn into a jealous woman. She quickly tells him how much she loves him and stunned to find out that Mr. Rochester actually wanted to marry her and not Blanche. She didn't believe his words. Mr. Rochester explained that he only said he wanted to marry Blanche to see what her reaction would be. Jane happily accepts and agrees to marry Mr. Rochester. Mrs. Fairfax doesn't agree with the marriage because she views Mr. Rochester as a proud man and too old for her. Jane was very uncomfortable hearing those words from Mrs. Fairfax. Jane began to have weird dreams of her children dying or crying for help which causes her to be more uncomfortable for she doesn't know what is happening and why she is having such dreams. Despite what Mrs. Fairfax said or the dreams she's been having, she still wanted to marry Mr. Rochester because she loved him very much. They were walking down the aisle ready to be announced husband and wife when someone announced a secret that ruined the whole evening.Will Jane ever find happiness and love or will she be lonely with no one to care for her? Read to find out if this will be the end of Jane and Rochester's love for each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane EyreI liked the book. i thought it was neat how the author wrote it as an autobiography. it was pretty interessting.like how the girls were treated in lowood school ws upsetting, and how she meets Mr. Rochester...

I don't think that I liked the character of Jane very much. I understand that she was mistreated and that she also lived in the 1700's but I still think that she was rude. She had no confidence and no pride. She would not let people love her and treat her nicely. When Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him and then wanted to take her out and buy her a nice dress and jewlery, she acts so coldly towards him that it makes me sick. Maybe I didn't like her character because I have self confidence and am very opiniated. Neverthless, I still believe that Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, I don't love or hate many characters, but I hated Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read this book for an english project and I got a 60% on it cuz I trashed the book. All i said was that the classics are not going to be so appealing to modern &quot;young&quot; readers like myself today because the &quot;novel&quot;(not jane eyre, read this literaly) has suddenly risen so much in content, state and depth. I dunno, perhaps if i was living during that era i would have appreciated the book more, but living in the 90's where you have authors such as atwood there's no competition and you really can't compare novels written before the 20th century to novels written in the 20th century anyway. Like a majority of the classics, the plot is almost always predictable and characters are indeed relatable but hell, boring! charles dickens is probably the most boring writer i've ever come across (no offence to all u dickens fans out there) and jane austen comes pretty close to him,though her books have a longer attention span. And the brontes, they're on the same level. I am not saying that the classics are bad cuz i know that if it weren't for these authors, we'd be nowhere in literature as we are now. However, my argument in my project was that books have suddenly become more interesting thru the years.

Why the heck would she marry that weird, bad-tempered, hairy scary man? If I found out that my fiance had kept his insane first wife in the attic and not told me, I'd file for divorce! He's bossy, unreasonable and mean. Why'd he pretend to wanna marry Miss Ingram?

I was squirming around and restless for Jane to get over herself and her ridiculous moral stand--I just wanted her to get her a** back to Edward where she belonged! I was TOTALLY against her when she refused to marry him--it really made no sense to me. I just didn't think that he had done anything wrong. He was such a victim. Poor Edward Rochester.

It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me.

Every couple of months since then I take out my used Jane Eyre book and am again mystified. The novel is a story about a woman's journey and finally to true love. Both Jane and Rochester are the best of kindred spirits, and it is Jane's own bright spirit that is never tainted by \\"passions\\" and whims.

I ended up reading it right away and devouring it. I absolutely loved this story and the writing was so beautiful and thought provoking and I immediately thought to myself &#34;THIS is what a writer should 'sound' like&#34;. I want my daughter to read it because I take away from the story that it is okay to be yourself, to be humble but proud of being who you are. To be true to yourself and be strong and though difficulties come your way, you can and will get through them. I wish I had read it when younger and had made it a part of my references as I grew and to have it to fall back on in my mind but I didn't but I am sure glad I have finally read it and now I look forward to also watching a movie about it that I found :).

In fact, someone pointed out to me that her childhood dragging on and on helps you suffer with her and gives you a lot of sympathy for the character (Thanks Miriam!). Oddly enough, when I read this a second time before I saw the movie, I found the beginning went a lot faster. So you'll have to judge for yourself if you like the pace, but either way the beginning is worth it.The movie adaption of Jane Eyre by Focus Features was very well done and I really liked it. They were especially faithful to the characters. A few of my favorite scenes got left out, but I liked the characters so much I forgave them.

The point which haunted her was during the orphanage her aunt has consigned her to: she kept thinking those who are talented are destined for greatness, but her best friend with the fair hand was let off and killed. That was the most disappointing part of her youth and haunted her to no end and no beginning. She most willingly settled to be with a mocked up version of male counterpart of her friend from youth as repairing the damages she saw but could not escapes. Who could not but questioned her senses on why would she not accept the person who she is, but she tries to escape her own drawing ability and let the skinny girl have the crown, in the end, she makes up by letting her of all the grieves with which she felt as a child and watches another woman die in her own care. In fact, she condone murder twice to marry into her unloved imagination. I am not sure if in fact, when love being equal, she herself is any more sane and/or shameful for her desire to escape the part of her soul that does not want to see her friend as gone awry, but she could have chosen to say no, to the man who has thus found her to be a willing body for his child in custody. So the subject became the unacceptable girl and her mother became more of disowned love tale's antagonist. I don't believe the author hints at polygamy, but it wanted to be so to satiate its own desire to compete with all the other females at all cost for a chance at marriage."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this book when I was 13. She said that it was a great classic for girls and that I would love it. And so I did read it and love it, but now I'm amazed that I got through it. I don't have a copy of it anymore, so I read some of it on-line, and I was surprised to see that the writing is rather ponderous and even tedious. I'm amazed at the length of some of the sentences. When I was young, I didn't worry about difficult words. I certainly never looked up unfamiliar words in the dictionary because I didn't want to destroy the momentum and flow of the story. I could usually tell from the context the meaning of the word. I'd been told that it was an exciting story so I buckled down and forced myself to get into it.Before I knew it, I'd put myself in Jane's shoes, and my own life started to look really good in comparison. Terrorized by the family who raised her, abused by the administrators of the school she attended, my heart was bleeding for her and then, finally, she received some emotional sustenance from a caring, understanding teacher and a saintly, loving classmate.When she goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess for his \\"ward,\\" Adele (actually his illegitimate child), she is a love-starved, vulnerable young woman. Worldly Mr. Rochester has been around shall we say, and his heart has been hardened by various circumstances in his life. However, Jane's goodness, innocence, and intelligence win him over. They fall in love and wish to marry.But remember this is a gothic novel, and there are mysteries in the big house they inhabit. Screams can be heard coming from the attic. There's a fire one night. Strange laughter can be heard on occasion.Suffice it to say, they're not allowed to marry--as they're about to exchange vows a man storms the church and insists that he can tell why the couple should not be allowed to marry.Jane goes away, she nearly marries someone else, and then one night she believes that Rochester is calling her...Enough said, this is the sort of information my mom gave me when she was seducing me into reading this book--a Cinderella sort of heroine falls in love with an older man who lives in a big spooky house--that was enough for me. I proceeded to make my way through all those long sentences and was richly rewarded at the end. I can tell you that this isn't exactly a fairy-tale ending but it's more happy than sad. Very poignant. You'll cry, but you'll be so happy that you shared Jane's misery and witnessed her happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, \\"What amd I doing reading a gothic romance\\", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it!

I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \\"passionate\\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \\"coincidences\\" which might have been classed as \\"providence\\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \\"coincidences\\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Got this book for my daughter.

Jane is such a strong character and considering the time this book was written, its amazing to me. Mr. Rochester is such a protype of the male hero we see now. It is one of those books that make me want to cheer the characters on, weep with them when terrible things happen or slap the living crap out of a certain male cousin. One of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I love this book! It is full of so many wonderful characters whom she describes so wonderfully. The story is full of woe and sorrow along with love and beauty."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be more than ready to assert that there is more to this novel than just a protracted love story. There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \\"syrupy-ness\\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"if i had to say anything about jane it would be that she seems to revel in pain. the injustic of her childhood caused it i suppose or, perhaps, she was always that way. was rodchesters wife crazy before she was locked up? or did locking her up make her that way? well, jane seems to like to be in pain and rodchester seems to like to cause it, they make a happy pair. it was a dark book with a happy ever after, as happily ever after as a dark book can be.the book was interesting, clear and well written though something of a slow read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"With an unexciting introduction of Jane's abusive childhood, Jane Eyre later develops into a dramatic struggle in search of autonomy and love. The story constantly shifts between poignant moments in Jane's life and triumphant ones. Like a typical classic, the novel starts with an abusive childhood and ends with a happy marriage. As mundane as it may sound, the story is unique and the reader grows to respect Jane for the hard choices she makes.Jane struggles to choose between her passionate love story and desire for independence, asserting that satisfaction results from a balance between emotions and desire. Jane develops from a miserable and mistreated child, to a well-respected and independent woman after she learns to discern between passion and reason.Jane decides to flee Thronfield and escape from the luxurious style of life to find her identity. She sacrifices her true love for Rochester and prefers starvation in order to flee from passions and desires. Yielding to her emotions would cause Jane to be a prisoner in her own eyes.Jane's social status does not compare to Rochester's wealthy possessions. When Jane, however, becomes rich, from an unexpected heritage, she willingly returns to Rochester, after having balanced between morals and passions.When Jane finally leads a comfortable life, she refuses to yield to reason, choosing love instead. Jane refuses St. John's proposal because she finds it necessary for her to choose love and happiness over the ideal woman society expects of her. Jane once again leaves her previous comfortable life in search for her true love. Even with Rochester's physical and social deteriorating conditions, she is able to find true love because she balances between desires and expectations. Jane's sense of freedom is to not yield to the position she is in if her conscience and desires are not both satisfied.Adding to its thrills, the Gothic character of Bertha Mason portrays the dark romanticism movement of the era in the late 19th century. Setting the house on fire, and tearing Jane's bridal gown on her wedding night, she is the conflict that tears Jane and Rochester apart. She also causes Rochester's blindness and loss of his house. She is killed in the fire and Jane, much stronger now, is back to compensate Rochester for all what he has suffered."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, written in 1946 by Charlotte Bront, tells the story of an orphan girl who struggles to overcome the hardships that threaten her relationship with Mr. Rochester. After leaving her hateful aunt and cousins, and then her school, Lowood, Jane Eyre travels to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is here that she encounters Mr. Rochester, and the two fall in love. However, the novel is full of surprises and their love does not go untested.The chapters describing Jane's time at Gateshead and Lowood bring to mind characters such as Matilda and Harry Potter. As familiar as it is, the story is still heart-warming and builds up the reader's feelings for Jane for the rest of the novel. At Thornfield Hall, it is obvious that Jane is falling in love with Mr. Rochester. It is less clear that Mr. Rochester has feelings for Jane. After waiting out the suspense, the reader is finally rewarded with Mr. Rochester's proposal to Jane. Jane herself is not excited, and I found myself wishing that she was happier. Even though Charlotte Bronte's foreshadowing hints that something is not right at Thornfield, the horrific revelation of Mr. Rochester's deranged and murderous wife is a twist that surprised me. I was irritated with Jane for her choice of reason and pride over true love, but eager to find out what becomes of her.For one chapter, Jane wanders through villages in Yorkshire, desperate to find work, food, and shelter. I was angry with her for forgetting her parcel on the carriage, and I just wanted her to return to Thornfield Hall. Reluctantly, Jane reasons that returning to Mr. Rochester goes against her pride and sense and she refuses to go back. Eventually, she encounters the Rivers, who provide a place for her to stay. Simultaneously, Jane discovers that she has inherited a fortune and the Rivers are her cousins. Jane is far more overjoyed because she has a family rather than that she is rich.St. John Rivers trying to persuade Jane to marry him is the only really low point in Jane Eyre. These chapters are full of long conversations in which Jane agrees to go with him to India but not become his wife, followed by St. John saying that she must marry him. The same points are debated between the two many times, making this part of the book slow and boring. Finally, Jane leaves the Rivers and returns to Thornfield. I was disappointed that Jane didn't put her foot down immediately because it is obvious she will never marry St. John.Jane does suffer many hardships throughout the book, but Bronte rewards her with a happy ending. I liked the fact that Charlotte Bront wrote the prologue so that it took place ten years later. The reader finds out what happened to most of the characters in the book, including St. John, the Rivers sisters, and Ad&egrave;le. I like books that finish completely, with every loose end tied up, and Bront certainly does this in Jane Eyre. This novel is not a simple love story: it is filled with hardships, gothic elements, and mystery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The plot revolves around Jane as a child to adulthood. Orphaned since an infant, she grows up with her harsh aunt and unpleasant cousins. Around the age of ten, she gets sent to charity-school, where they provide education for the poor and orphaned. The school is run so poorly, many of the students die from meager provisions and disease. Jane survives the hardships of being at school; she would rather be anywhere than her aunt and cousins. She stays until the beginning of her adulthood, where she obtains a job as a governess to a child within the moors of England, namely Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall is owned by Edward Rochester, whose satirical character meets Jane's sharp wittiness, creating an intense bond between the two.Bronte intrigues the reader with the intricate development of the characters, making them truly realistic. For example, the choices she has Jane makes choice that are never straightforwardly done. As she goes through a great deal of obstacles, the author has Jane dwell on them in a heart-wrenching and analytical manner. The characters are also realistic to the Victorian time period in which it is set in. The roles of women and men are clearly distinct to the 1800's. It critically explains the patriarchal domination that she's constantly up against with the men in her life (Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rivers) and England's social hierarchy while in her discovery of the complicated social position of governesses.****SPOILER ALERT****The author also explores a couple themes make the book quite interesting to its readers. One is the concept of morality. Jane decides whether her commitment to her philosophies is strong enough to resist the appeals of Mr. Rochester and refuses to be Rochester's mistress because of her \\"impassioned self-respect and moral conviction.\\" She rejects St. John Rivers' marriage proposal because they were not in love and forgives her Aunt Reed despite the cruelty she had Jane endure. Another was religion, when Jane attempts to gain a balance between happiness and faith. She encounters three extreme aspects of Christianity - Mr. Brocklehurst's strict religious discipline, Helen Burns' submissiveness, and St. John Rivers' commitment to charity and accomplishes stability between the three to help control her passionate personality but not completely changing her true self altogether.*****SPOILER ENDS*****Honestly, from the title and cover of the book, you would think it would be an uninteresting biography. However, Charlotte Bronte's story of Jane Eyre has a great deal of twists and turn of events and constantly keeps the reader interested. The book has it all - a blend of passion, romance, mystery, drama and suspense. I believe this to be one of the everlasting classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is one of the best readings of this book I've heard - and I've heard (and read) the book many times.

Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books. I had to read Bronte's novel for my college English Lit class and at first thought it might not be that interesting seeing as it was written over 200 years ago. The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society. She becomes a sort of female detective and finally discovers where she is meant to me in the end."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I really want to tell you what happens because I thought it was so good!

And I'm thinking maybe it's been a mistake. If only every book could be as wonderful as this one. I really loved it.My copy of Jane Eyre has an introduction by Joyce Carol Oats and I would caution those who don't know this story; do not read the introduction! It will spoil the story. Thankfully I didn't read it until after I finished the book and I am so glad, it tells everything that happens!Jane never forgets that she must love and respect herself first and foremost. She is clever, direct, honest and true to herself even when holding true to her principles costs her dearly.It is a gothic story, dark and heartbreaking full of love, devotion, obsession, isolation and oppression.

Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane to Lowood for free, to an orphan school where she was treated harshly and overworked. Growing up in this school made her stronger. Six years later she became a teacher in the same school where she was treated crudely and her best friend died. Then she decided to move out to a new city, Thornfield.

It's an asorbing page turner, causing you to grunt and yell aloud at the stupidity and density the two main characters seem to live on.

The narrator is a plain girl, who has morals and lives by them(however much it makes you scream). The fancied is Edward Rochester, a genius in his own right, with brilliant plans. The hidden secret-- it's a shock. (Just don't let anyone tell you beforehand).

I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the things that I liked most about \\"Wuthering Heights\\", by Charlotte Bronte's sister Emily, was the \\"scenery\\", the way in which the author conveyed a weather, an opressive environment, a climate of tension and impending doom. In Jane Eyre this too happens, but in a different way. For one thing, the characters move around more and it is not always foggy and rainy. You can actually see the novel like a film, and feel the damp air and the ominous silence.\\"Jane Eyre\\" tells the story of a woman, since her childhood. The orphaned daughter of a poor Anglican priest, she goes to live with his uncle and aunt, but the man soon dies and she is left to live under the iron fist of the aunt, a horrible woman with horrible kids who torment Jane constantly. Of course, we get only her version, since the book is narrated in the first person. After an incident when Jane is left to terrorize in the \\"red room\\", where her uncle died and where she fears his ghost will appear, she gets out of control and sent to an orphanatory. A brief digresson is worth here: ever since she is a child, Jane shows enormous self-assurance and pride. Her strong character refuses to be mistreated, and she reacts even violently to injustice. Her personality will grow through the novel, giving her the endurance to sustain repeated blows of fate. So she goes to the orphanatory, where after a period of incredible suffering and mistreatment, she finds a home and a friend in one of the school teachers (a young woman). She becomes a teacher herself, and when she's 18 she feels the time to fly away has come, so she advertises in a newspaper as a tutor for children. She receives a positive answer and moves to a manor house far in the countryside, the typical Bronte scene in the moors. The job consists in teaching a young French girl, with whom she develops a strong, if not too intimate, bond. But, and it's a big but, there is a mystery. The girl is not (at least not legally) the manor's lord's daughter. He's not even there when Jane is hired. He's supposed to be a stern, unpredictable man near his forties called Mr. Rochester. Finally the man appears, and he and Jane slowly develop a strange relationship. He's initially cold and sarcastic, but somehow he becomes impressed by the girl's strong character, ability for irony, and her unwillingness to be defeated. As time goes by, the other mystery of the house starts to intrigue Jane: in the third floor there's a locked room, from where sometimes come, muffled, a hysterical laughter and incoherent and incomprehensible words. Jane is led to believe it's one of the servants, an efficient but \\"strange\\" person. Subsequent episodes not worth revealing in a review slowly happen, and believe me they are terrifying, Gothic and violent. Little by little Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but it takes time for it to dawn upon her, and at some point, when she realizes, she realizes too taht she has no chance. He's rich, she's a poor thing without a name, heritage or fortune. She thinks he's going to marry a beautiful and arrogant woman from the neighborhood. One day, the horrible aunt gets terminally sick, and Jane is sent for. She shows remarkable ability for forgiveness and stands by her aunt's side until the witch finally dies. When she comes back to Mr. Rochester's house, she will find her Fate, which I won't spoil for you.This rare novel is a jewel. First, because of the perfect construction of the character, indeed a person. Even though unbelievable coincidences happen sometimes in the novel, Jane is created so well that she is totally fleshed out before us. She is rather plain and short, a tiny, seemingly insignificant woman. But in truth she happens to be charming, funny, a little shy but courageous to the point of recklesness. She has a penetrating and acid sense of humor. Jane's life is an example of braveness, of the truly free individual creating his or her own destiny. Sometimes you just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, only to receive a bitter comment. At the time the novel was published, it raised eyebrows for the uncondescending presentation of an independent woman, always figthing for her rights and conscious of her being a free spirit, slave to no one. Jane is easily on of the best created character is all literature. For people like us, usually living in big noisy cities, experiencing life in the moors is a refreshing, even if sometimes terrifying, thing.Finally, \\"Jane Eyre\\", like \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is totally original literature. It comes from the fantasies and dreams of a woman who, like her sisters, lived practically isolated from the outer world, from the inelligentsia and from any literary or political circles. The Brontes were girls from the wild, and lived tragic and Gothic lives which get greatly reflectd in their books. Excellent."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"And each time I still find something new to love. On about the fifth or sixth reading, you finally start reading all those long descriptions word for word rather than breezing through for plot. They're wonderful and frequently humerous. Bronte has a tremendous sense of humor.My favorite things about the work are its humor and how it attacks fundamentalist Protestant Christianity while embracing Christianity. Unfortunately it has little tolerance for Catholicism. But that is only a minor theme and I think Charlotte Bronte herself was much more liberal minded when she was dealing with particular individuals rather than stereotypes. At the very least it is a lesson in the prejudices of her day.Jane Eyre is ultimately a fairy tale. Everything is made right in the end. But it has far more edge than a mere romance. How many romances have ten year olds telling off the fundamentalist ministers who threaten them with hell? How many of them have the eight year old outlive her anger and grow into a generous and forgiving spirit. How many mere romances rely so heavily on playful intellectual banter? Jane Eyre is Cinderella and she is rescued not by beauty and a fairy godmother and pumpkin coach, but by wit and heart."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book was a complete surprise to me.

When her uncle dies, it falls to her aunt to provide her care. Unfortunately, her aunt despises the young girl and eventually finds a way to send the young girl away. The young girl, Jane Eyre, enters a boarding school for girls of less significant means and it is there she can truly begin to take charge of her life and where her adventures, so to speak, begin.Jane Eyre did catch me up immediately and keep me involved through the first half of the book. It moved fairly quickly. However, I thought the story dragged a bit about halfway and throughout the second half. Personally, I found the book suffered from what most Romance era and Gothic writers had an affinity for: why use 5 words when 15 or 20 will do. The novel became wordy and overlong at times and I found myself putting it down for long periods of time. Quite frankly, I think the story is better told in the myriad of movies that have been released. I am quite at a loss as to exactly why this novel is such the classic it is.The character of Jane Eyre bothered me as well, but I think she was more truthfully written and my dislike reflects the wordy nature of the book. Jane is morally strong - and that is to be admired - but she is so emotionally cold - I never imagined her being \\"in love,\\" passionate or otherwise. Even though she states she is in love, there seems to be no passion or fire. What an oddly matched pair! Though, I get the same feelings when I read Jane Austen, so perhaps readers of Ms. Austen's novels will appreciate this one.This novel is not all terrible, despite what I've said. It is engaging, though I think parts can be skimmed. Those who absolutely adore Gothic romance will love it.

Ms. Bronte's writing, while properly structured, lacks any ability to move or inspire a reader. Her character-- for there is only one character, the rest are mere background-- is a selfish brat who eternally whines about the unfairness of the world, except of course when that unfairness works in her favor, when she either glories in other's pain or trying to inflict more upon them. ... Bronte strains one's gullibility often throughout the novel, especially in its conclusion where she apparrently runs out of ideas and starts inserting magic and telepathy into an otherwise reality-based novel for the purpose of bringing the characters back together. She clumsily tries to blugeon the reader into the appropriate emotional state by cutting out any scene which is not miserable (including a goodly eight years in which Jane has friends, a good lifestyle, and a promising career-- the author claims they contain \\"no significant interest\\"), and her lack of subtlety has on numerous occasions given me an actual headache.As to the love story- where is it? The plot of the book consists of two things only: a small child growing up to get revenge on all those who she disliked as a child (everyone), and an adolescent sexual fantasy involving breaking a proud spirit and mutilating it at one's pleasure. (\\"Reader, I married him.\\"--of course HE had nothing to do with it.) Oh, yes, and i forgot: hatred of everything and blindness to all that is good. That's three things, i guess. These bleary tales are obviously the product of a small and vicious person, and I sincerely hope that if another Charlotte Bronte comes into being, she becomes a recluce and leaves us normal, relatively happy people alone. (The original did one, it seems, but not the other.)This book, if it has any value at all, is to show the world the darkness of man's nature. If one wishes such a book, read Macbeth or Lord of the Flies, for at least their authors knew how to tell a story.Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick. Now, if it just so happened that Mr. Rochester was Jane's father, and his wife was her sister...Now that might have sparked a little more interest."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Alright, this book was god awful. The begining dragged on about how poor and oppressed Jane was it was so cliched that i could've guessed what was going to happen next. Most all of the characters were two demensional and the plot was basic. This was more of a character development novel then a plot based novel. I'm not sexist in the least but this is truely a women's novel. The style was sappy and drawn out, and it was to much of a love story. I'm not trying to be macho but gentlemen don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Erye is a girl who is adopted by a wealthy and mean step-mother.

That said, I think I'll offer a different perspective than the rest of the reviewers. That perspective is that this book is one of the most boring, bland, lifetime-ish wastes of paper known to (wo)man. To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy. Somehow, this got to be considered a literary classic about feminine empowerment.

Jane is smart and witty, and her dialogue makes for a very enjoyable read. The language, however tricky it may be, is wonderful and wraps around you, taking you back to 1800. The romance between Jane and her master Mr. Rochester is a classic, and Jane's story is one that all should be a part of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a truly excellent book. I find that I enjoy Charlotte Bronte's writing more than Jane Austen (who is very wordy and could have used a good editor). The strange circumstances surrounding Mr. Rochester and his first wife, and the romance between Jane and Rochester make this book a very enjoyable read. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I gather this is required reading at a lot of high schools these days, and I'm sure that a lot of today's high schoolers do indeed think of it as a drag. It sure doesn't have to be, though, if you read from a larger perspective.To fully appreciate today's world, it helps to understand the attitudes and experiences of the past, and JANE EYRE is one of the novels that helps us understand.The book takes an orphaned girl taken in by an unloving aunt, and follows her into an unhappy school experience and ultimately into as good a career as a woman of that time and station could hope for, that of governess.Well, this is one of the earliest gothic novels and true to the genre, you know the girl's going to fall in love with her employer who, unfortunately, has a deep and dark secret.There's tragedy of sorts here and there's triumph, all told against the mores of a bygone era. There's much to learn and to enjoy here if you open up to it. It is dated, and not 100% relevant to today's life, which is why I give it four rather than five stars.It may be helpful to read and compare JENNA STARBORN to JANE EYRE. The former pales horribly by comparison, but by setting the story in the future, today's reader may gain a better understanding of the original story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I will be honest, the first fifty pages of Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are tough to get through, the story moves slowly as Bronte sets up the plot and introduces us to many of the major characters. I will get back to this in a minute...&quot;Jane Eyre&quot; tells the story of Jane, who is orphaned as a child and must live with her terrible aunt, who decides to send her off to Lowood School in order to learn discipline. Jane is unlike other girls, she describes herself as plain and boring and after leaving Lowood, she decides to take on the job of governess at Thornfield Hall.This brief synopsis is all that happens during the first part of the novel, but after this, Bronte creates a story that is mesmerizing and full of intriguing symbolism and a surprise plot twist at the end that was completely unexpected. I loved Bronte's play on names: Jane Eyre, Helen Burns, Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield Hall, etc. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are at once heartbreaking and romantic, including my favorite scene in the garden (the details of which I will not give away).It's easy to be tempted to give up on 'Jane Eyre' because of the slow beginning, but once Jane begins her job as governess, the novel comes alive as Bronte weaves the intricate plot that is full of joy, sorrow and bizarre occurrances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A true classic, I found an old copy in my mothers house and devoured this book one hot summer. It has been made into several motion pictures, the most recent of which being in 1996 starring William Hurt.The heroine of the novel, Jane Eyre, ends up in a strict boarding school after her parents die and her only living relative, and aunt, can no longer stand her 'wickedness'. She endures hardships at school, and the school mistress tries to dampen her passion and opinions.Jane does not lose her spirit, she merely hides it behind her plain face and grows into a proper lady of her station. She graduates from school and takes on a position as a tutor for a young French girl, the ward of a Mr. Rochester. She is given a room in his large house the likes of which she has never seen in her former spartan existance. She falls in love with the little girl as well as Mr. Rochster.Rochester is hiding a tragic secret however. One that he kept from Jane and everyone else for many years. The truth is finally exposed and Jane is heartbroken. This, however is not the end of our tale. Their love does not die, and the end of the novel is poignant and romantic. I guarantee it will have you in tears.Charlotte's writing is beautiful, moving, and descriptive. She is unmatched as a mistress of character development."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte created quite an admirable heroine. Jane Eyre is, without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable heroines of all time. Also, the love story has a modern quality that tells the reader that this book was ahead of its time.As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre had to endure many adversities in order to secure her status as a governess in the home of Mr. Rochester, a temperamental man with a dark secret -- a secret that could destroy the powerful bond he'd had with Jane Eyre.This novel has revolutionized romantic fiction; it has influenced many writers. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite heroines; I will always admire her courage and independence. I applaud Charlotte Bronte for having invented such an unforgettable character. Jane Eyre has found a special place in my heart -- and on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I just read in the second-to-last review that the reader (from suburban D.C.) never met a man or a boy who liked this book. Well here's one! I am 23 years old and have just finished it for my literature class, but it's not unprobable I would have read it otherwise anyway, sience it is a classic. Anyway, I first of all think it was very well written with a fluent language. The main reason why I enjoyed it so much, though, is because of the way the writer seems to understand and symphatise with her characters (which are all very real), even for the ones that have faults she condemns. You might think I, being a man (or a boy), could not identify with Jane, but in many ways I could. Maybe because Charlotte Bront is so superb in making her literal world coming alive, that I almost feel I'm there myself, or maybe just because Jane Eyre is the kind of person you'd want to be."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a plain woman in looks, but her intelligence, strength, and feistiness make her a heroine who I think gives much-needed justice to women of her time. She is a spitfire who makes you want to know her and hear her story, and she tells it in a clear, first-person fashion that makes it an easy story to read.Orphaned at a young age, Jane is sent to live with her aunt and cousins, who abuse Jane physically and mentally for ten years. Eventually ejected from her aunt's household on false charges of thievery, Jane is then packed off to Lowood, a charity boarding school whose conditions were deplorable; students were scarcely provided with food and clothing (think Oliver Twist), and were regularly terrorized by the school's cruel headmaster. If that weren't enough, Jane's only real friend at Lowood dies during an outbreak of Typhus.Fast-forward eight years - Jane, still nearly penniless after a two-year stint as a teacher at Lowood, ventures out to make a life for herself as a governess. Her charge is a precocious French child named Adele, with whom she develops a fast friendship. But the real story of Eyre lies in her relationship with the child's foster parent, Mr. Rochester, the dolefule, aloof, yet passionate and somewhat mysterious master of Thornfield. Despite their differing castes and the 20 years separating their ages, their feelings for each other grow deep, and they decide to marry. But it doesn't go exactly as Jane had planned - their wedding ceremony is stopped when it is revealed that Mr. Rochester is already married - to a madwoman whom he has kept locked up in one of Thornfield's bedrooms for years!Horrified, Jane flees Thornfield, ending up a beggar on the streets because she spent her entire savings to leave. Eventually taken in by a clergyman, St. John Rivers, and his two sisters, Jane makes a new life for herself as a teacher. During this time, Jane finds herself the sole heir of her father's estate. Soon after, St. John proposes marriage to her repeatedly, but Jane finds his cold demeanor lacking in comparison to the man she truly loves, Mr. Rochester. (She also finds out that St. John is actually her first cousin - a staple of this genre, it seems.) Prompted by hearing Rochester's voice calling her name during a prayer for guidance, Jane returns to Thornfield, only to find it burned down, and Mr. Rochester blinded by the fire his wife set before killing herself. Naturally, Jane and Mr. Rochester live happily ever after, but if you think this is merely another sappy love story (which I am no fan of!), you would be wrong. In Eyre, Charlotte Bronte shows us a depth and realness of characters which you would be hard-pressed to find in any other novel.Do yourself a favor by reading it - you'll understand why it's considered one of the finest examples of English literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's fine novel has been ill served by its thousands of formulaic romance imitators over the decades. Though it is the model for many a successor novel with an innocent heroine, a surly ugly-handsome hero with a secret, a big house with a monstrous creature in the attic, it confounds them all by having more substance and staying power than any.The love story at the heart of the novel must be founded on real experience, the depiction of the growing attachment between Jane and Rochester is so specifically poignant. The emotional crash and long period of recovery Jane suffers before she reunites with her beloved is also heart rendingly real to anyone who has ever suffered through such a loss. The gothic trappings of the story heighten the dreamlike intensity, but it is the solid reality at the foundation that make this novel stay and stay and stay.There's nothing cheap here about Janes sufferings and something magnificently strong about her victories. She does not just 'get her man.' She lives to be fully her best SELF. And this makes her triumph wholly honorable and beautiful.When I was 12 or 14 and first read this novel, I thought that I could never have forced myself to run away from the man I loved into the starving unknown. Jane's integrity -- not, by the way really principally a religious integrity, but rather an integrity of self -- knows that the man she loves truly would have come to despise her if she agreed to be a mistress. Author Bronte shows us this when she shows Rochester fantasizing taking Jane off to live with him 'on the Moon' . . . he knows himself that his project is merely a fairytale he's spinning to take himself away from his unpleasant reality.This very kind of confrontation between the integrity of self and the demands of the world she lives in--sometimes as a helpless child, and later as a strong willed but penniless runaway, and later still as a woman of independent means--tell the real under story of Jane Eyre that makes her a great heroine and the story a great novel and not just a cheap bodice ripper.Jane revisits every single scene of abuse, defeat and humiliation in her past, and through the strength of her own character, triumphs. Her cruel Aunt Reed, still a difficult and unkind woman on her deathbed, she quells with forgiveness; she outlives her miserable existence as a deprived child in an ill-conducted school, to become a teacher in that same school, reformed; her dark night of the soul and self-exile from her love is a time of utter destitution that she manages to turn into a home, worthwhile work, an inheritance of fortune and family, and another proposal of marriage from an unexceptionably moral man. When she has achieved all this, NOT because she knows anything has changed back at Thornfield Hall, she feels free to obey her deepest self--the self governed most by love- and returns to see what is become of Mr. Rochester. Only when she really truly acts solely from desire and not from need, only when she has a place of her own to stand firm in the world, does she hazard her return. None of these scenes, the ones that I hurried over as a teenager to get to \\"Reader, I married him\\" merit a slurring glance. Jane is growing stronger all the time. She never, from first to last, changes a bit from that deep essential person who loves intensely and desires love returned more than anything. But she becomes clearer and more secure in her ability to live out that self, as she heals and strengthens the other wounded parts of her life.As it's a novel, there are grand coincidences that make it all work out. Read it through once and notice the role played by her Uncle John Eyre, who never appears in any scene, but operates, like Providence, from afar. He's prevented from helping her in time to ensure that she must seek her living as a governess, his vigilance intervenes when she's about to be falsely married, his benevolence finally comes through with an inheritance and relations just when she needs them most.This is a wonderful story, and even as I get older, it does not 'get old.'"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"\\"It is best to be yourself, imperial, plain and true.\\" Robert BrowningAnother chick Brit classic that I had been eluding since my teen-age years and finally got around to perusing this past month. In all fairness to our fellow reviewers who panned this one, I wouldn't have enjoyed this when I was in high school (nor even in college for that matter) either and would have needed a dictionary along with a barf-bag if I was required to read it back then. I have no idea why teachers continue to shove such classics as this down their student's throats when the great majority of their budding brains, inexperienced hearts and raging hormones make it virtually impossible to fully digest at such an age. However, that is a topic better tabled for another time...To describe this beautiful work as simply a love story would be doing it a grave injustice. While it is arguably one of the greatest love stories ever known in literature (I actually prefer \\"Jane Eyre\\" over her younger sister's classic \\"Wuthering Heights\\"), it is so, so, so much more than that. This 1847 masterpiece is an important history lesson as well on what it was like living in provincial England way back when. It touches upon such common themes as morality, religion, gender relations, Social status, friendship, education, etc... A story such as this can relate so much more about the past than most text books will ever tell us, while at the same time making the whole learning experience a joy as well.Of all the past heroines I have had the pleasure (or sometimes the disdain) of being introduced to through my literary travels, it is almost impossible to think of one that possessed a bigger heart and more passionate soul than C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. I found her to be much more interesting and even brighter than James' Isabel Archer, without the latter's pretentiousness. She is way more down-to-earth and less judgmental than Austen's Elizabeth Bennet. She is much more grounded and has a much stronger backbone than Hardy's Tess. However, what really separates her from all the other heroic belles of invention is simply her burning, incessant quest to find love and to be loved in return. Not just romantic love, like Flaubert's Emma B. and Tolstoy's Anna K. but REAL sustaining love, the kind that brings value and a sense of belonging. The sincere kind that comes from not having to sacrifice (as the above mentioned did) one's own principles and ethics. It is this noble and true love that never dies or withers, because it is genuine and magnanimous, without any kind of contrivances whatsoever. Jane never sold out and held steadfast to her beliefs and values, and in the end, well... you'll have to discover that on your own!You don't need me to rehash the book's plot. You can read other people's reviews to do that. All you need to know is one thing - if you haven't had the pleasure yet of meeting Ms. Eyre and you love literature, then please do yourself a favor and order this one today. If this isn't a five-star classic, then I'm afraid I don't know what is!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students.

Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty.

Jane is treated less as a part of the family, and more of a servant in her aunt's household. Dragged into the room of her uncle's death, for fighting with her cousin John Reed, and suffers a mental breakdown. Doctors suggest that Jane be sent to the Lowood Boarding School for Girls. The school proves to be of little comfort to as she finds that the conditions there, under the brutal Mr. Brocklehurst, are barely an improvement on her living conditions at home. The school embracing the poverty as way of life and the girls barely getting by was completely under the thumb of Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane's only relief from the burden of hardships at the school is her dear friend Helen, a kind young girl, who imprints in Jane a measure of Christian patience for the pain, which she has endured in her childhood. An outbreak of typhus prompts many of the girls to leave, but Jane to remain as a teacher at the Lowood School. To expand her horizons, she accepts the position at Thornfield manor, caring for the sweet, French ward of the dark and brooding Mr. Rochester. Despite her best efforts to the contrary, Jane falls in love with her employer. What secrets lie in Thornfield manor? Why does Jane often feel like she isn't getting the whole story? As Jane begins to realize that things aren't as they appear in Thornfield, she is forced to leave the manor, her young pupil, and Mr. Rochester behind. But can she stay away from her true love for long?Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who was born on 21 April 1816. In 1824 Charlotte and her sisters were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. Within a year her sisters died of consumption and their father removed Charlotte and Emily from the school. The critical depiction of the school at Lowood in Jane Eyre drew on Charlotte's experiences at Cowan Bridge and her eldest sister, Maria, was the inspiration for the character of Helen Burns. In 1847 she published Jane Eyre under the pseudonym of Currer Bell. In 1854 she married Arthur Bell Nicholls and died shortly after due to complications with pregnancy.Jane Eyre is definitely a book everyone should consider reading. It helps define some many things including: love and independence. The entire time Jane pulls you on the emotional roller coaster of life. You go up and down with her through her love of Rochester. This book brings you into it so quickly that before you know it you are crying at the end too! And that's the kind of book you want, the kind that makes you feel like there is nothing quite as beautiful as the relationship between the characters.

The notes in the back, however, did just that - I was hoping they would explain a few things that I didn't understand (old usages, etc), but they just notes about how Bronte was referencing other works or about how there was something that showed up later in the book as well.This book is a classic that's remained popular for a reason, though.

While the first couple of chapters are somewhat boring, after that the pace never flags, despite the 500-odd-page length. Many chapters in the book are very intense and moving, and it is not too hard to feel for Jane. I thought she might be a very righteous, prim-and-proper person, but was surprised and delighted to discover that she's very flirtatious with Rochester once they declare their love, and playfully delights in her hold over him. Their conversations are fascinating and very revealing. It is always clear that she is passionatly in love with him and no one else, but still more than willing to leave him once the &quot;terrible secret&quot; is revealed. While not quite as strong and feminist a character as I expected, she nonetheless does show an iron will and desperate desire to do what's right more than once. When someone in the book was talking about a Mr. Rochester and made it sound like he'd died, my heart literally stopped for a minute until I (and Jane) realized the man was talking about Rochester's father. That was near the end, and by then I'd become so caught up in it I really couldn't put it down. It is not just a romance novel for women; I'm a 13-year-old boy and I enjoyed it immensely.

She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I finished reading this book about a week ago, and I've never been able to get it completely out of my mind since, particularly the wonderfully charismatic and passionate Mr. Rochester. (I'll get to him later, though) This is only the second novel I've read that has a main protagonist that is quite similar to me in personality, which is refreshing in itself. (Most novels have spirited, strong-willed people as the main character--not that it's wrong, it just gets boring after around 500 readings.) I identify with Jane because in many ways, for she acts and reacts as I would in her situation. And Mr. Rochester....I fell in love with him with the first chapter I read (which was Chapter 27; I cheated) and have not stopped since. *Sigh, Giggle*These characters are so brilliantly drawn out--no other classic has done a better job of making me feel as if these characters are dynamic people.The prose sparkles--especially Mr. Rochester's, who I find has the gift of turning me into a pile of mush.In short, this is the best classic I've ever read, and the only one that I will definitely read over again and again and again.....(The only one that came close was Pride and Prejudice) No other story has made feel as this one did--this gothic story of passion and love captivates me and will continue to do so.P.S. The only problem I had with Jane's character is when my darling Edward is singing to her, and she is fairly unaffected. I was sobbing on the floor and yelling at Jane at why she was not doing the same thing. Any one else feel the same way?PPS: Some people might say that she is strong and strong-willed, but she is not. Rather, she is strong-principled. She does not have to have her own way, but when it comes to God's way, she is more spirited about it.PPPS: And I am not Dwight Rhodes. I'm his daughter. Couldn't you tell?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Since it was penned by Charlotte Bronte in 1847 (under the male pseudonym of Currier Bell), Jane Eyre has been adapted to the screen several times, including a beautiful BBC Television production scheduled to air soon on PBS, and a musical. I even seem to recall an abridged comicbook version of Jane Eyre. I read the novel when I was 12 years old and was so inspired by it that I read it over many times that year, and never, never forgot it. Interestingly, I am now reading it for the first time since. I have little to add to the other reviews here, but recommend this book to everyone! The author develops Jane's tremendous character, childhood to young adulthood, with economy and care. The early chapters of the book are both painful and lovely to read. The love story that follows is passionate and terribly hard fought. Told in the first person, much of what I experience reading this book, due to our author's skill, is not written on the page, but felt as my own experience. And Mr. Rochester is, if possible, a more brilliant revelation this time around. He is completely compelling and magnetic, humorous and desperate, and sympathetic. The book also provides a portrait of how life was at that time, by the aristocracy and the common man. I have edited this review to add my advice that if you have never read the book, whether or not you have seen any of the film versions, choose an edition without an added \\"forward,\\" or save comments for last, so that do not encounter spoilers and can form your own impressions.Reader, .... read Jane Eyre!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The book Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte is about a girl who is about ten years old, and she lives with her aunt, cousins because her parents had died when she was young.

I borrowed the book from my school library. About four chapters into the book, I returned the novel to the library, and went out that night to get my own copy.I cannot express in words how this novel has touched my heart. The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront? I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

The numerous movie versions of it, including the most recent, never do Bronte's prose justice. I believe all modern romance novels sprang from the Bronte sisters' great works, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Jane Eyre is the more tightly wound of the two. Charlotte spins Jane's interior monologue and her emotional dialog with Rochester into a taut emotional web at the core of Jane, who is a complex and powerful lead character. Rochester is painted as an aloof, arrogant elitist, who is then humanized as Jane's gentler character opens him up.The story itself is masterfully plotted with the same craft and care as the characterizations. Charlotte wastes nothing and no seed planted in Jane's lonely and loveless life early in the novel goes without bearing fruit later in her tale.

It has romance and action. Everything you could want in a good book. This is one of those rare classics that are actually cool."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Whew...I finally finished! I have been holding on to this book since April 2011. It's not because the book was loathsome but because I began to feel as if Jane and I had become friends. As crazy as that may sound, I really hated for this book to end because it felt as if I was parting ways with an old friend.We are introduced to Jane Eyre as a young orphan residing with her uncle's (deceased) wife, Mrs. Reed, and three cousins. Jane was not welcome in their home and was sent to Lowood boarding school. The conditions at Lowood were horrible. Lowood was about survival and Jane soon found out that some didn't. Jane remained at Lowood until she was nineteen where she then transferred to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is at Thornfield Hall where Jane's strong resolve and concrete emotions are put to the ultimate test. Here is where the love story begins. Jane and her new employer Edward Rochester fall in love but not without challenges. Even though it was the perfect fairy tale \\"rich man falls in love with lonely orphan,\\" this is where the story takes a turn. Mr. Rochester has a secret. Just when you think nothing else bad can happen to Jane worse knocks the door down.Needless to say Jane had to flee Thornfield Hall abruptly without any direction or much else. She was stranded, starving, and sick when she ended up on the door step of a family that would nurse her back to health. The Rivers family took Jane in and she began to gain her strength mentally, emotionally, and physically. The family was made up of two sisters and a brother. Jane became instant friends with them all. The brother, St. John Rivers, actually discovered the destitute Jane who had been turned away initially by the family servant. During her season with the Rivers family, Jane received one of the best revelations of her life. Her ending up on the door step of the Rivers home was not a coincidence it was \\"divine\\" intervention. St. John Rivers had other plans for Jane once he had studied her for a while. St. John is very stoic and manipulating individual all under the guise of \\"minister.\\" Jane does not fall for his manipulative tactics and follows her heart back to Thornfield Hall. When she arrives at Thornfield Hall she stumbles upon a shocking and horrifying surprise.Jane Eyre is just a \\"boss\\" type chick (if can describe her in hip-hop terms). She faced some insurmountable odds but all these back to back hardships birthed a certain unexplainable resilience in her. Jane was not easily broken because she was grounded in her faith. Bronte developed a character that we need to encourage all young women to read and get to know. Jane didn't succumb to fleshly temptations but instead she fled and this led to a great rewards. Jane's valley experiences let her to a mountaintop of blessings and real love.This book is a classic that has been reviewed numerous times. Most that read Jane's story count her as an old friend because they have been reading her story since high school. Prior to reading this book, I saw several references to it being \\"gothic\\" and there is even a goth illustrated edition. As I read, I began to think it should be categorized as \\"Christian\\" fiction. I absolutely fell in love with all the Biblical references and how grace and faith played major roles throughout the entire story. Jane Eyre started out an orphan who was pressed on every side by adversity but she grew to be a strong woman that one could liken to the mythical phoenix."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"AHHHH!

Oh, what passion! It tells the story of Jane Eyre, an orphan who goes to become a governess and falls in love with her employer, Mr. Rochester. Bronte doesn't idealize their love, for Jane is plain, and Mr. Rochester, is not found handsome either. \\"Jane Eyre\\" has mystery, romance, and adventure, the perfect kind of story.

I reread it 4-5 times, and finally read the unabridged version when I got to high school and have reread it about 3 times since. Jane Eyre never ceases to amaze and delight me. Having first read the book at such a young and impressionable age, I think Jane Eyre has always been my inspiration. Her courage and spunk are qualities that as a little girl, I most deeply admired and wanted to emulate. It is a wonderful book for young women to read to for its strong willed heroine who nonetheless exhibits all of the compassion and femininity that women must also possess. So much what we teach young women today is, be masculine and ruthless to get ahead in this world. Women should be proud and not afraid to be feminine. That is a power that we possess that men don't."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The book is written in an interesting way, but it was also very difficult to read.

Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...?

You're reading along, you come to a place in the bok that captures your attention. You're completely engulfed by the story, you're not reading it, you're living it!

Your eyes cannot read the enthralling story fast enough. In your frenzied haste to know more, you grip the book tighter and bend it back, cracking the binding.Years later when you pick the very same book up again, you can tell the scary, happy, or sad parts of the book by the location of the creases.

Although I love to read, class-assigned books had a dubious history with me. Most, I felt, were boring or too pessimistic to find favor with me. I had heard many people talk about the book favorably after having read it in middle school. I put my hope in their past experiences and began to read. Although the first pages did not entirely confirm the praises the book had recieved, the book so far surrpassed my expectations that I finished the book in only a few days time! I would have read non-stop if it had been within my means to do so. When I did get the chance to read, I read as much as I could to the exclusion of food and family sometimes!You may be wondering what about this book could make me such a fanatic. Well, I could give you deep literary criticism about the symbolism, the metaphors, or the imagery, but that doesn't really help you enjoy the story more, it only rounds out the meaning. Instead, let me tell you why you want to read this book.This book combines passion and logic. An odd combination that don't often go together. Jane Eyre starts out in life full of passion and emotions, through torture and schooling, she learns to control her feelings and be ruled by logic. As she moves through life she struggles to find a balance between what her emotions tell her and what logic demands. Logic helps her through times when she feels abandoned and emotions guide her back to love when the tables are turned.This book skillfully combines elements from nearly all genre and is sure to please anyone. It has action, romance, comedy, suspence, even the supernatural!

Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest.

(I didn't read much at all for that matter.) And now as an adult I have the fortune of visiting some of the great works of literature for the first time. Jane Eyre was a challenge for me initially because I believed I wouldn't identify with the character much. The more I allowed myself to become immersed in the story, the more I was impressed by Jane's courage of character, even as a young girl.Jane Eyre has an intellectual confidence, noticeable from a young age, which she draws from in order to challenge those seeking to place unnatural limits on her. Her aunt Reed emotionally abused her as a child, and still Jane had enough perspective to fight for her own justice. When she was sent away to a boarding school (with only slightly better conditions than before), Jane suffered further emotional trauma but also learned to thrive in spite of everything. Her negative experiences informed her towards a life of seeking goodness.When Jane finally crosses paths with Mr. Edward Rochester, she faces choices of both heart and mind that few women of that time would be prepared for."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When we first see Jane as a child in the opening pages, we see her as one who is orphaned and left to the not so tender mercies of an aunt who for want of a better term is just plain mean. Jane is made to feel like an outcast by the very ones, who because of their consanguinity should have blessed her with love and affection. As she matures, she is at first pictured as one who must balance precariously between being an obnoxious little brat and one who deserves our sympathy for her state. In the school to which she is sent, first as a student then a teacher, Jane is seen in terms of such purely perceived sensibility that we do not doubt for a moment her own reality, even if we doubt the validity of her external reality. It is this successful ability to create a sharply defined subjective heroine that paves the way for us to equally accept the existence and credibility of the wild, moody, and totally Byronic Rochester. We do not see him as what he truly is: a flat character whose only purpose in the novel is to dash about on a horse and hide crazy women in his dank castle. We see him as Jane does; that is as Charlotte Bronte does, as a real life man from her own days of fantasizing about a teacher who was, to Charlotte at least, the very personification of manliness and virility.Charlotte Bronte also included a number of sociological subtexts that probably ring just as much true today as they did in her day. She presents in chilling detail the child abuse that was rampant simply because not enough people took the trouble to take notice and petition the government for redress. She addresses the male patriarchal attitude that did not allow a young woman to make her way alone in the world except in the accepted role of governess. She also exposes the unwanted issue of what to do about the rights of the mentally ill. As we read JANY EYRE today, we notice the melodrama and the sociological subtexts, but we do not pay them much attention, which is probably just as well. Instead, what we take away from JANE EYRE is the ability of Charlotte Bronte to make us feel the pain of a cruel world, even if we, or Jane herself, can do little about it except to remain as human as we can."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"4.5 stars on this one! This is almost a 5 star book for me - the only reason it's not, is because it's so long.I know it's a classic and all that, but it's just SO descriptive...I ::heart:: the Jane Eyre character and Mr. Rochester as well. It blows my mind that the horrible school/orphanageJane gets sent to is based on the boarding school Charlotte Bronte went to as a child. Oh, and that evil aunt wasjust awful, unbelievably horrible to her, so sad.I just loved the love story in this... such an awesome classic and I ::had:: to read it after reading \\"The Eyre Affair\\"(Thursday Next series) from Jasper Ffordes - it was so fun to understand that book better after knowing this story.And, yay to kindle for giving us classics for free, gotta love that! :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"One of the greatest novels I have ever read. I was just expecting a sort of Gothic romance, but this is so much more. There may be some spoilers in what follows, but I will try to stick to general, thematic terms rather than disclosing specific plot points.Jane Eyre is, above all, a novel about the unity, versus the duality, of mind and body, reason and emotion---or, as Bront puts it, \\"judgment and feeling\\"---particularly as this applies to the Christian religion. Christianity is, of course, committed to dualism, but Bront, though paying lip-service to religion, rejects this, depicting its evil in many of its manifestations. Some of the devout Christian characters she paints as blatant hypocrites, but even those whom Jane respects or even admires, when it comes right down to it, she does not emulate. Jane seeks happiness in this life, here on earth, while even the \\"good\\" Christians are doomed to seek it only in the next, and that by sacrificing it in this one.The basic story idea brilliantly demonstrates Bront's theme: Jane is given the choice of a loveless marriage, or unmarried love. The latter situation may seem a bit contrived to the modern reader, and indeed it seems as though Bront herself feels this on some level, as the passionate appeal of Jane's lover is much more convincing than her reason for refusing him---namely, that the laws forbidding both divorce and adultery must be in place for *some* reason. (That may be generally true, but they clearly don't apply in this case, or make an exception for it.) Even when she is finally able to follow both her heart and her mind, it is only after these Christian principles have resulted in the horrible crippling of her beloved, which damns those principles all the more.In short, Jane Eyre is a book about a woman's struggle to stay true to her whole self---heart and mind---against Christianity's attacks on both fronts. I don't think it was Bront's conscious intention to write a novel condemning Christianity for sundering our hearts from our minds, but only what she viewed as corrupt interpretations of it---yet that is what she did, and it is brilliant. Both her heart and her mind were clearly much more dedicated to this life than the next, as Jane Eyre powerfully demonstrates. This is a novel way ahead of its time, in many, many ways."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Similar in some respects to other Victorian era novels, this one is more exciting than most. Things happen. There is mystery and intreague. Even so, it's difficult at times not to get fed up with the flowery, laborious, self-aware banter that men and women of the day seemed required to engage in. Some of the prose is very clever, and that's always fun to hear. But there are times when you want to just shout: GET TO THE POINT, ALREADY! Nonetheless, there's a few great moments, and it's a fun book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When our AP English teacher first informed us we were to read Jane Eyre as an over-the-summer assignment, my first thoughts were not very positive. Fortunately, as I started to read I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I connected to the story. Jane begins in this bildunsroman as a insecure and naive young girl. She develops into a strong and independant woman, both physically and psychologically. I enjoyed that her relationship with her love, Mr. Rochester, is realistic and not based on the skewed prince charming image that many women project men to be, even during this time period. Jane Eyre is not a book that grips you from start to finish, but it's a very interesting read and a timeless classic that I am sure to read again."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It is said that you accidentally trip on a stone and find it out to be a gem. Jane Eyre for me is something like tripping on a book full of gems. Never in my life, have I ever read for which my heart has so passionately cried, laughed and felt sad. Every page of this book is craftfully written to make you want read the next. Oh, from where does the author gets a vision to make someone cry over what are essentially black inked words. When Jane leaves Rochester to go to the Moors, my heart really sanked into an oblivion. And when she came back was overjoyed as though Jane Eyre is me. Right from the first page till the last, the author has painted a picture. One that induces you to travel with Jane from her childhood to adulthood. A piece of gem, one that you can cherish for ever. As a reviewer had written earlier, it is one that would force you to give up watching that stupid idiot box, it really does. At least it did that for me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Someone below complained that only English teachers were giving this book 5-star ratings. And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Odd, how re-reading a classic can become a meaningful experience. I'm sure I read Jane Eyre at least two times when I was in high school and again at college. Then there were the films, the most memorable being the one with William Hurt playing Rochester. Yet, last weekend when I was visiting friends and had nothing at hand, I looked at the first chapter and thought &quot;I've don't remember any of this,&quot; and was hooked.No wonder this book endures and no wonder that readers are entranced: it is an extraordinary story of an individual's struggle to live in a harsh world, find and create physical comfort and sustain an unacceptable love. Even though the story is intensely atmospheric (food, structures, furniture, temperature, clothes and flora are in constant reference), it is Jane herself who drives the story. Where she will find herself and what she will do next is the surprise. No wonder feminists were interested in this book: Jane never succumbs to anyone's idea of what she should do, she wrestles with decisions and bases her choices (that she insists on having choises is already delightful) on her own moral, social code. Hard choices she makes too and we wonder if she'll manage when, for example, she leaves Thornfield and finds herself forced to beg for food.The writing is sharp and intelligent and...funny too: take, for example, the little girls toppling off their stools during prayers, or the description of Adele's &quot;French&quot; personality. The plot is a stretch but a loveable one. Jane, we are told often, has neither beauty nor stature, the type of person that gets ignored in any social situation. However, this seemingly ineffectual person has two highbrow offers of marriage,inherits a fortune and reaps the bounty of a geniune, loving relationship with the one man who is her intellectual and emotional equal. Not bad for a poor, plain governess in the 1830s.Today, it might be that religion, scripture and even the idea of morality are concepts that carry too much weight for popular fiction. Jane, a level-headed girl, is neither silly nor preachy. That her thoughts are informed with the religious moral tone of the period makes this story more than a romance or tale of finding true love. It demonstrates how conviction is founded."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I throroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Although it was quite lengthy, it was filled with suspense and excitement. I feel that Jane Eyre was a strong, independent and proud character which makes her a great role model for women and children. From when she is only ten years old she already possesses courage, honesty and generosity despite her unpleasant life. Going to Lowood School only adds to her miserable childhood, but somehow she has the strength to overcome it and move on. Even though she is a poor, unattractive woman in the Victorian era she believes in economic and social equality. When she meets Rochester he is amazed at her intelligence, wit and frankness and though he is a man, she is his intellectual equal. When she realizes she must leaves Edward, she is able to resist the temptation of being with him to uphold her strong morals. This is also a very commendable quality that Jane Eyre possesses. Through her determination, she is able to survive poverty and loneliness and find a home with the Rivers. Here she exhibits true generosity when she divides her fortune among her new found friends. Again, she resists the temptation of a good home and safety and leaves St. John to find her lost love. Jane shows compassion when she decides to stay with Rochester for he rest of her life, and nurse him in his unhealthy state. Reading about a woman like Jane Eyre is very empowering and it makes you want to be a better person. Cudos to Charlotte Bronte for a novel very (long and) well written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Lost yet somewhat hopeful, Jane Eyre spent some of her child hood with an evil aunt after her parents had past. Troubled by the haunted shadows that lurk in her mind, young Jane decides that she needs change in her life. Slowly yet surely she does find some happiness which appears to be a struggle. The character, Jane, seems vulnerable throughout the telling of the story. At the age of eighteen, Jane finally presents herself in a newspaper as a governess. As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre is appointed as a governess at Thornfield Hall by the mysterious Mr. Rochester. Her integrity and independence are tested to the limit as their love for each other grows, and the secrets of Mr. Rochester's past are revealed.This story tells of a young woman, Jane Eyre, who makes modesty and plainness appear to be the most noble and admirable qualities in a young woman. She learned over time to be independent and had developed a strong mind. It's almost a romance novel underneath all the inner searching. She struggles through many obstacles and when faced with them, she does what is right for her and no one else. What I liked about it the most is that it was a real person's story to some extent. It glorified female independence and seemed almost like a fairy tale. Jane Eyre becomes someone because she puts in her best effort, not because of a wish, or a dream, or someone else's pity. She made herself beautiful in the way she saw fit.This incredible book brings detail of what's written and both love and sadness that people can relate to. An example of this would be Jane as she was experiencing friendship for the first time when she started school and then had lost someone she's close to. If you're a person who loves romance novels then I recommend this book to you. She is a great role model for women today. And this should be read if over the age of fourteen and up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I am only 12 years old but at least read a book a week.

The passion and surprises are well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I think I like this book for the reasons that make some other people hate it. Jane and Mr. Rochester are not the typical protagonists of this kind of story: Mr. Rochester is not the usual Prince Charming, nor is Jane the usual beautiful princess. He is cold, self-centered and doesn't like children; it is difficult to see at first why she loves him. She is poor, plain and unladylike. A quiet rebel, not a fire-spewing one. She wants Mr. Rochester all right, but under her own terms. All this is narrated with unsurpassed intensity of feeling and beautiful language. The passages in which Jane uses her paintings to reveal her love for Mr. Rochester, are simply exquisite, like when she draws herself as the plain governess that she is, comparing herself with her alleged rival, a gorgeous woman of fashion, or when she draws a portrait of Mr. Rochester in order to have before her &quot;the face of a friend.&quot;A few clumsinesses of the plot can be forgiven considering the times in which the novel was written. For example, Jane receiving a big inheritance coming just from nowhere, or Mrs. Rochester being killed all too timely. At Jane's time, the only way a woman of her condition could be independent was to be independently wealthy, and the only way for her to have that kind of money was to inherit it. Also, if she went back to live with Mr. Rochester (as she clearly intends to do), while his first wife was still alive, most probably the novel would have been considered too scandalous for publication.I have read this lovely book I don't know how many times, and I always find it exhilarating and haunting. Being a fan of Jane Eyre doesn't seem to be considered intellectually glamorous these days, but then, I plead guilty to it. I never get tired of this book, and I don't think I ever will."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, is my hands-down favorite novel. Breathtaking in scope, Charlotte Bronte wrote a novel that is gothically romantic (given the popular style of the day), a commentary on Victorian England social mores, and of forbidden love...breaking the barrier between class. Jane was a feminist, controlling her fate, her life, despite whatever constraints (other people, social, financial) she encountered.Anyone who believes in the dismantling of the welfare state, should read this novel (and Charles Dickens for that matter) to get a better idea of the reality of a world in which &quot;unfortunates&quot; are dependent upon the random kindness and/or charity of others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's easy to understand and it starts to get fun when Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane had to face a tough decision, and she made the decision she thought was right, that makes me love her character even more.

Once of the strongest female characters I have ever read - loved it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As a caveat I must say that I am not a huge fan of the \\"Regency\\" novel. And this novel is so typical of that style of 19th Century British Literature. There is a different view of virtue in the Regency novel. In some novels, virtue is defined as heroism in battle, in others virtue is fidelity to one's morals and integrity. In Jane Eyre, virtue is defined as fidelity to one's class or station in society. And this woman, an orphan and governess by profession, is at the bottom of rural English aristocratic society.The character Jane Eyre is best described, at the risk of being crude, as a doormat. Her only concern is to do whatever is necessary to please those around her. In this heart breaking story, Jane goes from being a student in a school for orphaned little girls to being governess to a Mr. Rochester, who is a rude and self-centered man. Rochester takes a liking to Jane because of her never-wavering devotion to his comfort and ego, so he asks her to marry him. And on her wedding day, she finds out that Rochester already has a living wife, a woman who is chained up in his attic because of her madness. Despite the fact that Rochester already has a wife, he asks Jane to live with him as though Jane were his wife. To her credit, Jane does not agree to this. She has enough self-esteem to run away at this insistence, although she takes nothing with her and is impoverished in her flight.So Jane ends up as a pauper on the doorstep of a random rural English family, only to fortuitously discover later that this family are actually her long lost first cousins. They accept her as family after requiring her to spend a cold winter night asleep outside on their doorstep. Ultimately the young man, who is a parson at the local church, asks Jane to marry him. Jane refuses, not because he is her first cousin (interesting how family relationships were viewed so much differently in 19th century rural England than they are today), but because he thinks of Jane more as a colleague than as a romantic partner. Despite her refusal to marry him, she agrees to travel with him to India as a fellow missionary, but he refuses because he wants her as a wife. She is willing to give up her life in the service of a man who wants only to use her, but then this is the same attitude she had toward Rochester. It is definitely a trend in Jane Eyre's life.In the meantime, Jane learns (also fortuitously) that she is the sole heir of a foreign fortune left to her by a long lost uncle. The fortune would elevate her to a member of the gentry, but Jane, being true to her station and her self-identity as a doormat, splits the fortune with her undeserving cousins. However, at least now she is not destitute. She returns to Rochester to discover that Rochester's crazy wife has escaped her chains, burned down the house, killing herself and blinding him. His future is bleak, but this only makes him more attractive to Jane Eyre. She marries him and rebuilds his house and estate. And, at long last, Rochester sees her as more than a tool. It is a nice ending, I suppose, at least as good as it gets for the Regency novel.It is difficult for a 21st century American to relate to the kind of self-degradation that Jane Eyre not only endures but actively works toward in the face of the prospect of a better life. Perhaps it is a tale of true love, unconditional in the face of adversity. It is also a sad commentary on the social values of a bygone era. If nothing else, Jane Eyre offers an answer to those silly nostalgic people who see 19th Century rural England as some sort of golden era. We can be thankful that, in our era, these kinds of values of self-debasement are no longer acceptable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"THIS IS ABOVE ALL A GREAT AND GRIPPING STORY. JANE IS A PERSON OF COURAGE AND HONESTY. HER ATTACHMENT TO ROCHESTER IS IN SOME WAYS A PUZZLE SINCE HE SEEMS TO BE A LESSER PERSON THAN JANE HERSELF.

I found this novel very similar to Mansfield Park, although there was a little more drama than in Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is, in my opinion, the best book ever written. It is a classic that combines mystery and romance effortlessly, in a writing style that is beautifully unique.Jane Eyre is not a heroine, at least in her own opinion. She's orphaned, but educated; penniless, but not without family: just none that would claim her. She accepts a job as a governess to a young French girl named Adele, a Mr. Rochester's ward, who may or may not be his illegitimate daughter.Thus begins the epic romance between the young, plain governess and her grizzled, older employer. But the question remains: can the overcome the greatest obstacle of all - Mr. Rochester's best-kept secret?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I loved this book. I can say that the begining was a little boring but as you keep reading you feel captivated by all the obstacles that Jane has to overcome in life. It is a beautiful reading that promotes real love and not just superficial love, the characters are not beautiful or perfect and even thought they are described as ugly, you can not help but to fall in love with them and cry or laugh with them. In general a great reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Somehow I managed to get through high school and a minor's worth of Brit Lit credits in college (including a Victorian literature class) without ever having to have read this book or seeing any of the movies, numerous as they are. Oddly enough, a facebook quiz is what prompted an interest in this book that I knew close to nothing about beforehand.This book really captured my attention and it has been years since I have loved a book such as this. I usually don't take an interest in novels where love is a major theme of the book, but this is a fine exception. The author captivates the reader so thoroughly through the titled character it is like being told a story with a literary painting. The style of Charlotte Bronte's writing is beautiful, and despite predictability at times, it does not withhold any suspense.As for the edition of this book, the illustrations in both black and white and in colour from artist Darcy Dame made this a great edition. I really can't say how much I loved the illustrations. There is something dark, haunting, and paranormal to these illustrations which is so fitting of the Victorian era, well-known for their high interest in the occult. When I saw this edition in a store, I knew immediately that this was the perfect edition for me, as I love interesting pictures in books. I also have a certain love for ink drawings, so the images within the pages are very welcome as well. This certainly beats many of the dreary looking versions of this book. Yes, I know, don't judge a book by it's cover, in it's most literal sense, but an interesting exterior never hurts a good novel.As for other aesthetics of this edition: the paper is good and the colour illustrations are printed on glossy paper. This is of course in paperback, but it is very nice for paperback and I'm surprised that it did not cost more. A typical edition of Jane Eyre seems to be in the 300-page mark, but this one nears 550 pages due to the slightly larger font which is very welcome when reading heavier works."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the most fabulous book ever written.

Then you go back to it years and years later and find that not only does it maintain its quality, but it reveals an even further message you might have missed the first time- almost like a whole different story that just helps to illuminate the story you gleaned from it the first time you read it. While I don't find it \\"gothic\\" in the traditional sense, I do see those elements, but most predominate is a story that can be believeable and one which people can relate to on some level with one character or another in today's world. That is why its still a favorite for me after all these years. I consider it a romance novel told through the eyes of a character who does not want to speak about romance; just experiences it. Subtle and refined, but outgoing and with strong convictions at the same time. Same as the character of Jane. And same as Charlotte Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is wonderful!

This is a classic that I think young women will enjoy because it presents a strong heroine in Jane, who faces hardship and temptation as she grows up and later deals with romance and creating a secure, stable position in life for herself.As a man, reading the book for the first time, I enjoyed watching the story unfold through Jane's eyes. Sometimes she makes what I thought were foolish choices, but she remains true to her character. She also maintains trust in God, and I was surprised how many references there were in the book to both Bible concepts and characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Nope, I've never read this book until now. Can you believe it?! One of my goals for 2011 was to finally read the classic Jane Eyre and I am so glad I did! I get nervous reading classics. Alas my concerns were for naught because I thoroughly loved this book and I would highly recommend that everyone read this classic novel if they never have before (or re-read it if they haven't read it since high-school)!Having enticed my book club to join me in reading it since the movie adaptation was coming out in March as well, we had Jane Eyre as our March book pick, so with that I settled in for a classic read. Every time I sat down to read this book it would take a few pages to get back into the language but once I did, it didn't bother me and I totally understood everything that was going on, I just let it wash over me.Jane, how I loved you. You were strong at a time when many women were not. Your life sucked! If you are ever feeling down about yourself, pick this book up because it will make you feel better about your own lot. Poor little Jane did not have an easy start in life but she dealt with her hand and got through it, becoming quite the young little lady.Then she met Edward Rochester. Oh my goodness, brooding, ugly (as defined by Jane), kinda mean to his ward Adele, hiding crazy wives in the attic, Rochester. And guess what, even with all of this against him? We still kind of love him! Jane wants Rochester and Rochester wants Jane, but there are twists in the plot to keep them apart so will they be together? Oh so much angst and pining in this book will be had!Like I said, I am so glad I read it and would heartily recommend it to others.

Jane Eyre, and Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair, are both strong women but in different ways. Jane is selfless, innocent, filled with love and yet heroic. Becky uses people. And she outwits nearly everyone. While they are different types of people, both are strong women who take the initiative.Jane Eyre exposes the narrow mind of the dogmatic evangelical. He wishes to serve God. However he doesn't care much for people. On the other hand, Jane in her own loving and simple way, seems to be a much better person. She reminds me of Dorthea of Middlemarch.This wonderful book should be read by one and all!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"one of my favorite romances. i reread jane eyre at least once a year. just about wear out my copy. good read for all ages.... look for the movie with orsen wells and joan fontain excuse name spelling.. windy"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I read Wuthering Heights a number of years ago and never was very interested in it. I didnt think to explore the other Bronte sisters' works till now - and this book is incredible! The way Jane's emotions are described, her moral struggles, her strength, and the depth of her love, is just moving. I finished this book in two days. The language is beautiful, character development rich, and scenes dont move too slow. Anyone who's been prematurely judged in life or has loved to the point of heartbreak will see themselves in Jane. Amazing. (Oh,and I loved reading it on the kindle - no more wondering what those good old 19th century words mean because the definitions are right at your fingertips!)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"First and formost this is a good classic that should be in every bookshelf. The copy I got was in great shape but the cover didn't match the one pictured. I think mine was part of a set that was sold alltogether when new. Not a big deal unless you are depending on the cover to match other books you may have."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book was pretty good. It was slow at times and there were some pointless parts that I felt didn't need to be there. But this is an american classic and it deserves that title 100%. Good book for those interested in the 1800's or England."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I personally resent both the opinion that teenagers cannot appreciate good literature and the notion that all classics are dull. I read this book for the first time at age thirteen and loved it, and as a huge Bronte fan, cannot fathom why so many people I know cast off classics as boring. My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true. In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin. There may have been other gothic romances similar to \\"Jane Eyre\\" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about \\"Manfred\\", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type. He's sensitive, yet abrupt. Demanding, yet tender. Proud, yet remorseful. Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester. She's tough and stern, yet playful. She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her. And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not). Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. I picked it up off our bookshelf after having run out of things to read, and was not expecting much. I think it was left over from one of my children's school assignments. Anyway, it just grabbed me, and never let go. The plot twists are wonderful (although maybe there is one that is a little hard to believe, but that's why they call it fiction!). Jane's character is one that anyone could identify with, not pretty, not special in any way, and low in the self-esteem area. But through the course of the book, she blossoms, and reveals herself to be a woman of great strength, intelligence and integrity. Her relationship with Mr. Rochester is complex and satisfying. It is the kind of book that will cause you to ponder it for some time to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte is one of my favorite authors of all time. She is praised not only for her beautiful and eloquent writing but also for her captivating stories that fascinates readers of all generations. In this riveting novel that many considered the most prominent literary work of Charlotte Bronte, the life of a 19th century young English woman, Jane Eyre, is portrayed vividly. It is a life of shocking reality, a combination of misery and at the same intrigue and triumphs. Starting from her youthful years, she is met with great obstacles. As a small girl, Jane lived under the scrutiny of her cold hearted aunt, who not only showed bias but also cruelty. Sent to Logwood School at a young age, Jane is cast aside from the other students. Constantly tortured by her teachers and declared as a definite sign of evil and wickedness, she has grown up through a bitter childhood into a woman of great determination and tremendous courage. Striving in a world meant for the wealthy and fortunate, Jane is granted a job as a governess in the mansion of a rich yet mysteriously shrouded man, Mr. Rochester, who only visits the place years at a time. Handsome and prosperous, Mr. Rochester has had his own life of torment, one complicated by deception and remorse, and a shadowed past of beguilement concealed by intricate lies that haunted him for years. Yet, either by coincidence or fate, he unexpectedly went back to his mansion right after Jane's arrival. Inspired and warmed by Jane's calmness and wisdom, the pair soon becomes entangled in a complicated labyrinth of romance mingled with obscurity and dark secrets. With the greatest chance of happiness inches away, Jane discovers a terrifying truth, one that can ultimately destroy ...or save her.Through the main character, Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte graphically woven this book into a world where we, as readers, can all connect to. I highly recommend it to everyone! It is a classic that cannot be put down!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre is a classic tale of a search for human compassion. From the tragedies of her orphaned beginnings and a childhood with a hateful aunt who, out of spite, sends Jane to a prison-like life at Lowood Boarding School, Jane's strength of character shines through. Through each ordeal the reader develops a true concern for this \\"plain Jane\\". When she finally begins to find a more content life at Thornfield and as her relationship with Rochester develops into love the reader feels happiness for her, but follows her through the depths of despair at the shocking revelation that prevents her from marrying him. The reader cheers for her as she rebuilds her life as a strong, independent woman who is able to choose her destiny.Jane Eyre is a beautifully written book, although at times Charlotte Bronte's descriptions were very wordy and therefore the reading process was difficult. Understandably, this descriptive style of writing was typical of an era in which the average person did not have the opportunities we now have to envision different people and places."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte takes a plain Jane, and makes her one of the most memorable characters from the likes of Bronte sisters. This novel starts at a boarding school, as we learn of Jane's painful childhood, grows into an exciting love story as governness Jane falls for Mr Rochester, (whose daughter she tutors), and after a lot of twists, drama, separation and engrossing trains of events Jane finds home, love and happiness.I have had read the abridged version at age of 11, and loved it then. Over the years, I have repeatedly reread the novel. Like all classics, everytime I read it, it offers an array of previously unfelt emotions and of course remains as enchanting as ever. To say very least, it is like your favorite soap opera that you watched while growing up, has characters and events you nearly can never forget, and due to its ageless charm, you revisit those times and emotions through all the reruns and remakes. Maybe the weight of my years of association makes this novel unforgettable for me, but trust me, read it and you will definitely feel the romance, the pain, the emotion, the passion: and maybe like me, return to read it again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a touching love story from the 19th century. Within the first few pages you will be swept up into a poor orphaned girl's troublesome life. Jane Eyre's sorrows, triumphs, and love are woven together in an almost magical way that keeps you reading until the end. There is mystery, suspense, and drama in this book, and also humor and happiness.Jane is an orphan who was raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. She was sent off to a charity bording school called Lowood. There our 'poor and plain' heroine spends eight years. With sad and happy memories from Lowood, Jane departs to become a governess at Thornfield Hall. Little does she know of the mystery in the attic or the love that awaits her.I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good classic. It's really a magical tale that is worth reading over and over again.The reading is moderately hard, it is probably about high school reading level. I loved it, andunderstood it, even though I am in 8th grade.I think that when I finished this book I was slightly changed from what I was when I started this book. I can really relate to Jane Eyre, and that is why I think that girls tend to like this novel more than boys. Also because it is a romance,but who knows, it really depends on what kind of person you are.Jane Eyre is a passionate novel that sketches the way women felt in the 19th century, and what they went through. Jane Eyre's passion pours out of her so strongly, especially in this sentence:\\"...my soul began to expand, to exault, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into an unhoped-for-liberty\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I thought I was seeing things, so I enlarged the picture of the cover: does it *really* say Jane Eyre, by Emily Bronte? I know that it's the thrift edition, but was it necessary to be so thrifty that they credited the wrong sister? Maybe I wouldn't have been so \\"up in arms\\" if this weren't my favourite novel of all time... I still remember reading it for the first time... wondering about the mystery and fear surrounding Grace Poole (don't worry: I've given nothing away). Ms *Charlotte* Bronte has written a romantic, mysterious, heartbreaking page-tuner of a novel, and everytime I get to the last page, I'm bereft. Read it, at any cost...I see that the people who've dissed the novel have largely been *forced* to read it at school etc. Shame that they feel this way, because it's one of the most powerful novels with a woman protagonist that has ever been written.Yes, Charlotte has written what feels to our 21st-century eyes like a romantic piece of pap, but consider this in the context of the time: it was written by a woman (albeit under a male pseudonym initially), about a woman character who was in control of her own life, and able to make her own life decisions, rather than being under the male yoke. This was groundbreaking stuff, and actually manages to subvert the apparent genre. Read from this perspective, this novel is revolutionary, and far from pap.(By the way, if you want to read a *real* Emily Bronte novel, then it's probably Wuthering Heights you'd be after)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I don't especially know why I picked &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; off my shelves recently. It had been sitting there since I read it when I was younger and whilst perusing said shelves for something to amuse myself with, I came across it. I thank the Lord that I did because it's been the best read I've had since &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot;. The plot: compelling and captivating. The narrative: descriptive, philosophical, flawless. The charaters: both believable and lovable. I was so engrossed I found myself getting angry when plans went awry and on the verge of tears when they went right. I recommend that you DO NOT read this while you are young, as a previous reviwer suggested... I did so the first time around and in no way shape or form was able to appreciate its subtleties and sheer elegance to a thousandth of the degree I do now. It IS romance; but even if that's &quot;not your bag&quot;, you'll enjoy the pure power of Ms. Bronte's work. READ THIS BOOK: you won't regret it. Definately in my top 5 of all time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"After her uncle dies, Jane Eyre is grudgingly raised by her aunt (bound unwillingly by a promise made to her husband), in a home where she's constantly reminded of her inferior birth, orphaned state and dependence on her relatives. To top it off, she is of unremarkable appearance and is as poor as a church mouse. Yet there is something in Charlotte Bronte's protagonist that sets her apart from the rest of the world, a sense of self-worth and self-discipline that gives her strength and resilience against the many hardships that she'll face in her lifetime.Charlotte Bronte's story begins with Jane as a young girl, living unloved and neglected amongst the untouchable splendour of Gateshead and the Reed family. Jane's only escape is in her love of books and learning, for her spiteful aunt and cousins have no control over the power of her mind - though reading must be done on the sly as John Reed will stoop so far as to deprive her of books he has no interest in himself. When such an event occurs, Jane summons up the spirit to defend herself against her cousin and is duly punished for it. Estranged from human company, her aunt orders her locked in the red room, the chamber in which her uncle dies and which holds imaginary horrors for Jane. This terrifying experience is the catalyst of her childhood which will be remembered in all frightening and unnatural occurrences henceforth in her life.Relief from her extended family comes only when she is called away to school, and despite the poor living conditions and the zealous religious restrictions of Lowood School's patron Mr Brocklehurst, Jane finds a new outlook on life through her somewhat sentimental friendship with the pious Helen Burns. Amazed at Helen's patience and resilience with teachers that constantly heckle and beat her, Jane discovers Helen's devotion to God which puts to shame her own practice of fighting back at those who wrong her. An important stage in her inner growth, Jane takes upon herself Helen's teachings, survives illness at the school and enters the world as a governess.It is here that the story begins proper (not that the proceedings are unimportant), as Jane takes up a governess position for the young ward of Mr Rochester at Thornfield, stretching her wings for the first time. Here she befriends the elderly housekeeper Fairfax and her young charge Adele, and finally comes to meet her master, the intimidating and elusive Mr Rochester. Sharing a prickly and awkward acquaintance at first, Rochester soon recognises the intelligence and wittiness hiding behind Jane's modesty and plainness. Respect turns to friendship, and from there comes the first inklings of love...But something is amiss in Thornfield in the novel's most overtly Gothic thread. Jane becomes increasingly aware of sinister goings-on in the house: mad laughter rings throughout the halls at night. Mr Rochester's bedchamber is set alight and only Jane's quick action saves him from death. A stranger arrives at the house whose presence upsets Rochester and who is found badly wounded that very night. Jane suspects the quirky housemaid Grace Poole, but ultimately this mystery has a far more devastating answer, which once more upturns Jane's life and ambitions.Charlotte Bronte's heroine is one of literature's most unique and introspective characters; an ever evolving and maturing individual, who constantly searches her soul and conscious for meaning and identity. Jane's self control is remarkable, as his her ability to rationalise problems and follow through with the decisions that she makes. By today's standards, where self-indulgence and reward-systems are the norm, Jane's state of mind is like a bucket of cold water over the head. When the moment of Jane's great choice comes, she reacts exactly as should be expected, not as some overly-virtuous, too-good-to-be-true Victorian girl. Unlike other heroines, who might be repulsed or frightened at Rochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted. It is from herself and the knowledge of her own weakness that she flees, not from Rochester and his pleas. In this moment the strength of her conviction and will-power is sure to impress.It is important to know that this is not just a romance novel, though it is certainly the driving force of the latter half of the novel. What is most fascinating about the relationship between Jane and Rochester is the complex power struggle that goes on between them, something that often does away with romantic disillusions and deals with the practical and often uncomfortable components of attachment. Mr Rochester is Jane's employer, her social superior and a man considerably older than our teenage protagonist, yet Jane is constantly attempting to exert a sense of control over him and her feelings for him, knowing the cost that would come in succumbing to the man she describes as nearly taking the place of Almighty God in her estimation. The games they play with each other, the testing and the intrigues formed between them are riveting stuff and explore the darker power-struggles of male and female relationships that are almost always lost in typical romance novels. Bronte creates an astonishing amount of equality between the two lovers, for as the novel progresses Rochester becomes more and more reliant on Jane.Jane Eyre is in many ways a feminist novel, addressing to its contemporary audience the drudgery and monotony of female existence that \\"confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags\\". Jane's \`adventures' through school and into the world of employment, her experiences of passionate love and destitution in the wilderness, reflect Charlotte Bronte's own struggles in a man's world. Most (if not all) of the men that Jane meets in her travels attempt to control her in one way or another, and Jane is constantly fighting to walk her own path. As she says at the crucial point in her life: \\"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\\" The loneliness apparent in this passage, and the aloneness in which she spends most of her time is what makes the character of Jane so memorable - here is girl that has no one to look out for her but herself, and yet she keeps her kindness, faith and honour without falling into self-pity or bitterness.\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those classic books that everyone's heard of - but it's up to you to take the next step and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The epic story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's 'poor and plain' 19th century heroine, is a rare and wonderful combination of intelligent prose and keen emotion. It's a sweeping masterpiece of a love story, and a book which, even now, remains as accessible and valid as it did upon its first release.Jane, the heroine, is an orphan, being raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. Tired of her troublesome charge, Mrs. Reed sends Jane to board at Lowood Charity School, where she discovers a new way of life, sometimes as cruel as her time at Gateshead, sometimes full of friendship and laughter. Presently, she accepts the job of Governess to the precocious daughter of Mr. Rochester in Thornfield Hall, and falls in love. She discovers inner strength and self-worth through the redemptive power of that love.Unlike the novels of Jane Austen, Bronte's heroine is from an underprivileged class, and the mood of this story is generally sombre. However, compared to 'Shirley', or Emily Bronte's masterpiece 'Wuthering Heights', 'Jane Eyre' takes what is essentially a sorrowful tale and imbues it with vivid, if brief, descriptions of happiness and love. A sense of belonging pervades the latter half of the story, thrown into high relief by several traumatic events, and culminating in Jane achieving her heart's true desire - a family of her own.It's a more straightforward and rewarding book than most 19th century epics, and for that, it's a better way of introducing oneself to 19th century literature. Bronte's acute awareness of the complexities of human emotion is palpable, and her heroine Jane displays a sense of isolation and self-reliance not found in many other novels, contemporary or otherwise. This is the hook, this is what draws the reader to the character of Jane, she is hard and self-sufficient, without resorting to bitterness or introversion. This subtle contrast forces us to empathise with Jane's plight, and we are all the more satisfied by the story's end.Basically a love story played out against the backdrop of harsh, austere 19th century rural England, 'Jane Eyre' is a book you will return to, again and again. It's romantic, gothic, sparse and, conversely, lush, and truly deserving of its status as Classic. Buy it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"The title character of this novel is unusual, indeed, extremely rare - Marian Halcombe in The Woman in White is the only other such romantic literary heroine I can think of - in that she is not physically attractive. She has neither looks nor fortune. Most romantic heroines have the former but not the latter. It is Jane's character alone that the hero falls in love with. It is clear from the writing that Charlotte herself was unattractive and painfully aware of it. Strangely, the reading public have been unable to accept this, the very element of the book that makes it a perfect romance. The portrait of Charlotte that is most often reproduced is an idealized effort that makes her look beautiful. And whenever a screen adaptation is made of the book, the actress playing Jane is always beautiful. This reduces the theme to that of a rich man falling for a pretty servant girl. As always with classic literature, if you have only seen the movie, you emphatically do not know the book.My first Bronte novel was Emily's Wuthering Heights, which I found very disappointing, with its heavy-breathing masochistic melodrama. But sister Charlotte is a writer of a very different caliber. From the first few pages, the reader knows they are in the hands of a great artist. The heartrending portrait of childhood with which the story opens is based on the author's own experiences, and it shows.The book is not without flaws. The latter stages of the plot are carried along by a series of totally incredible coincidences and there is rather more Victorian melodrama than most modern readers would care for. But it remains, with its Plain-Jane heroine and its unlikely hero (in the end, he satisfies none of the conventional requirements of a romantic hero) the perfect romance. Never was the power of love more satisfyingly expressed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag.

Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best!

It is one of those special books which can be read and savored over and over, and seems to improve with each reading. The tale is narrated by Miss Eyre, herself, inviting a special and intimate relationship with the reader. It is through Jane that we meet and grow to care about, or hate, so many of the memorable characters one becomes acquainted with on these pages. And it is through her narrative, first as a little girl, then as a young woman, that Jane's complex persona is revealed. From an early age her morality, wit, determination, sheer grit and romanticism are evident.Published in 1847, the novel, at first glance, appears to be another well written gothic romance, of the kind so popular in the Victorian Age, with its mystery, horror, brooding hero, touch of the melodramatic, and dark castle-like setting. The rise of poor orphaned Jane, who against all odds, redeems her tormented hero through her steadfast love, is really not unique at all. Charlotte Bronte did not, however, write a mere romance, no matter how riveting the read. Throughout, the author makes some serious statements about women's equality, the treatment of children, and of women forced into a dependent state during the Victorian epoch, religious hypocrisy, romantic relationships between men and women, the nature of true love, and the development of self. This is a beautifully written work of fiction which combines a riveting storyline, compelling characters, vivid descriptions along with a powerful testimony about the period in which the book was written.Young Jane, orphaned at an early age, is grudgingly taken-in by her Aunt, Mrs. Reed, who seems to despise the child. The Reed children are spoiled rotten, and the eldest son is somewhat of a sadist who abuses his young cousin terribly. Aunt Reed always finds a reason to blame Jane for the household's ills. When the boy takes his torture too far and Jane attempts to defend herself, her aunt has her locked in the room where her uncle died, terrifying the poor girl into hysteria. Unwilling to care for the girl any longer, Mrs. Reed packs her off to the harsh Lowood School, a miserable charitable institution which is more like a prison than a place of education. Lowood's despicable headmaster, Rev. Brockelhurst, does everything in his power to break Jane's spirit. At one point, when he asks Jane how to avoid going to hell, she defiantly responds, \\"I must stay well and not die.\\"A particularly compassionate teacher recognizes Jane's intelligence and sensitivity and befriends the girl. When Jane graduates she stays to teach at Lowood until her mentor leaves to marry. Jane then decides it is time for a change, and applies for a position as a governess. She is offered a job at the distant Thornfield Manor. Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield's housekeeper, welcomes her warmly and introduces her to the staff and to little girl who will be her pupil, the precocious Adele. She is not, however, introduced to all the household's inhabitants - especially not to one who inhabits the uppermost floor. Thornfield's owner, Mr. Rochester, (one of my favorite literary heroes), is away when our protagonist arrives, yet it is he who will have a most profound effect on her life - and she on his.If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" yet, why wait any longer? If you have not reread it for a few years, now's the time! My highest recommendations!The Barnes and Noble Classic Edition provides an excellent Introduction and Notes by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a Professor of English at Adelphi University where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women's studies. Her research centers on women and romantic love in nineteenth-century literature, as well as on contemporary popular culture. This is a hardcover book. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge.

It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \\"martyrdom\\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"More than a simple love story, a gothic romance, a Victorian novel, or even a female picaresque work, Jane Eyre is, quite simply, a wonderful book. Written, as it was, in Victorian England by a female author, Jane Eyre has occasionally been pigeonholed as a garden variety gothic romance. It is much more than this, however: not only is it a genuine classic, it epitomizes its genre. There are several factors that set it above the pack. For one, it is extremely well-written: Bronte's characterization is masterful and the plot is well-developed. One comes to identify with the character of Jane, who narrates, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are well-drawn, rounded characters. The book also features other elements which are unusual for a book of its kind and which were genuinely new at the time. For starters, take its protagonist, the title character: she is not beautiful, like Edith Wharton's Lily Bart; she is not rich, like most of Jane Austen's female characters; she is not ambivalent and wish-washy like Kate Chopin's Edna Pontellier; she is not an intellectual. Jane is a well-drawn, rounded, truly believable character -- and a genuinely likable one. The reader comes to empathize and identify with her. Strong-willed, independent, and indefatigable, Jane is not a hard-to-like character like the aforementioned Edna Pontellier from The Awakening; the book could almost be called a female picaresque novel, were she not so practical and solid a character. Also setting the book above its ilk are several dark story details that set the book above the of the typical love story. Bronte also uses the book as a medium to criticize certain aspects of Victorian culture: the inhumane and non-emphatic treatment of the poor by the rich, the denial of the pursuit of happiness, the plight of orphans and other who had no well-defined place in society, the often cruel sternness of church and other authority figures, among much else. Bronte also pauses from time to time to take on spiritual and quasi-philosophical elements, which give the book an added depth and sophistication. With all of this, Bronte succeeds in bringing the book out of the sphere of mere feminist literature: its universal theme and eclectic contents set it above the works of Austen and Chopin, among others. Though many aspects of the novel show it to be a clear product of the Victorian era, the book, with its just-mentioned strengths, is a universal work that will endure for centuries yet to come. In this way, it is much more applicable to our present day than works such as, say, The House of Mirth, which deal primarily with ephemeral concerns. On top of all this, it is a wonderful and delightful read. What we have here is a true classic.This is essential reading for any fan of romances, gothic literature, or Victorian literature in general; readers looking for a truly great and easily-accessible classic need also look no farther."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students. Girls who gravitate toward love stories with sweet sentiments might find the tale of Jane Eyre more enjoyable than others who are not such romantics."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is a wonderful book, but it drags quite a lot. Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of 19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first 150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull. The plot builds up like a snail crawling on grass but then at the top it falls like a roller-coaster. I do praise Charlotte for this work of art. It is as sweet as can be though I am not for romances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I did not read this novel for school or for a book club; just for my pure enjoyment and did I ever enjoy it! I was a little intimidated by some of the reviews saying it was a 'romance novel' which I can't stand...but after reading it I realize, \\"Yes, it is a romance novel but also a mystery and many other things!\\" I am very surprised that I liked it or even bothered reading it everyday but to tell you the truth it is suspensful and intriguing. There is something about Charollet's writing that captured my imagination and the story line of Jane and Mr. Rochester is enchanting. A great romanitc/mystery/gothic novel for everyone!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In the 156 years since its publication, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been a source of controversy - first, over its suitability for and, later, its portrayal of women. When it first emerged in three volumes from the British publishing house of Smith, Elder, and Company under the nom de plume of Currer Bell, it was popular in spite of being deemed unsuitable reading for the Christian woman. Ironically, a century and a half later, it's come under feminist criticism for its allegedly archaic and weak depiction of the Victorian woman.The story itself is familiar to many. The orphaned Jane is left in the care of her mean-spirited aunt who pampers her own selfish children. The aunt can't abide Jane's willful temperament and banishes the child to Lowood, a charity school run by the hypocritical, Bible-thumping Brocklehurst. After disease epidemics for reform, Jane becomes a teacher at Lowood and then a governess for the adopted daughter of the mysterious Mr. Rochester - a man whose many secrets threaten to destroy Jane when she falls in love with him in spite of herself.In large part, the novel is autobiographical. Bronte herself was born in Yorkshire in 1816 and sent to live with an aunt when her mother died. She and her sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge - a strict Methodist charity school where two of Bronte's sisters died (and became the inspiration for Jane's saintly schoolmate, Helen Burns). Bronte became a teacher and then a governess herself, a position she detested.Jane Eyre is a blend of romance, Gothic horror, and a literary form known as Bildungsroman - an internal and external first-person account of coming-of-age. This is the most basic sense in which Jane Eyre is radical - most coming-of-age stories were (and, for that matter, continue to be) told about boys. Jane Eyre's story is not only about a girl, but about a girl who rebels against social conventions on her own principles.Ultimately, the story is about choices and extremes Jane faces and her journey to finding a middle ground that is suitable for her and doesn't compromise her personal integrity.Spiritually, Jane is faced with Brocklehurst - the epitome of the sanctimonious Evangelical movement. She then meets Helen Burns, whose love for God is certainly sincere, but leads to passivity and self-denigration. Later, Jane finds her counsin, St. John, whose religion is neither hypocritical nor meek, but leads to ambition and self-righteousness. Jane navigates the extremes to find her own understanding of love for God, ending her tale with, \\"Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus\\".Jane equally struggles to find her ambiguous place in the structure of Victorian class society. She comes from a monied family to whom she doesn't truly belong, giving her the social carriage and education of the aristocracy. Yet she works in the lower class jobs of teacher and governess reserved for unmarriageable women, where her intellect and her sense of self rebel, as they did for Bronte.But Jane's deepest conflict is between her need for independence and her desire for love. Rochester offers her love at the price of dependence. St. John offers her professional fulfillment at the price of love - a conflict I found meaningful and with which I could deeply identify. The dichotomy remains 156 years laterbetween ambitious, independent women living lives devoid of love versus dutiful wives and mothers living lives devoid of self-awareness and intellectual satisfaction. Even if few women desire these extremes, they continue to be offered and expected and refusing them can be the same source of pain and confusion that Jane experiences.Her love for Rochester is tempting because he can offer her two things, even as a mistress, which she has lacked her whole life - money and a sense of family. Jane realizes that the lack makes her needy and that neediness can never be the basis for an equitable relationship.Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed. He hasn't locked Bertha away which, to a Victorian reader, would have indicated his kindness given the atrocities of the Victorian asylum. He adopts Adele with little reason to believe she's his own child. But Rochester's problems are largely his own doing and Jane is clearly his intellectual and moral superior - another factor unlikely to make for the equitable relationship Jane seeks.But he does tempt her and it's no accident that at the moment of her greatest temptation, Jane sees Bertha Mason - the symbol of Victorian wifehood - locked away to the point of bestial insanity. Is it any wonder Jane flees?The final third of the book - the \\"Whitcross section\\" - feels forced, overlong, and dull despite its importance to the story. In it, Jane finds her family and her inheritance while Rochester gains in humility and moral strength. With these needs fulfilled, Jane and Rochester are finally able to come together as true equals.The book's epilogue, beginning, \\"Reader, I married him\\" has been the source of much debate. Many feel the entire last chapter in which, a decade later, Jane extols the blessings of married life, indicate that Jane has submitted at last to the mundane wifehood expected of her. However, even the first sentence belies this conclusion - Jane is the subject of the sentence, not the object of it. Like everything else in her story, marriage is something she does for herself, not something that simply happens to her. In it, she describes her marriage as \\"free as solitude\\", in which talking and sharing one another's thoughts are their greatest pleasures. Rather than a dismal descent into dailiness, this is Bronte's summary - that women who remain true to their own integrity and give in neither to the temptation of ambition nor that of meek dependence find what they seek - a love shared by two whole people who are able to remain fully themselves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Tis story had a little of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and more. I love this book and could not put it down. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a beautifully romantic and riveting experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"In this timeless first-person narrative, Jane Eyre --a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan-- recounts her childhood and latter years leading to her marriage to the mysterious Edward Rochester.What make the story fast-paced, fascinating, and ultimately admirable are not the mundane events and incidents that happen to her, but the manner in which she tells them. Within a few pages it becomes obvious that the narrator is a character who is a master of the English language. Her sentence openers are well thought out, well measured, and well balanced--a veritable fountain of wisdom.In addition, Jane owns a terrific imagination, which coupled with her lust for life, will get her to where she wants to go--but only after she experiences hurt, physical abuse, and much suffering.The novel goes through five distinct stages:1. Gateshead. This is the residence of Jane spends of her childhood, and where she experiences the cruelties volleyed at her by her aunt (Mrs. Reed) and cousins.2. Lowood School. In this school she meets the mystic Helen Burns and Maria Temple, whom Jane admires and sees as a role model. In this school she also endures the headmaster's humiliations and gratuitous abuses.3. Thornfield Manor. The manor is owned by Edward Rochester, who is her employer and with whom she falls in love.4. Moor House or Marsh's End. Owned by the Rivers family who happen to be her relatives. Here Jane received a marriage proposal from her passionless clergyman-cousin St John Rivers.5. Ferndean. A second house owned by her beloved Rochester.While we enjoy child characters such as Dickens' David Copperfield, Little Dorritt, and Pip, we admire Jane Eyre much more because she is proud and shows a fighting spirit. She fights back. \\"I resisted all the way: a new thing for me,\\" she tells us as Bessie takes her to be locked in the red-room, following a fight with the brat John Reed.She doesn't just let things happen to her; and the fact that very same spirit gets her in trouble, she also fights extricate herself from her predicaments. Resourceful is the word that fits Jane. I always admire the passage in the novel in which she wants change in her life and how an epiphany comes to her: Advertise! And that single action gets her not only her first employment, but also her first and only love: Mr. Rochester. But little did she know the mystery that engulfed the manor, and much less the source of the hideous laughter: \\"While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ears. It was a curious laugh - distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped\\"The author, Charlotte Bronte, a magician of the English language will take you back to England as it was in the 1840s, making you experience the highs and lows of life in England during that period.Jane Eyre is true work of literature that will introduce readers of any age to memorable characters and a story that is inexhaustible in its wisdom. Not long ago I was moved by all the attention given to J. K. Rowling and her lovable character Harry Potter. Moved I was but not fascinated as I am every time I re-read Jane Eyre. While J. K. Rowling is an entertainer, Charlotte Bronte is a literary artist.If you like low-brow romances you won't find it here. It is a story of a woman who struggles with a world in which she doesn't quite fit. While the novel may be read as a critique of both gender and social class, it contains a strong feminist stance:Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.Or,And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude and many associates, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.The protagonist and narrator has no amazing qualities, she's a plain girl and it says so, many times in the novel, but she shows some endearing qualities --which I won't mention-- that readers inevitably discover.Ahead of her times, Charlotte Bronte, hints and unveils as much as it was permitted then, erotic tensions, boundless passions, and hateful marriage ironies. These were not qualities encouraged in Victorian women writers, and Jane Eyre was offensive to many a contemporary. That a woman should expose her inner most feelings, was unheard of:I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.Jane Eyre is a trans-formative book from which we can all learn. I always say that the depths of human emotions one doesn't find in either in psychology book or philosophical tracts--but only in fiction. \\"Reader, I married him.\\"Read it!The writing techniques I use in this article are all explained in Mary Duffy's writing manual:Sentence Openers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I loved the cover to this book.

So I am eternally grateful to my aunt who handed me a small paperback that opened my mind to a world I never knew!

So please, read this book it is wonderful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . ."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I've had a like/dislike relationship with this book since my college days. All right- mostly dislike.Everyone knows the plot by now, since they at least watched the televised versions, so I'll be brief- neglected orphan who grows up with abusive aunt and cousins is sent to charity school, where she experiences more misfortunes, grows up to become a governess in a gothic countryside mansion and falls in love with her Byronic employer. Eventually she finds fortune and happiness through various plot twists, some completely implausible.I've read this book several times since I was 19 and seemed to dislike it more with each reading. I think that what has always put me off this book is Charlotte Bronte's prose. It's just so cumbersome and long-winded and I find the imagery and descriptions heavy-handed and awkward- sorry, when she describes the \\"bonny beck\\" I just don't feel it. I much prefer her sister Anne Bronte's simpler but clearer writing, not to mention Emily Bronte's masterful prose. Additionally, Charlotte is completely humorless. What passes as humor just isn't very funny. By contrast, again, Wuthering Heights has surprisingly funny moments for such a dark gothic tale, once again demonstrating Emily's superiority as a writer.I additionally dislike Jane--somehow, I can't feel much liking for her. I appreciate that Bronte broke the mold with having a poor, plain heroine, but it's stressed so frequently that it loses its effect. She was also stupendously blind not to suspect that maybe, just maybe, there's another person there with the stony-faced Grace Poole who was the source of that mad laughter. And Rochester is a manipulative git. He really is. And he says \\"Jane, Jane!\\" too much and has an irritating tendency to compare her to elves and fairies.What's most surprising is that St. John River is actually a much more interesting character than Rochester. He's a strikingly handsome, repressed ascetic who directs his passion to his religion. Nowadays he would have made either a splendid villain or a disillusioned hero. Rochester and his angst are boring by comparison.If you think that Bronte is a good writer I dare you, just dare you, to read any of her other works. \\"Shirley\\" is painful and I heard that \\"The Professor\\" isn't much better. The only work where I felt that Charlotte finally got a handle on her art was her last novel, the emotionally difficult and thereby much less popular \\"Villette.\\"The best thing about Jane Eyre are the television and movie productions. There's a million of them and I find myself compelled to watch every single one. So I guess there is still something in the story that appeals to me. This is why I give this book three stars rather than two."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a young woman, grown from a rash girl in a harsh life and boarding school, working as a governess to a French girl. This is Bront's romance novel, though it is somewhat vague to call it that, for there is much more involved than just a petty romance. Through some sticky language, and some boring sections-whole chapters, even-Bront relays the life of Jane Eyre through Jane's own eyes tastefully and with flexible, rich language, stringing the reader along.We begin with Jane Eyre's childhood. Through some difficult wording, we find that Jane lives with her Reed cousins and aunt. Her Aunt Reed sees her as a vile child compared to her own vile children, who she sees with a golden halo above their heads. Jane is often tortured physically by Reed's children, while taking the brunt of anger and blame from her aunt. We are brought through the agonizing years of her childhood, making her a rash young girl with dreams of a new life, which comes in the form of a boarding school that she is to be sent to. With such a rush of feeling, she spills out her heart to her aunt about how she really feels, but at such the young and tender age of 10, begins to discover truths about the world that normal 10 year old children do, such as what vengeance and anger could bring about. As Bront describes the feelings and compares them to some rather unrelated things, \\"Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic as wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after flavor, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned,\\" I gained a sense of familiarity, for of course, when I pursue revenge, it's often a cold and empty attempt, leaving me cold and empty as she describes.The boarding school is anything but lovely, but Jane often refers to it as better than her previous surroundings; of course, as I, the audience, felt, it was. She begins to accept the discipline and conform rather well to the strict rulings of Mr. Brocklehurst, and, lonely at first, finds someone that she can relate to - Helen Burns, who also often gets lost in her own fantasy world as Jane does. The next chapters are really just an explanation of time in the boarding school, and though rather boring, explained her transition from a brash young girl into something more disciplined. The only truly interesting thing I found in this piece of the book was how Bront utilizes the technique of the \`drop' sentence. To explain it, she builds and builds up to a heavy-impact event, and then uses one sentence to release the suspense, in a rather harsh way, making the impact of the shock all the stronger. In the end of her explanation of Jane's childhood, she uses this here: \\"\\"...my face against Helen Burns' shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep and Helen was - dead.\\" Of course, one thinks that there would be much more of a draw out here to Helen, her best friend, dying, but really, it was just a dropped ball, and I found myself shocked. Even so, there was a good five chapters of useless plot that I found to be quite tiresome.As Jane herself transitions to the next chapters, she explains the things that happened the eight years after that that she stayed in the hall, and how things improved, she improved, etc. This seemed to be one of the least confusing parts of the book, since it was straightforward and not so tangled up in language. Either way, she decides that she needs a change from the boarding school that she now taught at, and advertises herself, quickly replied to for a young girl. She immediately accepts and takes her journey to Thornfield. She is to teach a little girl named Ad&egrave;le in a large manor in which the master never seems to be around. There is an in depth, albeit easy to skip over, description of the lavish home that she now resides in, and Jane quickly falls into the routine. Before Mr. Rochester, the owner or Thornfield and a main character, shows up, I enjoy the passage (and the many after them) when Jane falls into her own fantasy world and fails to realize that something is happening, like this, \\"...Bessie's Gytrash,-a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head... with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would... The man...broke the spell all at once.\\" They often occur, but they're so shrouded in incomprehensible old language, usually, that I can't catch them until I realize that I haven't understood a thing I've read, and read it over again. Once Mr. Rochester shows up, the actually romance novel-esque story begins, the true heart of Bront's novel. The two begin to seduce and fall in love with one another, though not right away like in a woman's fantasy, but over time as if it did in reality. There are many events after this, but I've said enough already!Jane Eyre is an entertaining, albeit sometimes confusing and boring, read. This is more of a novel for a person with an in-depth knowledge of the English language (and perhaps a little French) and that's looking for a satisfying read. Bront places foreshadowing and certain events with elegance and not without reasoning, for those small events begin to fall into place for what comes in the end, but are something the reader may skip over, for they're shrouded behind a tangled language and wordy sentences."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 and I loved it. I love Mr Rochester and the playful way he has about acting with Jane. I loved the way their love was the perfect romantic love, not Mills and Boon but a more sedate, beautiful, mature love.As an afterthought though it has shaped my view of love and at 17 am shocked to find out that most people's idea of love is a prenup and till death to you part while I have a view of love as never part and don't need a prenup because you should love someone so much that you couldn't consider getting divorced. In short it screwed me up but it's a good book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"A governess falls in love with her employer in this passionate and romantic tour de force from the pen of Charlotte Bronte.

I read it when I was in seventh grade and have read again at least once a year and I'm now in 12th grade. Each time I read it, I understand it better and the love and depth of emotions of Jane and Mr. Rochester becomes so overwhelming. When I saw that 3rd and seventh graders were reading it and finding it \\"odd\\" at times, and boring perhaps, it's because of the age thing. You've got to wait a few years and read it again. Trust me, after all those idiotic teen movies, you'll develop a priceless love for Jane Eyre. The only book I've ever found that was so harshly honest and real was Gone With the Wind. And that book I really don't recommend to young readers. I've once saw a reviewer say Jane Eyre wasn't original at all and the parts that were original were bad. I can't possibly fathom how J.E. isn't original. This book is one of the few books in the world where a normal, poor, average girl finds love that usually happens to supermodel types (Dickens was a big fan of the supermodel love). Jane's life has been anything been peachy, but she has the courage and determination to make the most of everything and let bygones be bygones, and she does. If anyone deserves love like Jane and Edward's, it's the both of them. And even in books and movies of the 21st century you'll rarely see a girl as independent as Jane. For an experience never to be forgotten, read Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane EyreThe book starts out with a young girl, Jane Eyre, living at Gateshed with her late uncle's wife, Mrs. Reed. Jane's aunt and her cousins were mean to her growing up. Her aunt sends her to Broklehurst where she attends school till she is 18. When she leaves the school she gets a job at Thornfield Hall where she is a young girl's governess. When things take a turn for the worst, Jane leaves Thornfield Hall. While wandering through the streets homeless one night, Jane finally finds something she had been looking for all her life, family.Jane Eyre was not that exciting in my opinion. It was, however, not the most boring book I have ever read. The book was not that eventful. Jane just kept going form place to place. She just talks about how she felt unloved and unwanted. The only thing I did like about the book was the love story that evolved between Jane and another character.I would recommend this book to people ages 15 and up. This book is for those who have a wide range of vocabulary. The author uses words that people may not understand if they don't have a large vocabulary.

I have reminised several times over how the story comes into veiw with woman of today, and have found that it can show woman just how far we have come in a centuy and 1/2.

My only contribution is that this character is perhaps one of the early examples of a feminist, a working woman (think Eleanor Roosevelt) despite Jane's eventual wealth.

It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale. I think that all girls at some point in their life should read Jane Eyre to see what a classy love story is like."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have just finished reading this book in school (I'm in year 10, and im glad Ive read it now before it was too late; all adults who have read this always say they wish they had done when they were a teenager). As it's so long, the class only had to read half of it, but I felt compelled to read the rest at home as I really felt for the character, and I felt like I'd just die if I didn't find out what happens to her! That's what defines any good book: only if the reader is made to feel for the characters can they be interested enough to take in the issues raised in the novel. I usually find that novels that are fun to read, about characters that readers warm to, are generally superficial, whereas novels involving two-dimensional characters contain relevent and worthwhile morals and issues for us to dwell on. Thats what defines Jane Eyre as a classic; it has the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is a book that reveals, the complexities of a woman's mind, her struggle for independence and her search for a separate identity. It is a journey beginning with the innocence of a young girl, an orphan, and unfolds to show us the growth of the female protagonist in her search for an identity, helping us to see the world through her eyes.Bronte's style of writing is such, that the confusion and bewilderment young Jane feels is palpable, as is her hunger to be loved and the hurt she feels, on being ill-treated. The novel cannot be called an autobiography, but many of the incidents that go into the making of the novel have been taken from the life of the author. There is also an element of the supernatural, which appealed greatly to the readers of the time but does not invoke the same response today.The book also gives us an insight into the age in which the author wrote. The position of women, in the society or rather the lack of it. The portrayal of Rochester's wife in the attic at Thornfield can be interpreted as the darker side of Jane's personality. The part of her that she suppresses after being locked in the \\"Red Room\\" at the Reed mansion. Mad bertha is that part of Jane that she has to lock away in order to be accepted in a stifling and prudish Victorian society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Well, I can't call Charlotte Bronte another Marlowe, Shakespeare, or Dickens. But what I will call her is a very close runnerup. Bronte masterfully shows us a young girl's growth in an abusive environment to a mature an admirable woman. The images are deep and convincing. The scene where Jane forgives her abusive aunt is very touching and memorable. Bronte also strikes us with the complex Rochester. Perhaps Bronte's greatest accomplishment is how she makes Jane such a Christ like figure. It is interesting that this novel came out in 1847. It is also possible to wonder if this work inspired Charles Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I have read this book in Hungarian, but I know it is as good in English as in my mother language...

In other parts, I felt the story flashed by and I missed it (the ending where Jane went back to Rochester, Saint John's marriage proposal, Jane's botched wedding with Rochester). I do NOT think the woman in the attic (Bertha, Rochester's first wife) is a lunatic. I think her actions, although violent, are justified (ripping Jane's veil to shreds- She doesn't want her husband marrying another woman while she is locked in the attic). Though this review appears negative, I really did like the book. I, too, was assigned this as an AP English reading assignment (as JACKIE from Rotterdam, NY), and I am glad I was assigned it, for had I not been, I might not have ever read the timeless story of thencredible heroine, Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I was assigned to read Jane Eyre for school, but I did not realize that it would take me forever to read!

After another five, to the dictionary again! I know she is from a different time, but goodness. I never had this trouble from Jane Austen. I took two stars away for that and for the long drawn out descriptions and conversations. I had to force myself through the book in order to get to the story, which as great as it is..is hardly worth the headaches if your vocabulary is not up to par."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"JANE EYREBront, Charlotte. Jane Eyre. New York: Penguin Books, 1996 (reprint edition). Genre: Classic Victorian literature; gothic romance and suspense. Age range: Middle school to adult.It is sad that only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday sun. Clearly, the sun rarely shown at Haworth Grange, or anywhere near the wind-blown Yorkshire Dales--it might have reversed the unfortunate Bronts' madness. Page for page of gothic drama and angst, Jane Eyre can be a frustrating read. Jane's insecurity, low self-esteem, and then dramatic personality change near the end of the (very long) story hardly seem worth the agony for the dubious benefit of the love of Mr. Rochester. Those Bronts were all mad as hatters, and the unfortunate Mrs. Rochester wasn't the only one who should have been kept under lock and key. Be that as it may, the Bronts wrote classic British literature in the early Victorian Age, and therefore should be read, if only to see where gothic romance has come since then (not too far, unless you include &quot;Rebecca,&quot; by Daphne DuMaurier, a far tighter story, with as much spinelessness in the heroine, but at a far faster pace), and to understand that women did not have much else to write about in those days--thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionable female readers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Don't get sucked in by the pretty cover and cheap price (like I did)!

Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence.

Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Bront's novel, grows up as an orphan child in oppressive surroundings; however, she overcomes the repression of her cruel childhood and follows her heart to find out who she is and where she truly belongs. Readers, especially female readers, can easily identify with Jane because they are all searching for themselves or have already done so at some point in their lives. Although there are a few parts of the novel which are difficult to read, the novel is essentially easy to read and understand, mainly because it is actually written to and for the reader. Readers are still able to make a connection with Jane's passionate feelings, her love of religion, and her struggle with difficult decisions, because the readers of today must still deal with those same situations that Jane dealt with over one hundred and fifty years ago. Readers can learn from the balance Jane maintains between her conscience and her intuition as influences to the difficult decisions she makes. Jane's undying sense of hope is inspiring and shows readers that hope and faith are the only things needed to carry on in life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has an odd place in literary history. It is one of the most compelling reads ever written, and in my opinion, it uncovers so much about the nature of being a human. The novel's a page-turner for its entertainment value as well as for its ability to enlighten.Jane is a poor orphan born in a society that fights her ability to attain financial, emotional, sexual, and spiritual freedom. From the beginning of the novel, Jane is on a quest to gain her liberation. Of course, she cannot do so by herself. She must retain enough fortitude to be her true self, and she must be an instrument of grace, of change, in the life of Rochester.Everything in the novel conspires toward the creation of a near-perfect novel. I cannot believe I waited so long to experience this masterpiece, but I will certainly be returning to it over and over through the rest of my life. This novel cannot be missed by anyone who wants to read truly great literature or by anyone who just wants to experience a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen, and I fell in love with it almost instantly as soon as I finished the first chapter.

Don't be intimidated by the length, because you will certainly get so enraptured, and taken in, that you wont even notice it. I must say that Jane Eyre is one of the most endearing and enjoyable characters that i've encountered. Charlotte Bronte develops her perfectly. I love her ability to poke fun at and tease her admired one, Mr Rochester; it's refreshing, and my idea of love. It develops at a nice, steady pace, never lagging. The tone and the references to the reader suit the book quite well, and I believe that the story was far ahead of its time. Why four out of five? Well, i found certain parts of the story far too unbelievable, and Mr. Rochester seemed to go from stern and haughty, to love-sick and passionate all too quickly, that I found it somewhat ingenuine. I believe that the end is what really made the story worthwhile, when Jane goes back to see her beloved once more. That is when i started to tear.

Yet, yes, this book is at an advanced level, but so many girls between 12-15 read this book. And the funny thing is, that I don't understand the words, but when I read the book, I have a clear view of what the words mean. This is such a great book to give to your kids. I read it like, on my 11th birthday, and it is good for girls 11 and older. I would recomend this book for teens or pre-teens, and parents, don't give them Nancy Drew books.

Beginning from childhood, Jane was faced with the choices of life which lay before her. She moved from struggle to struggle with courage and self-determination which gained the reader's respect. Her character is strong and clever in a way that brings her to be a heroic personage in the novel. I liked how Jane obtained a strong-willed personality and how she stuck by her beliefs no matter what.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this slower paced romance from beginning to end and like many other books of its kind, it captivated me with the beloved mixture of romance and challenge. I liked how there was a fair amount of lovey-dovey moments in the book which held your attention, and made you strive for more. It wasn't a constant shower of romance and flirtatious quotes, and this I found, allowed the reader to excite themselves whenever the romance was present.Charlotte Bront used a lot of descriptive imagery throughout the novel ranging from the texture of light to the precise emotions Jane was feeling. This seemed to make it easier on many levels to comprehend exactly what was going on at every point of the novel. Although it had a few sluggish parts, I found was no struggle to read through those select scenes. The beginning of the book had a slow start, but I believe it was necessary to set up the stage for the rest of the novel. As a final comment, I'd like to simply state that I really enjoyed reading Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a very good book.

While it was not fast-paced and begging to be read, it was a beautifully written novel. It was very lyrical. I thought the love between Jane and Mr. Rochester was true, withstanding the test of time. It was a truly romantic book, but not so easy to read because of the time period in which it was written. For instance, this is not a novel I would read in bed at night because I would fall asleep. Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I usually read murder mysteries but ordered the audiobook after viewing the Brontes' sisters biography on television. It's a wonderful book. I can't believe I waited this long to read a book so popular for centuries and I don't know why this wasn't required reading in school.The characters are endearing, the language, beautiful and I think knowing the history of the author makes the book much more enjoyable and realistic.I had read Emily Brontes' Wuthering Heights years ago in my teens and enjoyed it very much but didn't appreciate the history of the author then.Maybe everyone should read or watch the sisters' biography then read the books."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"As I was in the middle of the book, I was so drawn to the characters I felt full. Later there was sadness for awhile. At the end I was full of joy. My feelings were \\"wow - what a wonderful journey.\\" I loved the two main characters, Edward and Jane, their individual natures, their love for each other and how they pursued it. There were interesting and unexpected conversations and events. I enjoyed the way early in their relationship, Edward would pass Jane in the hallway, sometimes scowling and sometimes politely nodding, yet she was not offended because she knew his moods were unrelated to her. The St. John character was odd yet amazing. He loved a girl, but easily gave her up because he believed she wouldn't fit in with his missionary goals and service to God. Instead he asked someone else to marry him whom he did not love but she fit with his vocation. The novelist Thackeray wrote \\"St John is a failure I think but a good failure.\\" Bronte describes St. John as being made of what heroes, conquerors and statesmen are made, but not marrying material. St. John was not a major character in the book, but I mention him as an example of the variety of interesting characters. An idea that continues to intrigue me is \\"fact is stranger than fiction.\\" One reviewer of the book (back in the 1800s) thought one of the characters was too unbelievable and stated \\"such creations as Helen Burns are very beautiful but very untrue.\\" Ms. Bronte responded saying that Helen Burns was a real person and that Ms. Bronte exaggerated nothing about Helen. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: 1800s England. Published 1847. Genre: historical romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a great book to read! I really love the voice of Jane throughout the whole story, making me really feel that I was reading her journal rather than Charlotte writing fiction. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I first read this in high school (oh, gosh...25 years ago!). I remember liking it then, though at the time I think I preferred Emily's Wuthering Heights. But as another reviewer mentioned, classic books really should be re-read from time to time. In some ways I think they're wasted on the young! Now I find Wuthering Heights a good story, though a bit melodramatic. However, reading Jane Eyre again, in my forties, I realize what an unusual book it is. On the surface, it has many of the standard plot devices of Victorian novels: a mistreated orphan, a romantic setting, a brooding romantic interest. But Charlotte Bronte's deft touch lifts this above the ordinary. She uses Jane to cry out against all the injustice she saw in the world. She addresses religious hypocrisy, women's rights, and the mistreatment of children, among other things. And it's a very good read. I find I am staying up late at night because I want to read on, rather than go to bed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"With this novel Ms. Bronte crafted what is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful works of the English language. One concern I always have with reading classics is to avoid their introductions as they inevitably forego on the minute details of the work (I suppose they assume everyone who's someone has already read it.) As such, I'll avoid disclosing the inner workings of the plot of Jane Eyre -- it's too beautiful to divulge and I hope you'll take up the novel for yourself.Simply put, we see Jane Eyre, the epitome of the term \\"Plain Jane,\\" evolve from mistreated orphan as she ascends the ladder of social status and, as with all bildungsroman novels, plummets to an even further depth than whence she came. We read as our heroine negotiates the complexities of early Victorian womanhood and confronts the haunting past of her mysterious master, all in the quest for conflicting longings for self-satisfaction, independence, and love.If interested, the reader may also enjoy Jean Rhys' 1966 classic novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which traces the story of Jane's symbolic inner woman, the \\"mad\\" Antoinette \\"Bertha\\" Mason."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a reprint of the famous Bronte novel that even now after so many years can thrill and captivate the reader.We are introduced to the heroine Jane EYRE on the first page and we soon realise she is a most put upon child, unwanted by Aunt, cruelly treated by her spoilt cousins and mostly ignore by the servants, save for Bessie who perhaps has the best understanding of the sufferings that Jane has to ensure under her Aunt Reed's indifferent care.We follow Jane from her miserable home life in Gateshead to her time spent at a charity school, her friendship with the doomed Helen Burns and her elevation to student teacher, a role that allows her to eventually take up a post as a governess for the child Adele, the possible illegitimate daughter of the enigmatic Mr ROCHESTER who owns the eerie Thornfield Manor.From Jane's first day at the Manor we are treated to a mystery story that slowly grows and grows with each passing day, soon Jane realises that all is not well at the Manor but she is not sure what the problem is, it has something to do with the enigmatic Grace POOLE and the attic where she works, but who cries out at night and why does Mr ROCHESTER almost get burnt to death in his bed in what is obviously not an accident but which he insists is the case.Ms BRONTE'S book is suspenseful and daring, in that she talks about illegitimacy, marriages of class, and the abuse of children in charity schools to name but a few subjects she incorporates into Jane EYRE.This particular edition is excellent because it is a faithful reproduction with no abridgement and is also can be purchased for a pittance, one way of getting the classics on your shelves, I will certainly be going out and buying myself more of these editions and look forward to re-reading Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Grey and Jekyll and Hyde."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"After reading the last words of this novel, the only word that escaped my mouth was WOW! Jane's character is so real. In one way or another, every woman can relate to her passage from the insecurities of childhood to the life defining moments of adulthood.For me, Bronte's main characters Jane and Mr. Rochester mirror the traveler in Robert Frost's Poem \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" as they struggle between raw human desire and moral righteousness. Jane chooses the \\"road less traveled,\\" where as Mr. Rochester takes the well worn path. In both cases, their choice defines the fiber of their spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When I was looking through the books at the High School Library, the librarian, Ms. Pimentel, asked me if I was looking for anything in particular.

Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story.

We find Jane Eyre the orphan child soon to be abandoned by her uncaring aunt to a stern stark girls school. Jane has a spirit that does not quake in the face of dangers. She is the model for feminists in years to come.Charlotte Bronte the author of the book was born in 1816 and like Jane had experience as a governess. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847. By reading the book one can experience the harsh times that existed in the era. Young children had little protection from society outside of their family and those without families were at risk. The school, Jane attends is a uncaring and stoic establishment. Even so Jane flourishes because of her strong spirit and desire to learn.After leaving the school Jane bravely sets out to be governess. It is here that she meets Mr. Rochester her silent and mysterious employer. Jane has the ability to see the real spirit of a person and draws for Mr. Rochester with her subtle elfin charms. Throughout the book Jane maintains an integrity of being and an independent spirit. She demands that others, who she cares for respect her as an individual as well as a woman. Jane is a person who doesn't accept the limitations which fate has set forth for her.In many ways this novel was far ahead of its time in recognizing women as individuals who were capable and independent beings. The plot is one that has been used repeatedly in novels yet to come. Any reader of romances or gothic stories should first read this to find the source of the story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is, hands down, one of my favorite books. It is not the typical romance story - the heroine is not a gorgeous, delicate, flower and the hero is not a young, virile Hercules. The characters are more realistic, allowing the reader to be more sympathetic. Jane Eyre is described as being the plainest of the plain, but her strength and independence make her a rare individual. She is a dynamic character whose love transforms her in the end.This is book really moved me.

Orphaned when she is a small child, Jane Eyre is left in the clutches of her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her bullying cousins at Gateshead Hall. So marks the reader's advent into Jane's dreary world. Sent to Lowood School at the of ten, she eagerly expects a genial environment only to be met by a cold, hostile institution plagued by Mr. Brocklehearst, the arrogant headmaster. Despite two high points in her stay at Lowood (she is befriended by Miss Temple, a solicitous music instructor, and a saint-like pupil named Helen Burns), they are brutally taken away from her. Helen tragically dies from typhus, and Miss Temple marries a minister and moves away. Jane's only escape from Lowood is a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall eight years later (when she is eighteen) that she accepts. When she arrives at the manor, she is heartily greeted by the housekeeper, Miss Fairfax. Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner, usually travel abroad and is absent most of the time. Jane's duty is to tutor his foster-child Adele Vareans, an adorable six-year-old French girl. It finally seems as if Jane has discovered a home for herself and is at last distinguished as a bona fide person. However, her tranquility and niche are suddenly threatened when the brooding Mr. Rochester returns home. Odd events occur, such as screams in the night, crazed laughs echoing in the halls, blazing fires, and the presence of an unexpected guest. To worsen matters, Jane finds herself falling in love with her master despite the fact that she suspects he is concealing a secret past of himself from her and others. Exactly what is it and will Rochester ever be romantically interested in &quot;plain&quot; Jane? To unearthen the answers, one has to enter the allure, intrigue, and enigma of Charlotte Bronte's delightful story of the struggles, identity, and emotions of a heroine on a quest for her destiny: Jane Eyre. --P.

Once you read it, you will want to read it again right away! Don't miss actor Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the BBC adaptation!

But as the heart of the story unfolds, it plays as an example of the &quot;classes&quot; of her time, and how Mr. Rochester, her love, treated her with equality. The truly talented writer, through actions and descriptions, depicted in this book a simple and plain girl's mistreatment from her aunt and cousins in her childhood and how her past affected her future.

The more I read the Bronte sisters' novels, the more I like them.The eloquence in language throughout this novel doesn't dilute its greatness by hindering the reader of today by having to decipher the meaning of each sentence. The story, though incredible, is also believable because it is told through the eyes of the one who experiences it. The characters are well-rounded, the plot is juicy, and the climax is fabulous. I love how, even though it is told in past tense, it is as though Jane is reliving each moment and her moods inside the narrative correspond to whatever is happening in her life at that time.

(A complex person, a good man in a bad situation)Seriously, although it is rarely mentioned, I was struck by the Biblical and religious references and overtones of this book. Charlotte Bronte, as a clergyman's daughter, sure knew the Bible. And contrary to popular opinion, religious people understand the trials of temptation, perhaps more than most. That is why Jane's struggles with her desires ring true. Although she suffered, her self-respect remained intact. As a modern woman I respect this character's moral uprightness and her strong sense of self--I wish more modern young (and not so young) women would learn from her example, and thus avoid much heartache and regret\\"Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.'--Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This is a really interesting book if you are interested in sad, mystery, and love books.

This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read is a set with selected works of all the Bronte sisters, so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Since I had read the book Jane Eyre, I had an urge to see the movie.I was impressed and fascinated by the classic English language, thereforemy choosing of the actors \\" Tomothy Dalton & Zelah Clarke \\".A real enjoyment !!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Hard to believe that JANE EYRE was written over 150 years ago since women of all ages still fall in love with its hero, Mr. Rochester, today. I know I did when I first read the book in sixth grade and I still find the book incrediably romantic all these years later. The beginning part of the book is reminiscent of Dickens since Jane survives a horrible childhood of mistreatment. And when she meets Mr. Rochester and against all odds he falls in love with her (for her character and intelligence as she is \\"plain and poor\\") the book really gets interesting for most of its fans. Of course there are still many obstacles along the way before Jane can find happiness with her true love.

The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes. His feelings are true, but he has to pay for his sins and become upright before God--only then can they be together.

The same things you hear about Wuthering Heights (which is a superb read as well...more - flowery, perhaps). I got a copy from my English teacher one day thinking I'd read it that night and give it back to her the next day. Well, it took me almost a year to get around to it, but then it sucked me in. It was a long time ago since a book did that. I, myself, am quite a plain person with a passionate spirit. Jane is a person who knows WHO she is, WHO she wants to be and WHO she can't. That is this struggle. She can give in to her passion, give into her dreams, but then they will slip from her grasp because everything that makes her the most beautiful person you've ever seen on the INSIDE would be tainted; Jane's simple purity and athletic mind would be no more. So: Give in and Regret or Die and Keep Living?I love Mr. Rochester. I see him as the male version of Jane; he can see who people are without looking into their looks to find it. St. John was a handsome man, but what pleasure did Jane take in his features? Perhaps he was prudent, but he was not wise. Anyway! Rochester. He is a brave, valliant man, willing to go all measures to give Jane what he feels himself. In his own words, \\"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward. Without it, my heart is broken.\\"Try and understand this book, and then feel that which our society lacks.One last word from a mouth that runs freely and...with INTELLIGENCE: \\"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination, and turn the bent of nature: but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get - when our will strains after a path we may not follow - we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste - and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.\\" (From 'Jane Eyre')This book is TRULY one of the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. \\"\`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, \`you have my full and free forgiveness'\\" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. \\"Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love\\" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. \\"I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless\\" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple \\"no\\" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"We read this book last year in my English class and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I loved it's mix of love, mystery, misfortune, blandness, and phychological struggles. There is much to learn from this book in the ways we see Jane grow and learn to love Rochester. We see all the different kinds of people; for example, Helen; the religious one, Jane; the rebel, Bertha; the insane wife who is a foil of Jane and many other suncharacters in this book. It is an absolutely brilliant book and it's worth the time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"You have to read this book.Why?

There are two reasons.You should read it because it is a classic of Western Civilization, and you should read it because it articulates, in an historically important and artistically excellent way, the insistence of one lowly born female on being a full human being.When this book was written the words \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident\\" had already made history -- for men.We still await the world where women are men's equals.\\"Jane Eyre\\" has the courage to say, in relentlessly feminine language -- Jane never has to resort to a karate kick to make her point -- that women have just as much value as men. Not just women who make good eye candy. But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.\\"Jane Eyre\\" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved. I think a man could learn much of what he needed or wanted to know about seduction just from reading this book.I've read other reviews here that speak of this book with great love, and that speak of Jane as a living being.

The characters seem to come alive off the page, especially the heroine, Jane Eyre, who seems to have a very twenty first century frame of mind. While the plot line is fairly hard to believe, the thoughts of the heroine is what makes this piece of work a true literary masterpiece. She deals with the perils facing her with an open mind, and is willing to stand up for her beliefs and morals even in a time when this wasn't acceptable for a woman. She's a true role model for all young girls and women, and a real figure of the ages.I would recommend this book to anyone, but you have to have an appreciation for good, in depth description and old-fashioned style of writing. You also must have patience, because this is a fairly long book with many twists and turns, and there were definite times in this book that I didn't think anything good could come of it!! You must also have faith in the writer, because I was afraid for a while when I was reading that it would end horribly.I have heard many negative things about this story, but I truly don't agree with any of them. Jane Eyre, Edward Rochester, Mr. St. John, they are all fabulously written, almost as though this story was written about actual people instead of fictional. I loved this book and will read it many more times."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Adrienne Zillmann September 12, 2000My Opinion of JaneEyreWritten in a time when women had no rights, and were not allowed to hold any serious jobs, Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is a porthole traveling back through history. Charlotte Bronte was a sort of maverick herself, assuming a man's name in order to have her works published. Jane Eyre provides a witty, masterfully written story of a governess trying to overcome the hardships of lower-class life, and her difficult rise to nobility. It's an enjoyable story for all audiences. Bronte's plot renders many twists, provides worthy role models for all ages and genders, and presents a romantic conclusion that is heart-warming enough to make any reader smile. Though she sometimes went off track, Charlotte Bronte eventually leads young Jane along the right path of destiny by using a series of random events to guide her in the right direction. There are two ways of looking at the fluke events that befall Jane throughout the book. Some people might say that Bronte overdoes her use of uncanny coincidences when Jane happens to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester, on the road, and his horse falls as he is passing Jane. However, the truth is, the world is a small place. Coincidences such as this happen all of the time in every day life, and much of the time, they pass unnoticed. Another such example is when Jane is looking for a job and she happens to stay with St. John and his sisters. She later finds out that they are none other than her very own cousins, and she had thought she had no relatives. This event could be thought of as unrealistic, but many people may enjoy these sly little detours from the plot and Bronte's use of destiny. This quality enhances the book tremendously by making it a far more unique, fascinating, and pleasing book to read. Another positive attribute about Jane Eyre is the happy ending. All too often, things do not turn out the way people want them to in their lives. The novel's joyful solution is a refreshing change to readers who wish their own lives worked out so perfectly. How could the story get any better? Jane, the poor, rejected orphan, finds a man so in love with her that he will forsake his own fortune and reputation to marry one of his own servants. Mr. Rochester, the eccentric, moody man he is, finds a wife so well suited to him, who returns a love so strong, that she marries a blind and crippled husband. The fact that Jane Eyre had a romantic and heart-warming ending will really secure one's opinion on the book. After all, most people do not enjoy books with unhappy or unfinished ends. They leave readers hanging and feeling unsatisfied. Jane Eyre is just the opposite. Its conclusion wraps up the story beautifully and leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It makes one happy to know that true love does conquer all. Probably the most important virtue of Bronte's whole book is the main character, Jane Eyre. If there had to be only one reason why people should read the book, this would be it. Jane has so many admirable qualities, and her own actions teach the reader many valuable lessons on life and good morals. She provides the perfect role model for readers of any age or sex when she demonstrates such qualities as self-discipline, strength, dignity, humbleness, and faith. She illustrates these traits constantly in the book, but one section that is a particularly good example of her wonderful character is when she leaves Rochester. At this point in the story, Jane has already found out that Rochester is a married man. She knows she can not stay with him because she can not love a married man. That would make her his mistress. She loves him more than words can say, and no matter how painful it is, she decides to sneak away in the middle of the night. By making the choice to abandon her own emotions and do what is morally right, Jane is demonstrating her own self-discipline and strength all at once. Then, when she leaves, taking only what she was wearing, she is retaining her dignity. She wants to show Mr. Rochester that she is strong, and she does not need anything he gave her to lean on or use as a crutch. She is an independent woman who has dignity, but she is also not too proud. She is humble when times demand so. One instance is when she is hungry, and has to go begging for food. It is an embarrassing task to take on, but Jane does it even though she realizes it will affect her own reputation. Lastly, Jane constantly has faith. She not only has religion, but a real faith in herself. When she is sick and living with St. John and his sisters, it is her faith and will to survive that keep her alive. She is definitely a praiseworthy character and an exemplary role model for any reader. As one can see by these bounteous compliments on the book, any reader will enjoy Jane Eyre, and it is earnestly recommended to someone who is looking for a good book to read. It is an enjoyable novel with a good ending, and the book Jane Eyre truly illustrates model human beings that anybody can look up to and learn from."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Before it was fashionable or even acceptable to be an intelligent women in command of herself, Charlotte Bronte created Jane Eyre, a heroine unsurpassed in courage, dignity, wisdom and self-containment. Bronte didn't resort to stereotypes of the day by creating a beautiful but wan heroine with giddy, sensual, flirtatious or fickle allure, but rather a woman who earns the reader's respect with her naive and quiet candor, her wit and constancy. Even her plainness, mediocre physical appearance and lack of skill become endearing as Jane is created to be real.However, though I respected Jane, the tale was so sluggish in the beginning that I almost stopped reading. Most characters were dull or too unlikable, and the storyline, though of interest to me, was blandly written. It was the entrance of the tempermental and ugly Rochester that sparked my attention. The dynamics and chemistry between Jane and Rochester are the best I've experienced between two characters in a novel. Their relationship was far deeper than most romances written in the novels of Jane Austen or Georg Elliot, as Bronte explores the characters' thoughts and feelings more than she does their economic dilemmas.Having read this novel innumerous times, I count it amongst the most satisfying and engaging of the stories I've known. Not only do I collect hardcover copies of it, I also own every movie made from the book (5 to date, I believe). It isn't necessarily a flawless novel, but it is passionate, haunting and stirring in its very imperfection."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Romance and love. Principles and rash decisions. All these are included with much more in the edge-of-your-seat novel: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.The main character, Jane Eyre, is first pictured as a poor, neglected, mistreated ten-year-old. Her temper is yet wild and uncontrolled, so she gets into many scraps, consequentially landing her in a boarding school fifty miles away. After a bad epidemic of typhus, the unhealthy structure of Lowood school is discovered. It is at once put to rights.After eight years at Lowood (two total as a student and six as a teacher), Jane discovers that she longs for a different life. She puts an ad in the paper, and soon receives a letter from an old lady named Mrs. Fairfax. This lady writes to hire Jane as governess of a little French girl. Upon taking the job, Jane presently meets the owner of the house, Mr. Rochester, and falls in love. However, while at the altar, about to make their vows, a disruption occurs.Jane runs away with nothing but a few pounds, which she accidentally leaves in the coach. After three days out in the open with hardly any food or sleep, she encounters a happy family, which takes her in. Se doesn't give her true identification, but soon becomes at home and gets a job as the local girl's schoolmistress.However, not very long after, Jane meets a bend in the road. No sooner does she get settled in, but she finds that she does have family and a large fortune after all! She begins to feel restless and uneasy to have left Mr. Rochester, and sets out to find him.I won't say the ending, but I will say that I loved this book! It is so romantic and sweet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Besides, \\"they all lived happily ever after,\\" and that's the best part."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"JANE EYRE is a wonderful story about a woman's struggle to survive and go on to realize her full potential. It is also a stirring tale of romance in which love conquers evil and despair.The plot is interesting while the main characters are multi-dimensional and very intriguing. The book has almost too many characters but some are memorable simply because they seem so real.The story begins with Jane Eyre as an unwanted orphan in the care of a cruel aunt who has two spoiled children of her own. Jane is sent to an austere boarding school where she develops into a remarkable young woman able to overcome tremendous obstacles and discouragements. She gets a job as a governess for a young girl at Thornfield which is owned by Edward Rochester. The evolving love relationship between Jane and Edward becomes the focus of the novel whose broad message is uplifting in spite of the sombre mood and tragic events which often intervene.I like Charlotte Bronte's writing style. It is easy to see why she became an immediate success with the publication of JANE EYRE in 1847."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"This book is probably my favorite that I have ever read. The story is about a young governess who grew up as a neglected orphan. When she moves to the home of Rochester, her life takes quite a turn. Charlotte Bronte's writing style is sound, engaging, and beautiful. The heroine is easy to relate to and displays a strong, ... character. This book is passionate, romantic, mysterious, exciting, and altogether wonderful!

Jane is one of my favorite characters in literature. It is an incredible, beautiful story, one of the best ever written. Jane Eyre is a plain, unattractive, poor orphan. She goes through a difficult childhood, first in the house of her abusive aunt, then as a student who endures the harsh and unjust conditions of Lowood School. At eighteen, she takes up the post of governess at Thornfield Hall, meets and falls in love with Mr. Rochester, her employer.Despite the wrongs and harsh treatments she recieved as a girl, despite having no family and few friends, Jane at eighteen is strong, thoughtful and intelligent when her character meets the nasty and sarcastic Mr. Rochester. Their conversation is so full of wit, humour and hidden meanings. There is nothing more charming than how Mr. Rochester attempts to provoke Jane and tries to bully her a bit, but his efforts miserably fail as he finds he has met someone who is quite his equal. In her novel, Bronte stresses that their relationship is based on 'sympathy' and 'a likeness'.A dark secret of Rochester's past impedes their marriage, and after an emotional and heart-breaking scene, Jane adheres to her morals and leaves Thornfield in the night. What follows are two days of degredation, neglect, and pain, as Jane finds herself in an unfriendly town where none will help her. An unusual twist of fate brings salvation at last, in the form of the handsome St. John and his sisters. Again Jane's strength of character is tested when St. John (is it me, or is he a lot like Enjolras of Les Miserables?) makes her a difficult proposal. She has to make a final decision of either sacrificing her heart or seeking Rochester again.The novel is full of heart-warming moments, suspense and intrigue. The narrator, Jane herself, constantly addresses the reader, and makes you feel like you know her personally. Through this and the beautiful use of language I've found a friend and an idol in Jane. She is a wonderful character, and you come to realize she is not at all plain, she is interesting, complex, and passionate.When speaking of her Rochester says \\"Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage...And it is you, spirit - with will and energy - and virtue and putiry - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.\\"Did I say the language is beauitful and thrilling? My copy of the book, although new, is quickly wearing out! Again and again I pick it up to read my favourite passages, which I've marked. Although I absolutely adore this book, I must say if you are not a fan of the genre and don't read classics, you might think it slow. But with some patience, your efforts will be rewarded. Read this book if you think yourself unlucky, Jane's courage and faith will inspire you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"When I was little, my mother would always read this to me. I was named after the writer, who my mother loved. This book is a classic. You must read this to be considered a true reader or &quot;book lover&quot;."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"True, the first few chapters are difficult to get through,but after those this story brought out tons of emotions in me.I felt ashamed when Jane heard the ladies talk about her in the game room with Mr. Rochester there.I felt shunned when Mr. Rochester brushed Jane aside seemingly without a second thought.And I felt the romance in the garden.Not to give away any more, I will just simply state that I felt some emotions that no book has ever brought out so fervently in me.This isn't your classic love story..boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. There is tragedy and heartache on the sides of both characters.There isn't just the longing of one or the heartache of one, you see each,longing and heartache, in both.The characters are put into such detail and described so well you can almost imagine what they will say in response to other characters in the book.This is a truly unique book and if you like feeling angry,fearful,mourning,loss,and romance this book is for you!When I first started it,it really was not that interesting to me, and it actually took me two times to go check it out before I eventually got past the part I didn't like.So if you bear through the beginning you'll eventually get to the really good stuff...oh, and one more thing. If you have seen any of the movies,don't go by them.Of the movies I have seen based on this book,none live up to the standard set by the book.I hope this was helpful:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Signet classics)","review":"I absolutly loved this novel. It does not matter how long ago it was written or how much time has passed since I have read it. The characters are interesting, well-developed, and exciting. I had forgotten about how Jane Eyre's childhood was such a struggle. She experienced mental and physcial abuse at the hands of unfeeling and wicked relatives. Later in the story when she is &quot;left&quot; at a &quot;school&quot; her life is again that of a sad and angry child. Somehow through it all she manages to become a affable, caring, and trustworthy adult. This assures her not only a position has a teacher at her school but later has a governess to a child in the care of the intimidating and wealthy Mr. Rodchester. What a formadable opponent she was has an adult to Mr. Rodchesters wit and saracasim. The end of the book is full of surprises and twists. I hate to sound cliche but it is true.
