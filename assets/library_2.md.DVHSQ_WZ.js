Designed for artists, writers, musicians, actors, sculptors, and anyone else whose desires lean toward the creative, Cameron's book reads similar to The Right to Write, another book of essays tailored more toward the impact writing can have on the creative life.Written during the summer months spent while living in Taos, New Mexico, Cameron begins each essay with a description of the weather, the landscape, or the culture of one of Taos, one of America's hotbeds of artistic inspiration. Cameron makes comparisons of the natural world around her to the creative lives of the individuals she seeks to help unblock. The essays are short, running on average two or three pages, and the initial paragraphs of explicit description of Taos and the weather can become frustrating after a while. Keep reading. Get past the mundane to the core of the essay, and you will find inspiring expert advice.Many of the concepts explored in The Sound of Paper are the same as in Cameron's best-selling creativity workshop, The Artist's Way. The Sound of Paper serves as outstanding supplemental reading for anyone undertaking The Artist's Way. Each essay is followed by an activity intended in helping the reader experience first-hand the concepts discussed. Cameron explores all aspects of creativity, from the root causes behind blocked artists to dealing with creative reawakening and even surrounding ourselves with supportive and encouraging friends. She takes things a step further by encouraging her readers to explore their deepest desires, imagining themselves as fulfilling their creative dreams and setting goals - both long and short term - to achieve them.Cameron discounts common stereotypes of artistic people, explaining that artists need not be loners, eccentric, alcoholic, or unhappy. So many of these stereotypes force individuals to shy away from an artistic life. Cameron explains creativity as the reason for life on earth, linking creativity to spirituality and a higher power she refers to as God, or the Great Creator. Her perspective is unique in that she asks her readers to consider themselves as conduits, or channels, tapping into the creative energy of the universe and bringing art to life. Cameron encourages the removal of the ego in the process of making art.A worthwhile and inspiring book for anyone seeking to get in touch with their creativity, The Sound of Paper will challenge readers to go outside of their comfort zone and take a chance on implementing a happier, more fulfilling existence. Aside from the often too details prose regarding New Mexico and the stretching comparisons, the book is filled with solid advice and inspirational stories of creative awakening."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"For anyone who has read The Artist's Way, The Sound of Paper will simply be a reiteration of Cameron's philosophy on the writing life and how to unblock, using the same concepts put forth in her earlier work. The text is well-written, albeit there is absolutely nothing new here; as in The Artist's Way Cameron continually pats herself on the back and drops names. The Sound of Paper should be renamed 'The Sound of Money' as it is definitely funding the author's less lucrative creative projects by tapping into her cash cow."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"What a ghastly let down ! Luckily this book was a gift and not a personal purchase. It seems to me that the author spends all her time writing books on how to write/be creative - without having produced much else at all. A really good writer writes books and maybe, just maybe, will write one guide to aspiring writers. I have not read any of Cameron's other works but the writing in this one is not a good advertisement for her at all. Her short 'essays' - presented to the would-be-creative-writer whose muse has gone on vacation are meant to be inspirational. I find them pedestrian at best; shallow and uni-dimensional in content and bristling with the shabbiest of clich&eacute;s. An insult to anyone dedicated to meaningful, resolved writing. These short essays act as a prelude to a simple 'exercise' aimed at about Grade 5 level ( I am judging by what my children received at school here in Namibia at age about 10) which is meant to release one's creative spirit. To say that the book is steeped in mediocrity is almost too generous. I cannot recommend this to anyone who is serious about writing or accessing their creative spirit unless they are a teacher of pre-pubescent children."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"I have liked some of Julia Cameron's earlier work, as well as one of her more recent (Walking in this World), so I looked through this one at a bookstore, but didn't buy. If she is so creative, why is she writing the same book over and over, year after year (or sometimes twice a year)? She needs to take her own advice: take some time for the well to fill up again. Hers has obviously run dry. It's getting to be rather sad, and embarrassing."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"This book is like every book by Julia Cameron. In it, she once again ponders her life as a writer. She once again pats herself on the back for all of her wondrous accomplishments. She once again looks in the mirror and assures us that she is still a beautiful woman. She yet again comes across as terribly lonely and makes writing look like a pathetic way to spend one's life."},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"My husband is taking a class in biology this semester and one of the required \\"texts\\" is the CD collection, Thinkwell's Biology. Most of the educational CD's I've tried have been a great disappointment. The attempt at \\"interactive\\" formats has left much to be desired, and there were no lecturers at all. The Thinkwell work, on the other hand, is superb. The lecturer, George Wolfe, is enthusiastic, knowledgeable and entertaining. The table of contents includes evolution, organic and inorganic chemistry, cell biology, respiration, photosynthesis, molecular genetics, biotechnology, cell reproduction, Mendelian genetics and mutation, population genetics and evolution, evolution of life on earth, animal systems and homeostasis, plant systems and homeostasis, and ecology. With such a wide range of topics, the collection would be very helpful for students in earth history, geology, biology, ecology, and anthropology, among others. Furthermore, the lectures are simple enough in their content, design and presentation that I think that most junior high school students would find the material fully understandable. Each lecture is about 10 minutes in length, so there are frequent jumping-off spots to allow for other activities, and each is fast paced enough and topic focused enough to keep even the most hyperactive student's attention. I find that when my husband is watching the lectures, I join him and we spend an hour or more; it's better than TV."},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"This book is actually instructional CDs. George Wolfe does a good job of explaining the differents topics in general biology. Thinkwell's biology also has access to the thinkwell website where biology teachers can post a class syllabus. The website also has thinkwell exercises for the topics on the CD. A good companion for college students taking first-year biology."},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"In my opinion, if you cannot learn Biology from George Wolfe, you are not going to learn it. I am a Biology professor and I bought these cds after running across some excerpts on youtube. He does an outstanding job of breaking down the topics and giving great analogies to help students learn the material. By watching these videos I feel like I have become a much better teacher. I would buy these again and again. For parent of a Biology student, this is an amazing tool. A Definite must have."},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"I had considered becoming a biology major earlier in my college career and picked up this resource because I had success with Thinkwell Calculus in the past. I did enjoy the lectures but found that it was not rigorous enough for my intro bio classes. I wish there were more application exercises for the DNA and genetics/probability stuff...my classes went way more in-depth than what was presented here. I found this to be more like high school biology than university level biology in the amount of depth and rigor covered."},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"I bought this set of CDs for an online biology class I had. The CDs have long dragged out lectures. The professor lectures are more entertaining than most, but they are not worth watching since they do not stress what my professor thought was important. The only useful thing in the CD set was the ID number which you can use to access notes from their website.To tell you the truth, I made an A in my biology class by just looking at these notes. A friend of mine was using the same CD set and was having the hardest time with the class until I told her to forget watching the CD lectures and just go to Thinkwell's website. Then she later told me thanks for helping her raise her grade up to an A.If you must buy this set, then buy the cheapest and get the ID number. That's the only thing of value."},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"I purchased this item as study material for Introductory Biology and I will tell you it is better than my textbook. I often found myself skipping my college lecture to watch this instead. It is very in depth. George Wolfe is very enthusiastic, his love for Biology makes you love it as well. He is an excellent teacher!"},{"Title":"Thinkwell Biology","review":"If you want an A in 1st year biology- get this and your A will be an easy A.

That's what I was really interested in."},{"Title":"Russian Cooking (Foods of the World)","review":"This book is a step back into the world of the late 1960's. The photography is wonderful and the description of Russian regional cuisine is enlightening. The writer/editors were prescient in titling the book Russian cuisine instead of Soviet cuisine since the Soviet Union is no more. But the regional dishes and recipes given are part of today's Russian cooking even though many of the countries mentioned (Ukraine, Georgia, Latvia, Estonia, Uzbekistan, etc.) are now independent nations. In short, we have a cuisine of a cultural region and not of a political state. An interesting historical development.The recipes are good, very clearly written, and with excellent illustrative photography. For the most part the recipes are authentic (although one wonders how one can have a Ukrainian meat borsch without pork)and can be created by a resonably competent cook.Book is worth the historical photography, if for no other reason."},{"Title":"Russian Cooking (Foods of the World)","review":"Fist mistake Ukrainian Easter eggs on the cover.

If I had been here it would have shipped right back to the seller."},{"Title":"Doll","review":"Doll was the first book I've read so far and a short one. I'm experimenting with unread authors and McBain is one of them that I've really enjoyed. Although, I knew who was the killer, but the characters made the book exciting and the fast-paced action was overwhelming. I wasn't too keen on the drug use, but considering the time that this book was written--at the height of hardcore drug use, one couldn't expect a cleaner book.I strongly recommend McBain. I had to buy several books the same day I bought 'Doll' because McBain was rated &quot;top&quot; comparing to those we already know about. My curiosity paid off."},{"Title":"Doll","review":"This case for the detectives of the eighty-seventh precinct is more &quot;concentrated &quot;than usual as it centres on one case ,rather than having the multi-focus plot that is a feature of many series books.It is a case of murder,the slaying by multiple stab wounds of the model &quot;Tinka Sachs&quot;in her luxury apartment while her terrified five year old daughter &quot;Anna&quot;is playing with &quot;Charlotte&quot; her favourite doll.Steve Carella the lead detective request the help of Bert Kiling still deeply traumatised over the death of his girl friend some five years earlier.Carella discovers the identity of the killer but before he can divulge this and make an arrest he is attacked ,knocked unconscious and chained naked to a radiator kept alive by his abductor only so he can reveal how he came by the knowledge of the guilty party .The key lies in the doll and before Kling can bring the case to a conclusion we are taken into the motives behind the killing (drug related)and are witness to the way the resolution of the case helps Kling in thre healing process.Its tautly told and totally professional .Good police and forensic analysis scenes -as ever in the series;and McBain is always good on the strsses and strains that police work imposes on its practitioners.As an example of detection its a bit thin-I found the plot device around the doll a little implausible-but a solid workmanlike book that maintains the high standards of this reliable series"},{"Title":"Doll","review":"In a previous book in this excellent procedural series, Detective Bert Kling lost his girl to a gunman. In this entry, he still is dealing with his grief and his attitude has him close to being transferred. In an effort to help his friend, Steve Carella volunteers to work with Kling on the case of a murdered model. Because of friction, Carella is taken (presumed dead) by a mystery woman who begins to hook him on heroin. This is a fine entry in the series, but I prefer those that focus on several cases and feature more of the 'gang'. But, hey, any McBain is hands down better than any procedural by anyone else!"},{"Title":"Doll","review":"Tina Sachs has been killed. Who would do this to a pretty model? Carella is assigned to the case and asked for Kling who is mad at the world over the killing of his girl friend in a previous book. Carella finds out who the killer is and goes to arrest him. Instead he is taken prisoner and put through much punishment and herion shots. Who is the strange girl who keeps bringing Carella food and also giving him the shots? Kling is taken off the case and Myers is given command. They do find tthe killer but is it in time to keep Carella from becoming addicted? This is much better than book nineteen. At least this one involves some police work. I would have given it a five except for several pages of how a doctor treated Tinka Sachs for her drug addiction. I don't think it had anything to do with the case. You knew,in your mind, that Carella had to live to be in the next book but it did hold my attention and I did not want to quit reading."},{"Title":"Doll","review":"'Doll' is one of the earlier entries in the 87th precinct series, and as such is shorter and more straightforward than some of McBain's later mutli-layered epics. Still, it's a good book; yet another solid entry in the long-running series. When model Tinka Sachs is found stabbed to death, the investigation quickly throws up a defensive employer, a one-eyed doorman, an ex-husband who still seems to love Tinka, mysterious contacts from the past, and obscure references to a personal \\"nightmare\\". The case is set against the backdrop of a brooding, on-edge Detective Kling still unable to get over Claire Townshend.McBain employs an interesting twist in narrative here; the case is actually \\"solved\\" relatively early in the piece, and it is what happens after this that occupies large sections of the book. This is quite a clever ploy, with various other detectives in the 87th needing to follow Detective Carella's footsteps to work out who the killer is, and what has happened to Carella. The particular plot point involving the titular Doll is perhaps a bit clever and coincidental for its own good, although the remainder of the investigatory technique is well done.For 87th fans, note that apart from Carella, the primary protagonists here are Detectives Meyer and Kling. Brown and Willis have smaller roles, and little is seen of Hawes and Parker. Obviously, in such a long-running series it is inevitable that spoilers from early books will be given away, so be aware that 'Doll' gives away a key development from the early books regarding Kling and Claire. Some 87th books can be read without knowing the backstory, but 'Doll' is not one of them.In summary, another good crime novel from one of the best in the business."},{"Title":"Doll","review":"The best thing you can say for \\"Doll\\" is that it is no less than you expect in opening an 87th Precinct novel: A ripping crime involving a scantily-clad woman, a title that comes to suggest several different meanings as the plot twists along, and a page-turner that never lets go.Several books and years after 1961's \\"Lady, Lady, I Did It!\\" Det. Bert Kling is still mourning the loss of his girlfriend while getting on the nerves of his fellow detectives at the station house. His pal Steve Carella decides on some occupational therapy by bringing him along on his latest case, the murder of a high-priced fashion model, a \\"mannequin\\" as she is called by the strange agency she works for. Kling becomes the station goat when he leaves Carella after an argument and Carella subsequently disappears. Is he a burnt corpse or someone's prisoner?Any 87th Precinct fan will know that \\"Doll,\\" since it takes place in 1965, doesn't actually kill off Carella, the series's main character. But author Ed McBain (really Evan Hunter, who kept producing 87th Precinct thrillers for the next 40 years until his death in 2005) keeps you on tenterhooks anyway with a storyline stretched tauter than usual and suspension of the comfortable rules governing past 87th Precinct novels. Lt. Byrnes, the detective commander, tells Kling he blames him for Carella's loss, and will see him off the force for it. Carella may not be dead, but he is in serious danger of losing his mind and self-respect.One nice aspect of Carella's disappearance is it gives the other detectives a chance to work on solving a case. Kling will have his shot at redemption, of course, but there's also some real work for Meyer Meyer for a change, while Art Brown and Hal Willis dig up a clue or two as well. Even Andy Parker, the department's rotten apple at this point in the series, has a nice moment where he philosophizes about Carella's loss. Being Parker, he shares the moment with a prostitute he is threatening with arrest if she doesn't come across with a freebie, but it's still somewhat out of character for him.The main weakness in \\"Doll\\" is the problem of the victim. The motive behind her death, when revealed, doesn't really wash, and the central clue feels somewhat contrived. The book lacks the depth and humor of other entries, particularly later ones.But that's something you think about after, when you have time to pause and reflect. The only thing you worry about when reading a solid McBain thriller like this for the first time is getting to the next page, especially with its array of sudden story shifts and clever red herrings flying at you. This is one \\"Doll\\" that plays with you. A fun read."},{"Title":"Doll","review":"A beautiful model, Tinka Sachs, is murdered, slashed repeatedly in a frenzy of killing, while her tiny daughter hides in the next room, talking to her doll. Detectives Steve Carella and Bert Kling of the 87th precinct, are in charge of the investigation and get a good description of the man who visited Tinka on the night of her murder, from a one eyed doorman, nicknamed Cyclops. Carella and Kling get into an argument about Kling's brusque interrogating technique, which results in Kling going off in a huff, leaving Carella to continue with the investigation alone for that night. Because of being on his own, Carella is captured, handcuffed to a radiator in the suspect's apartment and when an incinerated body, carrying Carella's police warrant card is discovered in a burned out car, his family and workmates are convinced that the body is his. It's a fast, good read, full of meticulous police work, without frills or fuss...a typical McBain book."},{"Title":"Doll","review":"It would be nice if some cared enough to quote prof reviewers who actually cared to read the work unlike Ingram's stupid mistake of saying it was Bert Kling who disappears. It was Steve Carella. After 50 some books one would think they could get it right finally.The work is classic McBain. It gives you the feel for police work. Slow where it should be and fast where it should be. He takes us into being part of the team not just a entertained reader. Perhaps that is why he has so many books published. We become a member of the 87th. It is spare writing designed for maxium impact. Never boring except when police work is indeed boring and that only briefly when emotions arise like &quot;TELL US. Quit hedging around and tell us&quot; rises in interviews with witnesses and perps.Steve's disappears and is presumed dead but... well you read the book. I won't snitch.Shame the original Ingram they quoted didn't bother to read it. It is worth it.

You never know who the killer is despite the fact that he has Carella locked up in his apartment. Also, McBain leaves you guessing as to the motive of the killer until the thrilling climax in which all is revealed. Man, you want to talk about nail-biting. The author also does a terrific job of illustrating both the inner and outer conflicts of Bert Kling, who is openly hostile after his girlfriend was gunned down (that incident doesn't occur in this book). I say again, DOLL is one of Ed McBain's finest works. Once you pick it up, you won't put it down until you're finished."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have always liked any book by GL and REALLY liked STAR WARS EPISODE III REVENGE OF THE SITH.

There are hundreds of pieces of conceptual art and beautiful paintings.

You'll see a lot of concept art on cityscape, robots, planets, costumes, creatures, architecture, props and characters relating to the Star Wars movie. This book is all about art, you won't see any movie stills.There are two versions of the book. The one with the movie script has 272 pages. The one I'm holding has only 224 pages.Design concepts are explained for the characters and set. There's not much text but enough. The level of detail, effort and creativity displayed by the artists is simply marveling.

While the art-books for the first two movies focused heavily on characters, the Art of Episode III focuses particularly on the worlds created for the movie, presumably as most characters have already been seen.I'm not interested in art, so I don't have a bias toward this type of product. I'm a Star Wars fan first and foremost. The art work is, however, of a high quality and shows diagrams, paintings, drawings and sketches of the characters, planet locations, vehicles and weapons - everything that was designed by Lucas' own art team for the movie. The book (this time) is arranged in chronological order, taking place over a period of two years where the author documented the development of the movie from preproduction to principal photography to digital shot creation. The author, Rinzler, was allowed to work with the artists and therefore had first-hand experience with Lucas and the team. Typically, the art team generate their own designs which are bounced off Lucas and then manipulated to his satisfaction. This is all documented with discussions with the artists themselves and Lucas as to why something is kept and another discarded.Not only do you find the items that made the final cut of the movies but concepts that didn't make the big screen. I don't want to give anything away about Episode III, so an example from the 'Art of Episode II' is the exciting concept of the Sith villain. Count Dooku was the eventual villain chosen by Lucas (reportedly due to Dooku's regal manner) but the character found in some alternative Star Wars literature called Asajj Ventress (the female dark jedi with the black and white martial arts appearance who carries two curved lightsabres) has a series of sketches and paintings attributed to her. So we see Lucas doesn't omit any ideas from his designers, and uses them in various side projects. It is fascinating seeing these characters etc pop-up in various side projects.Overall, all Star Wars fans should have the \\"Art of ...\\" books. They provide a classy addition to the bookshelf and provide hours of intriguing reading and dreaming of a galaxy far, far away."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I am a huge fan of the artists in this book. I've loved the other two books in this series and believe Sith is the best of the trilogy. The sheer scale and breath of alien worlds Lucas has conjured up for Revenge of the Sith is amazing. The drawings in this book have totally inspired me to work on my sketching more and have set the bar for industrial design. The drawings are something you can study and absorb for years. Many kudos. I'd give my eye teeth to study art with Church, Tiemens, Fu, McCaig, Frame, Zu... - Way to throw it down guys!"},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"This third installment of 'The Art Of', or should I say sixth, is once again a wonderful book. The contents are again one step further into the digital age, most pieces being made on a screen, not on paper. This is the only 'con' I have to all the 'pro's'. I miss the marker-made-visuals of for instance Doug Chiang. Even though this corresponds greatly with the way the movie was made, it is simply a thing I really like to see. But on the whole, it is a must-have for every Star Wars/movie art lover!"},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I have reviewed every Star Wars Art book and have enjoyed them all to differing degrees. Episode II marked for me a low point in this series. The art didn't look like I expected. Not sharp which is what I expect when I see Star Wars art. Well this one has that sharp art work I love and a few extra surprises.The layout of the book follows the chronology of how the projects were taken on by George Lucas and his art department. This was an interesting window into the \\"behind the scenes\\" activities. The quotes from Lucas and the crew were also very interesting.The concepts that evolved while arriving at Grievous were great, the worlds were only caught a glimpse of in episode three was something I was pleased to see more of, and Lucas' fascination with lemurs...well lets just say we already know what happens when he gets his mind set on a concept, be glad Episode III didn't end up with another Jar Jar.There is no script, but in time, I'll know it well enough like I do the others. So I can't take points off for that.All in all, a great book."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"I know that his is part fo teh 'pre-release hype' for a blockbuster movie. But in this case, the hype is well justified. One look through the art in this book makes a convicing case that the promotions and other media events being used to entice people into theatres (and later to buy DVD's) is probably not hype at all.It is clear that a lot of work went into making the Star Wars movies, and for REVENGE OF THE SITH, Lucas-Films, et.al pulled out all the stops and spared little (if any) expense to ensure that this would be a 'movie for the ages'. It might work.The story line for the movie is more or less revealed in this art book. That should come as no surprise, since it is almost impossible to present the visuals without providing some context in which they fit. Because reading the book and discovering what is involved in crating the scenes is so engaging, and fun, I'll let you read the book, and not reveal any plot details in this review.As a book, this might remain popular long after the movie is released. Unlike a lot of movies, the Star Wars series is about the art and technology of movie making, as much as it is about the final product. It seems that Luas and his production company paid a lot of attention to fan criticisms of EPISODE I, and after largely redeeming them in EPISODE II, appear poised to 'go out on top', ending the STAR WARS sagas with a true 'magnum opus'.This book will whet appetites for the movie itself, but from all appearances, it's a movie that will be well worth the wait, and satisfying to audience expectations."},{"Title":"The Art of Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith","review":"Such a great art book. Stunning paintings, sketches and just all around a great art book. Over 200 hundred pages. Nothing bad to say about this book at all."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"&quot;The Advanced Grammar Book&quot; should be on every advanced ESL student's bookshelf. Having seen numerous grammar books published in the US and Britain, I can with no doubt recommend this item. It contains very clear explanations of all complex grammatical structures in English and allows students to practice them thoroughly in context. Each of the 15 chapters revolves around a topic. New structures are introduced through a reading passage, followed by a careful explanation of the grammar points in the form of a chart and a number of exercises. The accompanying Workbook offers even more practice exercises. An additional strength of the book is the fact that the topics are very current and provide the students with the rather advanced vocabulary which is particularly helpful for ESL students preparing for the TOEFL and American college studies."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"This book covers a wide range of topics, but it does not go into detail in explaing them. The treatment of grammatical structures, especially tenses and conditionals, is broad but superficial, leaving out important cases, thus making the book of limited value for advanced students who require clarification of grammatical nuances, not a survey of topics. It is more suitable as an introductory text for beginning ESL students, as a foundation for further study."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"I've used this book as an ESL teacher and thought it was excellent. It definitely covered advanced and tricky structures with abundant exercises: both oral and written. The examples need updating, however. I'm waiting for the next edition."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"I used this book in my Advanced Grammar and Writing course, and I was very disappointed. I especially disliked the practice exercises. They often included complicated structures that were irrelevant to the topic being practiced and that tended to distract students from the issue at hand. Also, the book seems quite out of date, and this affects the types of practice activities included."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"Buyers be warned. If you are looking for the book, and not the workbook, double check your order before you purchase. Unfortunately, the workbook is useless without the book.The book is great. Now, for me to find it."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"It's not helpful at all...lots of topics with so short details.When you read it,you're gonna have more questions long the way."},{"Title":"The advanced grammar book","review":"I received this book 2 weeks later from I ordered even though I paid expedited fee. I really needed to get it early. I am very disappointed."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Security","review":"This book is the most up to date book on solaris security. It has a good resources list, as well as hands on intro to IPsec. The Kerberos chapter could be longer, but it sets you thinking anyway; the first chapter gives real insight into security in plain English. Overall it does what it says."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Security","review":"I just got a copy of Edgar Danielyan's _Solaris 8 Security_, and like other New Riders titles, I'm pleased with the contents. At around 250 pages, it seems small compared to a lot of the phonebook-sized buzzword-compliant books out there, but that is because it is a very focussed book. I particularly liked the section describing different types of cryptography, each type of encryption is briefly defined and related to security concerns.The book also touches on subjects such as Kerberos, simple ways to vastly improve the security of a system, and discusses what kinds of attacks are often seen (and how to deal with them).It's a good book to have on your shelf if you administer Solaris. It provides a good starting point for securing your Solaris 8 systems (and other UNIX systems in general). Ask your boss to buy it for you, you'll both sleep easier."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Security","review":"Mark Twain once said that he didn&#8217;t have enough time to write short stories, so he was forced to write long novels. In that vein, there are plenty of computer books in print that comprise more than 1000 pages, cover every topic under the sun, and include a CD-ROM with often-obsolete freeware tools. Such tomes are often a waste of time and money because the contents are primarily filler with little added value.Solaris 8 Security, on the other hand, provides a very good overview of Solaris security without the bulk of unnecessary and often extraneous information. The book covers a lot of ground. The author covers key issues involved with the various aspects of securing Solaris systems, but does not get bogged down in page-wasting minutiae.The first three chapters provide a good introduction to basic security, cryptography, and system security issues. Chapter 4 gives a good synopsis of the authentication and authorization facilities in Solaris 8. The chapter includes information about the basics, such as etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, and the new RBAC (Role Based Access Control) functionality that is available in Solaris 8. In the past, RBAC was only available on Trusted Solaris; now it is included in standard versions of Solaris 8 and above.RBAC attempts to solve the problem of network users having far more network access than is necessary. The fact is that most existing networks allow users to access 10 to 20 times more resources than they will ever use or need. Because authorized users commit roughly 80% of computer crime, providing too much access is a huge security risk. So how does a systems administrator reduce overall user permissions by 70-90%, while providing users with the necessary access on a need-to-know and need-to-do basis? RBAC.Further chapters in Solaris 8 Security deal with Kerberos, auditing and accounting, and open source security tools. Chapters 8 through 10 conclude the book with overviews of network security and IPSec. Chapter 8 has some very helpful hints on fine-tuning the Solaris 8 TCP/IP stack via various configuration tools and files. Chapter 10 details how to secure various network services including HTTP and NFS.Anyone looking for a well-focused book on Solaris security should take a look at Solaris 8 Security . It&#8217;s an excellent starting point, and at fewer than 200 pages, it provides a really good introduction to Solaris security without wasting readers&#8217; time, money, or trees."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Security","review":"I found this book very handy, if it does not answer some of the questions about certain solaris security issues it, at least, points you to the right direction. In fact it is an encyclopedia of Security for Solaris admins."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Security","review":"This book was what I needed. It is the perfect refference book for it's topic. I like the size of the book; it was not crammed with useless pictures, tables, or filler.Sure, you can pour over tons of online Sun Documentation scatterd thoughout the Answerbook series or even dig through the man pages. Who has that much time? I needed to get quick organized understanding of my options in securing Solaris 8. Some of the chapters will be basic reading for some and reviews for others. However, a new Solaris admin who need to learn good idas on security can start here. The experienced UNIX/Linux/BSD admin can also pick up this book to learn the specific options available on the Solaris plateform. You will also learn about the short-comings of it as well (such as not coming with ssh; remedied in Solaris 9). You learn how to configure the Solaris TCP/IP stack and it's implementation of IPSEC. These two where the most useful chapters in the whole book for me.All in all, if you admin Solaris 7/8/9 you should check this book out."},{"Title":"Solaris 8 Security","review":"I am a beginner Solaris administrator and was recommended this book on the net. I am glad I got it - in about 200 pages it manages to introduce many security aspects of running a Solaris system, even explaining such things as risk management."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I checked this book out of the library, hoping, like many other people, that it would be of the same caliber as the Bridget Jones novels. I was extremely diappointed. The character of Olivia Joules is like cardboard, a cheap imitation of BJ. While there were some funny moments, I found the entire story line way too implausable, and a plot that seemed like it should have been in the movies. I felt as though Helen Fielding catered entirely too much to the Al Queda theme which has appeared lately in fiction and movies. In this, she looses her originality."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Yes I too am a Bridget Jones junkie, like many of the other reviewers on this site. I too was disappointed in the book. It is not just that the character was not like Bridget Jones--but the plot, the pacing, the other characters, all seemed off.HOWEVER, there are plenty of reasons to read this book on the beach this summer. Fielding creates a fun atmosphere as her heroine tries to become a &quot;Jane Bond&quot; and track down the man she believes is an Al Qaeda operative--and on whom she has a very big crush. Olivia dashes from Miami to LA to Egypt to just about everywhere in the world in a very short time and manages to meet everyone from gun wielding kidnappers to Brad Pitt. It's a wacky, fast paced read."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Although more than a bit predictable in spots, Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination has the charm of Bridget Jones, but without the angst and self-loathing. Joules' clumsy attempts at super-sleuthing are almost always successful--not necessarily because of ingenuity or intellect, but because of odd deus-ex-machinas which seem to follow Joules everywhere she goes. She has the guts of James Bond without the misogynist bent. This book holds interest for those who are captivated by fashion, beauty, espionage, wealth, paparazzi, Iraqi insurgents, and Osama Bin Laden. Think these things don't fit together at all? Fielding makes it work in this book."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I read this while on a business trip and had trouble putting it down. I also embarrassed myself with laughter while on the plane and sitting in airports. It is a nice breezy read which is very enteraining."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I usually like this type of book for summer reading, but I was disappointed in this latest book from Helen Fielding. I found the book to be scattered and hard to follow. I was skeptical at the spy-skills that Olivia suddenly possessed. The characters are not developed, and the plot was not cohesive. Not an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. I did like parts of it, but overall I was disappointed. I don't like to read about real life tragedies in my light reading. I think it is inappropriate. References to Sept. 11, 2001, do not belong in a fun reading book. Neither do real life terrorists and their organizations. As for the book's overall concept, I still think it's sound. I like the idea of a &quot;female James Bond&quot; and Helen Fielding is the perfect writer to bring her to life. I hope that she is able to write a few sequels, hone her idea a bit. Make Olivia a little bit tougher, a lot less ditzy, and give her some of that old Bond pizazz."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Like the other reviewer, I really wanted to like this book. I was SO EXCITED when I heard that Helen Fielding was coming out with a new book. It turned me off right away with some reference to a dangerous terrorist being attractive or exciting. I was thinking, maybe this is a British thing I just don't get? I gave her a chance and actually read the book all the way through. It might not be the worst book I ever read, but I didn't enjoy it at all. The action and plot were so simple it was offensive, and the characters were empty and just plain stupid. Not at all what I expected from this author. Please don't hold it against her, though. Skip this book, but read Cause Celeb and Bridget Jones Diary."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I was actually a fan of Fielding before reading this book. Enjoyed her others! I found this book to be offensive. Either Fielding is racist and ignorant toward Muslim people or she wanted her main character to appear that way. It was clear that this book was written in hurry with little attention to character or plot details."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"There have been a number of reviews of Helen Fielding's \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination\\" that have started off with some reference to the author's Bridget Jones series. Obviously, Jones is one of those once-in-a-lifetime character creations, but given this, just how good is Fielding's latest heroine and story?The truth is...not that good.Olivia Joules (the surname a reference to a measure of energy) is a slightly off-kilter journalist that skims dangerously close to hack territory. Her name a desperate attempt to leave behind a tragic childhood, she flits from exotica locale to exotic locale following the whims of fashionistas, supermodels, and celebrities. Yet despite her gauzy occupation,she has a set of life rules she follows religiously, and always keeps a hatpin handy to dispatch would-be Lotharios who cross the line.In covering a new fragrance release in Miami, she stumbles across a movie producer who bears an uncanny resemblance to Osama bin Laden. Always on the lookout for a way into the journalistic big leagues, she insinuates herself into his presence and begins what will ultimately be a descent into hell-albeit with lots of sunscreen and superb diving.When a major new cruise ship is sent to Davy Jones's locker, Olivia puts two and two together and winds up following the suspected terror king all over the globe, each stop putting her closer to being bedded by the Bedouin. Will she pull it off with the aplomb that has become her signature style? Or will she be just so much chum in the emerald waters?Having not read any of Fielding's previous works, I can say that after a while the reader may not care if Olivia Joules makes it out alive or not. The problem with this book is two-fold. It is very stagy, the scenes plotted out as if the movie deal is already inked. Miami, LA, Mexico, Honduras, London, Sudan-it's a travelogue held together by a wisp of story. And that story is dragged out for far too long as the backdrops whisk by one after another. Fielding may be trying to spoof 007 movies, but she doesn't do it that well. Every character seems out of place, particular when they coincidently show up in every locale Joules visits.The second problem is with the male characters; they are all poorly written caricatures. Joules's newspaper editor seems to be an Anglicanized version of The Daily Planet's Perry White, a phone jammed in his ear and throbbing veins ready to burst from his forehead. The male lead, Pierre Feramo, the suspected terrorist, is so oddly portrayed that he has no center at all. Every time he does anything in the book, it is unrealistic. It is almost as if Fielding had no idea how to make the character consistently human, and male. The true love interest, and I'll leave that one a secret, is just a fool, plain and simple-a man Olivia can always one-up. This may be an empowering female character to some women, but did Fielding have to write her at a cost to everyone male around her?This is not to say the book has no redeeming value-it's a quintessential summer beach book--but it is still disappointing. Fielding leads up to a final showdown that fizzles, only to have an epilogue that is the real finale-and it fizzles, too. Pieces of greatness are here, but with no supporting structure it sags under a reading malaise. That's too bad from an author who was able to give us a lot more in her previous books.Despite all the promise and a spot on the bestseller lists, this one is merely fair."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I wasn't crazy about this book. For starters, I really did not like the plot. Post 9/11 terrorism is nothing to be glib about. There are most definitely evil people in the world and there is nothing funny about it. I don't care what spin you try to put on it. Many other reviewers stated that they felt that this book was racist. I don't think it was racist per se, but I will agree that it did feed into some of the Arab sterotypes that exist today. The plot was oddly reministent of the one used in the movie Ms. Congeniality with Sandra Bullock. I was wondering if anyone else noticed that as well.I found the whole Rachel Pixely/Olivia Joules character to be annoying. She suffers a tragedy and feels that this requires a name change?? I mean really! Not to mention she's pretty sure that she thinks Pierre is a terrorist and then proceeds to follow him around the world for the sake of a story?? Oh and did I mention she's a bit of a floozy? She hooks up with a few different guys and is prone to taking crotch shots when provided witha camera. The rest of the story goes downhill from there.... At the very end of the novel readers will no doubt marvel at Ms. Fieldings grasp of the male vocabulary as evidenced by Olivia's boyfriend Scott -- his favorite word is \\"baby\\". He must have said it at least 15 times!!Anyway the lowdown on this book is ... make it a library book instead of a permanent purchase."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I placed this book on hold at the local library after reading the 2 Bridget Jones books and enjoying them. This book is pathetic! It doesn't even read like the same author.I'm normally the first person to defend cheesy plotlines and silly characters, but this book takes the cake. The story isn't even really a story. It sounds more like a very bad rejected sitcom from the WB Network. The characters aren't even remotely funny or likeable. They're one-dimensional and lame at their best. I don't even think it would make a decent movie.I kept reading hoping that it would get better and would make sense. It doesn't. There's no romance, no mystery, no fun in this book. Don't bother with it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I had to put this book down because I did not like the story. I found the book annoying and did not like the subject matter. I did not find anything funny or amusing about writing a light hearted story around Osama bin Laden and terriorism. I am really disappointed in Helen Fielding's choice of subject matter for her book. I loved Bridget Jones and can not believe how disappointing this book was. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I read Bridget Jones several times so I was really excited when I finally got this book from the library (good thing I didn't have to pay for it). In the beginning, the book was ok, not Bridget Jones quality, but readable. I kept waiting for the whole Al Qaeda plot to really be a figure of Olivia's \\"overactive imagination.\\" Unfortunately, this did not happen. The lesson learned from the book is that if you see an Arab, he must be a terrorist plotting a disastrous strike on the U.S. and therefore you must call the FBI immediately. This book encourages fear, stereotypes and prejudice against Arabs, something which this country does NOT need. I am extremely disappointed, offended, and will not continue to support Helen Fielding."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Native Londoner Josephine Bailey gives a spirited reading to Olivia Joules, the latest incarnation from Helen Fielding who created a young woman to whom most could relate and therefore loved - Bridget Jones. Whether Olivia is falling in love or enmeshed in international intrigue, Bailey is right there with the proper inflections. At times reserved, at other times ebullient, the reader becomes Olivia.Let's say up front that Olivia Joules is not a Bridget Jones - far from it. Olivia is a fearless modern miss with a unique underwire bra and boundless imagination. Of course, she's drawn to handsome, wealthy, Pierre Ferramo. However, she does not believe he is the worldly tycoon he purports to be but rather a terrorist in disguise.Nonetheless, this woman's in love and she follows him all over the globe, which gives listeners entree to some of the world's most exotic locations. When the Brits hire Olivia to track Ferramo, she quickly becomes a female James Bond. All of which makes for fast paced listening and high adventure.Fantastic plot? Yes, at times it surely is. However, it's also great listening as we accompany our heroine from one hot spot to another and from out of the proverbial frying pan into some surprising conflagrations.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I really liked this book, Olivia is a great, heroic character. It seems some are put off by the terrorist angle, and perhaps since it has been a couple years since 9/11 that I'm reading it, I am not at all bothered by it. Humor is used, but seriousness is implied. I hope Fielding uses these charactors again in another Bond like adventure. I just adore when women are allowed to be sophisticated, cool and smart!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I was so excited when i found out that helen feilding the writer of Bridget Jones' Diary had a new book out.

Basically Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"When I started this book, I thought it would just be about a silly girl and her romances. Then as I read along I began to enjoy myself, engrossed in the humorous misadventures in exotic locales. I realized this was not another single gal in London/New York looking for a man book, but an action packed adventure written in smart prose. I am giving these as Christmas presents to my girlfriends and family."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This is poorly done. It is so implausible and her facts are way off. I find it ridiculous that a US Navy carrier has no combat air patrol up and is hanging out in the Red Sea close to the coast of Sudan. Plus, the Navy has Seahawks (Blackhawks are Army). You can't eject from a helo-- why would the pilot yell &quot;eject, eject.&quot; Also, a submarine communicating back and forth with the ship like that? I certainly hope MI6 doesn't recruit people like Olivia and if they do they don't visit their friends to provide details where the new agent is going. How could her editors not insist that she cover the terrorist attack if she witnessed it? I liked BJ's diary and I hope fielding goes back to that genre. I'm very frustrated with this and disappointed."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This book was TOO much fun! Not plausable at all, but just an outright silly, delectably daydreamy delight!Olivia Joules is an enjoyable character (much less whiny than Bridget Jones), stumbling into adventure and half-heartedly trying distinguish reality from fantasy. What woman hasn't wanted to be involved in both the fashion world and international intrigue? This story involves everything from a mysterious Shiek to scuba diving to LA twits. The book could have been intolerable but Fielding handles the implausability with humor so that I found myself giggling and smiling through the whole book.Most enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This was honestly the worst book I have ever read. I normally will burn though all of my \\"chick lit\\" books really quickly...I didn't even make it past the 7th chapter of this book. My husband was SHOCKED to find a book that I didn't finish. The plot was terrible, the main character I just could not get into and I was confused. This was an absolutely terrible book. I love the Bridget Jones' books and was seriously disappointed."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I was at the library and happened to come upon this book and was excited to find that Helen Fielding had written another book - I loved the Bridget Jones books. It had reviews such as \\"Olivia Joules is the Bridget Jones of the 21st century\\". It was very witty in the beginning chapters, but lingered way too long on the time when she was in Honduras and the Sudan...couldn't wait to finish it just so I could be done and move on. Overall I wouldn't suggest reading if you expect it to be anything like Bridget Jones."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I enjoyed this book. Having read all of Helen Fielding's novels I found this one to be an odd combination of Bridget Jones and Cause Celeb. In the beginning of the novel Olivia definitely was a rehashed Bridget character. Even some of the language and jokes were the same. If you enjoyed Bridget then you won't mind more of the same. The flow of the first half was definitely interrupted by the poor editing. At some points it was unclear where the action was going or had been simply because it needed better editing.The second half of the novel begins to find it's own voice and you are able to disassociate the this novel from the previous novels. Also the editing seems to improve dramatically.Having said this I found the book wildly entertaining and quite a few places I actually laughed out loud. IT became a real page turner that I could not put down. Definitely light, easy, fun reading that I would recommend and a nice addition to Helen's resume."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately I found myself racing through the last half just to get the reading over with. I wasn't expecting Bridget Jones, but I WAS expecting the same insightful humor and fun that came with the Bridget novels.I found Olivia Joules to be irritating rather than endearing, and the Al-Quaeda plotline to be, in a word, ridiculous. In fact, most of the plot I found to be overly contrived, predictable, and just downright silly.We know Ms. Fielding is a talented gal and I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out how this book took such a 180 from her previous novels in storyline, style and humor.I'm still hoping for Bridget #3...can't you imagine how many things could go wrong on Bridget's wedding day? I think that particular style is where Ms. Fielding shines most, and I hope she returns to it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I think it is great that Helen Fielding has written a novel that is quite different from Bridget Jones's Diary. It proves that she can write about other things, that she can create different storylines and unmistakable characters. Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination is fun, different and full of Fielding's British humor. However, as humorous and clever as this book sometimes is, Olivia comes across as a lunatic rather than someone with an overactive imagination at times. The Osama Bin Laden look-alike thing is so over the top I didn't even find it funny. I know Fielding leaned toward satire at times here, but I found the novel a chore to read halfway through the book...As said earlier, I appreciate Fielding's attempt at writing a different sort of novel, but I still missed Bridget Jones. It isn't fair to the author, but some things aren't replaceable, like the ditsy Bridget we all know and love. Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination is clever and humorous, but I advise readers to keep in mind that Fielding can write more heroines other than Bridget Jones, but I also advise the reader to be honest about your take on the book. It's great if you love it, but it is also okay if this novel is below your expectations. To me, Helen Fielding's newest effort is just... okay."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I really wanted to like this book having enjoyed Ms. Fieldings other books. I found the book to be cliche and bigoted against Muslim's and the Middle East. I think she can do alot better. I've almsot finished the book and I don't plan to complete it. The overall tenor of the book is marked by a strained reaching for laughs and a begging to be taken seriously, neither of which occur. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I stayed up half the night to finish this book, but not because it was good. The closest approximation to reading the second half of this book would be to watch a trainwreck unfold in slow motion. You can't look away, but you know that whatever you see is going to be ugly.The main character is an ingratiating, neurotic bore. The other characters are badly-drawn cardboard cutouts. And the plot? Jerky, unbelievable, and yet somehow predictable.Why did I stay up reading it? I wanted to see how the author would extract herself from the pit that she dug. Unfortunately, she did it in a most superficial and cloying manner."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I picked up this book while taking a break from another and immediately realized what the other was lacking: sparkle. The indescribable sparkly zing that makes a book special.After just a few pages I found that besides style, the book also had a thrilling and clever Nancy Drew meets James Bond vibe that I can't get enough of; as soon as I finished I started it over again! It was even better the second time.Olivia Joules is my new hero, hope she won't mind if I borrow her Rules for Living."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This book made no sense to me. I don't usually have a problem reading books but half the time reading this book I wasn't even sure what was going on or where she was. Read more like a screen play."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"After learning that Olivia Joules was a thriller, I wasn't in much of a hurry to read it. But after seeing Helen Fielding describe the book at a reading at B&amp;N in Los Angeles, I was sold! Fielding mentioned that she was at an airport one day, and was looking for a book to buy when she decided that she wanted to read a thriller that was fun. Think Bridget Jones joins the CIA. I started the book that night and finished it two days later. It was a fantastic read, even better than Bridget Jones! Give it a chance, you won't regret it. And don't listen to the reviewers who couldn't even finish the book, what do they know? Thank you Helen Fielding! Give us more!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This book is obviously not designed to elicit serious change in the world order, but Fielding has successfully managed to combine a light hearted romp with a serious desire to save the world. This is not John le Carre but it is definitely entertaining. Fielding has obviously done a little research that doesn't usually fit with the chick lit genre: a nice surprise."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Funny at times, but references to real-life terrorists is disconcerting and in bad taste. The voices are fine for the women characters, but HORRIBLE when the reader is doing men's voices. Especially annoying when it's American men. Skip the audio version."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"If you loved Helen Fielding's wonderful Bridget Jones books, you're in for a very rude surprise if you read this supposed spy novel. What a boring, unfunny and pretentious book. Olivia Joules has to be one of the most ridiculous, truly stupid characters that I've ever read. She's not sure if she's falling in love with a dark mysterious bin Laden ripoff but she sure hopes he loves her. Reading her pathetic efforts to convince the bin Laden character that she also hates America so that he might fall in love with her made me gag. This nonsense doesn't even have the benefit of the humor that characterized the Bridget Jones books. Save your money and stay far, far, far away from this drivel."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Having read the Bridget Jones books and having loved them, I looked forward to reading this one. I was not disappointed-far from it. This isn't as funny as the Bridget Jones books, but Olivia has her own little quirks, and makes a great heroine. It's sort of like combining a BJ type character with a James Bond type situation. The climax of the novel was wonderful and I couldn't put the book down until I finished. I can't wait for the movie to be made-should be great! There's also a lot of info about the Arab/Muslim culture, and so the book is educational, too. Read it, but do it when you have time to read it straight through with no interuptions. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Having read Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones books - &quot;Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination&quot; is much awaited for all Fielding fans. I'm waiting for the sequel - maybe there won't be, maybe there will be - can anyone beat Bridget? I don't think so! (Hence the reason why this book is given 3.75/5 - rounded up to 4 by myself!) This book did make me laugh out loud - and I can certainly see everything in the book in a movie! Go read this!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Compared to Bridget Jones, Olivia Joules fails to entertain and bewitch the reader on so many levels. Might not be a fair comparison, but still.... The story is highly unbelievable, to the point of SciFi movies, and that is what passes for entertainment. I believe Ms. Fielding can do much, much better. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I can't believe all the negative reviews!! Olivia Joules is confident, persistent, brave, and powerful in her own slightly bumbling but adorable way. Wonderful main character, fun and complex plot, great settings, worthy evil opponents, hunky romantic interest, and a full complement of adventure. And several great rules for living! An adventure story for our times. I read it and re-read it. Lovely writing with a perfect light hand creating a great romp. Thank you, Ms. Fielding!!!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"As a big fan of the Bridget Jones Diary books, I was eager to plunge intoOlivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination. It looked like a fun romp.Olivia has reinvented herself from the orphaned girl Rachel Pixley, and now that she has created this new persona, she is trying hard to make the switch in her career from style features to hard-core journalism. Once she has accomplished this task, she is determined to find adventure in all the exciting places of the world.When Olivia takes off on a jaunt to Miami to do a style feature, she stumbles on a potentially exciting story when a yacht explodes. She is suspicious of a playboy type whom she suspects is really a terrorist, and some of his behavior suggests that he is up to no good. Is he a dangerous criminal, or is it just her famous overactive imagination?As Olivia begins her quest to find answers, I started losing interest. Much of what happens in 2/3 of this book was convoluted, unlikely, and required suspension of disbelief. Plus, I found Olivia's tendency to place herself in potentially dangerous situations foolhardy and a bit stupid.By the end of the book, I was shaking my head and asking myself why I had read to the last page. Giving this one three stars seems too generous."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I don't mind the semi-vapid story line, as it is a fun read, but as many of the other reviewers are saying, I did feel that it was racially discriminatory.I think that the jibes about Muslims and Arabs were uncomfortable stereotypes. And her comments about the inbreeding incest and donkey loving on Popayan Island was a bit uncomfortable.Other than that (!!) I thought it was a fun read. But maybe misjudged.My biggest gripe, is that on the back cover story outline and in the first 50 pages of the book, Ferramo is spelt with two 'r's and then after that, with only one 'r' as Feramo!!! Terrible editing!!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I'm a picky reader and I loved this \\"thriller.\\" I'm surprised to see the extensive number of negative reviews - to each her own - but I thought the book was fantastic. I picked it up and couldn't put it down until I reached the end. Was it cheesy? Yes. Realistic? Not in the least. Ridiculous? Absolutely. A bit offensive? If you are easily offended, then possibly yes. But it as also hilariously funny with keen, witty observations about popular culture, self effacing dialog, and a refusal to take itself too seriously. The main character was a lovable mess that I couldn't help but root for. If you are looking for an engaging, fun beach romp, this book is for you. If you're looking for high class literature, you may wish to skip it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I read this book for the first time several years ago - probably in 2006 - and I have re-read it several times since then. I adore it. It is witty, fun, exciting, and a humorous send-up on much of modern culture and society. The snapshots of American culture through the eyes of a well-traveled Brit are particularly humorous. Helen Fielding, like her heroine, demonstrates a keen understanding of human nature and how who we are as people drives what happens to us in the world.Olivia as a heroine reminds me somewhat of Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next (seeThe Eyre Affair: A Thursday Next Novel (Thursday Next Novels (Penguin Books))) - Olivia is a competent woman with problems who goes about solving them.No one will mistake this for something by Mary Shelley or Emily Bronte, to be sure. But then again, I had a hard time getting through both Frankenstein and Wuthering Heights, and I have a degree in English. I couldn't put Olivia Joules down. This is excellent chick lit. Bridget Jones spawned a field of British chick lit books involving flawed female characters dealing with their romantic lives, many of which I enjoy (though I'd like to strangle Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic character). Olivia Joules plays off this and pushes beyond it, showing that women can have goals and problems bigger than the men in their lives, even when the men contribute to both.If you want to be bored and look erudite, don't read this book. If you'd like a fun, sly read, don't miss it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I adored the Bridget Jones diaries, which I think are among the cleverest of the genre, so it was with great anticipation that I picked up Helen Fielding's latest effort. I was disappointed.Sure the book delivers all that it promises - fast paced action in the beautiful parts of the world, potentially evil terrorists (or playboys?), big terrorist attacks, sub plots and red herrings. But somewhere along the way, I really began to find the book was quite hard going. I think I just stopped being interested in, or caring about our hero Olivia.It is certainly mildly entertaining, and as a smallish book it is a quick read, great for lying on a beach somewhere. But I think it is also a great opportunity missed. Perhaps it will translate better into a movie - this is a screenplay waiting in the wings."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"But I am not here to add to it. This book is fluff, but it is my kind of fluff. I was not all that fond of Bridget Jones, I found her whiny. Perhaps this is why I like Olivia, she is a Bridget who actually has managed to keep her resolutions and transform her outer self. Her inner self might still be a bit of a mess, but her confidence makes up for it.This spy story does involve actual threats, but that is true to the tradition of spy stories, when Ian Fleming was writing Russians was just as scary as middle-eastern terrorists are now. A good spy story should create a hero(ine) that can make you feel safer in the face of a real threat. Olivia is not quite as reassuring as the ultra-competent James Bond, but her ability to not panic and remain curious even in difficult situations is a saving grace.On another level this novel is a Jack tale, and Olivia's bumbling success follows that pattern. She charges in and get over her head and somehow comes out the better for it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I had heard bad things about this book but I loved it - let's add Olivia Joules to the list of great iconic female leads. Up there with Bridget Jones (obviously), Jane Eyre, Catherine Earnshaw (Wuthering Heights), Isadora Peabody (The Charm School) and my other new star Elsie Roundbottom (You Are Here)"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Fielding was way off base this time. I managed to get through 220 pages before I put it down in disgust. (I skimmed the end, just to make sure it was as bad as I suspected.) It was tasteless, to say the very least, of her to exploit 9/11 for the purposes of selling a rather badly written comedy. Other authors have managed to include 9/11 in their works (Pattern Recognition comes immediately to mind) with sensitivity and tact. Nobody could ever accuse Fielding of sensitivity or tact in this novel. It is relentlessly racist, in a casual British-colonialist kind of way. All the bad guys are Arabs, of course, unless they are selling &quot;carrrpeeets.&quot; Our sole black man has bulging shorts (not a speaking part). The romance aspect is a cross between a bodice-ripper and Masters and Johnson with shades of rubber. And Joules, our dim-witted, politically challenged, and oh-so-coy heroine, utterly fails as a Jane Bond. Overall, I'd say if you picked this book up for beach reading, let the tide take it back to England."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I've read all of Helen Fielding's books (though I really must admit--I couldn't make it through Cause Celeb, *yawn*). After reading the first chapter of Olivia, I was worried it would be another failed attempt from Fielding. But then things started looking up.Olivia won me over. I like to think of her as a Bridget Jones meets Sydney Bristow. I'm a big fan of the tv series Alias, and it was sort of like having Bridget thrown into a spy role, which led to many funny moments.I ended up thoroughly enjoying the book, and didn't put it down all day! Very pleased with the ending as well. Three cheers, Fielding has done it again!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"The only reason I finished this book is because I paid full price for it. I've enjoyed Helen Fielding in the past, but this book made me want to gnaw off my limbs. The characters are thin and insipid. The plot ridiculous in the extreme. I read the positive reviews posted here and wondered if they read a different book. Perhaps someone changed the cover on me? If you go in for the clumsy, ridiculous and poorly written, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"OK, this is not Bridget Jones (which was 5+ star). Lower your expectations. But it is a light summer read, perfect for the beach, about a reporter with an overactive imagination that is really cleverly done in the first half of the book- she imagines espionage everywhere! and sees hidden motives in all she meets- this could have been a wonderful comic novel ala Basil Fawlty, but alas some true espionage does come Olivia's way and the book changes tone dramatically 2/3's of the way through and becomes quite serious. Or rather, tries to take itself too seriously, ala Ian Fleming, which I think was a big mistake. The latter half of the book seems at odds with the first half- were these written by 2 different authors? Did Ms Fielding take an extended holiday between parts 1 and 2? By the end of the book, one can imagine Ms Fielding writing with an eye to the Hollywood film this will no doubt become. All ends neatly tied up- though incredulously (one must suspend one's disbelief) Still a light read that may be worth reading- but not a keeper (ie, I would freely loan it to people I'd never expect to get it back from) and just don't expect Bridget Jones to appear."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Olivia Joules, the heroine of this novel, is a smart, capable, and fashionable journalist who usually writes fluff pieces but aspires to oh, so much more. Her aspirations often combine with her overactive imagination to let her see too much into things sometimes, resulting in not a little embarrassment. And yet, there is certainly something amiss with the supposedly French supposed film producer she meets at a party in Miami...Soon Olivia is relying on her wits, overactive imagination, survival tin, and Rules for Living to get herself out of jam after jam in every part of the globe.Fielding's descriptions of places seem to be spot-on (at least the ones I've visited), and her voicing of Olivia's thoughts are hilariously funny. The plot is quite imaginitive, too.I flew through this book, giggling all the way."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I am a big Bridget Jones fan, so I had high hopes. I was so disappointed in this book. I tried, but I couldn't finish it. The characters were hard to keep straight and I didn't care what happened to any of them. Ultimately, my biggest complaint is the use of terrorism as the plot of what is supposed to be a fun beach read. This book needed to choose a genre."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"So many reasons that this is the most dissapointing book I've read in years. And NOT because Fielding does a semi-genre swtich from Bridget (i think that will be her excuse as to why the novel is not well received). I was all for the spy/thriller/comedy/chick lit thing, but this book does not deliver on any of those genres, let alone all of them.First lets talk about the blatant racism. The first arab Olivia sees, she thinks \\"Osama Bin Laden\\" (cuz they all look the same of course). Then she immediately pegs him as a terrorist- and dont you know, he turns out to BE one. The lesson here? If you see an arab he MUST be a terrorist.One thing I did enjoy at first were the dark undertones given to Olivia's character (ie. the family tragedy and changed names) but Fielding fails to develop this into anything substantial, and Olivia remains a cardboard chick-lit heroine stuck in a contrived spy-terrorist plot....well if you can call it a plot. Essentially a series of inexplicable coincidences has Olivia repeatedly endanger herself (there's a smart girl!)only to live another day and have learned nothing from the day before.Next, we can discuss how terrifically inappropriate Fielding's allusions to 9/11 and al-qaeda seem amidst what is apparently trying to be a fluffy beach read. A cruise liner is blown up, and Olivia saves a drowning man, but the experience seems to do little to alter her character or thought processes. Thereby one can only assume that the tragedy of hundreds of people dying was merely a plot device necessary to incite Olivia's adventure, and is never treated with any real emotional depth. This aspect of the novel was purely offensive to me. I am all for making light of difficult or sad situations, but the classless and utterly vacuous way Fielding handles the terrorist element is beyond redemption.There is so much more to dissect about why this book fails to even come close to meeting any expectations (of any published work, let alone an established author), that I will leave it here. I will only mention that the writing itself is awkward (the past tense seems out of place, perhaps to dissassociate the narative style from Bridget Jones)with amateur imagery and high-school level exposition. A true let down."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I don't think I'll ever read another book as endearing to me as Bridget Jones Diary and the sequel to that book but this book came in a close second.A very good read!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I can't tell you how glad I was that the kissing scenes were limited.

I've also read other books from Ms. Fielding, and she has in the past included some international \\"incidents\\" in her books, which have stretched credulity. However, to have a brainless conspiracy buff chasing down Osama Bin Laden in the Sudanese desert goes beyond fictional license and borders on inappropriate and disrespectful.I kept waiting for there to be a twist in the plot, wherein all that had gone on was in Olivia's head. I kept waiting for it to be some elaborate adventure vacation where all the exciting things that happened were all set-ups for conspiracy buffs like Olivia. However, unfortunately, nothing like that happened. Scott Rich and Olivia run around the Oscars at the end of the book just telling random people \\"I'm CIA\\" - is Ms. Fielding SERIOUS!?!?!? The two called each other \\"sweetheart\\" and other endearments during the investigation and while at work. Simply ridiculous. The book reads like Tom Clancy without any research or basis in truth or fact.Ms. Fielding turned something so devastating and ingrained in a national psyche as 9-11 and the fear of future terrorist attacks on the US into beach trash.

That was the case with my reading Olivia Joules and yes, it really is that bad. Lots of the reviews on this forum have detailed the bad plotting and characterisation and the bad taste of the subject matter. Others have said that had she not had considerable success with BJ this would never have been published. I can only agree with everyone who gave it a 1-star rating. This is possibly the worst book I've ever read. It's hard to believe Fielding has such disdain for readers or that the publishers would cash-in on her previous work.

I did not get the feel from the book that Fielding was racist or insulting 9/11, the book really is not that deep. Olivia is quirky and amusing. I like how she sees and criticizes Hollywood and upper society's superficial values. In closing I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an easy fun read, and not to look too much into."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Helen Fielding developed yet another character that we can identify with and be jealous of all at the same time... this is a great character with obvious development through the story. The story, even if it is admittedly a bit unrealistic, takes twists and turns that advance the plot and leave you laughing. All the book asks of you is to suspend reality in your head a little bit, and enjoy... which you're supposed to do while reading fiction anyway. I read it in a day and enjoyed every second of it. I very much recommend this book - it's perfect for a lazy Saturday."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"but thinking that the story is the most ridiculous thing that I have read in a long time.

Her assignments take her to all the hot spots including Miami & LA where she meets some strange characters. Wierd things start happening after she is introduced to Pierre Ferramo at a face cream launch in Miami.

Set aside the social commentary and Bridget-comparisons and just enjoy her!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Helen Fielding has provided readers with two wildly entertaining books, Bridget Jones's Diary and its followup Bridget Jones: the Edge of Reason. Olivia Joules has very big pumps to fill. Sadly,this book falls miserably short. Olivia Joules is on staff of the Sunday Times, a writer who is often distracted from her assignments by flights of fancy. Given her overactive imagination is it any wonder her boss hesitates to put much stock in her hunches? When Olivia is sent to the United States to cover the launch of a new skin care product line, Creme de Phylgie her suspicions are piqued by Pierre Ferramo, one of the product's inventors. Pierre seems to becaptivated by Olivia. She in turn is wary, sure he is involved in much more than skin care. When the newly opened Oceans'sApart, an apartment on the water/cruise liner, is blown to bits right before Olivia's eyes, she is sure Pierre is involved and may even have ties to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden!! No one believes her so she decides to get to the bottom of it all. For once, she'll prove it isn't just her imagination gone amuck. Although, Olivia is supposed to be covering the beautiful people,she seems to keep running into the ugly people, which there are too many.Sadly, this is a story gone amuck. There is not much that ties these different tangents together. The story veers here and there and it is hard to follow the story or to even care about the character. Plot lines are tossed aside to make way for yet another more implausible story twist. Even if Olivia does manage to untangle the web of intrigue, we don't care. We just want her to go away."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Olivia Joules is a well meaning , curious journalist seeking hard news who ends up on the style page for her London newspaper.

Also, Olivia Joules is not nearly as likable as Bridget."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I LOVED the Bridget Jones books . . . this book by Fielding, however, isn't the same.

It stinks."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"James Bond she ain't. Jane Bond she ain't. After elevating the world of chick-lit, Helen Fielding does a 180 from Bridget Jones novels, writing a lighthearted spy novel, \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination.\\" Olivia's bumbling gets rather annoying after awhile, but it's an amusing light read.Olivia Joules (original name: Rachel Pixley) was orphaned at a young age, and managed to claw her way into a top-level journalism job. But she's always had a vivid imagination, that results in her constantly reporting swarms of locusts, starving zoos and other things. So when she sees a guy who resembles Osama bin Laden (who turns out to be an international playboy, Pierre Feramo) at a Miami perfume launch, she immediately starts sniffing the trail.The next day, there's a missile attack on a local cruise -- and Olivia has good reason to think that Feramo is involved. Then her hotel room is bugged, and a giant sack of cocaine is left under her clothes. Now Olivia is convinced that Feramo is part of the al Quaeda -- but can she be a successful spy without losing her head, literally?Fans of James Bond and Jason Bourne need not apply -- Fielding's spy novel is a lightweight affair, with a decidedly amateur heroine. If you don't take it too seriously, it's an amusing beach-read. But if you take your spy-lit very seriously, you'll loathe every last word of it.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block is the idea of writing a chick-lit thriller about al Qaeda, a very real and sinister organization. I can understand Fielding's desire to laugh at what we fear, but it feels weird to have something so very unfunny as the center of her novel. Certainly it's well-written, and Fielding mixes in some elements to keep it from being too fluffy -- including an M16 agent, poisons, drugs and a decapitation.Most of the supporting characters are enigmatic and sinister enough to be convincing spy-lit characters. The exceptions are the Chatty Female Pal and the Demanding Boss, both chick-lit staples. Olivia herself is rather annoying, since she keeps tripping dizzily into danger and then freaking out. Still, she has some guts, even if they don't show up very often.Despite the ditziness of the heroine, \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination\\" is an amusing light foray for Helen Fielding. Just hope there is no sequel -- Olivia and her antics will wear thin easily."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Olivia Joules, the title character in Helen Fielding's latest novel, OLIVA JOULES AND THE OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION, is a professional writer who dabbles in novice espionage.

On more than one occasion, her imagination gets the best of her and she finds evil dwelling behind the scenes of every fashion story she encounters.Fed up, her boss assigns her to cover the launch of a new product in Florida where, as her history would have it, she encounters a man, Pierre Ferramo, whom she suspects of terrorism. A coincidental disaster on the morning of her date with the dark and exotic Pierre sends Olivia's brain spiraling. From London, to Miami, to Hollywood, to Central America, and finally the Sudan, Olivia follows her love-interest-slash-terrorist-suspect to an unexpected conclusion.Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding's lead character in her previous bestsellers, was one of those hugely popular fictional folk who became iconic in no time. Women loved her because she worried about weight, and boyfriends, and cigarettes, and drinking too much, and work, and, well, everything. We all found her to be highly recognizable and relatable. She was one of us. And we loved her so much that Helen Fielding brought her back in an equally successful sequel to the first book. Heck, Hollywood made a movie about her (and a second one is coming to a theatre near you soon).Olivia Joules, however, is no Bridget Jones. Where Bridget concerns herself with the absolutes of everyday life, Olivia is off the charts in her pursuit of a Bond-like existence. Bridget despairs over too many chocolates; Olivia assembles a spy kit. Bridget sneaks off to the country for a weekend with her boss; Olivia goes scuba diving in shark infested waters. Bridget suffers over decisions of what to wear; Olivia carries a suitcase of all the right outfits. Sure, Olivia is quirky in a Walter Mitty way, what with that overactive imagination referred to in the title, but she's unbelievable. She's not one of us, like Bridget.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Ignore all the idiotic reviews of this book - it is a riot, an absolutely fun, silly book that makes for great light reading. (I finished it off in two evenings.) The main objections people seem to have to the book are 1) Olivia isn't Bridgit, and 2) it's irreverent to the victims of 9/11 to use al Qaida as a plot device. So if you're the kind of person who can't deal with authors who create different characters (heh), or you're in complete denial about the reality of today's world, you might have trouble seeing this book for what it is - a lighthearted spy novel with a clumsily incompetent yet still lovable heroine. Yes, you have to suspend a bit of belief, in the same way that you do when you watch a Bond flick... but isn't escaping into a slightly fantastical version of our own world why we read fiction in the first place?"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I give this book four stars instead of three since I read it during the summer. As a Bridget Jones fanatic I was a little bummed out by this one. It's not nearly as clever and insightful as the two Jones installments. I know plenty of people find Bridget Jones to be shallow and pointless, but Olivia is transparent. Basically, Fielding is better than this and all of her references to 'current events' are cliched and pretty lame. In the end, this book reads more like Candace Bushnell than Helen Fielding. But there are hints of Fielding's genius hidden in references to fashion, terrorism, and scuba diving."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This is not a great book, but it's not a bad book either. I guess I just don't understand some other reviewers' vitriol. Sure, Helen Fielding could have developed characters with more depth; and she could have chosen to flesh out a more plausible plot. But I don't believe that is what she set out to do. Rather, this book seems a clear attempt to overlap the &quot;chick lit&quot; genre into a realm where it doesn't go as often as it could: mystery/suspense thrillers. I understand how another reviewer could draw comparisons between Olivia and Stephanie Plum - though the early Stephanie Plum stories were more overtly hilarious than this book - and maybe that's why I didn't hate this novel. Despite the fact that Janet Evanovich's &quot;Stephanie&quot; series is showing signs of fatigue of late, I have generally loved Miss Plum and her (mis)adventures.That said, I really think Helen Fielding needs to listen more closely to the Americans among whom she now lives, as few of her American characters consistently speak as Americans actually do; they read like Brits trying to sound American. I had more problems with this than with the other aspects that bothered some Amazon reviewers.By the way, I loved Bridget Jones too, but not every Helen Fielding book is going to be just like BJ. And that's as it should be."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I adored Brigit Jones Diary and was prepared to fall in love again....until I read Olivia Joules. The book had a horrible plot that could have only been created by too many late night of watching CNN by Ms.Fielding. While in concept the plot may have been a winner it quickly falls apart with far too many refrences to the Bin Laden family.

Imagine a novel written by Jackie Collins and Robert Ludlum and that's what you get with this funny thriller.

This book does not warrant the bad reviews it has received. I had stumbled across the book accidentally after finishing Dan Brown's Deception Point and aside from my familiarity of Fielding's other heroine Bridget Jones I knew nothing of the novel. If you're looking for an intense convoluted plot with intricate twists and turns this might not be the book for you. However if you don't mind a bit of silliness and a girl using a hair pin as a dangerous weapon I'd give this book a go. I found myself laughing out loud many times and about half way through and I soon decided I couldn't put it down. I spent the last two hours curled up on the couch reading the rest of it and was thoroughly satisfied. This book will transfer well to the big screen."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"It sounds like the reviewers who did not care for the book may have taken it a bit too seriously.The main character does have an overactive imagination, keep that in mind...it's right in the title!Overall, I enjoyed it. Not as good as the Bridget Jones' books, but a funny main character who kept you turning pages to find out what she'd do next.I do recommend!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I really thought that the critical reviews that I read about this book were bunk. But the authors are entitled to their misguided opinions.I just loved that Ms. Fielding was brave enough to make the real life terrorists the bad guys. If only the Hollywood types that acted brave at the end could really be counted on to do so. I thought the book was funny, ironic in the use of typical Al Jazeera propoganda-and just when will some of the critics of this book wake up to the real threats in the world. Ignoring the threat is the REAL disservice to the victims of the terror. I think that everyone should \\"Stop, Breathe and Think\\"."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I don't know what the other people that wrote reviews for this book were thinking, but this book was awesome! It was like a truly new section of chick lit that hadn't been covered by anyone else--it mixed adventure, romance, and fun. I finished the book in a day, because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Olivia Joules; the plot line kept me riveted and glued to the book. I'd say that this book was definitely a lot more entertaining and enjoyable than the Bridget Jones' diary books because it had a more exciting plot and adventure while still keeping with the chick lit theme. Definitely recommend this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I almost gave up on this half way through because I felt it was just nonsensical.I could not put my finger on it exactly but it really bored me and I wanted to get to the end of the story. The heroine, Olivia, just was not that believable to me and the story jumped around so much that it was just hard to keep track of.That being said, the ending in a way redeemed itself, since you find out that Olivia may have an overactive imagination but in this case she is spot on and figures out everything about the bad guys.It is not bad but it is not up there with any of my favorites."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"At first, I found it hard to keep reading this book. Fielding's flowery writing style got on my nerves. I decided to keep on reading, however, and I'm very glad that I did.Oliva Joules is a brand new kind of heroine. The book had me laughing out loud so often that my sister had me keep her updated with the happenings in the book as I read it so that she could be in on the fun. If you're looking for a solid piece of \\"chick lit\\" that will keep you entertained then this book will hold your attention. The plot is extremely far-fetched, but then again, that's the point! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Honestly, Bridget Jones got on my nerves in the second book and I never finished it. That rarely happens to me since I always have a compulsion to find out what happens. Olivia is less whiny but there seems to be very little brain processing when she decides on a course of action that's almost as annoying. She manages to skate through some dicey situations by what seems to be just dumb luck.It was almost grating on my nerves of how Ms. Fielding would use current events, which in my view was just a device to try to make the book more believable. If she had just stayed in fantasy land, I might have been more ready to suspend my disbelief. And the way she would describe the romantic interests by comparing them to Osama bin laden and Eminem, made me feel like she was just being lazy. Especially since I don't see either them of as being attractive.Despite those annoyances, I still finished the book since it was still mildly amusing and I had to find out what happened."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I'm afraid I must disagree with other esteemed readers. I loved Olivia more than I loved Brigid--and I liked her quite a bit. The book might be titled \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination,\\" but it's Fielding's overactive imagination that makes this book sing. It might not be WAR AND PEACE, but this book is exactly what this generation of young women need--an independent woman who is sucessful BECAUSE she is a woman--and sexy--not in spite of it. But most importantly, Olivia plays by her own rules--and wins. Hurrah for Olivia and Helen!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I am a huge Bridget Jones fan and was initially afraid Olivia Joules would just be another Bridget. But it was quite the opposite. I found the character to be fun and self sufficient in a different way than Bridget. This book is totally different than the BJ books and I liked that. Clearly Fielding was not trying to write the same book over and over. This book is fun and fast moving. I would recommend it for anyone looking for a light read."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book and now regret spending my money on it.

Yeehaw!Its readable, a bit slow in the beginning, but enjoyable all the same. Keeps your interest and is a bit sensational. (And why not?) It seems Olivia has built up all these talents and lifeskills to become an instant recruit for MI6. She chases after hunky men, the hunky men chase after her. Shipboard romances, globetrotting, money, designer clothes, scuba diving, etc. Olivia does it all in quirky little novel that would make great aquatic (bubble bath, poolside, beach) reading."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Wow! What a unique book! Who would have though that the author of Bridget Jones could write such a thrilling spy novel? I am truly impressed with Helen Fielding ability as an author. She has created the character of Olivia Joules with women in mind. She's smart, she sexy, she's fashionable and she's mysterious. What more could you ask for? She's the perfect character! Helen Fielding, if you are reading this, please writer more about Olivia Joules! Just think, she could be the next James Bond!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Was expecting a book that was as original, fun, and humorous as well entertaining as Bridget Jones but instead I encountered a storyline that was not only sketchy but also unbelievable with undeveloped characters and dull writing.

However, Olivia is a fantastic character - funny, smart and doesn't take herself too seriously. This novel moves at a fast enough pace to keep things interesting, and has enough twists that you will genuinely not know how it's all going to turn out.

Well, then I tried listening at home . . . couldn't do it. not funny at all. no memorable chacters. no solid plot. very boring. and the moment I noticed Fielding got political (suddenly the character was mentioning osama bin laden and al qaeda and blah blah blah) I decided not to continue, and I got my money back . . . in cash.and then I pretty mush swore off Helen Fielding and picked up Sophie Kinsella (same idea - funny bimbo has funny stuff happen to her and mess with her work life/love life/family life/social life etc etc.)"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"This book was one of the biggest disappointments in my literary life! I adored both \\"Bridget Jones\\" books and liked \\"Cause Celeb\\" very much. I therefore was anxious to read Ms Fielding's latest. However, I soon realized that this book was very sub-par compared to the early works.The characters are very shallow, and Olivia is downright annoying. I believe Bridget Jones would slap Olivia if the two ever met. Olivia's paranoia is more apropos of a mental patient than a comic heroine. She compares a man to Osama bin Laden, thinking that the man looks very much like bin Laden and that he is probably a terrorist, and then proceeds to make out with said bin Laden look-alike. How sick is that?The book's desperate attempts at humor fall flat. The plot is just silly. That very silliness is also offensive, considering that the plot line involves several make-believe al-Qaeda attacks, which kill hundreds, yet is supposed to be funny. I am by no means easily offended or overly sensitive, but the author's repeated references to 9/11 are appalling. It is way too soon to causally pull the events of that tragic day into a comic novel. It is as if Ms. Fielding is trying to send a message to Americans along the lines of \\"Get over yourselves; a bad thing happened but it's time to forgive and forget. Al-Qaeda can be quite humorous\\".The actual message that I got out of this book is more like \\"Be cautious[...]\\". That is the message that I intend to keep in mind!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I originally bought this book when it was first released and it has been an all time favourite since; it's great to see it out now in ebook format. It was only when I read Olivia Joules that I found I liked it far better than Bridget Jones: the tongue in cheek humour and standard Fielding touch for character realism make it an absolute must for girly Bonds everywhere. I know this book is relatively unknown but give it a chance - I always come back to it like I would an old friend. This will be about my 16th time reading it, and I know I'll still want another go at some point!

I want to be Olivia Joules in my next life!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I beg to differ from those 1-star ratings and bad reviews of some Amazon readers! Granted, this book does not have the depth and research of reality as, say, a Dan Brown novel but, overall, it is an entertaining and exciting book. Although a little plodding at first, the beginning of the book also leaves much to the reader's imagination -- after each scene, you are left wondering whether what the heroine is experiencing is merely a figment of her own imagination or whether it is actually happening. From the middle to the end of the book, it was just hard to put down. Sure, some scenes weren't original (stolen from movies) but there were also many cliff hangers. Taken as a whole, the story is substantial and holds quite a few surprises.The heroine is not another ditzy Bridget Jones because she is smart and independent. I started this book as a big fan of Bridget Jones but now I am just a big fan of Helen Fielding!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Olivia Joules is the most entertaining and self-effacing heroine since Bridget Jones, so it makes perfect sense that she springs, wholly formed, from the forehead of Helen Fielding. This book is hilarious, witty, and an acerbic poke in the eye at our current image obsessed culture of superficial beauty and style. Fielding is also spot on in her location descriptions. Clearly she has done some travel in between churning out bestsellers.Ms. Joules, a minimized features journalist, carving out a living and trying to keep her self esteem in the face of idiot editors and budget conscious news directors, stumbles into an apparent Al Qaeda terrorist plot to... well, you'll have to read about it for yourself. No spoilers here. From L.A.'s Standard Hotel, to Miami, Honduras, and the Sudan, Olivia Joules becomes increasingly suspicious of her new exotic romantic pursuer Pierre - is he French or Arab or both? What does he really do for a living? Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you, baby. I almost hate to write the comparison, but think: Carrie Bradshaw meets the Sheikh.Some reviewers are shocked - shocked! - to read a comedic novel that touches on current terror conflicts and - gasp!- Osama Bin Laden himself. Well, get over it. This is how we reduce the enemy. We mock it. To wit: parody posters of Hitler as a rodent during WWII; M*A*S*H; Hogan's Heros, James Bond and the Soviet KGB, and countless more. As one reviewer notes, this is a screenplay waiting to happen. And I can hardly wait."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I loved this book - I seriously do not understand the reviewers who are pulling it to pieces. Look at the title - it's pure escapism - obviously taking a dig a James Bond - and when did a Bond movie ever tie up all the plot lines? Sure, the editing's bad, the characters are thin, and yes, parts could be considered racial if that sort of thing bothers you - but I don't read a book like this expecting a literary masterpiece - (for that I will anxiously await the next Harry Potter!) - it's a quick fun read and should come with a warning on the cover 'NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY' especially for those reviewers who can't tell the difference.

So when I heard that she was coming out with a new novel I had to have it. 'OLIVIA JOULES AND THE OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION' was nothing like what I expected. It was a cross between a chick lit novel and intrigue in true 007 form. While I did find some aspects of 'OLIVIA JOULES' funny, I found much of the book to be a little over the top.While on assignment in Miami writing an article for facial creme for her newspaper back in London, Olivia meets international playboy Pierre Ferramo, who suspiciously remids her a little too much of Osama Bin Laden. Olivia being the woman that she is believes that there is a story here and convinces one of the magazines that she freelances for to let her do a story on a luxury yach that is docked in Miami. Olivia's intention is to make herslf part of Pierre Ferramo's already large entourage in order to get the goods on him. But before she knows it there is a huge explosion on the yacht and hundreds of people are killed, the explosion is believed to be the work of Al-Qaeda terrorists. Is this a conincidence? Is it Olivia's imagination or could there be a connection here? Olivia follows Ferramo and his crew from Miami to Honduras to The Sudan to Los Angeles in hopes of uncovering a terrorist plot and saving the word. Yeah.While 'OLIVIA JOULES' tended to drag in certian areas and I assure you that the book is pure fluff, it is a quick and easy read made for a day at the beach or when you just don't feel like flexing those brain muscles!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"...at least I did. Olivia is a great Bridget-Jones-turned-James-Bond character. The story in itself is paper thin and Helen Fielding's foray into the world of spy thrillers probably won't give the likes of John le Carr&eacute; any sleepless nights. Nevertheless, the book makes enjoyable reading if you want to take a break from more serious matters and relax in the company of a witty heroine with a mildly feministic approach to matters such as world terrorism, hotel lobby decorations etc."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I forgot how much I enjoyed Helen Fielding's writing. Incredibly imaginative (overactive imagination!), while at the same time being totally real. And hysterically funny!The plot of this one had me holding my breath--very fast-paced & engrossing. And just when you thought it was finished, there's more!The only sour notes were some of the Al Qaeda descriptions-- I think there was one borderline racist comment in there but I will choose to overlook it. All in all a great read!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I am a huge Bridget Jones fan mainly because Helen Fielding has such a great sense of humour. She also has a uncanny knack for pinpointing the hidden fears many women have running through their minds at some point (though, thankfully, most of us are not quite as neurotic).Now Fielding presents us with a new heroine, and on paper, it all looks great. A witty heroine as well as a fast-paced adventure plot? What could be cooler than a female spy? Sadly, I really felt this novel was just a hollow echo of Fielding's previous offerings. Sure Olivia is more composed and less of a spazz than Bridget, but Bridge made those qualities (or lack thereof) endearing. Bridget is not exactly someone we strive to be, but I still empathised with her more than Olivia, who just rang false and never seemed fully conceived to me. Somehow, Fielding has all the parts right, but the result is underwhelming.I personally did not enjoy the terrorism plot, which seemed tawdry and like a poor attempt to cash in on an ever-present global threat. As well, I found the twists very predictable, and I'm not really one of those readers that thinks ahead... at least not if the story's good enough to utterly enrapture me. Again, I'm not sure how, but this book seems trite and was very unsatisfying.I would recommend borrowing this from a friend or at least waiting for it in paperback. It's not worth a hardcover printing. I would have given this a 2.5 star rating if I could have."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I've been reading lots of novels, mostly so I can say \\"I read that!\\" the next time someone mentions a book. For example, I read the new Helen Fielding novel (the author of \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" -- that famous British \\"singleton\\"), entitled \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination.\\" Olivia is also a single British woman who combines intelligence, intuition and outright paranoia to smell out a terrorist, and eventually seduce him into the hands of the authorities. While comparisons have been made to James Bond, I think Olivia is a much more complex character -- she has a real job as a journalist, and a real psychosocialhistory (orphaned at age 14 when her parents and brother were run over by a \\"lorry\\" while she stayed behind to buy some sweets and a magazine). And, of course, there's a love story involved too, so, it's a fun novel to read when you have time, like when you're vacationing!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"It's okay...less \\"chick lit\\"-ish than the Bridget Jones books, and laced with espionage.The main character is fairly likeable. Where Bridget was about 65/35 loveable/infuriating, Olivia is more in the likeable/exasperating range, and about 50/50. But she's still a very cool character, and the plot is sometimes silly, but fun, with some surprisingly affecting and somber interludes.I don't really want to compare it too heavily to \\"Diary\\" and \\"The Edge of Reason\\", because those books had their start in a very different kind of writing. Short, episodic pieces for a newspaper column are not written in the same way as a flat-out novel. And while Fielding is not quite as good at the flat-out novel as she was at the columns, \\"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination\\" is certainly not chopped liver.It isn't an Earth-shaking, life-changing read. It is an engaging and enjoyable light novel, with a strong, confident, resourceful female protagonist. As escapist fair goes, it goes pretty well."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I found this book to be poorly executed. the syntax was awful, detracting from the plot, which was juvenile, to say the least. this was one of the worst books that i have read, and that's to say a lot."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"First off if you've read the previous reviews you will see that Ms. Fieldings latest offering is not BJ. Okay so now that we've gotten that out of the way lets chat about what it is.This is a fun light read that will have you traveling the world with one space cadet of a heroine by the name of Olivia Joules. She is writer that has an incredible knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time all the while trying to get a story that will be front page worthy of the publication that she writes for. This book is really &quot;James Bondesque&quot; kind of read which is at times funny and witty and at other times outright ridiculous. In any event it's entertaining.Again this is not Bridget Jones's Diary and to be fair to Ms. Fielding, one should allow this talented author room to explore other creative avenues. Although this effort has not made it onto my keeper shelf I would not be quick to throw it in the trash bin either. I've actually read the British version of this book and found the illustrations to be an added bonus and quite fun.Chick lit now has another semi-worthy effort out for reader appreciation. It's not as good as some but it's defiantly not as bad as the others. Come to this book with an open mind and I think you may just be surprise. In any event the ending is explosive and...fun."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I love love love Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones' books - they were hilarious, smart and warm. When I heard she was coming out with a new book, I rushed to read it. I could have waited...say, forever.With none of the vivacious charm of Bridget Jones, Olivia Joules is a seriously sad act. Even without comparing it to Bridget, based totally on its own merits this book was just a painful read. An implausible plot which can at no time be mitigated by the explanation of an &quot;overactive imagination&quot;, Fielding's characters and her attempts to address current political issues come across as confused, strained and shallow. Perhaps better editing could have helped - I can accept a book full of impossibilities, but implausibilities make it impossible to get into the book at any point.Although glimmers of humour appear (VERY infrequently), the book is largely unfunny - so much for a fun summer read.Also, any sense of female empowerment is constantly undermined by Olivia's self-absorption and generally annoying personality. She engenders no feelings of respect - you're too busy being irritated by her and by dreams of what could have been...Unfortunately, this book has none of that quirky British sensibility which made Fielding's other books so enjoyable. And the worst part is, we know Fielding is capable of better. Truly, the most enjoyment I got from this novel was the huge sense of relief when I realized it was finally over.I don't recommend wasting any time reading this - save yourselves the disappointment and pain!"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"After reading 48 pages I decided this book wasn't worth my time.

It's hard to believe the author who wrote Bridget Jones wrote this.Thank goodness the bookstore let me return it."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Helen Fielding showed a knack for humor and fully-fleshed characters with the \\"Bridget Jones\\" books, then displayed these talents, a conscience and a gift for poignancy in \\"Cause Celeb\\"--before casting all that rubbish aside to write \\"Oliva Joules and the Overactive Imagination.\\"\\"Joules\\" begins precariously by expecting the reader to understand travel-writer Olivia's attraction to Pierre Feramo, a man she initially suspects to be one of the world's most infamous terrorists. (Yes, that one). Olivia's physical attraction to the man is difficult to get past from either an emotional--or aesthetic--level, and creates a reader/heroine disconnect immediately. Later, it's also declared that Feramo resembles a young Omar Sharif, though it's curiously late for that improvement (and creates the odd impression that the two men cited look alike to the author, which is odd).Although unrealistic from the get-go, the book does drag for several chapters. When the story begins to improve, it's marred by a short passage in which the island-hopping Olivia--seeing biracial locals--briefly \\"imagine[s] she was in a weird land where fathers would sleep with their nephews and great-aunts have secret affairs with donkeys.\\" I tried to excuse this ugly analogy by thinking that perhaps Joules' character was meant to seem provincial or uncultured--but she's supposed to be a worldly, multi-lingual travel writer, & a heroine. Distracting and hurtful, brief though it was.\\"Overactive Imagination\\" did keep me reading out of curiosity, but it is carelessly and implausibly written, with quickly sketched characters...a storyboard of a book, as though Fielding intended to sell the film rights immediately and didn't care about the quality of the writing so much as getting the plot down on paper. And the American dialogue could use some work--about the 10th time an American character calls Olivia \\"baby\\"--and both he and the author intend it to be sexy--it's just eye-rolling.It there was anything I did very much like about the book, it was the delightfully arch \\"Professor Widget\\" character (perhaps Fielding wrote him with Sir Ian McKellen in mind). Widget gets the best paragraph of the entire book when he comments on the nature of man and the seduction of self-image.Not an awful book, but not terrific either."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"So it's not Bridget Jones, and I know the critics panned it, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading about a funny, less-than-perfect, journalist turned secret agent, in this over-the-top farce. Whether she's poking fun at Hollywood or herself, the main character, Olivia Joules, is someone we all wouldn't mind being: Picture Meg Ryan playing a McGuyver-type character. If nothing else, Olivia's \\"List for Living\\" is something worth writing down and taping to your refrigerator, as it includes great tidbits like: No one is thinking about you. They're thinking about themselves, just like you. (Perfect for when you're stuck alone at a cocktail party.)"},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"Have you ever noticed that most people put corrupt dictators, nefarious scam artists and cheap crooks into their proper perspective as being little people whom you can poke fun at? Authors have no trouble taking that line in their books, and much great crime fiction is born that way.But move anywhere near terrorism, and most people become deadly serious and fearful. Credit Helen Fielding with helping us poke fun at ourselves and James Bond by writing Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination.As well all know, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean that someone is out to get you. This book builds on that theme. Journalist Olivia Joules has a vivid imagination, and sees evil-doers all around her. When she stumbles onto a group of terrorists it turns out that she isn't paranoid enough.Much like Ian Fleming would arm James Bond to overcome anything, Olivia is quickly turned into an omniscient and powerful person who can foil any plot by anyone. The spoof is good fun.Spoofs can fall down in several areas that hurt their entertainment value. They can go overboard and be too extreme. Unfortunately, Olivia Joules is guilty of that problem. Spoofs can also take the plot too lightly. Guilty again.But Olivia herself is an amusing and entertaining character. You'll like her and enjoy reading about her. That's what separates this book for wannabe spoofs by lesser authors.Ms. Fielding also has a good sense of humor, and the jokes are quite good. I found myself laughing aloud several times with full glee.This book could be described as good beach reading . . . except that no one in the northern hemisphere heads for the beach to read this time of the year. So if you live in the southern hemisphere, this book will be great for your summer reading."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"I picked up this book after having read (and loved) the Bridget Jones' books. This book is a light, fun easy read, yet it was too long. It seemed to take Helen Fielding a while to really get into the rhythm of writing a faster-paced book. The last quarter or so of the book is the best written, but I can see how some readers might give up on the story before getting there. If someone had never read a book by Helen Fielding, I would recommend the Bridget Jones books before recommending this one. It might make a fun movie. However, I hope Ms. Fielding doesn't write any more books based on this character. One was plenty."},{"Title":"Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination","review":"After being wowed by \\"Cause Celeb\\" and delighted by the two Bridget Jones books, I have to wonder what on earth happened with THIS book??!!The character Olivia Joules has a paper-thin development which leads a reader -- me, in particular -- to feel no particular sympathy for her. By the end of the book, Osama bin Laden could have eaten her leg roasted over a spit in an Afghanistan cave and I would have thought, \\"Oh, well.....that's a shame. *yawn!*\\"Every character was paper-thin, now that I think about it. This is an acute disappointment after \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", which I personally thought was a brilliant book (I bet Jane Austen would have thought so too!) \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" was equally well-thought out and very funny. When one gets used to characters who seem as if they could step off the pages and into your living room, it's a disappointment to deal with Olivia Joules.Not to mention the fact that the plot was just....dumb. By the time we got to Scott rescuing Olivia from the Middle Eastern Bad Guy at EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT before Olivia was killed, I wanted to throw the book across the room.This book was nothing more than a light, fluffy beach read. It had none of the charactertization, none of the plot, none of the zinging, stinging social commentary of Fielding's first three books.

Highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Putting Out of Your Mind","review":"It is mind blowing to me to see so many five star reviews. This book is, AT BEST, a good article in Golf Digest. Okay, here is the summary...1) Clear your head and don't think of anything other than putting; 2) Believe you are a good putter because if you believe in yourself you will be a good putter. That's it gang. Take those concepts and wrap some lame stories around some pro golfers who used that technique and you've got 150 pages of the lightest, breeziest, contentless book you've ever read.Oh, it was funny to read the part about Davis Love and how he practices.

It's a very good book!"},{"Title":"Putting Out of Your Mind","review":"&quot;Take your satisfaction not from whether the putt drops but from whether you got yourself in the right frame of mind to hit it.&quot; That quote summarizes the key point of this book.Think of Dr. Bob Rotella as someone who sees putting as being totally about controlling your mental processes, to eliminate the effect of your conscious mind. He is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Dave Pelz's engineering-based evaluations. I find much value in both approaches. Having taken lessons at Dave Pelz's Short Game School, one of the most useful parts was getting an automatic routine and rhythm for putting that clears my mind of tension-creating thoughts.The advice in the book is easy to understand, but you will probably find it hard to apply. I suggest that you find a pro to help you create a mind-clearing routine that you feel comfortable with. Then commit to using that routine always.Here are a few quotes that will give you a further sense of the book's advice:&quot;No matter how skilled you are . . . you're going to have to make roughly 40 percent of your shots with your putter.&quot;When you arrive at the green, you're going to think: &quot;Oh good! Now we get to putt!&quot;You will &quot;just focus on the target.&quot; You will have &quot;selective amnesia&quot; about putts you've missed in the past.You will spend 15 minutes a night &quot;visualizing making putts.&quot;Before putting, you will be &quot;always relaxed and confident.&quot;During the putt, you will &quot;putt as though the putt [is] conceded.&quot;When you putt, you will &quot;simply let the putt go and trust.&quot;I especially liked the metaphors from other sports like shooting baskets and making passes in football. Those actions are done in the flow of play, rather than in some rigid, controlled way with the conscious mind.The book has interesting sections on how to practice putting, and what top putters say about how they go about putting. Many of the pros quoted in the book use Dr. Rotella's methods, so they will help you to understand the message here. You will also find an exercise to encourage you to practice your chipping so you will have shorter putts to make.One of the most difficult aspects of any activity is explaining how champions think about the activity while they are doing it. I think that Dr. Rotella has done an outstanding job of sharing that information here.After you have finished enjoying and starting to apply this book to your putting, I suggest that you think about other places where you are trying to use your conscious mind when subconscious processes might work better. Imagine if you always tried to ride a bike by thinking about each thing that you do. That wouldn't be much fun or very successful, would it? Where do you find yourself tied up in tense knots now? That's where you need to let go.Trust yourself to accomplish more!"},{"Title":"Putting Out of Your Mind","review":"I subscribe to a bunch of golf magazines. I own and occasionally re-read many of the best-selling golf instructional books ever written, including Golf Is A Game of Confidence. Most are good for knocking 1-3 strokes off your game per round over the course of 6-9 months. But this tape, with its suggestions for a simpler pre-shot routine and mind-clearing suggestions has taken 3-5 strokes off my putting alone in just 2 months. I listened to it 10 times before even trying out the suggestions, just to make sure they were ingrained in my thinking. It has actually made putting fun for me, rather than an afterthought.

What I found interesting in this book are the insights that the author gives us as to how pros and ordinary players think, or should think when preparing to putt. He discusses the importance of the pre-shot routine . As 40% of the shots made in the course of a game are putts, it's simple logic that such a book should interest all golfers whatever the state of their game. If you wish elevate your game another notch, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Putting Out of Your Mind","review":"This book is a very enjoyable read and has many \\"Dr. Bob\\" insights that will help golfers of all levels. Unfortunately on the heels of his classic \\"Golf Is Not A Game Of Perfect\\" this exposition on putting is less fulfilling, but very good nonetheless. Ultimately the book recommends the following: 1) focus on the process of putting (developing a standard mental and physical pre-shot routine to clear your mind), not the mechanics or outcome of each putt; 2) don't worry about mechanics during practice or course putting, just focus on the target and aim to put each putt in the hole; and 3) the more relaxed and positive you are about your putting and the experience of putting the better the results will be. The messages in the book are simple. While they seem redundant at times the lessons are valuable and the book is an enjoyable and beneficial 4-5 hour read. As the author points out, 40% of strokes are putts so it's worth putting time into improving this part of your game."},{"Title":"Putting Out of Your Mind","review":"My golf game has been transformed by this CD.

Rotella guides you right off that path you've been walking that's called the mental approach to putting.

England is beset with rumor of the supernatural--vampires, werewolves, and demons. Darwin approaches everything with an open-minded skepticism. Together with his treasure-anxious sidekick, Colonel Jacob Pole, Darwin delves deep into the mysteries that confront 18th century England finding, among other things, the Loch Ness Monster, Bonnie Prince Charlie, and a forgotten race of humans.Author Charles Sheffield has created a charming set of stories of a past not too different from our own. Darwin contains the best of Sherlock Holmes as well as the gluttony of Nero Wolfe. I suspect that Sheffield meant his novel to be a reminder to us, in the 21st Century, to always remember to look to rational and scientific causes before we ascribe whatever we see to the supernatural or unexplainable. It is easy to see why Sheffield, a scientist, would choose Erasmus Darwin as his hero.THE AMAZING DR. DARWIN is both powerful and amusing. Darwin is fallible enough to be sympathetic, and Pole is sympathetic without being completely brainless."},{"Title":"The Amazing Dr. Darwin","review":"The hero of this book is Erasmus Darwin, the real-world grandfather of Charles Darwin. He apparently was quite a spectacular observer and thinker, quite in the Sherlock Holmes mode. Indeed, a couple of the stories remind me greatly of Sherlock Holmes, one in particular of Hound of the Baskervilles. There are several novellas in this book, each of which stands alone. As another reviewer mentioned, this is an expanded version of the earlier Erasmus Magister, but it does have new stories that make it quite a buy, especially at this price!Very readable and enjoyable.

It moves from close up observation: the garden, the quilt on the bed, the window and things in the room, to abstracts and distant perceptions: wind, rain, the swing, one's shadow, and lands over the seas.There is a reason children who are read to develop keen minds, literacy skills, and good relationships with parents, and this is one of the best early childhood reading resources. The Wordsworth edition with fanciful illustrations by Charles Robinson gives the child an extra imaginative leap through time and space.

There are some stunningly illustrated collections of his poetry out now, notably two by Thomas Kincaide, among others. But how many of us have actually read all or most of his work? I'm guilty as charged.This smaller, quieter version of Stevenson's poetry helped me finally, actually read all the Garden poetry. True, the illustrations are spare, but delightfully accurate. My children (7 and 10) were not as mesmerized by this book as they are by others with fanciful graphics, illustrations and larger type to accompany the poetry.Still, this small book found its way into my purse to be used for waiting moments, e.g. at the orthodontist, doctor, and also to my bedside, where it's shear diminutive size did not dissuade me from reading &quot;for only a minute or two.&quot; And within Stevenson's words and language lie the ferment of creative pictures. I liked to have my children close their eyes while I read short poems to 'force' them to use only their mind's eye.I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures, moods, and images Stevenson conjures and at long last can understand why his poetry remains so classic."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"This review is of the Chronicle Books edition (ISBN 0877016089).First published in 1885, Stevenson's marvellous collection of children's poetry has never gone out of print, and remains near the top of numerous \\"best book's for childen\\" lists. For example, Maurice Sendak, when asked to list books that he thought every child should have the opportunity to read, named this collection first. Harold Bloom, renowned literary critic (he has received more major awards from his peers than any other) and author of the thought-provoking and controversial \\"The Western Canon\\", included ACGoV in the list he furnished in response to an interviewer's request for a \\"Western Canon, Jr\\". Among the homeschooling set, everyone from \\"Unschoolers\\" to \\"Classical Christian Educators\\" recommend it.(It\\"s on the Classical Christian Support Loop's \\"1000 Good Books List\\").The Chronical Books edition, containing all 64 of the poems that appeared in the original 1885 edition, is lavishly illustrated with more than a hundred pictures, many of them full page, by several of the most distinguished children's book illustrators of the late 19th and early 20th century. The book is well laid out, with a pleasing juxtaposition of art and text, and printed on high-quality paper. It was named one of the \\"Top Ten Picturebooks of the Year\\" by Redbook, was an American Bookseller \\"Pick of the Lists\\" in 1989, and was given a starred review in Booklist.Stevenson perfectly captures the child's world of sunshine, stars, dreams, toy boats, swings, apple tarts, fairies, flowers, and far-away places in simple, evocative language which remains just as accessable for today's children as it was for their grandparents. And I can think of only one poem that might offend modern \\"Politically Correct\\" sensibilities: \\"Foreign Children\\", wherein the speaker imagines asking various nationalities' children \\"O! don't you wish that you were me!\\" I guess the historical and socio-cultural context of this poem could be discussed with your child if you were so inclined.In short, this venerated work, and especially this glorious Chronical Books edition of it, belongs in every child's library. No other volume of children's poetry has been so well loved by so many generations. ..."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"Poems are perfectly chosen words which are a pleasure to read. Writing them is a true art and Robert Louis Stevenson is able to perfect this art by remembering his own childhood. These poems were written between 1881 and 1884.This is a selection from the most popular collection of poems about childhood in the English language. Each poem is accompanied by evocative paintings, which are as vibrant as the words in each poem.The paintings are impressions of color and light and show children and a few animals on beautiful canvases of cities, gardens, meadows and seas. The poems are about flying kites, cows which give cream to enjoy with apple-tart, flowers where fairies live, children sitting in the warm sun, children on a swing, children playing with toy boats and children playing in gardens who will never grow up as they are frozen in time in the beautiful pictures. Here is an example of part of the first poem in the book.THE WINDI saw you toss the kites on highAnd blow the birds about the sky;And all around I heard you pass,Like ladies skirts across the grass-What lovely poems to share with a child. Highly recommended!~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"Most everyone knows that Robert Louis Stevenson was sickly, both as a child and as an adult, and the happy result for the reading public was his nearly feverish flights of imagination. Here, in an edition of his classic \\"A Child's Garden of Verses,\\" that fever is complemented in spades by the fantastical illustrations of English artist Joanna Isles.Isles uses an arsenal of utterly frivolous flowers, borders, insects, birds, kings and queens, fairies, and more to expand upon the imagination exhibited in Stevenson's poems. The children in these pictures are depicted as being in charge, being at one with their environment, and being delighted to be alive.Some of the illustrations hint at the influence of artists more famed than Isles (Henri Rousseau appears to be a special favorite of hers--see the illustration for \\"The Unseen Playmate,\\" in which a boy lies down in weeds that might have sprung from the edge of Rousseau's painting \\"The Dream\\"). Using both primary colors and pastels, Isles creates a world within the world of Stevenson's verse. The marriage of the two is a happy one."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"First published early in the 20th century, this version of a Child's Garden Of Verses comes alive with Jessie Wilcox Smith's gorgeous illustrations.

Needless to say, this work by Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the granddaddys of all poetry books for young (and not so young) children. If you do not have a copy in your child's library, you really should have. This particular edition is illustrated by Eric Kincaid and of the several various versions published that I own or have read, this is one of my favorite. I simply like the art work. Mr. Kincaid has used soft colors and presented his illustrations in a true Victorian style, something I like.

They're taken from numerous editions over the years, and they cover a variety of styles and time periods.

Their interest in the book revolves around the illustrations--why do the boys look like girls, why are they wearing sailor suits, and where are the pirates?At any rate, even if your child does not enjoy the poetry, it is a good opportunity for kids to learn about what life was like for children a long time ago--what they wore, the games they played, and how they lived."},{"Title":"A Child's Garden of Verses","review":"Stevenson originally published these poems in 1885.

However the literature of clays is much less common. Therefore all books on this area are welcomed. Especially a book with a broad theme of clay seals of oil and gas deposit is really needed by engineers and geologists.However this books fails to be a broad book for a reader interested in clay seals in general, but provides a good insight of the work conducted in Russia.The references in the book lack a main part of the important references in this area despite the close to 300 references in the book. The nomenclature which are used are differ with common practise. Some of the figures have Russian text. The micrographs has not been labeled to common practice is it a backscatter SEM picture, ordinary SEM etc.The last part of the book \\"modeling of the change in the clay seals properties in lithogenesis\\" is really not a book but a scientific paper of a method developed by the authors.If you look for a general book about clay seals of oil and gas deposits you should probably look elsewhere. However it gives access to important research which are difficult to access when originally written in Russian."},{"Title":"Principia Ethica","review":"Principia Ethica is a significant philosophical work of G.E. Moore because G.E. Moore has presented an new approach of ethics, from both the descriptive and meta-ethical approach that tries to define what we mean by the \\"good\\". G.E. Moore's contention is that the term \\"Good\\" cannot be defined because it refers to simple constituent property rather than a complex relation of predicative properties. The term \\"Good\\" then is similar to the color \\"yellow\\" since yellow does refers to a simple perceptual experience; to say that yellow refers to complex wave-lengths of light is to commit a naturalistic fallacy since yellow simply refers to our simple experience. Likewise to say that the \\"good\\" involves pleasure, duty, and other complex concepts is to commit a naturalistic fallacy.G.E. Moore's criticism against naturalistic hedonism, metaphysical ethics, social darwinism, utilitarianism, etc are all applications of his contention that the \\"good\\" is a simple concept. These criticisms tend to be very analytical, not only in terms of the concepts but by presenting them in terms of premises and analyzing the way they used words. This approach may not be new, but it is emphasized by G.E. Moore in its application to Ethics. Bertrand Russell, Whitehead, and Wittgenstein have already innovated this approach on logic, but G.E. Moore applied it on Ethics (or Meta-Ethics) and I think this is what made his approach significant in the history of contemporary philosophy.While I did enjoyed the book, I find it overly methodological. His own stance on ethics is interesting in the sense that he tried to fuse deontology with utilitarianism, but this form of morality is very much like a situational ethics. It appears that my duty is simply based on the possible consequences that occurs from this situation, and G.E. Moore admits that we cannot always know the consequences in every circumstances. What he proposed is that there are general situations in which we can know the likelihood of the consequences, but things are not as clear cut in that way. I don't recall this for sure, but the impression that I get is that he hasn't really defined what this general circumstances are. His approach to ethics is very analytically, which if fine, but I always felt that this approach lacked the substance of ethical concern.Perhaps I need to re-read the book again to re-evaluate my opinions on G.E. Moore's Principia Ethica, and I admit that I have not always thoroughly read this. I will, however, say that any philosophy student of ethics should read this since this is the very book that shaped how we talk about ethics today. It maybe very dull and boring (I must admit, there are some very dull parts), but it is nonetheless the kind of book that will introduce you to descriptive meta-ethics."},{"Title":"Facts for Visitors: Poems (New California Poetry)","review":"Reddy's debut collection is a necessary Baedeker for 21st-century poetics and its new salon of key writers, from Chicago to Paris, who are finding ways to weave together elements of traditional and linguistically innovative poetry. The poems turn on a dime - one minute sharp and snappy, the next languid and exotic.We are led by Reddy's words into worlds enough, and time, that, from Esperanto to weird scenes onboard a boat sailing to a pseudo-darkness, query what it means to travel, or inhabit. The foreign trades places with the familiar, and a witty exploration uncovers lost cities of eloquence.Reddy is, to my mind, one of the most exhilirating younger American poets now writing - and his spare yet delightful use of line is only one of his many gifts. Another is his unexpected way with theme; yet another, his propulsion of dead language and texts back to life. This much is fact: this book should not be forgotten on the voyage."},{"Title":"Facts for Visitors: Poems (New California Poetry)","review":"I met Chicu Reddy, briefly, at a poetry reading in Boston whereat he autographed my copy of this book. His poetry is great stuff. Reddy injects new life into all the poetic forms he uses, which range from the prose poem to the villanelle. He is truly a versatile guy. No matter what form is he using at the time, Reddy makes poetry seem so easy and fluidly flowing and *fun* that reading this book will make you want to sit down and write prose poems and villanelles of your own. This is limpid, beautiful, visionary verse, full of dreamlike free associations and joyous wordplay, written in an authoritative yet conversational and all-too-human voice. Reddy's vision of life in the Information Age is a fundamentally optimistic one, and his poetry will leave you feeling that poetry is far from dead, and life is full of possibilities."},{"Title":"Facts for Visitors: Poems (New California Poetry)","review":"in is first volume of poetry, facts fa visitors, srikanf reddy accomplishes a goal dat is usually only achieved by much olda writers angin at da peak of their powers: he evokes a world dat seems maximum and coherent in its scope-a world dat is at once da world we recognize and one dat, coz fully and for real inhabited by is imagination, is also completely da autha's own. we recognize da details, but cukabillyva them within startlin landscapes and voicings dat shake us from da banalities encrusted around everyday perceptions. da book's cosmopotilan vistas vacillate betweun global perspectives. reddy's gravitational ouse is southern india, but da poet's collectin check circles out to europe and furtha west, involvin a ost of references from \\"a bone priest / pickin is way through crop ruks / toward da wreckage of an iron temple,\\" to \\"soviet-bloc comics,\\" to a speaka who in complete sincerity regrets neva avin \\"rested on a sunday / wiv a bea on da deck ... / listenin to styx.\\" balancin da quotidian wiv da mystical without recourse to irony is no easy feat, and dat is only one of da delights awaitin readers of dis thrillin debut. these poems leave da impression dat reddy is a kind of collecta of da world's abstract detritus and ephemera, similar to an artist dig joseph cornell siftin through da thrift stores of main bitchs. reddy, dig cornell, is an archivist of da abstract as well as da tangible. he is as much an encyclodepist as a collagist, definin, oftun wiv frightenin detachment, an emotional palette dat ranges from epiphany to disembomident, tenderness to tragic despair. is writin precise, almost \`miniarutist,' in its reverence fa detail;

It is put into good Contemporary English, without dumbing it down. The language is inclusive without being &quot;politically correct&quot;. For instance, in many cases, Greek used male nouns like &quot;brother&quot; in a generic sense, that is, sibling. This Bible translates those situations accordingly, as &quot;brother or sister&quot;, but it doesn't use any unnecessary terms like &quot;Our father-mother in heaven&quot; (I've actually seen translations like that!). The translation itself is based on new findings of older documents.

Are you looking for the Scriptural basis behind Catholic teaching and doctrine concerning Mary? Then this is the book for you.Fr. Stefano Manelli presents a thorough explanation of Marian doctrine in light of Old and New Testament. He addresses the common misconceptions about Marian devotion and defines those terms that are largely misunderstood, such as Mediatrix and Immaculate.Translated from the Italian the book is a must for anyone studying Biblical Mariology."},{"Title":"All Generations Shall call me Blessed: Biblical Mariology (Studies and Texts - No. 3)","review":"Manelli's work 'All Generations Will Call Me Blessed: Biblical Mariology' is a wonderful resource for Catholics. In every way, I recommend it even over Scott Hahn's book, 'Hail Holy Queen'. Manelli provides a careful overview of every significant passage of scripture concerning the Virgin Mary. Often apologetically useful, it supplies Catholics with ammunition in defense of their faith against Protestant arguments. However, despite its overall achievements, this work falls short of a perfect rating because it sometimes omits relevant material, is lacking in originality, and, by citing other authors too frequently, is not as readable as it could have been.The work itself is the translation of an Italian original, 'Mariologia Biblica', published in 1989. With almost 400 pages of material, this work is a commentary on every major Marian passage in the Bible. Methodologically, this book uniquely blends historical-critical exegesis with reverential exposition. Consistently upholding traditional and authentically Catholic positions, Manelli nevertheless draws upon some of the best insights offered by Catholic biblical scholars.Part I treats the Old Testament and covers the protoevangelium of Genesis 3, the Virgin Mother in Isaiah 7, and other passages. Manelli defends the Marian reading of Isaiah 7 and Genesis 3, and he does so admirably. Mary's place in the liturgy is also discussed in Part I.Part II is devoted to the New Testament. The infancy narratives are discussed in detail. The commentary on St. Luke's portrayal of Mary is especially valuable. Each text is handled reverentially, by which I mean that it is interpreted in a way which conforms to Church doctrine and gives proper honor to the subjects discussed. Manelli for example refers to the Blessed Virgin in a very dignified manner, often calling her 'Mary most holy,' or employing similar titles. By contrast, other books on the Virgin Mary are sometimes lacking in due reverence (e.g., Scott Hahn's work 'Hail Holy Queen', a work with similar aims). The result is a treasury of exegetical material about the Virgin Mary. Consequently, this book is a rich source of material for one's mental prayer. It exhibits a rare combination of scripture scholarship and devotional flare.However, the book is not without its flaws. First of all, it is lacking in originality. The author almost never goes beyond presenting the views of other scholars. Thus, for example, this book is really a synthesis of the teachings of other mariologists, especially Laurentin, Roschini, and de la Potterie. This in itself is not condemning, but the way in which Manelli incorporates the material of other authors is not always integrative. That is, rather than summarizing their conclusions in his own words, he simply quotes them at length. The result is a book lacking a consistent literary style. And that makes it difficult to read.Moreover, there is a surprising omission in this book. Manelli consistently comments on every text which historically has caused trouble for Catholic exegetes. Nevertheless he inexplicably fails to discuss the phrase \\"opens the womb\\" in Luke 2.23, a text which Protestants argue is not compatible with Mary's perpetual virginity. Such an oversight, in a book of this nature, cannot be overlooked.Despite these minor flaws, Manelli's book remains one of the best available on biblical mariology. For those readers who can handle reading almost 400 pages of biblical commentary, I recommend it over many more popular works. In conclusion, one might bring out the strengths of this book by comparing it with two books with similar aims. As I have indicated, in comparison with Hahn's 'Hail Holy Queen', Manelli's book is more reverent and more academically rigorous. In comparison with McHugh's 'The Mother of Jesus in the New Testament', Manelli is less original and not as easy to read, but his positions more naturally conform to traditional Catholic exegesis.I heartily recommend this book for all Catholics."},{"Title":"All Generations Shall call me Blessed: Biblical Mariology (Studies and Texts - No. 3)","review":"This book is to the Roman Catholic Church's Marian doctrines what &quot;Jesus, Peter, and the Keys&quot; is to the Papacy - a complete, intelligent, and relatively readable study of the doctrines based on the Holy Scriptures.

He uses the cultural contexts of the United States and Great Britain and mostly from white citizens of those countries to express a decidedly culturally distinct method of grief. By writing in two major book sections, he attempts to demonstrate that the culture of grief centers on an individual's need to integrate the dead while societies need centers on the need to regulate the grieving process. Walter demonstrates these themes through the use of qualitative transcriptions from earlier research. While some may think this a cheap trick appealing only to sentiment and sensitivity, from a literary point of view it is exemplar of the issues to be discussed.Walter divides many of the current concepts into a dichotomous position that exist for the bereaved. In the first half of the book, he concerns himself with concept of integration of the dead from the bereaved person's point of view. In this section he aptly demonstrates the often-contradictory positions of the bereft person's need to leave the dead behind while still maintaining or even continuing to develop a relationship with the deceased. The author makes a distinction between these two issues by illustrating how as an individual we often have the need to maintain the relationship with the dead through story telling especially to others, remembering or recalling an iconic representation of the deceased, and even talking with the dead. Conversely, society tends to need to leave the individual behind yet immortalizes groups as with the death of large numbers of persons through tragedy. Walter shows how the individual can sometimes be seen as pathologic for their desire to maintain this relationship. At the same time, society encourages a continuing relationship with wartime losses if only out of a need to maintain some sense of history and to create the ongoing lineage of ancestors.Another position expressed as opposites comes from the societal need to regulate grief especially as it relates to outward or public expressions of that grief. Society often allows for the initial shock response or tears and depression but often encourages the individual to get on with their lives. This often comes in the form of group distraction or encouragement to the widow/widower to remarry or begin to see others again. A contradictory point can be seen here in that there tends to be societal endorsement of the individual to work through his or her grief in approved and sanctioned manners such as grief counseling or support groups. Polar opposites tend to be replete within the culture of grief as the individual expresses private concern and society expresses a desire to regulate the bereavement process.Walter creates a context for many of the concepts found in the book. For instance, he traces the transition of society's expectations that in a different time, a person was required to wear appropriate clothing to demonstrate appropriate grieving. In more contemporary times, the major focus or concern has moved on to the deceased and the appropriate ritual for burial and even casket selection to demonstrate adequate mourning. This movement from focus on the individual to focus on the body/deceased is shown with intriguing and often quirky snippets of personal correspondence, obituaries, and tomb stone sentiments. This not only makes for interesting reading, but illustrates the point in a manner that could not be grasped otherwise without such illustrations.No examination of death, dying, and loss would be complete without discussion of the importance of religion in the cultural context of bereavement. Walter traces the historical and often the limit of time-bound aspects of Catholicism, Judaism, and Protestantism as the predominate Judeo-Christian influence upon this most private and yet public event. The author posits that the temporal nature of the state of the religion had a direct influence upon how both individuals grieved as well as how society sought to regulate its members' activities related to bereavement. As contrary or contrasting cases, Walter includes some discussion about such disparate religious cultures as the Hopi Indians and Puritanism on the culture of grief. Additional historically contextual examples or illustrations throughout the reading include the use of Diana Princess of Wales and President John F. Kennedy as case studies for how both individuals and society respond to death of famous figures.One last significant point is that of gender issues or differences in how grief and bereavement take place. This gender orientation can be seen to prescribe for individuals and society as to what expectations are inherent with any particular chromosomal assignment. Walter also discusses the historical change in how men and women were both once allowed and encouraged in openly grieving and even shedding tears. It was through the emergence of the macho or Marlboro Man influences of among others, the post World War II influences that changed the societal expectation of men and women as it relates to grief behavior. Many local cultures continue to expect that women will perform the grieving for men as it has become unallowable for men to openly express their feelings about the dead.Bereavement care and theories about bereavement round out the discussion. Walter does not try to proscribe any particular theory or method for bereavement. Instead, he attempts to illustrate the current thoughts about what society and the individual feel are appropriate systematic ways to deal with bereavement and grief. A good discussion is given related to how bereavement care has developed over the years and even changed in its foci as the needs of the individual and the society have changed.Clearly, this text has added something to the body of knowledge about death, dying and bereavement. The text attempts to be as all-inclusive as possible related to the subjects chosen for discussion. Historical, temporal, religious, societal, and cultural aspects are used to shade and color the major themes being discussed. Walter provides us with a thoughtful approach to the study of bereavement and grief in the white Anglo-Saxon communities."},{"Title":"New England Rooms 1639-1863","review":"Samuel Chamberlain was one of America's preeminent photographers during the early and mid 20th Century.

Sure it has all the richness of George Eliot novels, but the story seems a bit contrived and the ending isn't very satisfactory."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"Adam Bede is my second favourite book by George Elliot. This is a wonderful story about a young dairymaid who is seduced by a country squire - an old story it's true, but George Eliot handles this in her own unique way. No one can create a sense of scene and paint imagery with words like she can. The story is sad in its honesty, but it does not leave one with the feeling of partaking of a tragedy. Perhaps it is the sense of hopefulness that brims through the pages. This novel is one of George Eliot's earlier works, and her character development and writing skills do get better with later works, but her wonderful skill is still very apparent in this book. The women characters in this book seem to be the stronger, but Adam Bede himself is a wonder. Ms. Eliot was a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"\\"Adam Bede\\" is a story about love, self-deception, religious feeling, innocence, and experience. It would not be an unfit introduction to Eliot, though \\"Middlemarch\\" is by far her superior novel.I am awed by Eliot's psychological insight into human personality. Her characters are some of the most vivid in all of literary history, and her ability to penetrate to the very heart of human motivation is unrivaled. She presents her story with wit and subtle sarcasm. (Take, for instance, this tongue-in-cheek comment, which will explain Adam's devotion to Hetty: \\"Of course, I know that, as a rule, sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their acquaintance, see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty, never imagine themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on all proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in every respect. . . . But even to this rule an exception will occur now and then in the lapse of centuries, and my friend Adam was one.\\")Eliot's command of English is deeply impressive, and this book is worth reading just for the beauty of the language. But the story is quite interesting as well, and you will come to care about and sympathize with the characters. It is not a fast paced book, and it will require an investment of time and intellect. But it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"When George Eliot published her first novel ADAM BEDE in 1859, unknown to her reading public, she had just ushered in a new era of the English novel. Beginning with this novel, Eliot infused her novels with an overwhelming sense of determinism, a then popular philosophy that suggested that man's voyage through life, that when set by nature, society, or even by himself, was etched in stone. If literary characters were to pursue a course of action that was taken willingly, then that character had to live with the consequences, however unpleasant. The primary characters of the book, Adam himself, Arthur Donnithorne, and Hetty Sorrel, are seen as limited in their ability to avoid the ramifications of their actions.Adam Bede is portrayed as the quintessential man of good. Indeed one of the problems that modern readers have with him is that in his goodness, he is essentially a flat character, whose goodness towards others and anger towards Donnithorne, all stem from that same well of virtue. Adam falls in love with the flighty and flirty Hetty Sorrel, and is prepared to marry her, until he catches her passionately embracing his childhood friend, the aristocratic Donnithorne. The two men fight, the consequences of which set in motion a sequence of events that do not allow for mitigation of circumstance. In Hetty Sorrel, Eliot has created a woman whom she seems to judge overly harshly. Hetty truly is a flirt, and a passionate one at that, but to subject her to a non-stop series of painful retributions merely because of Hetty's willingness to sleep with the object of her youthful dreams, Donnithorne, suggests that Eliot began the book with a deck stacked partially against Adam but totally against her. And then there is Donnithorne, one who is supposed to be the villain, yet he is far less the villain as Eliot tries mightily to portray him just as Adam is far less the understanding hero as Eliot tries just as mightily to depict him. As Adam and Donnithorne battle each other for possession of the fickle Hetty, the lovely preacher Dinah Morris has been patiently waiting for Adam to come to his senses and forget his infatuation with Hetty and recognize the virtuous treasure that Eliot wants the reader to see.Readers today show a marked lack of patience with Eliot's frequent narrative intrusions. Editors call such intrusions the use of omniscient narrator, a style of writing popular in Eliot's day but pass&eacute; today. Yet, there are many readers who enjoy the panoramic vistas and linguistic idiosyncrasies that Eliot draws of a countryside that even in her day was fixed in the roots of an earlier 18th century cultural milieu. For those who do not mind Eliot's sometimes all too frequent helpful and sometimes unwanted comments, ADAM BEDE can be a welcome read in that it is a living reminder of how people may not escape the consequences of their actions, no matter how hard they try."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"Like other reviewers, I have read other Eliot books and enjoyed them. In ADAM BEDE, there are a lot of wonderful glimpses into country life, and several memorable characters, especially some of the \\"B list\\" folks such as Mrs. Poyser and Bartle Massey. And as someone pointed out, for a student of religious history it gives a good inside view on the conflict between the Established church and the growing evangelical movement of the Wesleys. But I think the book has two huge flaws. First, am I the only person who found Hetty's pregnancy to be a complete blindsiding plot device with virtually no preparation? Can we believe that a girl who lives with farm workers could conceal a pregnancy that must have been advanced enough for her to deliver an infant viable enough to remain alive for many hours after birth? Sure, Eliot comments a few times about her \\"roundness,\\" but in Victorian lit that could easily be a comment on other portions of her anatomy. There is nothing in her relationship to Arthur that suggests further intimacy than kisses in the woods. I felt betrayed when the pregnancy/infanticide became the main hinge of the plot, since it was so poorly set up. And once Hetty's trial is over, the rest of the book just dribbles out to the conclusion. Eliot didn't seem to realize that once she tied that plot up, her book should have ended quickly. So, three stars for wonderful scenery, dialog, and character...but points off for plot!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"My high school English teacher, a nun, assigned this book in my junior year. I think I considered it a great accomplishment to make it through the entire book and the fact that I actually enjoyed the experience was a bonus. At seventeen, I didn't have the experience in life to really appreciate this book fully. So at 65, I decided to re-read it. First, I was amazed that I actually read this without complaining at seventeen because it can be very tedious reading at times. I have been spoiled over the years with the short concise sentences which are the order of the day in the 21st century. If one considers the long sentences, the difficult dialect, and the complicated thoughts, Eliot often rivals our modern-day government with her over-blown verbiage. I would come to the end of a sentence and want to say, \\"Come again?\\"However, Adam Bede is an unusual and beautiful story with well-drawn characters and a realistic picture of 19th-century rural English life. To give you an idea of the personalities of the two main female characters, I'll take you to the more well-known story Gone With the Wind. Who can forget vain Scarlett and saintly Melanie? Well, Eliot's Hetty would be compatible with Scarlett and Eliot's Dinah would make an excellent friend for Melanie.I loved Eliot's admiration for the simple folks--the hardworking country folks. I liked the way she philosophized about art and how the homely pictures with the simple household objects and the homely wrinkled people shouldn't be scorned.This story is very heavy on characterization and description for more than half of the book and then during the second half we learn about the true reason for the book--the events which lead to tragedies and change the lives of some of the characters irrevocably. Then your heart will start to beat faster and you won't be able to put the book down. But actually even before then I started looking forward to getting back to the book each evening, and I think it was because I was falling in love with some of the characters. Eliot is superb at drawing her characters and breathing life into them.I was satisfied with the conclusion and very moved with many of the scenes. Some of the characters simply shine with the goodness, love, and forgiveness they display. They could put us all to shame! And then again some of the characters are very human and their complaining natures are always very evident. There is a good mix here. You won't conclude that all of these people are just too good but you won't be overwhelmed by evil because even when evil rears its ugly head, Eliot shows us in her compassionate way that evil is sometimes the result of a human being in desperate circumstances. Great story!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"Having read George Eliot's great work 25 years ago and forgotten why I'd liked it so much, I recently re-read ADAM BEDE and liked it just as much again. Perhaps it is an unsung masterpiece, because I have never heard much tell of it. Nevertheless, it's a book that sums up a lot of what is great about literature in general, and about 19th century English literature in particular. Eliot evokes the English countryside in all its varied moods throughout the seasons. She presents rural life as if her book were an anthropological case study (only much better written than most). Her saga of a desperate voyage throughout England by an increasingly-penniless girl brings the feel of the country in the early 19th century very close. The slowly-unfolding story will engross any reader who has a feel for the slower paced books of that time. Dinah Morris as itinerant Methodist preacher was an unusual character then and perhaps now too. Bound up in her puritanical cause---to bring the word of God to the masses of \`sinners'---she cannot envision married life, certainly not with Seth Bede, who is deeply in love with her. Adam Bede, a tall, intelligent carpenter with something of a temper, loves the shallow, self-absorbed Hetty Sorrel, a maid in the home of her uncle and aunt, the Poysers, tenants in good standing on the local estate. Both Adam and Seth have to deal with their recently-bereaved mother, a complainer, who nevertheless loves her boys. Adam sets great store by two friendships--with Rev. Irwine, the local Anglican minister, and with Arthur Donnithorne, the son of the landowner. He also has a great admirer in the shape of Bartle Massey, a teacher of local adults who finds Adam to be the great success of his life. Arthur, Adam's friend, conducts a casual affair with Hetty, who dreams of a life of riches and ease, but things turn out differently. Things go very bad, but end more felicitously than might be expected. All these characters are very well-developed and a pleasure to follow. Arthur, though he seduces Hetty, is a complex character in fact, with many good points to offset his callous treatment of the not-so-innocent Hetty. Eliot handles the varied shades of each character very well.Sex is only hinted at, little violence, more than a bit of religion and moral guidance to readers thrown in. Some people may find the use of 19th century rural English dialects rather hard to follow. You can get used to it. The beauty of the prose and the sincerity of the story carry everything before them. If you love literature, you must read this novel."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans, 1819-1880) has gained the reputation as being one of the finest writers of 19th century England. She is considered to be an equal of Jane Austen or the Bronte sisters, or any other writer of her era. Middlemarch is her masterpiece. The present novel was her first major work.Many of her works have rural settings, involve moral values, and feature realistic plots and characters. Eliot was an agnostic but tied to Christian moral values which are an integral part of her stories. Her characters and plots are easier to believe than Dickens, who for example, introduced highly improbable reunions and lost relatives to get closure for his plot in Oliver Twist. And, the characters of George Eliot are more human and realistic than those found in the novels of Jane Austen or those in Charlotte Bronte's highly entertaining Jane Eyre. Also, she has much detail in her minor characters. Unlike Austen, the prose and the relations among characters are straightforward, and one does not have to make a family tree to understand all the characters, nor is there a learning period of 25 to 50 pages needed to understand the prose - as in Austen's Mansfield Park.While her masterpiece is acknowledged to be Middlemarch, many consider her first novel Adam Bede to be an entertaining read. It features Eliot's style and techniques. As described in the introduction, Eliot is the \\"omniscient narrator...controlling reaction and interpretation with her own illuminating intelligence.\\"The story is a love triangle between two men and a teenage woman, the young, beautiful, naive, and self absorbed Hetty Sorrel. She is very young, approximately 17, obsessed with her beauty, and works at a farm which produces cheese. Adam Bede is one of the men interested in Hetty. He is a carpenter in his twenties. Arthur Donnithorne, the rich young squire and friend of Adam, is the other man interested in Hetty. There is a second female protagonist, Dinah Morris, who is also relatively young and who is a Methodist preacher.Without giving away the plot, the heart of the story is the self delusion or self-deception of Hetty and the other primary characters. They are living in a rural farming community somewhere in north central England. Will Hetty accept the carpenter Adam Bede or do something crazy and run off or have an affair with Arthur? That is the main element of the plot.The story is not exactly a page turner but it is good. In any case, it is an excellent read.Recommend: 5 stars."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"This book is a good read although it can be slow at times. Adam Bede is, of course, the title character. But it is Hetty Sorrel that Eliot uses to raise questions about a very judgmental society. Hetty's &quot;fall&quot; asks the question of who is to blame. Throughout the novel she is never given much guidance, although she is expected to act in the proper manner. In fact, Eliot may not have even known how to deal with society's reaction to Hetty, therefore, making a dull ending that does not make much sense. Eliot seems afraid to address the issues of Hetty being integrated back into society and the consequences of her actions. In failing to end the book with Hetty coming back home, Eliot fails to make her point. That being, the influence of a society in the actions of their people. Who is to blame? Eliot herself, in the weak ending, backs down to the very own society she is questioning. Hetty is not allowed to return, therefore, the society is never forced to deal with the issue. In the end, Eliot raises many questions regarding the structure of society. However, she does not follow through and falls short in the ending. All in all, I would highly recommend this read. If you can get through the slow spots, you will raise many of your own questions about who is responsible when someone falls short in our own society?

Moreimportantly, however, the book has a strong moral; it is sureto leave an impression in the mind of even the most cynicalreader.

Why they have never done this one is a puzzle. Eliot's description of English pastoral life in 1799 leaves no stone unturned. The characters are as sharply drawn as if you had met them a few moments ago. You can literally smell the fresh country air. Yes, the character of Dinah is overdone, reminding one of Dicken's saccharine women, but a small price to pay in so rewarding a book. You will be truly sorry when you finish to leave the world Eliot has drawn so well. The morals of these people are no longer ours, and that must be kept in mind always. But Eliot has stated that the idea for this book came from a story of her aunt's, who did indeed go to such a woman as Hetty in prison.

While the plot is hardly complex (boy loves girl, another boy gets girl, unhappiness abounds - also reused in Mill on the Floss), the manner in which Eliot develops her characters and their emotions and actions ring as true and resoundingly as a bell. It's so clear, so obvious, but also moving and textured. You feel Adam's absolute love for vain little Hetty, Dinah's calming grace, Arthur's good intentions, Lisbeth's fretting nature. Eliot draws you in with her honest observations of life in a country town, without the background becoming a dominant factor. The near idyllic life the characters lead is a healthy contrast to the town's emotional upheaval.Adam is an upright, genuine character, and not as perfect as he seems. If his love for Hetty seems unfounded at times, it only serves to highlight how dangerous delusions can be. All the \\"sinners\\" are ultimately redeemed by truth - true love, true friends, true promises, and true acceptance. Religion plays a significant part in the novel, but don't let that deter you. It's so much more than that - Adam Bede is truly one of the few works that encompass a world of humanity between two covers.AB reminded me of Tess of the D'Ubervilles a bit, but there is no villain here, just flawed, honest people in search of unattainable dreams. In the process of trying to get a bit of happiness, they stumble and bleed, but ultimately find something truly worth having. Bittersweetness is Eliot's trademark for good reason.George Eliot's first full novel is obviously a bit less polished than her later works, but you see the wonderful command she has over language and expression. The book, the people, the story all come alive with her touch.

A great summer read."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"\\"Adam Bede\\" is a bucolic novel, and in its attempt to capture daily life in a small, rustic town in England (circa 1800) it succeeds remarkably well. Unfortunately, its this leisurely portrait of the town and its denizens that made reading the first 300-plus pages something of a chore. My two greatest problems with the story were its lack of plot until that point, and near lack of interesting characters. Adam and Seth are dull, hardworking, self-sacrificing, and would give Jesus a run for his money in terms of saintliness (significantly, they're carpenters). The book spends a great deal of time visiting the different homes in the town, and creating realistic depictions of the people who live and work there. Most are almost as dull as Adam. Hetty Sorrell is the only truly interesting character in the book (although the author continually berates her with moralistic reproaches). Arthur Donnithorne has some interesting moments as well, but he ultimately (and unconvincingly) proves spineless -- sacrificing his own happiness to comply with societal opinion (and to redeem himself in Adam's eyes). Once Hetty's story kicked into gear, the book became increasingly interesting -- culminating in her desperate trek across a larger world she'd never dreamed existed. As someone else noted, Hetty's character bears some resemblance to Mdme Bovary ... and to Hedda Gabler, Scarlet O'Hara, Hester Prynne (after whom she is named), and many other great female literary characters. And, for all its upright characters (and moralizing narrator), the real heart of the book is Hetty's tragic fate. A 17-year old girl, she is essentially a victim of statutory rape (at least by today's standards) who finds herself shunned by family and society when she scandously becomes pregnant. Her unintentional infanticide, and subsequent trial and demise provide a far more telling commentary on the mores of Georgian England than they do on Hetty Sorrell. I suspect that Eliot, to her credit, may be more on Hetty's side than she lets on."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"As the title indicates, I feel quite unqualified to review the writings of George Eliot. But I did like the edition that Penguin classics puts out. It's sturdy, held up well being hauled around (never go anywhere without a book). I thought the explanatory notes at the end were quite thorough, and I enjoyed the editor's introduction."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"You HAVE to read this book, it's a winner for all Victorian literature mavens."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"Adam Bede, the titular hero of George Eliot's first novel, is of a character so sterling that one little anecdote serves to define his whole life and work ethic: He's a carpenter, and he had done some work for a lady whose father, an old squire named Donnithorne, suggested that she pay him less than the fee he requested. Adam insisted that he would rather take no money for the job, for to accept a reduced amount would be like admitting he overcharges for shoddy work. By standing on his principles, he won his full fee in the end and cemented his reputation as a businessman of honor and acumen, proving his fairness to both his customers and himself.Thus he seems an unlikely match for Hetty Sorrel, the prettiest girl in the village of Hayslope. Vain, selfish, materialistic, hating her laborious farm chores, Hetty bears more than a passing resemblance to Flaubert's Madame Bovary. However, while Madame Bovary's unattainable dream world is inspired by her reading romances, Hetty &quot;had never read a novel&quot; so she can't &quot;find a shape for her expectations&quot; regarding love. Unable to foresee any possible consequences for her actions, she allows herself to be seduced by Arthur Donnithorne, the old squire's grandson, who stands to inherit the land on which most of the Hayslopers live.Arthur is a radiant example of Eliot's mastery in complicated character creation. Acutely aware of his position in society, he has the kind of charisma with which he can talk to his tenants politely but with just the slightest hint of condescension and completely win their respect for his authority. In fact, he is so accustomed to receiving nothing but admiration for his apparent moral integrity that it comes as a genuine shock to him when Adam, a man he truly likes, reproaches him for his reckless behavior with Hetty, a girl both he and Adam truly love. And the tragic irony is that Hetty doesn't really deserve either of them.Religion plays a curious role in the story. Adam's brother Seth is infatuated with a woman named Dinah Morris, a cousin's cousin to Hetty and a Methodist evangelistic preacher who was inspired by Wesley in the flesh. Her influence among the villagers comes to the attention of the Anglican Rev. Dauphin Irwine, the vicar of Hayslope, who visits her to try to figure out her game and concludes that she's essentially a good woman with a good heart. Indeed, she is the first one to sense that Hetty may be headed for troubled waters and earnestly offers her spiritual guidance, to which Hetty responds with distrust and irritation.Most powerful of the novel's images is that of Hetty wandering through the darkness and dangers of the English countryside in desperate search of the departed Arthur, carrying with her a symbol of their tormented love, and oblivious to the goodness of Adam, whose only desire is to protect her from the disappointment, shame, and disgrace that result from her pitiful reliance on Arthur's ability to buy her pretty things. But Eliot is too fond of her hero to let him suffer for long when the tides of fate come crashing violently to their inevitable shores, and the ultimate product is a novel of great compassion for its characters."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"Highly recommended for those who loves classic literature. George Elliot beautifully captured the lives of the people in rural English country in the late 18th century and early 19th century. I guarantee you'll fall in love with all the 4 main characters ie. Adam Bede, Hetty Sorrel, Lord Arthur and Dinah Morris before you finish the book. The courting scenes involving Adam Bede and Dinah are both very romantic and honest. George Elliot had a great understanding of human nature which makes the story very believable although it's fiction. ADAM BEDE's a hero in my heart, and this book's a must read for all literature fans."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"I just finished &quot;Adam Bede,&quot; turning to the novels of George Eliot after a long stint of reading only Thomas Hardy. A long-time fan of Hardy's work, I thought him to be my favorite English author -- George Eliot, however, has proven to be quite the challenger to Hardy for a place in my heart.&quot;Adam Bede&quot; is the tale of simple people making their way in the world, each of them encountering hardship and sorrow along the way. Eliot's style is immediately engaging: she addresses the reader directly, and it seems like she is behind the scenes everywhere, pulling up a curtain to reveal vignettes in the lives of her characters. She forces the readers, almost, to fall in love with Adam immediately -- the strong, righteous man whom the story will carry along its rocky path. Similarly, Dinah emerges immediately as the source of peace and goodness in the novel, and it is always refreshing when, in times of turmoil, she appears.I was bothered by only one element of the story, but I think it is rather easily overlooked: Adam's unrelenting love for Hetty. Eliot gives little background as to why his feelings for her are so strong, and all we really know of her personality is that she is incredibly vain because she is incredibly beautiful. Adam never struck me as a character who would fall for such a &quot;surface&quot; woman. His final choice for a wife (which I will not reveal in case amazon.com surfers haven't read the book yet) seems much more appropriate.All in all, the journey through this book is a most rewarding one. I look forward to my next Eliot read!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"ADAM BEDE is a thrilling read, though it may seem hard to believe given the unpromising setting and the stilted way Eliot introduces her story. But after the first few starchy chapters, abruptly, something wonderful happens: she gets wise to herself. It's as if you can see her realize that the upright characters she *thought* she was pinning her story on, dull Dinah and Mr Irwine, aren't really the stuff of which fiction is made -- so she shoves them aside and takes up the flawed characters of her triangle, who resonate with possibility at every turn. Suddenly, miraculously, with almost no warning, all Eliot's amazing gifts as a writer take center stage: Her psychological insight. Her phenomenal wit. The dramatizing genius that allows her, effortlessly, to plot the most intimate narrative developments against the gigantic backdrop of a county-wide feast or funeral. Her fearlessness and surefootedness in picking her way (and ours) through the tangle of social and class relationships of an entire village. In this embarrassment of riches, maybe most rewarding for a reader like me is Eliot's unerring ability to pay off her plots: here, ladies and gentlemen, is a writer who knows how to write the hell out of a climax -- George Eliot's big confrontation scenes never, ever disappoint.Too, some wizardry seems to keep her narrative touch both incomparably delicate and completely unflinching at the same time. At the heart of ADAM BEDE is a story so sordid I wonder whether it could be broadcast on network TV today, and Eliot tells it without vulgarity but without ever shying away from its ugliness. My most serious criticism of the book is that Eliot didn't quite trust herself enough not to tack an unconvincing (and, worse, uninteresting) happy ending onto her story. But the hair-raising drive of the middle two-thirds of the book is something you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"I love Marion Evans and expect others would enjoy her very much too. I'm writing this review to make sure that, if Adam Bede is your first experience with her, you not judge her by it and, if there is anything you find you like in it, that you go on and read more by her... Silas Marner, Middlemarch, essays, etc.Adam Bede is, if I recall correctly, one of her earliest (if not first) extended works... the rest only get better. It is the only one that I would give less than five stars. There's really only one thing that mars it.But first, what's good about it? Well, there's her deeply probing, psychological characterizations that leave all of her characters fully understood by the reader. We may love, admire, sympathize with, hope for, dislike, or disapprove of them. But we always understand them. Even the most minor characters or bit parts get well-developed. She puts more into a characterization of dogs than some writers do of humans... and it's clear that she loves them both very much!Then there's her beautifully dense english: within a single sentence she can present a thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. She has the most charitable way of using irony I've ever encountered. Also, she was very much to British vernacular what Mark Twain was to American vernacular. This is especially marked in Adam Bede and may lead some people to shy away from it.Also, she takes on the big issues of her day... political and religious change, the position of women and the otherwise disenfranchised, etc... in a way and to an extent that no one else in her day was doing. It's somewhat stealthy at times, being cloaked in the lives of the individuals who are affected by the issues. Not infrequently her own views come, comically, from the mouths of those who must otherwise be taken to least likely represent them... very sly. An example from Middlemarch flows from the nontraditional Dorothea's very traditional sister: \\"Oh, women are better than men at most everything [Dorothea smiling in response and her sister catching herself]... excepting of course the things they're not I mean!\\". I think her writing definitely stands the test of time.Now what's bad? One thing only... Adam Bede has one radical plot twist that's either physiologically impossible or relies on the unbelievable ignorance of most of the characters. I can only imagine that the twist was less perverse to the Victorian reader's sensibility but it left me cold near the end of an otherwise warm, engaging, moving work by a great writer."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"This world-famous novel is all about love and loss and making choices in marriage.

I have serveral others of hers but I alway seemed to have another book I wanted to read. In fact, I started Adam Bede once and was about 150 pages into and put it down. After 6 months or so, I decided to pick it back up and I am glad that I did.This is a wonderful story about a person who is true to himself and to those around him. This is also a story about how the actions of a person affect more than that person and those immediately involved.The only problem I had with the story (and thus the 4 stars) was the dialect of the language used in the book. It is difficult to get used to the dialect and it is difficult to know what the character is trying to say. However, after the first 200 pages, I did get the hang of it but it was difficult going at first. In fact, it was because of that difficulty that I put the book down before.I was glad to have read this book. It does have a shocking part to it though it is subtle at first. What really helped me was to read several chapters and then go the the sparknotes and read them to make sure I had not missed anything which was a big help in fully understanding the story. I would recommend that if you read this book, read the sparknotes after every 4 or 5 chapters.I would also recommend this book to anyone that likes Thomas Hardy and espcially his \\"Far from the Madding Crowd.\\" I loved \\"Madding Crowd\\" and this book reminded me of it.I truly recommend this book to anyone that likes English Classic Literature. Once you get the hang of the dialect you will like this story. If you read this one and have not read Thomas Hardy's \\"Madding Crowd\\" I would recommend that you read that one as well."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"\\"George Eliot\\" is the masculine pen name of the brilliant English classic novelist Mary Ann Evans (1819-1880). Evans grew up in Warwickshire and knew rural England like the back of her hand. It was with this background allied with her literary genius that persuaded her in 1859 to write her first full length novel \\"Adam Bede. She did so at the urging of her longtime lover George Henry Lewes. After a career penning short stories, literary reviews and translation she was ready to begin one of the greatest careers in all of English fiction. Eliot produced such masterpieces as \\"Silas Marner\\"; \\"The Mill on the Floss\\"; \\"Daniel Deronda\\"; \\"Romola\\" and her lengthy masterpiece \\"Middlemarch\\"Adam Bede occurs in the time of the Napoleonic wars. Adam Bede and his brother Seth are carpenters living in the small village of Hayslope. Their mother is the cranky but good Lisbeth. The novel begins as a young female Methodist preacher the fetching Diane Morris is preaching in the village square. Seth is in love with her but his dreams of matrimony will not be fulfilled. Adam is smitten with the seventeen year old featherhead but lovely Hetty Sorrel. Hetty is an orphan who lives with her relatives the Poyser family at the Hall farm. Hetty will be seduced by the rich but weak willed Arthur Donnithorne. He will abandon her; she will kill her baby and plans on being married to Adam. Hetty is tried for murder but at the last minute is saved by a reprieve won for her by the repentant Arthur. Diane and Adam marry. Order and tranquility are restored to Hayslope but Eliot and her readers of 1860 knew that the rural life of sixty years before would soon yield to the encroachments of industrialism.Adam Bede is a leisurely novel with a slow pace. We see the seasons unfold in all their English glory; met the Poysers and the garrulous Mrs. Poyser and her passel of children. We attend drinking and harvest parties and catch up on the gossip with the \\"rude mechanicals\\" of the town who share their folk wisdom and foolishness with the reader. Much of the book is written in a dialect but this is understandable and not an obstacle in perusing Adam Bede's many pages.Although an agnostic, Eliot displays a deep knowledge of the Christian Bible and teaches us about the early Methodist movement in these pages. Many of the characters such as Adam, Seth and other characters have biblical names.Hetty Sorrel reminds this reviewer of the character of Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" of 1850. Unlike Hester, however, we see little moral growth in the soul of Hetty. Eliot had an understanding for those under a moral black cloud due to her unorthodox relationship with Lewes. Her style probes psychological corners of the human soul. Eliot wrote for literate adults producing a work of beauty, wisdom and love. She is the brighest of Victorian novelists and one of the best. I have read this book several times and list it as one of my all time favorites. Essential!"},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"Adam Bede is a wonderful, tragic story in the very best tradition of 19th century English novelists.

I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego. Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works."},{"Title":"Adam Bede (Film/TV tie-in series)","review":"I am still in the middle of reading Adam Bede.

Her beauty becomes her downfall because of the attention she receives from the local squire. The consequences of her behavior are not retractable and affect her and her family deeply.

That the (mostly) Victorian sentiments in the stories which describe the love, admiration, attachments, and living arrangments between the cowboys are, in reality, describing cowboys who are homosexual and who can't keep their eyes or hands off each other. That the reason all these cowboys sleep in their bedrolls in pairs, live together in wilderness cabins just like married straight couples, and find children who are orphans to raise as their own, is that all these cowboys are gay. That the hundreds of novels and short stories about cowboys published in books and in pulp magazines and read by millions of straight boys and men for the last 200 years and who thought that they were simply adventure stories about cowboys, were really gay love stories drenched in erotic language and imagery. I'd really love to believe this is true, that cowboy stories are really gay romances. But this book Queer Cowboys doesn't convince me. Characters in fiction don't have real lives the way people who are subjects of biographies have real lives. The cowboy stories NEVER say that the cowboys have sex with each other. I think the author of Queer Cowboys is misinterpreting the over-the-top Victorian sentiments about admiration and platonic love in these stories. I don't believe that the stories are revealing that cowboys were all gay. But the book is thought provoking, and the author has courage, and I think it's worth reading since there isn't a lot else on the subject."},{"Title":"Queer Cowboys: And Other Erotic Male Friendships in Nineteenth-Century American Literature","review":"Chris Packard puts together an entertaining, and intellectually stimulating tour of some \\"cowboy literature\\" of the 19th century, emphasizing everywhere its homosocial qualities, and finding the erotic under every set of chaps. Comical, sometimes suggestive period photographs dot the text, cowhands hugging each other, holding hands, or even standing \\"too close\\" to each other, dancing, or swimming nude. Packard begins his survey of American lit with the Leatherstocking Tales of James Fenimore Cooper (and his sea stories too, which share some of the same tropes of white man + \\"othered\\" man finding love where no woman dare go). Cooper's always good for a few laughs, but the intensity of same-sex feeling that Packard finds in these novels might make you momentarily confused--might he be writing about DENNIS Cooper's books? On a broad level, was homosexuality encouraged \\"on the trail\\" as a way of avoiding children of mixed race? So it seems.Owen Wister's THE VIRGINIAN was a famous novel written by a contemporary of Henry James who actually was a cowboy himself, briefly, in youth. Its narrator, an Eastern newcomer, is in love with the Virginian, that's pretty obvious from Packard's canny precis. This chapter is the highlight of Packard's discussion and the one that comes closest to furthering his thesis. Succeeding chapters descend into writing's netherworlds, of softcore porn, lockerroom ballads, and Mark Twain's obscene smoking room talks, to show that American men were not above appreciating same-sex love as a basis for comedy, though it is a pity Packard couldn't find any cowboys doing so.The book feels oddly foreshortened at the end, as though the publisher were punishing him for running overtime and stopped the argument, arbitrarily, at a certain number of pages. But I enjoyed myself thoroughly and could definitely see an expanded edition."},{"Title":"Queer Cowboys: And Other Erotic Male Friendships in Nineteenth-Century American Literature","review":"Despite the general movement towards social equality for queer men and women, homosexuality and homosexual behavior (they aren't the same thing) remain controversial and poorly understood. For example, most people think that because a man engages in homosexual behavior, he is necessarily homosexual. (Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar are bisexual, not homosexual.) The recent \\"shenanigans\\" among Wackenhut employees in Afghanistan are described as \\"deviant\\", when they are actually a normal component of male sexual behavior.Gay readers tend to reflexively enthuse over books that present \\"queer history\\" in a positive light, while straight readers too-often bring a sackful of prejudices. The latter, in particular, are obvious in these reviews. (See the reviews of \\"Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe\\".)The \\"Queer Cowboys\\" title is intentionally provocative. The subtitle tells us what the book is actually about -- the way 19th-century American writers and literature presented close male friendships. (In this usage, \\"erotic\\" means emotional, not necessarily sexual.)Does it bother you that Mark Twain was very much aware of what men did with each other when women weren't around? Or that he apparently wrote a sketch about a man who'd lost his girlfriend asking his best friend to submit to penetrative sex as an act of consolation? Does it bother you that cowboys engaged in mutual masturbation (and other activities) to relieve their sexual stress -- and probably to \\"take pleasure in\\" their masculinity? Does it bother you that \\"The Virginian\\" has bluntly homoerotic elements, * that Owen Wister was probably in love with the man the title character is modeled on? Does it bother you that several of Bret Harte's stories (\\"Tennesee's Partner\\", \\"In the Tules\\", \\"Uncle Jim and Uncle Billy\\") are barely disguised narratives about two men's physical and/or emotional attraction to each other? **If so, you won't like this book.It's disappointing to see reviewers mis-reading what (to me) is plain in Packard's analysis. Given that cowboys, ranchers, miners, mountain men, et al, present an image of rough masculinity, stories about them are implicitly homoerotic. But Packard focuses on the \\"coded\\" -- and sometimes not-so-coded -- elements. Nowhere does he suggest that all cowboys had sexual feelings for each other, or that if Pea-Eye Parker and Dish Boggett just happened to wander into the bushes to masturbate, that made them \\"homosexuals\\". ***What he is showing is what is plainly there, if you don't willfully blind yourself to it. Amos Lassen's naive review reveals that he has little knowledge or understanding of human sexuality. Human males have been messing around with each other as long as there have been human males, regardless of how you choose to label such behavior.Someone might profitably study Westerns for coded homoeroticism. For example, in two of the Mann/Stewart films, Jimmy Stewart's character and his sidekick briefly reminisce over what they friendship has meant to them, and how much they care about each other. This might not have been intentionally homoerotic, but it /is/ there, and is worth noting, as American films of any genre do not generally have such scenes.My only quibble with \\"Queer Cowboys\\" is that Packard occasionally over-interprets and exaggerates his case. But not too often.Recommended, unless you're afraid of alternative points of view.* I have recently read all the novels and short stories referred to in this review.** In \\"Uncle Jim and Uncle Billy\\", Harte notes that Jim and Billy, a \\"married\\" couple in a mining camp, sleep in separate beds. This was probably a conscious attempt to avoid any suggestion of deviant sex. Such an interpretation would probably not have occurred to a strictly hetero writer.*** I interpret Larry McMurtry's refusal to acknowledge sexual behavior among cowboys, etc, as simple cowardice."},{"Title":"Queer Cowboys: And Other Erotic Male Friendships in Nineteenth-Century American Literature","review":"While my usual genre is historical fiction, I am always on the lookout for research of a historical variety. Therefore, although it has been around for a while, \\"Queer Cowboys: And other erotic male friendships in nineteenth-century American literature\\" by Chris Packard (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005) is one such work.The stated objective of this thesis is to explore the \\"bonds that hold ... [same-sex partners, i.e. \`sidekicks'] together, particularly the erotic affection that undergirds their friendship.\\" To do this it painstakingly explores the \\"originary\\" texts of seminal, nineteenth-century writers who, individually and collectively, created the prevailing stereotype of the devoted same-sex partners. Moreover, the author undertakes to \\"teach readers how to recognize homoerotic affection in a historical discourse that was free from the derogatory meanings associated with post-1900 evaluations of male-male erotic friendships\\"--a not overly presumptuous ambition, given that Packard teaches literature and writing at New York University and New School University.Okay, I am one such hypothetical reader, so let's see how well Professor Packard achieved his objectives.At the risk of oversimplifying Packard's thesis, it starts with an underlying premise that before 1900--i.e. before \\"the modern invention of the \`homosexual' as a social pariah\\"--cowboy relationships were freely represented as quite a bit more affectionate than they are after that date. Moreover, although the stereotypes generally depicted ethnic warfare; citing the threat of \\"savagery\\" as justification for ethnic slaughter, and the freeing-up of territory to make way for European homesteaders, writers like James Fennimore Cooper wrote about friendships, \\"even marriage rituals,\\" between members of warring groups based on shared values. In addition friendships between young whites and natives were quite common. These mixed friendships usually had the natives tutoring the boys in the primitive ways of the wilderness, and included rituals of brotherhood, i.e. exchanging blood, and other physical, nuptial-like rites.Notably absent from this literary same-sex scenario is any role for femininity, which is described by one quoted authority, Walter Benn Michaels, as \\"...the problem of heterosexuality.\\" The \`problem' being the threat of reproduction in a period when fear of mixed-ethnicity through sex or marriage was keen in American culture. Moreover, femininity and reproduction ran contrary to the strong, independent, and particularly \`free' nature of the cowboy characters.\\"Within canonical as well as ignored literature, high culture as well as low, homoerotic intimacy is not only present, but it is thematic in works produced before the modern want him to be queer. America's official emblem of masculinity is not one who settles down after he conquests ... rather, he moves on, perpetually conquering, and repeatedly affirming his ties to the wilderness and his male partner.\\"Having thus stated his hypotheses, Packard then goes on to support these with an anthology of mostly \\"canonical\\" writings--i.e. Cooper's \\"The Leatherstocking Tales,\\" Owen Wister's \\"The Virginian,\\" and Walt Whitman's poetry. He also introduces some lesser known examples, such as Claude Hartland's \\"The Story of a Life,\\" Frank Harris's \\"My Reminiscences as a Cowboy,\\" and Frederick Loring's \\"Two College Friends.\\"While circumstantial, when read from a homoerotic perspective Packard makes a very compelling case, over all. There are no \`smoking-gun' examples, of course, because such blatancies would have been considered excessive by Eastern readers--meaning east of the Mississippi, but it is evident that the implication was there just below the surface. Consequently, he has also taught us how to recognize homoerotic affection in \\"historic discourse.\\"To get to that level of edification, however, the reader has had to wade through an Introduction that I found to be a jumble of complex ideas, confusingly presented and fraught with academic jargon--i.e. \\"nexus,\\" \\"praxis,\\" \\"lingua franca,\\" and so forth. A case on point:\\"Given the instant and undying popularity of cowboys in U.S. popular culture during a period of rapid national expansion, to identify a homoerotic core in its myth about the supremacy of white American masculinity is to imply that American audiences want their frontiersmen to practice nonnormative desires as part of their roles in nation building. In other words, if there is something national about the cowboy (and other frontier heroes of his ilk), and if there is something homoerotic about American national identity as it is conceived in the American West.\\"Perhaps I am a bit slow on the uptake, but I didn't find the \\"In other words\\" any more elucidating than the original statement.Happily, once he launches into the body of the argument his tone becomes somewhat less esoteric, and apart from belabouring some points--giving a new dimension to the term \`moot point'--he presents a very interesting and informative perspective on nineteenth-century thought.Those looking for titillating erotica, however, are bound to be disappointed but well-informed after reading this work.Gerry BurnieGerry Burnie BooksCanadian history from a gay perspective series."},{"Title":"Queer Cowboys: And Other Erotic Male Friendships in Nineteenth-Century American Literature","review":"An intersting little anthology of the queer and not so queer which suffers from too much hindsight on occasion.

StormFront is the latest book in the Gospel and Our Culture Series, which seeks to help the church more faithfully engage North American culture with the gospel. Other volumes have included The Missional Church, and The Continuing Conversion of the Church.The title is meant to evoke the image of two masses of hot and cold air running into each other and creating a violent storm. One of these air masses is the Kingdom of God, the other is the Kingdom of this World. The church finds itself at the intersection, caught in the clash between these two forces. It is in this \\"dynamic and tumultuous\\" intersection where God engages our world.The authors claim that many North American Christians act as if the gospel were a small ocean breeze, rather than a raging storm. The North American gospel, they argue, primarily centers on how God can meet my needs and how God can fulfill my desires. It has little sense of God's greater purposes in this world. They contend a Biblical understanding of the gospel looks a lot different. The gospel concerns God's activity to redeem the whole creation. The gospel isn't about me getting what I want. The gospel invites us to enter, receive, and participate in God's Reign, initiated by Jesus' life, death and resurrection. This gospel should radically reorient our lives.Through the book's five chapters it examines our dominant understanding of the gospel, God's intentions on earth as found in the Old and New Testaments, the role of spiritual powers, the place of discipleship, and the practices that help us embody the gospel. The section connecting the gospel in the New Testament to the Old Testament is particularly helpful.Few books accomplish what they set out to do. Impressively, StormFront does effectively answer the question: What is the gospel? And beyond that, on the practical level, it issues a significant challenge both for individuals and the church to participate more fully in God's purposes on earth.Although this book is targeted to lay-readers, it is a dense and difficult read. It contains a great deal of theological language that can be at times hard to sift through. But for those willing to take the time and effort, they will find their understanding of the gospel deepened, and their faith commitments inspired and challenged."},{"Title":"StormFront: The Good News of God (Gospel and Our Culture)","review":"This book has been greatly helpful for me to understand the current state of affairs in the church. I have lived in many other countries in my adult life and &quot;coming home&quot; has not been easy. Despite the book's focus on the USA context, it is also an immensely appropriate resource for reflecting on our context in Canada. The book's thesis that the church has been caught up so seductively in all aspects of a &quot;consumer&quot; culture that we approach our faith and religious experience with the same value system is powerful and deeply sobering. While &quot;easy-reading&quot; the book is not an &quot;easy read&quot; since its premise demands that we refocus our lives on our call to be a community living out God's vision for hope and grace and justice in the world."},{"Title":"Rhythm And The Blues: A Life in American Music","review":"In-between the archetypes of musician-as-record- exec (as in Berry Gordy) and evil-incarnate-as-record-exec (as in The Geffen and progeny) is the fan-as-record-exec. Atlantic is the greatest example of a record company run by fans. With top-flight soul/R&amp;B, jazz, and rock divisions, Atlantic beats Sun and Chess for the title of &quot;History's greatest independent label.&quot; Jerry Wexler's colorfully logomaniacal verbiage tells of the view from the air up there. The personal history detailed in this book isn't to be skipped, either. Not nearly outshined by the magical music history that attracts us to this book, the life lived by the author helps make this stuff such a good and quick read. There's something to be felt there. Read. Look for Ahmet Ertegun's entry on the subject, coming in May 2000."},{"Title":"Rhythm And The Blues: A Life in American Music","review":"If you are a music lover, industry hopeful, or history buff, this book will give you an honest, down to earth, fireside story of one very important man's life in the business.

When it is all said and done, you feel as if you knew Wex throughout his journey and understand his joy in the career path he chose and just what he has accomplished.

It was given to me free with the purchase of another book. I had never heard of Ms Fitzjames but she really can put a great story together. This action packed book had it all. Love interest, mystery and a bracelet with a puzzle to solve. It even combined Bridey, a very proper Boston lady, with a frontier hero. I loved the town of Potluck she created, built in tiers, with stairs leading to each street (reminded me of 1st and 2nd streets in downtown Seattle). The brothers that ran the &quot;Contraption&quot;, Digger always singing &quot;Sweet Betsy from Pike&quot; and his huge mule Ulysses. Can't forget the widow Ruth Spivey who ran the hotel and her secret love interest. Caught me with her surprise at the end too. I have read so many books that received a 5* rating just on the author's name when the book left much to be desired but I highly recommend this one to all who enjoy a book that grabs you on the first page and doesn't let go till the last."},{"Title":"Silver Angel","review":"The story was good but the plot dragged on.

Using articles written between 1781 and 1789 by Jacobi, Feder, Tiedemann, and other eighteenth century commentators, Sassen (McMaster University) makes it rather easy to follow the complex polemics on space, time, logic, empiricism, idealism, and Kant's critical philosophy in general. Although somewhat forgotten today, these debates and discussions are of great historical importance because they led directly to some of the crucial revisions in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason. This collection of articles and essays forms a companion edition to the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant. Less advanced readers will be helped by biographical notes, a very simple German-English glossary, and a short but useful bibliography. This book will be very useful to any reader interested in the ideas of the Enlightenment and encourage students and professors from many disciplines to revisit this important chapter in European intellectual history."},{"Title":"Preaching Pity (Studies in Nineteenth-Century British Literature)","review":"The book Preaching Pity : Dickens, Gaskell, and Sentimentalism in Victorian Culture (Studies in Nineteenth-Century British Literature, Vol. 11), by Mary Lenard provided an insightful analyzation of the birth of public feeling in the Victorian Era. She uses the works of Dickens and Gaskell to prove her points, which she does quite well. Her book demostrated a deep knowledge of England during that time period.

The boy is named Kim Sin Gyu, but the name is never used; all the other characters remain nameless. They struggle across a shattered landscape, scavenging wood for heat, and living on handouts from the American soldiers, wild grasses, fish and occasional small animals. Their pilgrimage is torturous, miserable, and seems never ending. That's the story in a nutshell. Eventually the long march ends, if you can read that far, but of course I won't tell you what happens. You'll have to read this one for yourself.Chaim Potok is a great writer, and he manages to make the reader feel the misery and tedium of this unending pilgrimage. What he doesn't do quite as well is to make the characters and their culture believable. He writes this book in a rambling stream-of-consciousness style, with the point of view ever shifting between their three heads. Unlike most of his better known works, this one has nothing to do with orthodox Judaism. The author makes a cameo appearance as a Jewish army chaplain, one who seems strangely oblivious to the Koreans he's dealing with.This is a powerful book if you can get through it, but not as good as Potok's earlier works. It's good, but not for everyone. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"Chaim Potok uses very vivid writing to portray the many dramatic scenes in this book. Clear images form in your mind as you read about a war torn Korea and the many hopeless lives of people escaping their doom. When hope seems to be lost, it is regained and keeps you on your toes wanting more. New worlds and ideas are brought into your head as you learn about a different culture during a horrible time. Characters with rich personalities are running from the blackened earth and dismembered corpses while trying to gain safety and essentials for living. Sickness and death overcome many, and sadness hampers those who are living.Even though Chaim Potok uses poetic and vivid writing, he lacks substance. This story gives the reader a very confused feeling as they try to figure from which point of view certain events are being described. Stories of the past are being told by characters who are remembering the good times before the war, but who is actually speaking? This aspect of the book leaves characters seeming drier than Potok intended to portray them and gives the reader a sense of being lost, ultimately eliminating the books adhesiveness.The actual plot in this story is very dry as well. There is no ultimate goal for the characters to reach other than survival. If there were something the characters were trying to achieve, it would make the story much more interesting and compelling because it would add more variables to the plot. Unfortunately, a strong plot is greatly needed for a story to be worth reading, and this book lacks that aspect which decreases the value of the book.This book is not worth reading unless you are just looking to read a great writing style. The book is not purposeful enough and does not sufficiently contribute to the world of literature. Just a little more thought into the plot and moral of the story would make this a top-notch book."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"I am amazed at how Chaim Potok wrote this book, especially since he served as a Chaplain in the Korean war. He should learn more about Asian culture before he makes a direct comment on it. For example, he said that the Japanese do not use the Chinese characters, when, in fact, they do. Isn't that a surprise?Potok needs to get over his obsession with the human phallus in this book. He talks about it in the most annoyingly random places you could ever imagine. It often has no relevance whatsoever to do with the book.I think he also does not give enough credit to Koreans in terms of common knowledge. A great example of this is when the main characters think that bats are mouse-shaped spirits that fly.The storyline of the book is of the utmost simplicity, and as the first reviewer of this book said, it is often easy to feel as though Chaim Potok had not enough to say and decided to \\"stretch things out\\" a bit.Oh, and on the back of the book, it says that the people are heading north in the Korean war. They turn back north at one point, but the Chinese came and invaded south. Why on earth would anyone ever want to run north during the war?"},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"i only got up to page 27 but i didnt think it was too good yeat. it was kind of confusing me because the characters were thinking to thenmselves but you couldnt tell if they were thinking or speeking because the author didnt specify un his writting."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"REALLY GOOOD WHen i say good It was bad i did not like i"},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":".

It is a story of people who get lost in a war, who feel alienated from one another, and who after suffering together, finally find a true love. The story is remarkable in its vivid beautiful images, incredible in its surprise twist, and powerful in its ending. It creates an intense heat of the war, the bleak cold of suffering, and a moving feeling of love. If you are a true lover of ramance, you should venture in the war zone, find your compassion and treasure it for your meaningful life."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"I am the Clay is superb reading. From the beginning I did not want to put the book down and felt sorry when I had to say goodbye to the people at the end. Potok departs from his previous stories of families with Jewish backgrounds to tell the story of a family of Korean refugees during the war. In spite of the horror of their sufferings, the story instead of being depressing, is constantly filled with hope and love. Although in some ways each day in the lives of the old couple and the boy they rescue is the same as the one before it, each day you also get deeper into understanding them and thus the story progresses rapidly.The language and writing style are simple to match the simple lives and minds of these peasants, while the psychology is complex. We recognize and resonate with the complexity of love - the surpise as loved ones seem to change before our eyes, the impatience with things we don't agree with, the need for one another, and the deep love that can exist between two individuals who share a long life together."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"I read this book when I was 13, I couldn't quite recall the plot but I there were certain images from the book that popped into my head.The main characters are known as old man and old woman and the boy. The Chinese Army has begun its sweep South and the villagers of a Korean Village during the Korean War have become refugees. The Old Man and The Old Woman, immediately upon leaving the village find a young boy. The old woman refuses to leave the boy, she thinks of the child she lost, the old man begins to resent the boy and think that the woman is crazy. They risk their lives to save the boy, they suffer to save the boy. And when the boy does not die he returns as many kindnesses as he can upon these people who protected him and did not give up on him.I think what moves me most is the desire to reconnect to one's humanity when the world feels as if it is spinning dangerously out of control. The are lead by their compassion and it is a remarkably moving story.If you were to use this book with young adult readers there could be a number of topics to discuss. The tension between the man and the boy. Why do you think they do not have names. The complexity of the Old Woman. The hard side of the old man. The sacrifices made. The reason for the title. And discuss the things unsaid at the end of this powerful book."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"This is a beautiful, thoughtful, moving book -- perhaps not Potok's best, but very good nonetheless."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"I am an avid reader and liked/loved every book I ever read by Chaim Potok well until now. Sorry to say that this book was dragging and there were so many repetitions throughout the book that it got underneath my skin. It's one thing to write in detail (which I do enjoy) and it's another to make the reader feel like the writer has nothing to say therefore \\"lets stretch this out\\".This was one of the very few books that I could not even finnish reading. I read about 3/4 of it and I had to put it down.The story line was interesting and the book would've been enjoyable only if....."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"this is definitely not one of Chaim's greater works of art. If you are expecting the type of work you got in \\"The Chosen\\" then you will be dissappointed. The plot is very slow developing and is not very interesting, it seems that nothing of importance happened in the novel from beginning to end, and you dont establish a connection with any of the characters like you did in his previous works. This book is not worth reading unless you are a fan of Chaim Potok."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"I Am The Clay is a story of suffering and civilians caught in the crossfire of the Korean War. However, I believed the story was repetitive and predictable. It was mainly told from the perspective of an old man. Much of the narration is in fragmented sentences, in which the characters' emotions are poorly articulated. A big portion of the story involves the old man stating his disapproval of his wife's obstinacy. The old couple abandons their home, finds a child, makes it to a refugee camp, and comes back home. The events have no effect on their perspective of each other or life.I found the beliefs of the characters of I Am The Clay to be interesting. They believed in spirits that protect them, despite the hardships they had been through.I preferred The Chosen, the author's previous book; the characters of that book articulate more than their most superficial feelings."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"Wow. I just finished this book. I've read many of Chaim Potok books and have enjoyed each one so much that I keep picking up another one. He is such a great storyteller. I must admit that I was a bit skeptical about this one. Most of his books center on Judaism and this one seemed so different than his other writings. I wondered how he would manage a different culture. However, what I have learned is that certain themes are universal to humanity. Heroism in the face of extreme conditions is a theme that certainly holds true in the Judaic experience and in this book on the Korean War experience. Heroism to me is the ability to remain human and loving even under the most stressful and dire of conditions. The heroism of the characters in this book is so moving and heart warming. It is classic Potok. He leaves you thinking about the characters and their future long after reading his books."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"When I first started reading this book, I assumed that it would be boring, and redunant, and hard to understand. That all changed after I got into the book, and I found myself attached to the young eleven year old boy, who is orphaned by war. &quot;I am the Clay&quot; is an intimate and touching novel about the cruelties of the Korean war, and how it affected the little people, the citizens of Korea. I think that it should be read by all people to better understand a different point of view on the wars. I trust I will never forget the images of survival and suffering put into my head, and am confident that I have gained a better knowledge of war."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"If you ever wondered how refugees find the strength -- emotion, physical, spiritual -- to live through wars and insurrections on their homeland -- this fictional book explores the true horrors of not knowing what tomorrow will bring. The characters are touching and realistic. Potok investigates the human soul to explore hate vs. love, cruelty vs. kindness, etc. Read &quot;The Good Earth&quot; by Pearl S. Buck as well."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"An old Korean couple flees their village as invaders come from the north. Potok knows the glory and seaminess of human nature, and he gives it to us in his spare prose. These are scenes we know: the tension between a childless couple: \\"Woman, you are a roaring in my ears.\\" Superstitious beliefs, exposed when the old woman saves a dying child who later saves them. Exploitation: in the refugee camp and later in the old couple's village, the old man is out for himself and yet has a certain affection for his woman. She is captured from time to time humming the tune, \\"Have thine own way, Lord, Have thine own way.\\" She represents the glory possible when the clay submits to the potter."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"'I am the Clay' is a refreshing change to Potok's readers from an intimate view of Jewish family life to an intimate portrayal of innocent people caught in war.Set in South Korea during the Korean war of the mid 1950's, I am the Clay is centered around the journey of two elderly South Korean peasants as they struggle to save a young orphaned boy they found in a ditch, and travel north (a poor choice during the war).The book, as with most of Chaim Potok's, is very well-written and detailed.However, I am the Clay lacks the intimacy od Potok's other celebrated works due to the fact that Potok, despite having served for two years as a Chaplain in South Korea and Japan, is largely ignorant about Korean culture. I am the Clay has two peasants who believe animals to be spirits, and a little boy to be a magical charm. Although the characters are intended to be simple-minded, it is not a part of Korean culture to believe animals to be spirits, and human beings are not regarded as lucky charms.for this, I am the clay is certianly one of Chaim Potok's less imporessive novels. However, he does deserve three stars for experimenting with themes outside of Orthodox Judaism."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"Book ReviewI felt that I am the Clay by Chaim Potok, is a very emotional story that also puts emphasis on the relationships the characters develop. These relationships help the reader to understand the way people treated one another and what is important to their Asian culture. This book also gives you a feel of what it would be like to live during the war and how hard it must have been to pack only the necessities and leave your home. Not only did they have to worry about their survival but also what condition the house would be in if they returned. Would they have to build a new life from scratch for themselves and how many of they're neighbors and friends made it through this horrible ordeal? These are the questions they had to ask themselves everyday while they suffered from the cold and hunger. Chaim Potok really gives a descriptive view of the life they led and the hardships they had to succumb in order to survive.What I found very odd about how Chaim Potok wrote the book was how he named Kim Sin Gyu, but only referred to the couple that took care of him as the \\"old man and woman.\\" I would like to know his reason for doing this and how it enhanced the book. Another style of his I picked up on was how he tended to have a lot of long sentences when the boy spoke and how he tended to ramble on a bit about things that is not completely relevant. So I would recommend this book for those who have some past knowledge in history and war, or it may be a little hard to follow. However the author's vivid description of their hardships and struggles really made the book come to life."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"The title \\"I am the Clay\\" is taken from a Christian hymn that eventually serves as a theme throughout the progress of the novel. This short novel, reminiscent of a fable, focuses on the lives of three characters as they intersect and conflict during the Korean War. More famously known for his works in regards to Judaism, it is unique to have Potok's perspective on another culture; but unsurprisingly his writing is still shaped by tradition and the influence of the generations who came before.\\"I am the Clay\\" is the story of an old man and woman in flight from their village which is under attack. Along the way, they discover an unconscious and wounded eleven-year-old boy in a ditch along the road. The old couple, childless, is at odds as to what to do. The old man wants to leave the boy - why waste their energy and food on someone who is a stranger to them? But the woman wants to take the boy with them, and her stubborness wins out. Then follows the long trek these three refugees make through the south from shanty town to refugee camp, and finally back to their village when the war ends.Potok's book is a quick read, filled with a lyrical writing style that brings his vivid descriptions to life before the readers' eyes. At times the narrative can be confusing, since Potok interweaves all three perspectives with little indication between the shifts in narration. The suffering and ultimate redemption that these three characters face is powerfully told and universal in nature as destiny unfolds around them."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"Chaim Potok was an amazing writer who takes you from modern times back to when life was challenging, when people worked hard, and family was important. His works have truth to them bringing histroy into everything he writes and gives a person a feeling that they are becoming one with his work."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"This is a riveting, well-paced book. It is a terrific study of human behavior, especially in the concern for another in need under dire circumstances. It is also an excellent portrayal of what occured behind the headlines in horror of the Korean War as the South was being overrun by the Chinese. Reading this story stimulated many emotional feelings, i.e. compassion, love, sadness, disgust. I hope Chaim Potok writes a sequel. I want to know happens to the central figure of the story as he goes on with his life."},{"Title":"I Am the Clay","review":"I think the overall meaning and story behind I Am the Clay is a powerful one and that this book should be taught within Jr. High or High School. With that said, I had the hardest time reading this book. Potok's writing style is one that helps my brain wander while I'm reading, and I often had to go back and re-read sections. The beginning of the book is the densest with narrative description that's often told in 2 different perspectives and later in 3. I really became interested in the characters about mid-way through the book.I Am the Clay will give any person who hasn't been affected by war in their homeland a glimpse of what life can be like. This was set during the Korean war, which was not that long ago, so I think we can imagine what it may be like today as well. No matter where you live."},{"Title":"Lincoln on God and Country","review":"I read the book and am actually reading it a second time because I want to better understand Lincoln and his decisions. I found the authors insite into Lincolns religious beliefs rather facinating. The book was well written and easy to read. I enjoyed reading the speeches, because they are are at at a level that is well above the way our politicians talk to us today.I am writing this review because I wanted to send this book to some young HS graduates as a gift; and my wife was suggesting another book because it had more reviews. I liked this book and I think it would make a great gift, especially if it had dollars stuffed in the fold."},{"Title":"Lincoln on God and Country","review":"We live in troubled times. The presidential candidate of one political p[arty is ridiculed for stating that Jesus is his favorite philosopher, and the vice-presidential candidate of the other political party is castigated for speaking about religion. What has happened to the moral tone of this country, which was founded by God-fearing men? Have we completely abandoned the idea that there is a Being who guides and guards us in all that we do? Abraham Lincoln, arguably our greatest president, believed that there was Someone watching over us at all times. He also believed vehemently that our governmental system was important, and that its structure was the best that could have been devised for the country. His words are eloquent, and call to us across the gap of 150 years. Reading this work, it is easy to restore some confidence in our governmental system, even though now it is being sorely tested by the eletoral events in Florida. This work could not have come along at a better time in our history, and it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"At the time I write this review I am surprised to find there are only two others before me, and they are both from Louisiana, the state in which Richard Taylor resided at the outbreak of the war and which he so tirelessly strove to defend from Union depredations. A complex man, Taylor could be a stern martinet one moment, and then wax eloquent, displaying an artistic appreciation of life the next. Early on we see him ordering the execution of two of Wheat's Tigers for insubordination. Later, we see him transfixed by a flying bluebird the morning of First Winchester.Taylor's memoir deserves to be preserved not just as an academic curiosity, but because it is the expression of a now extinct class of men who, regardless of their lofty status in society, considered it their personal responsibility to put themselves into harm's way, to lead from the front instead of sending young men out to die while they remain safely at home. As a memoir of war Destruction and Reconstruction is non pareil, due to its flourishes of erudition and vivid accounts of the battles and personalities described therein. The biblical, mythological, historical and literary references are legion and display an education unlike any in the nineteenth century South. Some graduate student should make a project of cataloging and footnoting these references for an expanded edition. Be sure to mention me in the acknowledgements.I strongly encourage anyone wanting to read Destruction and Reconstruction to first obtain and read Parrish's bio on Taylor, for a broader background in understanding Taylor and where he came from but also for the maps which are absent from the memoir."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"The most interesting thing about this book is that you get to read a first hand account of the War between the States, from one of the greatest military heads of either the North or South. And also a very cultured man. His culture comes out prominently, almost too much so. When one just wants to read about how it was, the War and the so-called Reconstruction, it becomes a little tiring to have to take in with it also all the references to European military history, ancient history et al. Those names of old generals and foreign politicians of by-gone times are just a bother to the reader.And that brings me to -what I think is- the reason for the failing aspect of this book: It was meant for Taylor's contemporaries. It just feels from the start that the man is taking for granted that the reader knows much of the \\"story\\", and he is just telling another side to it: his own side. It is a readable book though, and entertaining, if you discount the pretension alluded to. And it is a definite contribution to the South's take on the whole conflict and the times. Elegant, sad, and full of Southern sentiment."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"This is a must read for anyone who desires a true understanding of the war and aftermath before our historical perspectives are forever changed with the new history being written by liberal professors. It clearly accounts for the crimes of the reconstruction which is a topic that is definitely being rewritten by those that desire to protray the US as some type of force for good."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"If your needing a really good review of Civil War history this is the book. From the beginning to the end of the Civil War and after. Tell's why the South fought and lost. Personal opinions of other southern generals are expressed by Taylor.

Taylor's love of the South and of Louisianan is put together marvelously."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"General Taylor's surprising written eloquence together with his personal participation in the subject matter of this book is extremely valuable to having a correct understanding of the events."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"I've always wanted to know more about Richard Taylor, and how he became a Southern General, Can't think of a better way to learn than from his own personal experiences...I highly recommend this book for those interested in the civil war and the behind the scene deals."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"I thought the chance to read an account of the civil war that not only came from a southerner but one who actually saw/participated would be pretty interesting. I was right. If you've watched the Blue and the Grey and North and South on television... those are movies, not the real thing. This book actually describes the politics, the social aspect and the battles of the civil war from a first hand view. At times it was a bit dry... I've read histories by much better story tellers, but you really have to give some credit for reading the account of someone who was actually there and experienced it."},{"Title":"Destruction and Reconstruction: Personal Experiences of the Late War","review":"Genl Richard Taylor offers his insights of the &quot;late unpleasantness&quot;. Unlike too many other popular civil war personalities who wrote first-hand accounts, Taylor usually avoids the name-calling and back-stabbing others seem to readily participate in. His immediate supervisor, Genl Edmund Kirby Smith,however, doesn't fare too well by Taylor's standards. Taylor holds Smith responsible for failing to allow him the necessary reinforcements needed to route Banks in the Red River Campaign (North Louisiana). Taylor indeed offers a unique perspective, as the son of Zachary Taylor, as well as having served in the Eastern and Western Theaters. A well-bred, highly educated man, Taylor's writing is filled with allusions to Classic Literature and military folk-lore, which is often muddlesome. Also annoying is the lack of ANY maps -a real problem when discussion of the various bayous, rivers and small towns fill page after page. Definately recommended for those of Confederate ilk - especially his remarks on post-war happenings."},{"Title":"All but Impossible!: An Anthology of Locked Room and Impossible Crime Stories by Members of the Mystery Writers of America","review":"This is the first time I read so many short impossible crime stories at one time, and the experience is amazing. As a golden-age mystery lover, how come I didn't try to find this book earlier? ---If you like to challenge your intelligence with that of the masters, this is the right book!"},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"I don't think it's a stretch to say that the vast majority of OOD developers fell prey to the Data Driven Design methodology. While we wrote procedural code that hid intent and everything else that Responsibility Driven Design aims to make explicit, we weren't really doing OOD. While we worked with objects, we weren't object oriented.What's strange about the wording of this book is, the more vague the language, the more you ought to pay attention. It's vague because of its timelessness and universal application, not because they wanted to add pages to the size of the book. However, because of the general scope of much of the advice, you won't fully understand the gravity of its truthfulness until you fail to comply and have to come crawling back. It is the Proverbs of OOD. Remember, this book is the definition of a process; an approach to structuring logic into roles.While some developers never seem to catch on, fast forward a few years in the life of an insightful developer and many of the RDD principles will have already been adopted. Reading this book at a later stage will seem like pure confirmation of all of your mistakes.Using objects does not equal OOD.If you're new to OOD, this book is indispensable and should be read immediately after learning the concept of a type or class. The entire concept can be condensed into a simple statement; if you don't build a society of roles that interact and behave in a \\"moral\\" object neighborhood, you're going to have magic procedural code that is burdened by all of the same complexities, but they will be invisible and your project will fail, not maybe but definitely.Those who don't utilize RDD will dramatically reduce code reusability, conceptual comprehension, process flow validation identification, developer and business agent understanding, modular decoupling, domain context definition, business rule execution, persistence schema flexibility, scaling, parallel programming, separation of concerns, command query separation, and vocabulary purity to name just a few aspects.Without RDD you might as well toss out SOLID and GRASP while you're at it.Domain Driven Design shares many of the SOLID principles of RDD, yet at a higher level, but RDD is perfect for pairing manifest models to domain contexts.DDD (good) = Domain Driven DesignDDD (bad) = Data Driven DesignRDD gives business aware personnel like PM's and higher ups a design vocabulary to understand an implementation while guiding the technical choices of the development team.If you're a developer, and you're having to think of the principles of responsibility, data governance, reusability, testability, scope, ect... while you're in the middle of writing a functional operation, you're doing it wrong, that kind of thinking should have been done before hand.This book is a big \\"duh\\" for those who learned it on their own, but absolutely invaluable for anyone just getting started (it is comparable to warp drive for your marketability), or for those who seem perpetually comfortable slapping behavior on their Table Module or Active Record platform that rules with an iron first over database denormalization and don't seem to realize the tyranny is precisely why the bugs never go away, why features are so hard to add, why people look at each other momentarily before laughing out loud when someone inquires where to find the documentation, or why it's impossible to provide an accurate estimation of work to a curious PM. Resources won't be allocated appropriately, the team will suffer, the inevitable failure of the project will become apparent, you will cry.If you're a PM or Lead or Solutions Architect or currently living, \\"implore\\" the development team to read this book, it is your duty.You don't know OOD or BDD until you know RDD, DDD (good) will have a home, and then the path to TDD will become clear.The single most important question I would ask a job candidate is to explain their sentiments between an approach using DDD (bad) or using RDD. If they don't know what you're talking about, you've been warned. They can name every GoF pattern in the book and recite the basics of OOD, but it won't matter if they are not well versed in RDD.P.S. READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"Overall very good impression, original presentation with sidebar essential quotes. However after a while seems more of the same: how to identify collaborations in an Object Oriented Design. Special note for Chapter 8, where valuable and interesting information is provided regarding exceptions and errors."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"What I like about this book is that it gives you another point of view about object analysis and design. The book is full of tips and examples so it is easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"I am a developer/programmer for a technical software company and my review contains my perception of this book from that perspective. I must also disclose that I am sceptical of any object-oriented design methodology that involves a lot of writing. We are \\"programmers\\", not story writers (read use cases).When I ordered this book a week ago, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book because it sounded so promising. My enthusiasm turned into total disappointment so quickly I couldn't believe myself; I had to give another shot in reading this book to make sure. But I am convinced; the authors managed the impossible task of filling its 390 pages without saying anything substantial about object-oriented design for a professional software developer.The book might be useful for a novice programmer or a manager in terms of defining the object design jargon and process. But other than this, it provides no valuable advice for a professional. These are some of the points that I find ridiculously simplistic and almost idiotic:- In my opinion use cases and CRC cards all boil down to writing on a piece of paper what classes one should use and what these classes should do. This is not methodology, it is common sense. Any sensible developer would write down his/her ideas about the classes involved in an application before starting to program.- Although it is valuable advice to think about class responsibilities, the book states nothing more than the obvious in terms of finding what responsibilities should be assigned to which classes. Statements like \\"Responsibilities come from statements or implications of system behavior found in use cases\\" are tautologies. Where else would they come from!- Or the chapter on Flexibility says things like \\"Find out what you don't know\\". I can't even begin to elaborate on philosophical implications of such advice!Although the book looks appealing to the eye, it has no clear content. It states ideas about classes, responsibilities, etc without a clear structure; and after a while, everything said seems to be a repetition of some earlier statements.If you are serious about object-oriented design as a \\"programmer\\" I recommend these three books:1. Gamma E., et al., Design Patterns.2. James R Rumbaugh, et al., Object-Oriented Modeling and Design. A bit dated, but you will get all you need to know about object oriented design from this book.3. Bjarne Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language (Special 3rd Edition). Never mind it is a C++ book. Chapters on OOD (I think chapters 21-25) will tell you exactly what you need to understand to start programming using OO approach.Do yourself a favor and invest in these books; and ignore all the fab about such trendy books such as the one reviewed above."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"I think I finally have a handle on object modeling-- 'Object Design' deserves a lot of the credit.I have a shelf full of books on UML, uses cases, patterns, and modeling. I spent almost a year struggling through UML, trying to understand the nuances of sequence diagrams versus collaboration diagrams. Meanwhile, I felt no closer to being able to create serviceable object models for my projects.Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and Alan McKean dispense with much of the tedious diagramming one usually associates with object modeling. Instead of charts and relationships, the book focuses on the roles, responsibilities, and behaviors that define an object. If you have ever assembled and managed employee teams, the framework will be very fmailiar. And that's where I found my breakthrough.The book offers a good introduction to object modeling for those new to the area, and a solid reference for those looking to stremline their current methodology. The processes suggested by the authors are simple and flexible. But they are powerful enough to handle even complex designs.One of the strongest pieces of advice in the book is to avoid rushing into UML software--stick with index cards until the design is fairly well developed. That's what got me out of a morass of charts and diagrams that looked nice, but did relatively little. I'd paraphrase the book's theme as &quot;Forget the formalism and focus on your application's responsibilities, and how those responsibilities can be allocated among cohesive, well-organized team players.:The book is language neutral--it's focus is design, rather than programming. The design methodology taught in the book should be easily adaptable to nearly any object-oriented programming language.I have no hesitation recommending Object Design to novice and intermediate object modelers. I rate is as the best book I have read on the design and modeling of object-oriented systems."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"I purchased this book a week ago, and am enjoying it immensely. Thisis NOT a book by authors that rapidly churn out multiple books, and itis NOT a book to be read quickly. It's clear that a lot of thoughthas gone into every page and every sentence, and that you need toreflect and compare with your own professional programming experience.Despite the huge amount of information, I'm finding the book veryreadable. The authors make a living consulting on architecture anddesign, and know how to communicate.There are some code examples in java, but the book is really languageneutral. The java code uses features that are available in all objectoriented languages, and can really be considered to be illustrativepseudo code. This book is written for software architects, and coderswho are looking to advance to higher levels of design responsibility.A nice touch that I appreciated was the short summarizing side barssprinkled throughout the text. If you want to quickly evaluate whetherthis book is for you are not, just pick up the book and read thesidebars from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"I've always believed the best approach to object-oriented design is Responsibility Driven Design (RDD), and this is the best book on the subject-written by the inventor of RDD.I recently showed Mike Rosen, of Cutter Consortium, Object Design. Before I could say it had great chapters on RDD plus work on design for reliability and flexibility plus pages of references to related books and papers, he said 'Great! This will be my next book purchase'.So, why is Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations (OD) a really great book? These folks have years of design consulting and teaching experience, know what they are talking about, and are good at telling the story.OD is a great read from cover to cover. Their two-chapter review of object design concepts was energetic, insightful, and comprehensive. From the beginning they are mixing in CRC cards (Thanks Kent, Ward!), architecture styles, patterns, and stereotypes into the discussion. This is the place to start for novices and intermediate students, and professionals now have the definitive reference book on object oriented design.The authors understand we all have different learning styles. Along with their conversation, the first two chapters also illustrate concepts and examples with over 20 figures, a couple of UML diagrams, three (short) Java code blocks, and eight CRC card drawings. Concrete examples are provided throughout the book, from computer speech to finance and telecommunications.The Chapter titles are: 1 Design Concepts, 2 Responsibility Driven Design, 3 Finding Objects, 4 Responsibilities, 5 Collaborations, 6 Control Style, 7 Describing Collaborations, 8 Reliable Collaborations, 9 Flexibility, and 10 On Design. Each chapter includes a summary. The recommendations for further reading provide a guided tour of related works in software engineering, design, and general literature.The authors share how they think about the critical areas of design for flexibility and reliability. So how do you build reliable systems? What are some experience-based guidelines for dealing with error conditions? What about all those exceptions anyway?! The chapter on flexibility is for me the heart of object technology. They show how you can apply object technology to give users control over their world. The analysis of hot spots or flex points guides the focused introduction of added flexibility. Then you can actually deliver on the promise of object oriented software.Practitioners will find this book \\"spot on\\" for the treatment of UML and Patterns. So, yes, with three or more UML books on the shelf, I am sure you can draw all those diagrams - right? With OD you are learning to think in objects and to communicate your story. Your learning how to tell your story with UML, what to say visually and what not to say. OD is a pretty good source for UML notation guidance too, as the text and the diagrams are meticulously accurate, down to the arrow head styles. OD provides a good introduction to patterns and weaves a number of the more interesting GOF patterns into the design examples. Patterns are also emphasized in the chapter on flexibility.Paraphrasing Ivar Jacobson's words from the forward: &quot;this higher-level view of design, which focuses on responsibilities...helps you step away from implementation details and focus on what the appropriate software machinery should be...&quot; In closing he writes: &quot;Whether you are new to object technology or an experienced developer, this book is a rich source of practical advice.\\"These common sense lessons are essential for practitioners of design and systems architecting in all fields."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"Wirfs-Brock and McKean have written an oustanding introductory book on object-oriented design. This is definitely a book for beginning OO programmers, the ones who aren't sure how to assign functions to objects and who aren't ready for design patterns yet. More experienced developers won't get much out of it, but that's OK. Every level needs its own reference books.The book's layout and illustrations present its content well. UML diagrams, for example, use one color and typeface for the actual UML notation. The same diagrams use a different color and typeface for notes that explain the UML. Unlike other books, there's no confusion about which is the tool and which describes the tool. The text is gentle and reasonably jargon-free, but I think it over-does the friendliness in places. In discussing a program's normal and exception handling behavior, the term \\"happy path\\" described the execution in the absence of errors. The term may be evocative, but is just a bit hard to take seriously.The sequence of topics makes good sense. It starts with the idea of a \\"responsibility,\\" the basic unit of application logic. The authors develop this into strategies for defining objects, defining relationships between objects, and defining the control strategies that implement those relationships. They continue on through error handling (reliability) and extensibility - handling of future features. Throughout, the authors keep a moderate, pragmatic tone, free of name-brand methodology. That's a good thing, since the real focus is on basic skills and decision criteria.One aspect of this book is just a little confusing. It's definitely aimed at educating a new OO designer, but it doesn't lay out its educational objectives or plan very clearly. It certainly lacks the didactic rigor of a textbook. It would make a good supplementary text, though, and it might be very helpful to a novice working with more experienced developers. Best of all, it refers to additional texts (including Strunk and White!) that will help claify the programs as well as communication with other members of the programming team.This book is great for anyone starting OO design on their own. It's also good for classroom students who just aren't getting it from their regular instructor and text. Experienced developers won't find much new here, except very clear descriptions of how much error handling or flexibility is enough.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"I have to agree with some earlier reviews on this book.1. Very Good Text on Object Design,2. A great first text on OO design,3. Total Disappointment for ProgrammersThis is a great book on Object Oriented Design, but ONLY for novice and intermediate object modelers. It is not for an experienced developer who already knows how to use some of the design patterns in Gang of Four book.If we use an analogy to compare this two books, if Gang of Four Design Pattern book is for post graduate students, Object Design is for the student in the second year of the university.I want to read more on Object Oriented development so I started to read this book, mainly attracted by its cover. Domain Driven Design by Eric Avans falls into the same category but offers much more exercise for your brain.Hope this is helpful. I have 10+ years in software development, 7+ years in Java, understand OO and Domain Driven Design.5 Star Book for a beginner."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"This is an excellent book written in a style reflective of the extensive consulting and training experience of it's authors.It offers the reader a substantial mental framework with which to think and reason about the system you are designing, how to cast that system in terms of objects and how to use some very practical tools to help you create and refine your design concept.Instead of dogmatically stating &quot;this is the (only) way you do x&quot;, it helps you to understand the variety of possible approaches to problems - such as deciding what is the best control style for a system and gives you tools to help decide the best approach. It also acknowledges that design is very much a team activity and gives you ways to facilitate communicating the design story effectively amongst team members.Although the book is very compatible with the use case methods and uml, it transcends these tools to include some unique and powerful ways of thinking about your object design.Above all, although it covers some powerful methods, it is very easy to read and apply. I attribute this to the extensive teaching experience of the authors.I highly recommend this book whether you are a system architect, a program designer or a coder of algorithms."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"Generally excellent language and flow. The book manages to bob nicely at a readable level, ducking deep when necessary for some details, and popping back up for abstract concepts at appropriate times. Throughout, it's filled with reasonable examples about how to really design systems. The examples are nicely balanced between being trivial and too complex. They get a lot of richness out of the analysis without burying the reader in domain-specific details.What they present seems to be compatible with most development processes. It's highly tunable to the level of 'agility' you're looking for, even from component to component.One downside is that it only talks about the dangers of over-engineering when it gets to the flexibility chapter (late in the book). It would've been nice to see this earlier, particularly when talking about identifying candidates. Also, the discussion of flexibility also ignore versioning. I don't know anybody who owns something they can just change as they please, and it would've been nice to have a framework for the kinds of things you can expect to be able to change in subsequent architecture versions and the kinds of decisions that you're making and won't be able to change without major system incompatibilities.Finally, the chapter that used UML said something like &quot;we're not going to introduce UML&quot; and then spewed UML at me for twenty pages, gently lulling me towards sleep. It killed the otherwise stellar pace that the book had going for it, but immediately recovered after that."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"The authors provides a good introduction to object oriented analysis and design. Some may find that the content is too wishy washy with seemingly vague advice in many areas. The responsibility driven approach along with object stereotypes are indeed a good way to approach OO design however. The concept of object neighborhood and control style are also worthy of praise.If the reader persists they'll be rewarded with a good understanding of why OO design is needed. There are nuggets of wisdom throughout the book, however many sections seem to be hastily done and glossed over. Too many times the authors resort to bullet listings to explain concepts. That may be acceptable in today's power point age but its not acceptable for a technical book. Reading lists after lists of advice is not a good way to learn and retain concepts."},{"Title":"Object Design: Roles, Responsibilities, and Collaborations","review":"This well-written and very readable book gives an excellent overview of object-oriented design. It takes a very pragmatic and human-centred approach that is fresh and enjoyable to read.

The heroine Tanis is a ray of giving warmth and optimism in the somewhat bleak life of Giles, a divorced QC in danger of losing access to his young children. Tanis's rather notorious past history also means that Giles must make a tough decision about his future ambitions.(Which could be interpreted as Tanis getting her revenge after all...but that's really going too deep.) Unashamedly both Giles and Tanis gain a lot from being together and it is poignant as they drift apart. Thank goodness the parameters of the genre mean that a HEA is compulsory.

Bah Humbug!"},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"I just finished the audiobook of Desert Gold, and I still don't know whether I like Zane Grey's writing. This Tantor edition is read by John Bolen, who takes the prize as the worst audiobook reader I've heard. He has no concept of phrasing or inflection. Have you ever learned a foreign language well enough to understand speech, but not to the point that you start thinking in that language? That's how this audiobook feels. Every sentence is read so obtusely that you have to mentally correct the pauses and the rise and fall of the voice into something that makes sense in English before you're ready to take in the next sentence.At first I thought he might be sight-reading the book, never having rehearsed it. But I read books to my kids without rehearsing - pretty much every parent has - and I never sounded like this guy. And he must have read it in advance, because he has different voices for each character. He must have planned that after reading the book. And what voices! Embarrassingly stupid parodies of human speech. I would suggest that someone teach Mr. Bolen that a reader need not try to play a dozen parts of a play - just read the book. But then we'd still have Mr. Bolen, and he simply can't be trusted to read aloud, regardless of the voice he's trying to employ.I listen to audiobooks because they make a long commute and service calls enjoyable. This was an exception. It was a study in how a reader can get every word right and every sentence wrong. I finished it, because I'm stubborn that way, but I found myself listening to furniture store ads on the radio, procrastinating my return to the book.If you find this Tantor edition in a library, as I did, check it out, but check out another book at the same time as a backup. Then you can listen to a little of Mr. Bolen and marvel at how a reader like that got a job recording for a major audio publisher. Then switch books.I might check out a Zane Grey book in print - maybe even Desert Gold - and see if I like it."},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"Great story. I found myself hesitant to pick this book up and reluctant to put it down. I haven't been a big reader of westerns, but I have been wanting to do some historical reading. 'Desert Gold' interested me because it was a western that covered the times that it was published in: 1913.The characters are just good people surviving a harsh environment, protecting whatever and whoever they can. It took me a while to get my mind adjusted to Zane Grey's style of writing, but I really enjoyed everything about it. This is a unpretentious story of finding root, pursuit, escape and survival and it provides a medium for Zane Grey to get philosophical on us during long dusty nights in the desert. Although it may have bogged down a little, I liked the philosophical. Always have. The book has a satisfying ending even if it did finish a little cleaner than it was set up to do.I read this in the 1964 paperback edition, but it would be great in audio!"},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"Desert Gold is a great read and quickly gets you involved with the story. Zane Grey is simply a treasure and prolific author. This book contains a little big of romance, adventure and takes us back to a time before television and telephones."},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"I love reading Zane Grey but this is one I had never read before. Great style. Also, great price!! I believe it was just $1."},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"Desert Gold, this edition based on the original published in 1913 is an excellent book, but not an extraordinary one, as is the unexpurgated version based on Zane Grey's hollographic manuscript and published as Shower of Gold. All I will say is: If you can't buy the the \\"new\\" one this one will most certainly do, as it has everything Zane Grey is noted for--breathtaking landscape descriptions; vibrant characters, including one of his greatest of Indian heroes, romance, intrigue, and mystery, all set in the newspaper headlines of the day. You can't ask for anything better than that."},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"Of course anything written by Zane Grey is worth reading so I downloaded 'Desert Gold' to my Kindle. The thing is it's one of those westerns that makes you wish you could have been there. The first story finds a man brooding over the love of his life from whom he has been separated by circumstance when he is joined at his campfire by an old man and his donkey. The cowboy is mystified by the talk and actions of this old man who insists on traveling together. The climax of the story is a surprise that will confound you.The second story is about a young man who leaves home in the city to make his fortune in the wild west. He runs into a former classmate on his travels and together the two of them are in and out of trouble often. There are of course, two lovely women, one a mexican princess, the other a born & bred Westerner. You will enjoy this tale of the old west even if you've never read a western before."},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"This is one of the better western novels that I have read.

I would recommend this as one of the better Zane Grey novels."},{"Title":"Desert Gold","review":"This was a very good book at times I got lost,sometimes his writing did not have a lot of explanation so it was hard to follow.

He claims to have studied the Arab-Israeli conflict intensively for 9 years, but that's not what this book is about, and the problems between blacks and Jews have very little to do with that part of the world."},{"Title":"Strangers in the Land : Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America","review":"A Critical Response to Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust AmericaSince I began intensively studying the Israel-Palestine conflict nine years ago, I have (as a Jew) also been concerned with its historical and current effect on relations among blacks and Jews in this country. These relations have reflected the influence that neoconservatism, originating primarily among Jewish intellectuals, has had on mainstream (liberal) Jewish institutional life and political culture in America, and the manner in which Jewish-identified aspects of neoconservatism (opposition to affirmative action, support for Israel, an obsession with alleged anti-Semitism and now \\"Islamo-fascism\\") have been adopted by a broader culture of white racism and class privilege, with obvious dire effects both domestically and globally. What began as one aspect of the white ethnic intellectual backlash in the 1960s has evolved, been appropriated, and become central to the domestically ruthless and globally violent ideology of the current administration, with a concurrent black-Jewish subplot that has been much discussed but not adequately understood.It is in this context that I was intrigued to discover a massive 527-page work of scholarship called Strangers in the Land: Blacks, Jews, Post-Holocaust America by UCLA English professor Eric Sundquist (Belknap-Harvard, 2005). Upon obtaining this book, however, I was quickly disappointed to find-in spite of many insightful analyses of literary works-a clear unwillingness to seriously engage the central issues noted above. While I will leave it to others to judge whether Strangers in the Land succeeds as a work of cultural/literary criticism, I would suggest that it is an utter and insidious failure of political criticism. Moreover, I think that it is as a work of political criticism that it will be (and should be) primarily received. As such, this book stands as an apology for neoconservatism and its support for white privilege in America, as well as its support for the Zionist project in all its aggressive criminality, now coming to a head as any possibility of viable Palestinian state is being destroyed. In this context, Sundquist shows a marked lack of compassion for the dire plight of the Palestinian people, and-given his obviously considerable scholarly skills-demonstrates a seemingly willful innocence of the implications of historical scholarship, human rights reports, and diplomatic records now freely available, most recently summarized by Norman Finkelstein.In summary, Sundquist views neoconservatism as rather benignly emanating in the 1960s from liberal Jewish intellectuals understandably caught amongst a dedication to the meritocracy, Jewish group interests, and the threatening demands of what he sees as anti-Zionist and incipiently anti-Semitic advocates of Black Power. Sundquist reduces Black Nationalist, Black Power, Pan-African, and Third World Liberation movements, and specifically the leadership of Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, to demagogic, venal, anti-Semitic opportunism and bigotry. Sundquist adopts a boilerplate Zionist narrative of the history of Palestine and Israel that would not pass muster in any college classroom worth its name, which romanticizes Israelis and denigrates Palestinians. While maintaining a scholarly tone and engaging in prodigious amounts of research, Sundquist ultimately refuses to seriously engage the critical scholarship which he references, from the work on Jewish whiteness of his UCLA colleague Karen Brodkin, to Manning Marable's careful scholarship on African-American political movements, to the new Israeli historians, and to Edward Said and Rashid Khalidi.All this is done in the framework of a purportedly unbiased treatment of Black-Jewish relations. But two examples will be quoted of Sundquist's peculiarly jaundiced notion of \\"balance\\" in his treatment of black-Jewish and Israeli-Palestinian issues:\\"(Meir) Kahane's views were all the more remarkable for being borrowed from the same black nationalism the JDL (Jewish Defense League) meant to oppose. The paperback jacket of Kahane's \\"Never Again!,\\" an exposition of JDL militancy, rightly compared the book to Cleaver's \\"Soul on Ice\\" and \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X.\\" The JDL's symbol, a clenched fist issuing from a Star of David, mirrored the clenched fist of Black Power. Consciously styling themselves \\"Jewish Panthers,\\" members undertook armed community patrols...Underscoring the parallel, Kahane declared that the JDL did not differ from the Panthers in wanting to instill self-assurance and pride in young people...\\" In the face of Black Power's demand that Jews acquiesce to policies inimical to their own interests, and wary of their precarious position in a nation still for the most part ruled by a Protestant elite, many Jews may well have felt hemmed in by the \\"politics of powerlessness.\\" \\"(p. 357-59)This passage is reflective of Sundquist's tone throughout the relevant sections of the book: blacks threaten innocent Jews, who do not partake in the racism of other whites, and just want a \\"color-blind\\" society based on merit. Some Jews understandably react negatively to black betrayal. Black Power-the basis of this betrayal-was an insidious force sui generis, and a corruption of Martin Luther King's movement which was supported by most Jews. Some Jews have of course over-reacted. But Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X are to be equated (or worse) to Meir Kahane, and Kahane was simply reacting to their provocations. These black leaders-viewed by Sundquist as stereotypes of threatening black males rather than evolving socialist revolutionary political leaders, are more deserving of harsh criticism and dismissal than someone who immigrated to Israel to lead the most vicious and openly racist aspect of the Jewish settler movement.\\"Whether or not the massacre (at Deir Yassin in April, 1948, during which Zionist forces led by Menachem Begin killed 100 Palestinian villagers, including old men, women, and children) was intended-at least some dimension of it, such as killing all the men of the village apparently had been discussed-remains a vexed question. ...Whatever the explanation for the killings at Deir Yassin, there is little doubt that the Palestinian Jews, soon to be Israelis, used the threat of other Deir Yassins, coupled with less fearsome raids on individual villages, as psychological warfare. If the killings led to wild rumors about Jewish determination to exterminate Arabs, however, such rumors were made credible less because of the way Jews conceived of the war than because of the way a number of Arabs did. Ahmed Shukeiry, aide to the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, envisioned \\"the elimination of the Jewish state,\\" while Abd al-Rahman Azzam Pasha, the secretary general of the Arab League, looked forward to \\"a war of extermination and momentous massacre\\" and declared that \\"it does not matter how many (Jews) there are. We will sweep them into the sea.\\" Joined with other factors-the early flight of the wealthy elite, Arab calls for women and children to evacuate, and the dissolution of Palestinian military leadership-fears that Israelis were bent on waging such a war, a mirror image of the declarations of Arab leaders, were a decisive factor in the momentous outflow of Arab refugees in the months to come. Responding to concerted attacks by five Arab nations bent on destroying the Jewish state, Israel captured some 30 percent more territory than it had been granted by the United Nations. With the exodus of the Arabs, a Jewish majority was created. So too, the \\"Palestinian problem,\\" the approximately 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in Palestine, most expecting to return after Arab nations had driven out the Jews ... \\" (p. 374-375)This virtually propagandistic obfuscation is typical of Sundquist's treatment of Israel and Palestine throughout his historical account, from 1948 to 1967 to 1973, with Israel's survival always assumed to be at stake from hateful Arab nations. The most significant and brutal Jewish massacre of Arabs is buried in a sea of equivocation (including a veiled reference to the myth of \\"Arab broadcasts\\") in a selective and distorted historical context-without regard, for example, to what is now known about Zionist plans for transfer (carried out before and after Deir Yassin), collusion between Zionist leaders and the leader of Trans-Jordan (Emir Abdullah) to prevent the formation of a Palestinian state, or the tepidness of Arab intervention, arguably not a serious threat to the nascent but already well-armed Jewish state. Again, in spite of the Sundquist's references to new Israeli historians like Avi Shlaim and to Rashid Khalidi, he seems unwilling to seriously address the implications of what is now conventional scholarly wisdom, which well explains the ongoing destruction of Palestinian national aspirations.In his narrative context, both American and Israeli Jews-including the worst sorts of neoconservatives and Likudniks (although not always clearly distinguishable from liberals and Laborites)-maintain an essential innocence and humanity; black Americans and Palestinians, on the other hand, are seen as easily manipulated by the demagogic appeals of their leaders, who ultimately undermine whatever legitimate aspirations their followers might have, which can best be served (according to Sundquist) by traditional liberal activism (as defined by Jews). In tracing what he sees as the nave and unwarranted affinity of black nationalists for the Palestinian cause, Sundquist casts aspersions on third world liberation movements as antithetical to the centrist, domestic liberalism with which he, and in his view most Jews, rightly identify. African-Americans, according to Sundquist, have been betrayed by their leaders, whose criticism of Jews is self-serving and impractical at best, and anti-Semitic and violent at worst. Ultimately, Sundquist collapses James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Stokely Carmichael onto Louis Farrakhan, Leonard Jeffries, and Tony Martin.At bottom, Strangers in the Land fails as a work of political criticism not only due to a careless rendering of reality in the Middle East, but due to an unwillingness to entertain the notion of a peculiarly Jewish intellectual and ideological contribution to white racism and the maintenance of white privilege in this country, including the projection of racist attitudes onto the Israel-Palestine conflict, and onto western relations with the Arab and Muslim worlds. While the notion of Jewish racism is absent from this book (as if the experience of discrimination and the Holocaust makes such a thing unthinkable and impossible), an indigenous anti-Semitism is assumed to be long-standing, central, and substantial in African-American culture. Sundquist has thus written a book that accepts the basic assumptions of neoconservative ideology, with all of the racist baggage that that implies at home and abroad. In these narrative confines, there is no objective place to stand from which to understand the peculiarly Jewish-American contribution to this ideology, and to propose a new interpretation of Black-Jewish relations based at least partly on Jewish self-criticism, including criticism of what has turned out to be a morally and politically disastrous Jewish state."},{"Title":"The Law of One, Book Three : By Ra an Humble Messenger (Bk. 3)","review":"If you are as I am, a seeker of the love and the light of The One Infinite Creator, if you are Israel (a seeker of God) desiring inner guidance and a clearer understanding of both the purpose of incarnation and a clearer awareness of your self in relation to other-selfs then this series is for you.

The book takes 568 pages and 27 chapters to convey material that could be reduced to perhaps 300 pages and 15 chapters (that is generous).My critique as an instructor is the poor citing of sources, and the poor choice of sources in many instances (such as \\"Redbook\\" magazine and a variety of self-help books). I have not encountered ONE journal article cited. There are also some pretty wild claims without basis, such as generalizations of Americans as independent thinkers who would not go along with a corrupt authority figure as Germans did in the past (I used Milgram's \\"Obedience\\" studies to refute that).It does read easily, however, for the students and it has some good ideas for conversation starters.

For instance, Luvox (Fluvoxamine) usually helps compulsive gamblers (p. 459). The Water Pik is said to be the best adjunct to regular and prolonged tooth brushing (p. 371).Every topic in this book has its own author.

He writes candidly about the period when he was experimenting with meditation and having a live-in relationship. This discussion is crucial. Later he moves to India. He lives with Ratnaji of Ramana ashram. He learns all about Hindusim from Ratnaji. A interesting episode is how he goes back to America just to repair a tape recorder so that his guru can record Bhagavatam classes. He returns at once. His pligrimage in North gives a good understanding about human nature. He discusses about puja to Guru and it effects. The book's end discusses how he came to AMMA and took her as guru.

This book has everything a fantasy lover could want; elves, dragons, half-elves, 3 systems of magic, evil empires, and ancient prophecies. This book also has all the hallmarks of classic literature, such as characters you can empasize with, romance, betrayal, and a host of other elements. As a fantasy book, it stands without peer."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"It took me a total of 5 hours to read this book. That is how engrossed I was in the story line!! It has wonderful magics and a world that draws you into the story line as surely as if you were Lashana. The world of magic and mystical creatures has always been a fascination for me and this book certainly left no disappointment!!"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"this is one of my favorite books and i've read alot.Basically Shana a halfblood(wizard)becomes the fabled elvenbane.Raised by dragons and cast out she discovers the wizards lair and begins a war against the evil elves. If anyone nows where to get the third book(Elvenborn)E-mail me at elvenwizard23@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"The Elvenbane (1991) is the first novel in the Halfblood Chronicles. The Elves are aliens from elsewhere. They are long-lived and have great magics and, long ago, they conquered Earth. Now the humans wear slave collars and take orders from Elven overseers. The Elves and humans can interbreed; the resulting child usually has Elven magic and the mind powers of the humans. These halfblood Wizards are reluctant to obey the Elven Lords and eventually rebelled in the Wizard's War. Ever since, it has been a killing offense for a human to become pregnant by an Elf.The Elves and humans unknowingly share the planet with the dragons, who came during the Wizard's War. Dragons are shapeshifters and their shamans have the power of mind speaking and reading the thoughts of others. They can also play with the lightning and create gates between worlds. The dragons despise the Elven Lords and cause confusion and anger whenever they can. One of their favorite ploys is to spread the prophecy of the Elvenbane, a halfblood who will free the human from Elven tyranny.In this novel, Alamarana is a shaman and pregnant. She is traveling across the world, shifting her shape and becoming one with the planet. For a while, she impersonates an Elven maid and leads an Elven Lord into a marriage agreement just before she vanishes from his manor. Then, as she is meditating in a body of stone, a human slave, also pregnant, literally stumbles across her. Serina Daeth had been the chief concubine of Lord Dyran, but another concubine managed to make Serina fertile with the Elven Lord and so now she is fleeing for her life.Alara almost abandons Serina in the desert, but decides to help deliver the child. When the mother bleeds to death, Alara takes the girl child home with her. Seeing the baby, all the dragons of her lair start to argue and complain. The infant is too noisy, she is too smelly, and she is ugly, but Alara is determined to keep the child. Moments later, she goes into contractions herself.Alara's son, Keman, thinks the infant is kind of cute. He is the type of dragon child who brings pets home with him and the human baby looks to be another pet, yet so small and feeble. When his mother goes into labor, Keman takes the child home and puts her in the pen with Hoppy, his three-legged two-horn, who soon includes the human in her nursing brood.Keman names the baby Lashana, which is \\"orphan\\" in Elvish, but since she is so little, he shortens the name to Shana. Since his mother is very busy with his baby sister, Keman takes over the care of this little human. He makes her a shift of his own shed skin to protect her tender skin. He starts teaching her to talk, refusing to just speak mind-to-mind. He soon learns how hard work there is in being a mother.This novel is about family, fate, and freedom. As with most of both authors' stories, this tales features characters who persevere in their struggle against hardship and injustice. Moreover, it contains alien characters who defy there own kind to help win the struggle.Recommended for Norton and Lackey fans and anyone else who enjoys tales of strange powers, friendly dragons and righteous conflict."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"Before reading this evew, please take into account the fact that I am slightly prejudiced; this is my favorite book of all time. The thing I love about this book is the way it destroys stereotypes. In this book, elves are evil beings, humans are stupid, and dragons are either lazy or terified of being discovered. There are no people fighting all that is bad in the world because they want to, instead they tend to run away as fast as possible. When you have been reading this book for sometime, and hen put it dow, prepare to take 10 to 15 minutes in order to readjust to reality. A few people I have lent this to have also experienced this, so It's not just MY overactive imagination. There are some minor problems. By about half-way through the book, the alliances of all the main characters are clear, so it's fairly obvious what will happen in the end (although the details are surprising). The book also leaves someting of a cliff-hanger, remedied by the sequel, Elvenblood (although this too has an ambigous ending). In all, if you like realistic, gritty, and above all well-written ficton, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"Escapist fantasy at its best! &quot;Elvenbane&quot; is a wonderful ride, well-written and absorbing. You're swept up at once in the world of the story, and carried along relentlessly to its end. This is a page-turner in the best sense -- you always want to know what happens next!As others have said, the real fun of this book is the way it turns our expectations on their head. It takes a fairly standard fantasy set-up -- a prophesy foretells that one of the despised and hunted half-bloods will become the savior of humankind -- and quickly subverts it. Nothing is as it seems. As soon as we think we're safe in a standard fantasy cliche (such as the wise and kindly dragons who take in the orphaned child, or the half-blooded wizards in their hidden fortress in the forest who will become the heart of the fight against the elves) -- boom! It evolves (or perhaps I should say devolves) into something else entirely. There are no pure and good-hearted heros in this book. These characters are real people -- grumpy, bad-tempered, and petty, as well as kind-hearted and brave. Even Shana, the main character, has a sharp temper and a tendacy towards self-centeredness (in my opinion, anyway). These flaws make the characters more realistic; I cared about Shana and her foster-brother Keman, and I wanted them to win.As for the reason why I gave this book four stars instead of five? Norton and Lackey spend so much time establishing their world and characters, that by the time the action picks up, they've run out of room! The ending felt greatly rushed to me. It's true that the end brought no real surprises, but the fun is in seeing the story play out, and I felt a little cheated by all the scenes I felt were missing. Valyn's sacrifice in particular lacked the emotional impact I felt it should have -- simply because he hadn't been around long enough for me to care that much about him! I realize that, at 560 pages, this book is already quite long, but if as much attention had been paid to fleshing out the ending as was paid to the beginning and middle, it would have been perfect.But, even so, I greatly enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to anyone. It gives you what all fantasy readers want -- a story you can lose yourself in."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"In The Elven Bane, Shana (Lashana) is born to a human of an elf lord in a time when people are considered slaves and elves rule all. Shana's mother dies out on the desert and a wandering dragon who is about to have a baby finds her and helps her give birth in the guise of a nurse woman near a place of refuge. Alara (the dragon who helps to birth Shana) takes the newborn human child and raises her with her own son Keman. Shana is Keman's &quot;pet&quot; but instead of being treated as an animal a marvelous relation forms between them.A great book for me and others I would highly recomend The Elven Bane to all readers whither they like fantasy or not (its a great opening book to those who don't know what to read next)."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"I read this book last year and could NOT put it down...Literally. I'd go to classes in school and constantly get it taken away for reading it in class! For some reason, it took me a long while to read this book. But after I did, I was so happy with it that it wasn't even funny. I wanted to read it over and over again. I think this book was very excellent and made me wish I was Shana, the girl with a telekenesis-type power. Shana was the daughter of a concubine of Lord Dyran, who was an elven Lord. He got the concubine pregnate and, since the child would be a forbidden half-blood, the concubine ran away. She got stranded in the desert and a &quot;shiftshaper&quot; dragon came across her as the concubine was giving birth to the half-blood child. The woman giving birth dies and the dragon, Alara, takes in the child to raise it with her own. The half-blood is raised by dragons and creates a controversey within the dragon's lair upon raising a &quot;human&quot; with none other than it's own. A lot happens from there on. It is too odd &amp; difficult for me to explain. Therefor, I'll leave it up to all of you to be smart and read the book.;)"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This book is absoulutly amazing! For anyone who likes magic and dragons, this is definatly the book for you. Basically, the story is about these elves that have taken over a human world. The elves have magic but the humans don't so the elves rule over everyone. As time passes, there are human and elf couples who have children creating a half-breed of humans that do have magic and can fight back. You may ask where the dragons fit in. Well, the dragons remain in hiding because of their fear of being hunted but since they can shape shift, they often go and stir up trouble in the elven community. Anyone will love this book because it contains everything a good book should."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This book was simply incredible. What a spectacular job Mercedes and Andre do of creating such emotion into words on a paper. The very thought of that book fills me with swelling anticipation of how good a fantasy really can be. To me it created an entirely new world, something that was so real I can picture it with ease. If you really want to experience a fantasy filled with every kind of emotion, from dizzying romance, to boiling hatred, you have found it."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This book was very well written and exciting. Took my imagination to new arenas. One of the few series that I have re-read. I'd recommend it for anyone that enjoys intellectual stimulation with their fantasy."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"Most foster children have foster parents of the same species, but in this fantasy a young girl, Shana, half human half elf, is brought up by the fabled creatures, dragons. She is brought up with beliefs of dragon kin and dragon ways. Shana is exiled from the saftey and comfort of her own home and from her loving foster brother Keman. Because of a power she could not control, she is forced from her way of life. Shana meets humans for the first time. She is awkwardly placed in an Elven city and knows not the customs of human or elf. Shana is forced to forget everything she has learned since birth and realizes the real world. This story shows how one person can overcome any obstacle with the faith of friends, or in this case, dreaded dragons. In Elvenbane, it is mostly towards science fictional and fantasy readers."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"The story moves along without being overly predictable with interesting characters and a fascinating background world. The writing enables the reader to clearly understand the political climate in all the races: dragon, elven, human, and half-blood. I was very impressed by how quickly I was able to comprehend this new world, which I believe is due to the great story-telling abilities of the authors. My only complaint is that I NEVER in all my LIFE had to READ as many ITALICIZED words per PAGE as in this book. I felt that it distracted from what was a wonderful story with the overly dramatic intrusions of way too many emphasized words. Please don't let that stop you from reading this book though!"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"I read alot of books and this one caught my eye.It's vivid and exciting and all together one of the best books I've read.

Despite what any other reviewee may say, the book is wonderfully written. Unicorns, until recently, were portrayed in mythology as violent, stupid, and yet, beautiful. That is how it is in the book.

C'mon Mr. Norton and Mrs. Lackey, WHERE'S THE ENDING? Brad Heinle"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"I really loved this book. The ending was not quite as happy as I thought it would be, but the book was still excellent. I recommend any of Lackey's books she is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"I started reading this book after finishing Terry Brooks Voyage of the Jerle Shannara: Antrax. I was a victim of Hurricane Wilma which put out my power for almost 2 weeks and reading was all I had.I don't give this book a perfect 5 because there are a few problems. For one, Norton and Lackey made elves the bad guys in this. They made elves into despotic slave-driving being who conquered the human world after leaving their home world. They destroyed their home world by using their magic to mess up the environment in their world and they are doing the same in this. If I were either Norton or Lackey, I'd have made the bad guys dark elves. In most other stories, elves were good beings trhat coexisted with their environment and didn't try to interfere with the natural orders.Another problem I found with this book was that it went against what I have been taught about writing fiction. Too much detail was put into the story. Much of the wordy details were completely irrelevant to the story.But the story I liked. The main character Shana is a very likable character. She was the halfblood child of an elven lord named Dyran and one of his human concubines. We watch her being born in the desert then get adopted by a dragon named Alara. Alara takes Shana back to her lair and gives her to her son Keman. Keman gave Shana her name and treated her like a pet then later like a sister. Shana grows up with the dragons until the age of twelve then is exiled from the Lair. There is a lot more to the story which I can't get into. But this story flows well. I give this 4 stars"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This book is a masterpiece of simplicity. The basic story is full of emotion, and unlike all the new writers who get paid by the word, this one cuts in words in such a way you don't have to look at the dictionary every third word or so and yet it doesn't lessen the story one bit, on the contrary, it makes it more enjoyable and easier to read! The two witers used very basic elements in this story, dragons elvens and humans, but the mix is quite new and very interesting, in fact their world is very diffrent from the Forgatten Realms/ DnD, so you will finish the book saying &quot;this IS a fantasy book but I've never read a fantasy book that resemble it.&quot;The reason this book gets 4 stars and not 5 is that although the story is diffrent it is quite predictable (some people like it better though), and although the world they created is diffrent the book in general is not thought-provoking (althoug in general fantasy books are not thought- provoking), and the characters could have been more complex (that DOES resemble old Forgatten Realms books)."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"While this story is nothing new [the dragons-are-good-elves-are-evil take isn't as unique as some might think], and the characters aren't anyway near worthy of a 5-star, it is entertaining in the best tradition of what I like to call Bad Fantasy [basically, anything that takes place in a magical fantasy world with nothing to set it far apart from other fantasy].Shana has red hair, unusually strong magical powers, and is destined to save the world. Good grief, can we get a little more conformist? How about some brown-haired, brown-eyed heroines who have no magic [a la Keladry, who would be wonderful had she a bit more personality. But then, I still need to read Squire] and no prophecies, and no magical sidekicks? Yeesh. When I say I don't like the characterization . . . well, this just doesn't do much for me. \\"The Sparrow\\" is more to my taste in that regard. Shana's just sort of there, as are all the rest; the most we get are shallow skimmings of conciousness.The dragons just get on my nerves after a while. And I'm not sure why so much of the book was devoted to Serina--she could have just as easily been left out, or detailed in a previous book, or whatever. Well, maybe she enriched the story for some people.On the positive side . . . this story is fairly etertaining, and I managed to read it over a period of two or three days [interrupted by school and such] without becoming bored.Conclusion: typical, hackneyed, trite, but you won't fall asleep."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"Every elf a psychopath, dragons and humans with magical power. Humanity downtrodden, enslaved, clawing to be a better slave.Somebody's dream world. Or Iraq under Saddam Hussein.Haven't quite analyzed it through yet.Definitely an escape novel.

This is my favorite book, and thats saying something."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This was the very first fantasy book that I read. My friend loaned it to me when I was a young kid and I have not read anything exactly like it since. Maybe I was just in awe that I could be transported into another world and share someone elses trajedies and triumphs. I laughed with her and I cried with her. I will always have a special place in my heart for this book by the greatest of authors. The writing is so outstanding that you really lose yourself while you are frantically reading the pages wanting to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This book starts off with a very entertaining premise, and though I am far from a Mercedes Lackey fan, I was willing to give the Norton/Lackey team the benefit of the doubt and have a look. For a time, I was not disappointed (if not actively inspired) and was ready to log this away as another blandly fun fantasy romp.The trouble, however, starts to emerge at about the two-fifths mark. It's at about that point that, for whatever reason, the Lackey/Norton pairing really stops being a happy marriage. It was like watching them bickering. Something would happen, a big plot point, and then it would be swept under the rug in the next chapter, only to come roaring back a little later. Plot threads would appear from nowhere as though they had been ongoing, and then just vanish without a trace. I can't decide whether the communication was bad, the editing did strange things, or whether these two women really were sort of passive-aggressively hacking each other's plot points into dust, but it makes for a very disjointed reading experience. To provide one example among many, there is at one point a brewing romance between two main characters, left on a dramatic cliffhanger. Then it's almost immediately, and absurdly casually, put down in the next chapter. Twenty pages later, it returns and becomes the basis for the protagonist's entire emotional state. Then it just goes poof and we never hear from it again.The number of dangling plot threads in this book is maddening, and even the characterization is affected. In order to fill certain roles in wherever one of them is trying to take the story in a given moment, characters will suddenly be revealed as different figures than they were portrayed as up to this point, carelessly flaunting all evidence to the contrary provided so far that makes it abundantly clear this change was unplanned. What's even worse is that once they've done their duty to the plot, they'll undergo a sudden conversion experience and change right back again.This last has Mercedes Lackey written all over it. She has always been a careless author with no sense of dramatic timing and the mistaken belief that she can get away with abrupt, sweeping changes without the slightest consequence to her world. She's not better, and is even a bit worse than usual in this book.I do have one positive element to note in this book, and that is that Ms. Norton is not only a far superior author to Lackey, but actually manages to provide some very good imagery and characterization. When the book swings up, I'm pretty sure it's her hand on the tiller. It does swing up once in a while, and as I've said, it begins very well.But once again, the latter part of the book swiftly descends into Lackey's customary undramatic blather, with its cohesion shot all to ribbons by Norton and Lackey's apparent inability to work together effectively.I give it points for the concept, and for Ms. Norton's truly entertaining prose in some places. But honestly, the plot is just complete crap, and whatever dramatic moments the book has are smothered by Lackey. Avoid it."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"To be honest, I read this book for the first time quite a long time ago. I recalled enjoying it, but nothing more - and when I stumbled across the third book in this Halfblood Chronicles series,Elvenborn (Halfblood Chronicles, Book 3), I decided that I would re-read the series. And it did make for a very good re-read. The characters are all engaging. I have been a fan of Lackey's fast-paced and emotional style since I was a lot younger, so reading this - though it isn't a Valdemar novel - just lifted my mood. I did, however, do some research on the series, and I learned that Andre Norton has sadly passed away. And that a fourth book was planned, so I am a little nervous that the reading experience as a whole will be disappointing since it seems the series is unfinished, and will remain so. I hope this isn't the case, since these books didn't come out terribly closely together, but my overall excitement when I first (re)started the series is lessened."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"I like this book, and loved it when I was younger, but as I have matured, so have my tastes. So... It's interesting, but not the best book. If you want to read a really good book of the same type of story (girl raised by dragons), check out \\"Daughter of Dragons\\" by Kathleen H. Nelson. I think it covers the human/dragon culture clash better. Would a girl raised by dragons really fit in that well into human culture?"},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"This is a wonderful beginning for the &quot;Halfblood Chronicles&quot;.

The pacing of the book is very slow for the first 90% of it (then the end comes in a rush). The characters are developed reasonably well, but their interactions are trite and uninteresting. The twists on high fantasy stereotypes are interesting, and I thought that might bode well for an interesting story, but unfortunately the story is typical fantasy and the ending is downright banal.

The story jumps all over the place and leaves many plot-threads. There are entire episodes that are completely unnecessary to the story (like the visit to the Elven Lady Triana, the \\"handfasting\\" with Mero) and neither introduce important characters or move the story forward. Interesting ideas, but these authors needed some severe editing and re-writing, because the story reads like a first draft.However, the second book (Elvenblood), is much better."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"First, I'd like to say that I am a big fan of both Andre Norton and Mercedes Lackey. That said, this isn't one of their better works. I picked this up for reading over vacation as I had seen the book in print for a number of years and thought I would give it a try. My problem with the book, is that the characters aren't very engaging. I've only read this first of 3 (4?) books, and I doubt I will continue simply because I found that I do not care about the well being of the heroes or the destruction of the villans.

I want to do so because I was amazed at the skill of Aasne Vigesaa, and I've been listening to audiobooks for a while now. She makes the story come alive- characters all have distinct voices, tones, and inflections, which is no mean feat considering the number of characters in this story. Accents appear when warranted. When a character talks with a mouth full or has a cold, the voice changes to reflect this. I was never at a loss for who was speaking what, and the voices she chose fit each character's personality flawlessly.It was an absolute pleasure listening to this narration, and I hope to hear more from this narrator in the future."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"As an author I enjoy a story that is not only well written but has great imagination and characters.

The timeline and history of this world seems to place it sort of after the end of our present world, as a kind of post-apocalypse in which first the dragons found and then the elves, with the latter taking over and enslaving the remaining humans. I found the passage of time to be bothersome at times, since the authors seem to almost skip over the climaxes in favor of just relaying the information through the memories of the characters after the fact. More than once, I wished the writers could have written out this passage of time so that I can actually experience it as it happens.The characters were all well-developed and unique, as the size of the book allowed the writers to spend lots of time focusing on a single character, even if his or her purpose seemed to end rather abruptly with death, such as Shana's mother, Serina Daeth. Normally, I have no trouble picking characters that I favored over the others, but with this book, no character seemed to jump out at me as so much better than the others, even the main character Shana, who seemed to lack in maturity as much as a pre-teen, with how she behaves around some of the other characters.There were several over-arching themes in the book, such as the need for change, the call for justice, and how every rule has exceptions. Shana especially seemed to find the latter annoying as she continually found that what she was taught about elves, humans, or dragons was not always true. Even though the legend of the Elvenbane is merely a tall tale crafted by the dragons to stir up trouble with the elves and humans, Shana falls into the role by accident simply because of a dragon's kindness. Ironically, her up-bringing gives her the perfect personality for playing that role, as the main goal of this book was to put her in the perfect position to fill this role for the next book in the series, Elvenblood (Halfblood Chronicles)."},{"Title":"Elvenbane","review":"I first read this book when I was fourteen and fell totally in love with it. The characters are rich, interesting and unpredictable. The story grips you from page 1. I've read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi novels and The Elvenbane ranks as my favourite. If you like sweeping sagas with exotic, lavish locales, a focused, engaging plot and characters to love and hate aplenty, get this book. It's so well written; one of those wonderful reads that you're sad to say goodbye to when it's done. Luckily, there are 2 more books in the series, although this is the stand out of the 3. In true epic style, my copy of Elvenbane got destroyed by rain when the roof blew off my house during a particularly nasty storm- haha! I promptly ordered a new one. Love it love it love it!Plot Overview:Elves (a ridiculously good looking but cold-hearted race)have invaded Earth because their world had become uninhabitable. They promptly enslaved humans and constructed a decadent and self-indulgent existence for themselves. One of the wealthiest and most powerful Eleven Lords, Dyran, has a feisty and ambitious concubine named Serena. She falls pregnant to him (a crime punishable by death) so flees his estate. A shape shifting dragon encounters Serena in the final stages of giving birth and ends up taking the baby girl when Serena perishes shortly after. She names her Lashana (Shana) and raises her alongside her own son, Kerman. Shana grows up to be a gorgeous and strong willed teenager, who shows great promise as a wizard (something elves fear and suppress at all costs because it endangers their position in the world). She eventually meets up with a band of rebel wizards who suspect her to be \\"The Elvenbane\\" a mythical maiden prophesied to eventually bring down the reign of the ridiculously good looking but very nasty elves.

There were around 12 years between books 2 and 3 being published so don't hold your breath for book 4.That aside, these are lightweight stories but still entertaining and worth reading.Elvenbane is a tale of the struggle between 'half bloods' and Elves. The lordly elves rule the land with savage brutality. Humans are their slaves and viewed as little better than animals. Occasionally half bloods (a mixture of elf and human) are born. These are feared by the elves due to their strong magical powers, and are usually destroyed as soon as they are born.Shana, the heroine of the tale, is one such half blood. Born in the desert to a mother who died giving birth, Shana is found and fostered by a dragon. No one knows dragons exist until Shana, following her fate as the 'Elvenbane' calls on them for help in the battle against Elves.

After using her magic to defend her foster brother Keman, Shana is banished to the desert where she is captured by human servants of elven lords; races she thought no longer existed. A rare mystery, Shana is about to be sold in a slave auction when she is rescued by disguised halfbloods who take her to a Citadel where wizards live in secrecy. Yet fate intercedes and soon the most diabolical of elven Lord's, and presumably Shana's father, discovers the location of the hidden city and Shana and her friends must fight for their lives.Slow to build and exhaustively descriptive, The Elvenbane is 566 pages of introduction to the next book in the sequel. This first book in the trilogy takes place over approximately sixteen years of time, and you certainly feel it.

It also reverses some of the traditional fantasy norms, such as the characteristics of the elves and unicorns. The plot seems to work out every time for the main characters, except for a few isolated instances. There is no tension over whther or not the main characters will win, its just a matter of when and where. The end of the book seems to be a foregone conclusion before the book is even half finished. It is a fun read, but its lack in creating any kind of tension or real unavoidable conflict makes it fall short of being termed &quot;Great&quot; by any standards."},{"Title":"Brunswick Babies- Crochet for Babies (Volume 696)","review":"I knew the book was used and was not disappointed when the one pattern I wanted had writing all over it.

As Julia Quinn and her daughter, Emmi, prayed for someone to love, each found their answer in the same angel-man. Emmi found the daddy she wanted so badly and Julia found the love of her life.Joel, captured from his angelic dimension in a university physicist's experiment Julia and her assistant, Linda, set into motion, entered the world of humans and all their limitations. He also found the simple pleasures, and pain, of love and friendship. As he took on more of the human traits and emotions he learned that, in the earthly realm, there are consequences to every action.Love blooms between Joel and Julia as she lets go of the childhood pain and heartache that had kept her heart closed for so long.

A real heart stirring story with passion, mystery and love."},{"Title":"Captured Angel","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesJulia Quinn is a brilliant physicist who dreams of making a name for herself in the world of science by discovering how to make teletransportation work. Her life revolves around her daughter, Emmi, and science, ever since her husband died. Emmi's greatest dream is for God to give her a new Daddy. Julia thinks her experiment is finally perfected, and when she tests it, is in for quite a surprise. Her equipment ends up capturing an angel! Emmi is thrilled, believing Joel is the answer to her prayers for a new daddy.Now, they must figure out what went wrong so they can fix it and return Joel to his proper existence before it is too late and he's trapped forever. However, neither expected that they'd capture each other's hearts in the process, and they must now make a decision that could change their lives for eternity.This was a pleasant story about \\"what ifs\\" and dreams come true, with a dose of inspirational thrown into the mix for good measure. Julia is lonely in her life, but doesn't realize it quite so much, believing it is full between her career, her daughter, and her few close friends. She had never truly loved her husband, so she isn't even quite aware of what she's missing in that respect. Joel is full of confusion when he is yanked out of his plane of existence, and sucked into Julia's world. He is also full of delight at the simplest of things, like the microwave, and excited over each new discovery he finds. Emmi is thrilled to have him in her life, convinced he was a gift to her from God, and prays daily he will stay forever, marry her mother, and be her daddy.As Julia works against time to figure out what went wrong so she can return Joel to his realm, all the while she's wishing he could stay with them. Their love and passion grow from the close relationship that forms as they try to crack the equations, and both long for something that should be forbidden to them.

This was the first book I have read by this author (it was given to me by a friend who is a fan of Ms. Basso's) and I thought it was wonderful!Her descriptions evoked all sorts of images and emotions - I got a vivid sense of the characters, the time, the place. There was an almost gothic feel to most of the book and I found that to be a refreshing change from the usual Regency fare.Unlike one reviewer who mentioned that she does not have any children, I have children (and grandchildren) and I thought the three little ones added a great deal to the story and mood of this book. They were a key element to the plot without taking it over and acted like real kids - they also provided some humor and fun.The romantic tension and sexual chemistry between Harriet and Nathaniel was HOT! I was happy that the author took the time to build a solid relationship and friendship between the two of them before they jumped into bed because I rarely enjoy a story that has the hero and heroine between the sheets in the first chapter.The book started off slowly as the characters were introduced and the mood was set, but the tension built with each chapter and that kept me turning those pages, anxious to see how it all turned out.I rated this book 5 stars because I felt it was terrific and I look forward to reading more books by this talented author."},{"Title":"To Tempt A Rogue (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Harriet was jilted by her fiance and wishes to avoid the ton by settling to become a governess (Because she is the daughter of a viscount, this is a little bit too far fetched anyway the hopeless romantic that I am I didn't stop reading)Nathaniel needs a governess for his three young charges who he has Kidnapped from his uncle, because he is concerned his greedy uncle who is their temporary guardian will mismanage their inheritance. Although he can fight his uncle in court over his nieces and nephew's guardianship, he sees it a lost course because not only is his uncle greedy, he is very corrupt as well. In kidnapping them he hope to find a solution soon but in the meantime he is giving them all the love they deserve but never recived from their evil granduncleThe twist to the story is that Nathaniel doesn't know Harriet's true identity and vice versa. So she nearly because of her stubbonness puts her charges in danger.The story is an excellent read, a little bit dark for a good read nonetheless.I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"To Tempt A Rogue (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Harriet Sainthill is somewhat embarrassed (and gravely disappointed) upon being jilted. However, having no wish to be the talk of the ton, Harriet decides to remove herself from the melee for a while, and decides to try a post as a governess, which will enable her to relocate to Scotland for a while. Yet Harriet does not know that Mr. Wainwright, her new employer, is, in reality, Lord Nathaniel Bennett--who due to his brother's and sister-in-law's untimely deaths--must try to keep their children safe. Will he succeed? Can Harriet resist the reformed rake? Will righteousness prevail over nefariousness? Read the book and find out--and enjoy the sumptuous Scottish setting!"},{"Title":"To Tempt A Rogue (Zebra Historical Romance)","review":"Harriet Sainthill was apparently jilted by her fianc&eacute; (who was scandalous, I guess) in one of the author's previous books. A spinster living with her Viscount brother and his family, Harriet wants a change in her life and decides to become a governess. Yes, you heard me right. A Viscount's daughter wants to become a governess; not because she's homeless or has no money or family, but just so she can be independent or something. (Go ahead and chuck your disbelief out the window now, because things do not get better from here.)Lord Nathaniel Bennett (the author insists he has a title of his own, but he wouldn't, so I won't use it) has recently lost his brother and sister-in-law to illness. His four year old nephew (now a duke) and two young nieces have, through Nathaniel's neglect, fallen into the clutches of an unscrupulous great-uncle. Facing a legal battle for custody that he fears he can't win and fearing for the life of his nephew, Lord Nathaniel decides to kidnap his nieces and nephew from his uncle.Harriet is one of the worst romance heroines I've ever seen; she's just a stupid know-it-all. We're introduced to her as she (having no parental experience herself) interferes with her brother's discipline of his son, then proceeds to lecture her brother on parenting. I'm not even a parent and that bothers me. And then, she has this idea about becoming a governess. I'm not one to harp about historical accuracy, but come on. A daughter of a viscount would never resort to taking employment unless she had no other option. Not to mention that if she's as infamous as the book makes her seem, no one would hire her--Regency governesses had to have impeccable reputations.Nathaniel is a blah hero. I'm told he's a rake, but other than an \\"other woman\\" sex scene there's nothing to support it. We know he's less than strong because he didn't take responsibility for his brother's children (as his brother asked on his deathbed), but things get worse when he decides that kidnapping them is the answer. It's hard to say what the best solution to the problem is as we're never given enough information about the brother's will and laws of the time to make a determination, but it seems to me that kidnapping was one of the dumbest courses of action. So, basically, Lord Nathaniel comes off as a weak, dim, poor excuse for a rake.I've covered my problems with the characters, but those aren't even my biggest issues with the book. I'll try to give you an example of what bothered me most:I began reading and, for the first few pages, was intrigued with the style and initial set-up of the story. Then things began to get tedious. The story meanders through repetitive, non-essential detail. After forty pages the protagonists hadn't yet met (a pet peeve of mine); my sister happened to call and we started a discussion of how much we hate it when it takes forever for the hero and heroine to meet. Then I went back to reading and called my sister when I hit page fifty and they still hadn't met; we had a good laugh and I started reading again. I hit page sixty and called her once more, because they still hadn't met! She told me to quit reading. I told her I wanted to review the book and therefore had to read more than sixty pages. I kept reading, and when I hit page seventy (they still hadn't met!) I called her again. Neither of us could remember reading a romance where it took this long for the romance to begin; she told me I was an idiot for continuing to read. I kept going and was relieved when the hero and heroine finally found each other a page later, only to be flabbergasted YET AGAIN when, after the scene where they meet, I'm treated to a repetition of the scene on page eighty, only this time from another point of view. The first hundred pages could be cut down to twenty without a single pertinent detail being removed.Ok, did you notice my last paragraph--how long and filled with useless, meandering detail it was? That's what the book is like: miles of unnecessary rambling.\\"To Tempt a Rogue\\" has other problems too. The romance is almost non-existent; Harriet and Nathaniel have no chemistry and seem to \\"fall in love\\" just because they're in the same place at the same time. There is a \\"big misunderstanding\\" because the heroine, twit that she is, makes assumptions. The heroine tips the evil uncle off to their hide-out --the twit factor again--but the hero takes responsibility for her stupidity (proving he's no genius himself). Our hero's young charges don't act like any children I've ever met. The dialogue is done about as poorly as any I've ever read. The endless droning about carriage trips, Scottish scenery, nightgowns, baby dolls, etc. drove me nuts--especially when many things like the legal situation with the hero's charges and the heroine's past (apparently you have to read a previous book to find out all the details about it) are woefully under explained.I give \\"To Tempt a Rogue\\" one star. The pacing is, frankly, boring; the characters are unlikable; the story, despite endless detail, in not cohesive. And, I'm irked by the inattention to accuracy. Avoid this book; it was my first of Ms. Basso's and will be my last (though I have the impression that she's capable of better than this).Also, a bit of research into the use of Regency English titles (particularly, the non-disbursal of them to younger sons) would benefit the author."},{"Title":"Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls","review":"This was the first Rankin novel I tried, and I'm now chewing my way through the rest of them. The humour is about as zany as it gets, and there are some real laugh-out-loud moments.

Their picaresque adventures could be interpreted as products of their overactive imaginations. In various novels they come face to face with the antipope, aliens from Ceres, time travel, and a host of other delightful oddities, always helped by their friend the Professor.

All of commerce, all of industry, and a fair bit of the government have been taken over by one megacorp, but the placid little town of Brentford putters along the way is has for the last few hundred years. And a good thing, too. For one thing, there's that new band with the feel-good music, the kind that really leaves you feeling good. There's Jim Pooley whose name goes down in history as the biggest cockup ever, and getting killed early on doesn't seem to get in his way. There's a stove-top genetic experiment in horse breeding, with success of peculiar sorts. There's the fortune teller who doesn't read your palm but your - well, women don't seem to have very much ahead of them. And there's the end of the world, not that anyone seems to care very much. It all comes together in a readable, entertaining story that all ends just about where it began, only not quite.This seems to be one interlude midway through a series of books centered on Brentford, but a newcomer will pick up the who's who and what's what (even the when's when) quickly enough. It lacks Terry Pratchett's level of fantasy and huge personalities, and lacks Tom Holt's sense of frenzy. Still it's a good read, and I'll be back to Brentford again.Rankin is just starting to catch on in the US, but deserves a lot more attention. He puts together an amusing story. If nothing else, it should hold you until Pratchett or Holt come out with their next.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls","review":"Very little sex though real or simulated but keep on reading and... you will laugh really hard twice on each page and chuckle to yourself in between.

It has: A Beatles reunion no less, although a Serbian SF/Horror writer had that on before Mr. Rankin.

Chronically unemployed, the duo manages to find adventures that border on absurdity. As the title \\"Sex and Drugs and Sausage Rolls\\" suggests, this book is no exception.The good news is that the Beatles are back together, and Jimi Hendrix is alive. Even Elvis is still making music. The problem with this scenario is the means by which it was done. As John Omally tries to convince a mysterious local band named Gandhi's Hairdrier to let him be their manager, the world is changing. The band's lead singer's mysterious powers of voice only add an extra layer of peculiarity. Time has already ended, causing the people of the future to return to the past and change it according to their whims. The consequences can be staggering.Gags are cleverly placed like landmines throughout the book, often causing readers to laugh out loud. It is also amusing to see the rockers we miss, having a go in old age. These scenes almost make the book worth it alone.While I did not enjoy this book as much as his Toyland tales, it is a very entertaining book.

The characters can move in way that are not limited by the laws of physics, reason, or propriety. That's what makes it fun.He touches on pop culture, rock music and the strange way the brits seem to act. All worthy deviations from the old classic tales.In the end it is fun fast read.

My two favorite restaurants, Soul Vegetarian East and Alice & Friends, got two star ratings. Alice & Friends food is absolutely excellent, and I go there every chance I get, and the vegan chocolate mousse pie is fantastic, and I'm not a dessert person at all. This book says the dessert is not desirable, and that blew my mind. And as for Soul Vegetarian East being so unique that it's hard to find seating, I've been there at least six times, and the only time I had trouble finding seating was on a late evening. During the day and early afternoons, I usually come in to maybe three or four tables of one or two people.

I have been to many workshops and conferences on autism, and this has touched base with somethings I've noticed about from what I have seen at some of these workshops as well as some events I have attended geared to those with autism as well as family members, however, before this, nothing I have read has really touched base on the subject.This has so totally exceeded any hopes I had, even after seeing the title.I had originally purchased 3 books, one for myself and two for friends I knew would be extremely interested.

Pilates instructor Alycea Ungaro takes up this &quot;Pilates challenge&quot; with 3 women. She breaks down the fundamental Pilates work into 3 different developmental programs: Upper Body, Lower Body, and Flexibility/Posture. Alyecia documents the beginning, progress, and final results of the three volunteers in these programs in this photo-intensive book.First, I want to thank the three women who agreed to work with Alyecia on this project. It takes a lot of courage to go down this path so publicly -- especially when *you* are the ones who are blazing the trail. The results you achieved are fabulous, and people you will never ever meet will be inspired and benefit from your example for years to come.As with &quot;Pilates: Body in Motion&quot;, Alyecia and the DK Books staff have created a betutiful book. There are hundreds of pictures with breakdowns and tips on every single exercise. What's different is that Alyecia uses her students as the models for most of the exercises. This is absolutely brilliant: it shows real people with real bodies doing exercises -- as opposed to those Pilates instructors who already have &quot;perfect&quot; bodies. Starting a Pilates program is a pretty intimidating thing to do; this book's design removes some of that intimidation.I like the breakdown of the Pilates work into the 3 separate programs. This helps emphasize that Pilates is really a total-body strength/flexibility/posture system of exercise. Alyecia also includes the classical arm series exercises -- plus some extensions -- in her upper body program. This arm work often shakes up people's misconceptions about the nature of Pilates. I also like the inclusion of optional equipment/props to the exercises. These props provide variety in the exercises and help students learn the new skills while developing their muscles. Make no mistake: this is challenging work.The before/after pictures of the models are absolutely stunning. You see both dramatic and subtle shifts to their bodies. It's interesting how Alyecia points out some of the changes but not all of them. I noticed some remarkable improvement in shoulder alignment in all three women (but especially in Casey).I have two quibbles with this book. First, I do not believe that anyone can effectively learn Pilates from simply reading and applying a textbook. The three women here didn't do that; they worked one-on-one with a consummate Pilates instructor. The book can be excellent supplementary material, but it cannot stand on its own. Even so, I think this is a &quot;best in class&quot; instuctional book and deserves 5 stars; it does the best job that you could expect any book to do.Second, why no men? When are we going to see the Pilates Challenge tested on some male volunteers? I fondly hope that Alyecia is considering that for her next book."},{"Title":"The Pilates Promise","review":"I've been a Pilates believer since I took the Pilates challenge a few years ago. Indeed, in 30 sessions, I had muscles I'd never known about, as well as being overall stronger and more limber (and I was pretty limber to start with). Many people, of course, are quick to dispute the claim, although they've never tried it themselves, and many others don't want to devote the two months/ten days necessary to achieve the results.The Pilates Promise shows three realistic bodies taking up the challenge. Better yet, Ungaro created three different programs, one for Upper Body, one for Lower Body and one for Flexibility and Posture. I liked her choices, especially since 1) most people think of Pilates as a glorified abdominal workout and 2) a lot of people hold that it's not possible to use Pilates to improve your upper body (and sometimes lower body).Each program is a derivative of the classic Pilates mat sequence. Only the most advanced movements (the JackKnife, the Underwater Series, the Rollover, etc) are not included in the programs she designed. She also includes the Standing Sculpting Series/Arm Series, the Rowing Series and some movements with the Magic Circle.All of the participants came into the program with real bodies and left the program with real bodies. However, the participants did get their desired results. For example, the woman who wanted to improve her upper body gained 1/2 an inch in her deltoids, 1/2 an inch in her biceps and 1 inch in her bustline (while also losing 1 inch from her waistline). (While those results may not impress someone trying to build significant mass, Ungaro notes that in the absence of serious weight training most women are going to have difficulty gaining large muscle mass.) The woman who wanted to improve her lower body lost 2 inches in her waist, 2 1/2 inches in her hips, 2 1/4 inches in her upper thighs and 3 1/4 inches in her lower thighs. The most dramatic results were from the woman trying to improve her posture and flexibility. Though she changed her proportions somewhat, the overall improvement in her range of motion is what was most impressive.If you're looking for dramatic \\"Body for Life\\" results, this is not the program for you. This is not a weight-loss program (though I wonder if that's Ungaro's next book?) and changing one's diet for the program is never suggested. In fact, at one point one of the participants notes that she made a conscious decision not to change her diet while pursuing the program.As with Pilates: Body In Motion, this book is very easy to read and follow. Ungaro uses color coded charts for each program and then includes all of the exercises used in the book in the sequence they would be traditionally performed. As a bonus, she also includes charts for four time-crunched Pilates workouts, the Side Kicks Series, the Arm Series, the Abdominal Series and the Wall Series (all of which take about five minutes). Finally, for those of us who have always wondered how to incorporate the Pilates \\"extras\\" like the weights and the circle, she discusses that as well (matwork, then circle, then weights).A lot of times when reading other Pilates books, I always feel a little let-down when we get to the part about the specialized equipment- like somehow the reader is going to miss the boat if they can't run out and get everything. While Ungaro does suggest the use of items like weights, rubber bands, circles and poles, she also lists alternatives- just in case you're not able to run out and buy a Pilates Magic Circle.This is a great follow-up to Pilates: Body In Motion and will help guide both new and veteran participants to get the realistic results they want on their own."},{"Title":"The Pilates Promise","review":"\\"In 10 sessions you will feel the difference, in 20 see the difference, and in 30 you'll have a whole new body.\\" ~Joseph PilatesPilates will do wonders for your body. That is undisputed. But trust me when I say that none of the participants in this program were \\"majorly\\" overweight. If you are 30 or more lbs overweight, you might want to give yourself more than 30 sessions. In fact, I myself have been doing Pilates \\"seriously\\" for over 30 weeks now and I can say that I do Pilates about 3 or more times a week. Most of the participants in this book had relatively flat stomachs, minor posture problems, lacked muscle definition and look like they are basically at their target weight or close to it.Measurements of one participant:Waist before, 30 inches, after 28 inches.Hips before 42 inches, after 39 inchesUpper thighs before 26 inches, after 23 inchesAnother participant saw an increase of 1 inch in her bustline while another saw an increase of inches in her biceps and deltoids.The participants all give their \\"view\\" of Pilates and are given an assessment. There are a few before/after shots that do not show dramatic changes in weight loss, but show other features like improved posture and thinner thighs.If you are close to your target weight and want to firm up your entire body, then I'd highly recommend this book. If you are just starting Pilates, I'd also recommend this book, but take the challenge less seriously if you are moderately overweight. As you do walking, you do start to see the results of Pilates showing through. Honestly, Pilates helps you walk more efficiently because it improves your posture. You also gain an added level of confidence and your stomach will start to disappear and your butt will lift. Basically, everything firms up from the inside out.If you are just starting to do Pilates, you might also want to look for a variety of video/DVD workouts to compliment this workout book. Karen Voight, Jennifer Kries, and Winsor Pilates are names to look for here at Amazon. Alycea Ungaro also has a book/CD set called Portable Pilates.There are over 350 Photographs and clear instructions for each exercise. Alycea Ungaro is a Pilates instructor who has created matwork exercises that produce real results. She has trained dozens of celebrities including Uma Thurman and Christy Turlington.The Contents of this book are too complex to list. There is an Introduction, Basic Program, Upper Body Program, Lower Body Program, Flexibility and Posture Program.You will be doing exercises called, The Hundred, Spine Stretch Forward, Push Ups, Double Leg Kick, Arm Series, Magic Circle Series, One-Legged Teaser, Can-Can, The Seal, The Saw, Neck Pull, Swimming, Mermaid, Rowing.If you have experienced these while watching a DVD then you will be familiar with the types of exercises. Many are done standing or laying flat on your back. There are no complicated bouncy exercises that hurt your knees, there are no fancy steps to memorize.This is exercise at its finest. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to make Pilates more than a challenge and who want to seriously consider this form of exercise for long-term results.Things to buy with this book: An inflatable 16-inch ball or a \\"magic circle.\\" Karen Voight sells one that works very well and it is padded. A yoga mat or padded exercise mat. 2-3lb weights, pole, ankle weights and exercise bands. There are some sources for supplies in the back of the book.It sounds like a lot, but all these items can be used with lots of exercise videos. You might even get excited enough to start collecting exercise videos. Imagine, something that you can collect that is going to change your entire body!Also look for:Jennifer Kries' Pilates Plus Method: The Unique Combination of Yoga, Dance, and Pilates~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Pilates Promise","review":"I am so impressed with this book with its color photos, and the wonderful descriptions of the exercises.

I am an applied biologist by training and I work as a consultant in animal agriculture. I found the scientific nature of the book's plot to be intriguing and prescient to our times. The book did an excellent job of addressing the issues of professional ethics within the business of science. Because I am a fan of Grisham et al. by avocation, I found the legal aspect of the plot to be thrilling as well. It has been my experience that graduate students of the life sciences spend no time studying the subject of scientific ethics. It would serve all students well to read this book and others like it. They need to be aware that no matter your career choice (professional consultant,entrepreneur, or attorney), they will be faced with ethical dilemmas almost daily, often from unlikely and/or unexpected sources.As your read this wonderful novel, and I hope you do, ask yourself the following question--\\"Do I know someone like Henry Holten or Dillon Love, and whom would I rather have on my side?\\" The answer may surprise you!!"},{"Title":"The Litigators","review":"My roommate left this book on the kitchen table; I picked it up and couldn't put it down.

Well written and highly recommended. 5 Stars.\\""},{"Title":"The Litigators","review":"Author: Lindsay G. Arthur, Jr.ISBN: 0-9765201-0-9Publisher: Scarletta PressSet in Minneapolis, the crux of The Litigators focuses on an unfortunate event where a young woman, Ruth Bergstrom contacts some unknown disease and begins to lose strength in her legs causing her to suffer pain. Her condition seems to be deteriorating and when she consults her doctor, she is advised that her health problem may be due to having been exposed to some toxic substance.The Bergstroms live next to an abandoned gas station which is in the process of being cleaned up by a company called EnviroClean owned by a former college professor, Dr. Boyd Campbell. The company has been using an innovative procedure wherein genetically mutated organisms are employed to degrade hazardous compounds. The company calls these organisms P-27.EnviroClean is about to launch an IPO and as Campbell is presenting all kinds of data concerning his company to his attorneys and prospective investors, an unusual letter pops up among the many documents. The letter is from Mrs. Bergstrom where she causally asks Campbell if what his company is doing would possibly cause her to have an allergic reaction. Little does she realize at the time that her innocent letter would eventually result in a horror of events involving a bunch of egotistical lawyers that would not be acting in the best interests of their clients.Campbell is quite adamant that the process he uses to clean up toxic contaminants is very safe. However, this does not totally convince his investors who tell him and his lawyer, Henry Holten that he must put a quick end to Bergstrom's inquiry as they don't intend to buy into any future law suits. Holten brushes it all aside and assures them that the matter will be dealt with appropriately.Holten and his gang of high powered lawyers put their heads together including Holten's hot shot young partner Allison Forbes and draft a reply letter to Bergstrom. After considerable discussion and several drafts, Forbes presents the letter to Holten, who, without informing her, makes some important changes and has the letter sent off to Mrs. Bergstrom.Within a few days Mrs. Bergstrom receives a very strong response from Campbell's lawyers stating that they would vigorously defend EnvuriClean and its products against any such frivolous charges to the fullest extent of resources of its firm.Mrs. Bergstrom is introduced to her friend's husband, Dillon Love who is an attorney. After reading Mrs. Bergstrom's lawyer's letter, Loves smells something fishy and is determined to pursue EnviroClean. However, there is one problem, Love is not in the same league as Holten, as he is a solo practitioner with very limited resources. Nonetheless, this does not deter him and he wants nothing to do with a possible our-of-court settlement. Incidentally, Holten is likewise not open to any kind of settlement fearing that it would jeopardize EnviroClean's IPO and is looking to have the case thrown out. As the story unfolds, we also discover that Holten has another reason for not settling-one that plays a very important role in the future trial.Let the fun and games begin as the lawyers counsel their clients to forget about settling, notwithstanding the reluctance of Mrs. Bergstrom and Dr. Campbell to avoid litigation. Such a pity, for in the end no one really wins.The novel stretches far more than what appears on the surface as it engages its readers in the lives and hearts of its characters. In addition, readers get the real feel of what it is like to practice law in a powerful and prestigious law firm as compared to a solo practitioner who barely ekes out a living with very little resources at his disposal and where the odds are generally stacked against him. Moreover, it is a reminder that unfortunately there are far too many lawyers that don't consider the frightful consequences that can result from long and drawn out legal procedures and manoeuvrings.What I found most surprising about The Litigators is that it is authored by someone that you would expect would be an unwavering defendant of litigators when you consider that he is an attorney who has tried over 150 cases during a career that has spanned thirty-five years. However, as mentioned in Arthur's bio, he \\"was prompted to write The Litigators by his love for the law, whose greatest virtue is, paradoxically, its willingness to tolerate strident criticism. In that spirit Arthur speaks here, as an entrenched insider, with a bold critique of a judicial system that is increasingly tarnished by the unscrupulous and excessive practices of certain lawyers.\\" And to this I say, Amen!"},{"Title":"The Litigators","review":"I have read everything written by Mr Grisham. While this book was filled with twists and turns it was also a very hard read. I don't see a Grisham first-timer picking up this book and wanting to read more Grisham. This isn't a fast-paced book as some his are nor is it one of his best. I was disappointed in this latest work"},{"Title":"The Litigators","review":"The Litigators is a wonderfully intriguing story that skillfully presents the darkest side of the prevailing scorched-earth philosophy that drives much of the litigation in the U.S. Unfortunately, one's enjoyment of Mr. Arthur's insightful and realistic exposition is ruined by dialogue that is needlessly peppered with gratuitous and senseless vulgarity. One can only guess that such dialogue either betrays Mr. Arthur's own personal penchant for obscene language or his having fallen victim to the false belief that an author must use morally crude language to make a novel \\"believable\\" or \\"sellable.\\" Either case is very unfortunate. If you are looking for an engaging novel written by an attorney, sans repulsive dialogue, I highly recommend any one of the following wonderful novels by Robert Whitlow: The List, The Trial, The Sacrifice, or Life Support. Should Mr. Arthur pen future novels, he would do well to take a page (or several for that matter) from his fellow member of the bar and forgo dialogue that panders to the vulgar."},{"Title":"The Red Chief, Set","review":"I enjoyed &quot;The Red Chief&quot; as a kid and recently re-read it. Way before the coming of white men to Australia, there were many tribes of aborigines. The Gunnedar tribe had waned in power and was in danger of being violently assimilated by other neighboring tribes. The young Red Kangaroo works against the corrupt mismanagement of the tribal elders as he grows up, and eventually becomes the Red Chief and saves the tribe.Along the way are wonderful descriptions of aboriginal tribal life and how they gathered food, hunted, and made war. The book is an exciting story for teenagers, but is also interesting for adults. I didn't actually buy the set - I have a single book. It is readily available on the used markek ...."},{"Title":"Tao Te Ching: The Classic Book of Integrity and the Way","review":"This translation of the *Tao Te Ching* is based on the 1973 discovery of ancient silk manuscripts of the text at Ma-wang-tui in central China. For those familiar with the *Tao Te Ching*, this translation will be surprising. The chapters are not in the original order, and a few chapters, familiar from later versions, did not exist in this early version. Unlike most translations of this text, the first half of this translation focuses on TE (which Mair translates as \\"integrity\\"), and the second half focuses on TAO. Thus, the famous opening line (here translated as \\"The ways that can be walked are not the eternal Way\\") is found here as the first line of chapter 45. Mair provided extensive introduction, annotations, and \\"Afterword\\". Clearly, his primary concerns are philological in nature. While I would not recommend this to someone reading the *Tao Te Ching* for the first time, this translation could be quite helpful for someone comparing translations and trying to come to a deeper understanding of the text."},{"Title":"Tao Te Ching: The Classic Book of Integrity and the Way","review":"Victor Mair is a well-known scholar of Classical Chinese, and I feel that of the many translations of the Tao Te Ching, his is the best by far! Thanks in part due to the discovery of the Ma Wang Tui scrolls, this book provides a refreshing change to the cookie-cutter translations I have seen in the past, and in the back of the book goes into great deal on why he translated thing the way he did.As a amateur in Classical Chinese myself, I feel that Mr. Mair's translation is definitely the most accurate in relation to the general mood of the time in China, when many other such classics were being written (Confucius's Analects for example). Many of these classics drew upon the same pool of ideas, and this particular translation shows the mood of that time better than any other I have seen. Most translations tend to interpret words and phrases in a modern light, but Mair's is true to philosophy of the time.I also like the detailed analysis that Mair does in comparing the Tao with other religions in Asia (in particular Judaism and Hinduism) and how they also drew upon a common pool of ideas prevalent at the time. I believe he makes a very strong case for this.For those who are not interested in the historical aspect of Taoism, I feel they will still enjoy this book very much because this translation preserves the spiritual mystery of the Tao Te Ching (another aspect most translations lack), and lets the reader interpret the meaning as he/she sees fit.Anyhow, in closing, a fanstatic translation, that stands above the rest. I strongly recommend this for both scholars and enthusiasts alike."},{"Title":"Tao Te Ching: The Classic Book of Integrity and the Way","review":"Over the course of the last 15 years or so I've seen maybe six English translations of the Tao Te Ching, including those of Red Pine and Henricks. I'm not qualified to speak to the accuracy of Mair's effort, but I have found it to be far and away the most poetic and powerful that I've encountered. This truely sings in places, as Mair attempts (so he says) to impart not only the meaning of each verse, but its approximate effect as well.However, Mair is not shy (nor is he intrusive) when it comes to pointing out awkward and impenetrable language or derivative notions wherever he believes he encounters them. I find this kind of frankness instructive and refreshing. It led me to a greater appreciation for the rich historical context of both the text and the ideas that it conveys."},{"Title":"Tao Te Ching: The Classic Book of Integrity and the Way","review":"It has, however, grown on me. Victor Mair is obviously a scholar of the highest order when it comes to this particular text. He is well versed in scholarly areas that are literally foreign to me. Over time, they have begun to make sense a bit more but I was quite put off by this in the beginning. The other thing that was off-putting was his frequent use of 'I' in terms of his studies of Taoism. His reference also to 'new' and 'never before considered' avenues of comparison between Taoism and Hinduism gave me the impression of braggadocio that was quite disconcerting. I couldn't get passed what seemed to me to be scholarly arrogance, a bit too puffed up on knowledge (which, for readers of the Tao, can lead one astray...).I've since gotten beyond that and have begun to learn from what he has to say. I believe what he has to say is valuable and needs to be considered (albeit with some salt). He does know his stuff. As a scholar, and as one who has obviously put a great deal of thought into dissecting the nuances of translating ancient Chinese terms into more modern English, he has done an exquisite job in helping to really understand what the terms literally mean.The drawback with this, however, is that it tends to be a bit dry and overly scholastic in nature. But on the same note this is also important in trying to really get to what the terms mean rather than what we may read into them (though this is not so cut and dry as it may sound).So I have begun to really appreciate his unequalled journey into the meanings of the terms and their context (though his journeys into comparing them to Hindu/Buddhist equivalents gets a bit tedious...) really helps me in drawing out deeper meanings when balanced with other translations.So kudos to his effort. It is really beginning to grow on me. I suppose my issue is not with him, per se, but the havoc that pure academia can wreak. Moving beyond this, however, it becomes clear that he is merely trying to rattle those of us who have become quite comfortable in our views on the Tao Te Ching.

I appreciate his choosing to translate \\"De\\" as \\"Integrity,\\" but other than that, I found much discrepancy between the translation and the original language.Readers that don't know Chinese would not have any problems, but I like to put the translation with the Chinese text side by side so that I can understand better. That's how I got disappointed.Some translated words are annoyingly misleading. For example \\"''\\" in classical Chinese means \\"kingdom,\\" or \\"nation,\\" but Mair translated it literally as \\"all under heaven.\\" That would take the reader away farther from the original intend of the Tao Te Ching. \\"''\\" which means \\"the king\\" is translated as \\"ruler of men.\\" That might sound OK, but Mair says that he tries to use inclusive language wherever he can. So why \\"men?\\" If he uses \\"the king\\" he would be more accurate and would have avoided the exclusive language.Some chapters are quite off. For example, chapter 57 (13), giving that is a harder chapter, he just comes up with a totally different meaning. He starts the first line as \\"Being favored is so disgraceful that it startles,\\" which in Chinese is \\"''''\\" meaning \\"Both honor and disgrace can be startling,\\" or \\"Either honor or disgrace is like a frightening experience.\\" It's quite a stretch to translate it as \\"Being favored is so disgraceful...\\"Further more, I was expecting some footnotes or end-notes to guide the reader for better understanding of the classic. However, he just presented his translation as it is, as if it is the most authoritative. Even though he mentioned it in the introduction that it was not easy to translate, I expect some notes showing his struggle with certain words or phrases, and I didn't expect some words and chapters that are so way off."},{"Title":"Tao Te Ching: The Classic Book of Integrity and the Way","review":"This translation uses newly found materials to shed further insight into the meaning of the work of Lao Tzu.

This translation by Victor Mair is as good as any out there and maybe even better since it used the oldest known manuscripts for its translation. In comparison to other religions, this one has the most in common with the Hindu faith. However, to understand the tenets of this faith, you may have to reread this a few times since the language does not flow extremely well with the English language. Even then, depending on your background religion, you may have to rely heavily on a commentary.

Especially when she saves the filly's life - not once, but twice!Julie, a recent graduate from high school, works for her father in an antique shop but her heart belongs to horses. She and her dad meet an unsavory character who has a filly chained by a river. Mr. Jefferson buys the abused horse for Julie, much to her delight. With her connections at a nearby racing stable, she is able to trade working there for the filly's board and care. She soon learns that the filly she names Bonnie is most likely a valuable racehorse. Someone had exchanged horses, but who and why?Besides being a fun mystery, I loved the authentic equine and racetrack terminology. The story has likable characters (including the variety of animals) and realistic villains. Although the ending was predictable, it was satisfying.First published in 1971, the only improvement I could see to engage today's young readers is to include modern technology such as cell phones."},{"Title":"The sweet running filly","review":"I read the Bonnie books when I was a kid, and I still remember them twenty years or so later as some of the best books I read.

In case you don't know, he won the Triple Crown in 1977 and also went on to become one of the most influential sires ever. Because of Seattle Slew, I was hungry to read everything about horse racing that I could get my hands on, and that's how I found Bonnie and Julie. I fell in love immediately. Bonnie is a champion horse every girl can love, and Julie is the Nancy Drew of the horse racing world. What could be better for a young girl? But these books are more than that - they tell about the horse racing industry the way it really is. Little details like how the horses are really cared for and trained, what a claiming race is, and so on. It's not unrealistic like this underaged and unlicensed kid is going to jockey an unknown and unpapered horse that's not even a Thoroughbred in a race against the top two horses in the country.

Are Irish & Scottish Travellers a distinctive ethnicity with a distinctive language, or merely a sub-culture of itinerants who developed a coded array of a few hundred words that they devised to keep out of a stranger's earshot particularly intimate concerns (from a \`country person' most usually, but perhaps also to protect their conversation from a suspect Traveller from another group)? The scholars and speakers of Cant/Gammon seem to agree that Travellers comprise a cohesive entity among whom this spoken secrecy evolves not from deceit, but from intimacy, much as a minority in many threatened situations concocts an argot to cloak their messages from authorities or rivals.&Oacute; Baoill and Kirk in their introduction address this need for protecting Cant/Gammon, even from academic publication. The fear that police will misuse the findings meant that certain words were not printed, only glossed with their English equivalent or excluded with an \`X'. While the Traveller-descended part of me sympathises with this ambiguity, the academic part of me trained then resists such obfuscation, however well-intended. Certainly, if those in the \`buffer' world cannot study this code, then it is up to the Travellers themselves to formulate the sophisticated linguistic and cultural analyses with which to confront the persistent questions about its origins, function, survival, and future that all involved in this conference and volume concur is threatened by the dominant Anglophone society.One area, for instance, receives only a footnote, but I claim that it contains a valuable field of comparison and contrast. The analogy with the state of Irish among its native-born speakers makes for an excellent and timely intersection with Cant/Gammon studies, since creolisation appears in both under the unrelenting pressure among younger users who, under the constant switching between English and the second language, begin to make the task easier by adopting more English into the remaining patterns and vocabulary of the gradually less-spoken method of intimate communication, itself eroded by media, integration, and assimilation. M&aacute;ir&iacute;n Nic Eoin's use of post-colonial literary criticism within an Irish-language context, Tr&eacute;n bhFearann Breac (Cois Life, 2005), is the first major work bringing sustained and sophisticated discourse into a largely neglected academic and cultural field. Diarmait Mac Giolla Chr&iacute;ost in The Irish Language in Ireland (Routledge, 2005) carries substantial sociological theories and public policy recommendations into his survey so as not to let his work languish on a library shelf, but to foment lasting change among agencies and individuals charged with using and fostering Irish today. It is to be hoped that the two conference proceedings will spark further research similarly for Cant/Gammon. Both Irish and Shelta, no matter how defined, deserve intensive analysis.As with Irish-speakers, Travellers too accept that their culture remains only as vibrant as their language. Its declining fluency among the younger cohort means that both academic study and practical application of Cant/Gammon race against an Anglo-American (for it also has endured, cut off from the homeland post-Famine, within Travellers largely in the Southern and Midwestern states) clock. Kirk and &Oacute; Baoill close their preface by urging Travellers to recognise the need for scholarship on their language as well as cooperation between speakers and students of Cant/Gammon. Yet overcoming ingrained suspicions on the part of Travellers towards outside manipulation of their treasured and protected form of communication mean that even for scholars, access will not soon come easily or confidently given by its potential interpreters.Fears of its manipulation and appropriation, as voiced by one Traveller in this book, emerge in abuse hurled in Cant/Gammon at women in and visiting prison, for example, a chilling use of the language against its speakers by guards and police. Such situations only worsen the fears that Travellers possess about appropriation of Cant/Gammon by their oppressors. Delicacy, as shown in the excisions in this anthology, has been chosen as a short-term reaction, but in the longer run, progress cannot continue without cooperation of Travellers. The net is noted wryly as a means by which Dr Binchy's own rarified and rarely reproduced research was, by one diligent American, extracted of its vocabulary on Cant/Gammon and the matching lexicons posted on-line. Binchy synthesises her earlier work, solidified by her MA thesis and Oxford dissertation, into reiterating that--what she refers to by the older term used by early investigators as Shelta-this code builds a barrier between \`us' and \`them'. Not out of contempt or hostility, but out of pride and safety.With Binchy's survey, its use as a small array of largely trading terms may not qualify it among linguists as a language, but she counters that it need not be complicated, and that it sufficed in the commercial contexts for which it emerged, mixing Irish and English words into patterns making terms unrecognisable to outsiders. Unlike its Scottish variety, the Irish version did not borrow from Romany variants popular among British \`gypsies' who overlapped in their trade and contact with Travellers for many centuries; in Ireland, it is debatable but there appears to have been no substantial entry of Roma until very recently, centuries after Shelta had been already constructed.I wish n&iacute; Shuin&eacute;ar had expanded her 1994 considerations (see my review on Amazon.com of 'Irish Travellers: culture & ethnicity', eds. McCann, O Siochain, Ruane from an earlier 90s conference) into the origins of Cant/Gammon. Instead, her paper examines earlier 19-20c scholarship on the language to find it all too wanting. Unfortunately, no other sources can substitute for what she regards as persistently misguided attempts to keep Travellers apart from the more \`orientalised' and \`exotic' Welsh and English \`gypsies'. Her comparisons of modern Dubliners' unknowing English employment of spoken strata originating in Irish make for intriguing analogies; she stresses how also Traveller speakers can not be necessarily conscious of how what they speak is rooted in far older forms of speech. She surmises that Travellers use what is a different form completely of Hiberno-English--akin to how Black English among African Americans denotes its speakers no matter where in the country they are raised; such a spoken substrate as Cant/Gammon still awaits serious analysis.A much-needed perspective from within the Irish language comes from Mich&aacute;el &Oacute; hAodha. He reminds the audience that they need not be embarrassed about the predominance of \`back-formation' as a disguising technique. This rather \\"reflects the richness and antiquity of Shelta'. (57) Although, as with n&iacute; Shuin&eacute;ar's essay, I would prefer to have read more about these origins--for any ethnic group depends upon its past orientation towards origin myths (and fact) as well as a direction towards community continuity into the future-still, his remarks about the previously higher literacy among such Travellers as the Wards (whose Irish surname means mac an bh&aacute;ird =son of the poet/bard) and the prevalence of \`the lettered class' of doctors and healers attributed to predecessors of today's Travellers urge any investigator into the community to remember that current levels of schooling have not always been those among the predecessors of their past. His detection of renewed pride among younger Travellers and their wish that Cant/Gammon not be kept from them as they perpetuate their heritage makes also heartening conclusions for his essay.Marian Browne's paper compares the language to Hiberno-English. While she does not dismiss the speculation that Cant/Gammon may have emerged from Irish-language grammatical patterns, she concurs that in its present form, it blends a non-English lexicon with Hiberno-English syntax. Ricca Edmondson and N&iacute;all &Oacute; Murchadha relate how American, Irish, and Scottish Cant has been attempted to be reconstructed from the limited fieldwork undertaken, with the complicated help (and not mere hindrance as prejudice would assert) of clergy, teachers, and police, some of whom guided the investigators towards contacts scattered over great distances, defying conventional means of communication as they linked together via technologically sophisticated as well as timelessly simple methods. They agree with Binchy that while Cant/Gammon may have intentionally bamboozled outsiders, it also cemented bonds between its users. Ellen McDonagh, Jimmy Power, and an anonymous Traveller provide first-hand reactions to the scholarship presented at the conference. Richard J Waters (who has a website on Travellers now long in need of updating) adds from an American Traveller viewpoint his own critique of earlier research and a reminder from within the community to open up within reason the treasure of Cant/Gammon for further research and preservation. He points intriguingly back to its ancient Indo-European etymological roots and the early traders known to us as the Beaker Folk, while at the same time urging the restoration and perpetuation of these remnants of communication that may go back not centuries but millennia. Waters' own independent scholarship, in my opinion, is precisely what editors Kirk and &Oacute; Baoill urge: from within as well as beyond Travellers own experiences, strengthened by academic foundations, a truer knowledge of Cant/Gammon awaits.Mary Burke delves into literary representations of Cant/Gammon, ranging from Victorian scholars (dovetailing with n&iacute; Shuin&eacute;ar's essay) into 20 c work from writer Juanita Casey (of English Romany/Irish Traveller parentage), Bryan MacMahon's undercover assumption of posing as a Traveller through his own disguise, Maurice Walsh's romanticised depictions, and the Tuam band The Saw Doctors' own incorporation of Traveller terms (even the name of their group) into their lyrics. Tuam playwright Tom Murphy and especially the \`hybrid' John F McDonald's novel Tribe reveal changing adaptations by Travellers as their formerly protected linguistic and communal spaces have become opened at least in part to the \`country people'. Burke's notion of an \`alternative geography' (I thought of Bruce Chatwin's popularisation in Songlines of the aboriginal Australian strategies of tracing connections across a landscape) for Travellers meshes well with her challenge that Cant/Gammon represents the refusal of this language to fall into binary English-or-Gaelic comparisons, in its fluid and musical existence that transcends and frustrates the printed page.Certainly, as I have earlier addressed, the inability of a reader to enter fully into the bracketed, glossed, and absent language of Cant/Gammon in this anthology due to Traveller caution and pride both presents a rather post-modern, as well as subversive, predicament for any \`buffer' wishing to colonise this contested realm for a safely Anglophonic hegemonically literate space. The notions of space and time, without sounding romantic, do differ among competing languages and cultures, and even in 21st c Ireland, the dogged survival of Travellers and their speech reminds us of the revolutionary nature of those who resist and frustrate the dominant, the powerful, and the rigid, within long-contested Irish cultural-political terrain.[Edited from 'To Go On: Irish Travellers meet academia' at the on-line Belfast-based journal The Blanket.]"},{"Title":"Journal of Recreational Mathematics, Vol. 21 , No. 4, 1989","review":"As co-editor of Journal of Recreational Mathematics, what I present here is the contents of this issue with no commentary.

However, accomplishing what the Rebels could not, the British caused the white population of the South to stand against a common enemy by badly misplaying the slavery issue. The Pre-Revolution Southern economy was based on labor intensive staple crops (tobacco, rice, and indigo) which required slave labor to be successful. So much labor was required that in many areas of the South the slave population outnumbered the white population. Consequently, Southerners greatly feared slave revolt. Although the British did not make it official policy, they gave the appearance of being sympathetic to slaves (particularly Clinton's policy of limited emancipation). This tactic frightened the white Southerners and encouraged thousands of slaves to flee their plantations creating economic hardship for the plantation owners. Some slaves fled into the wilderness, while others fled to the British Army and were either incorporated into the army, or at least traveled with the army. This British policy, or non-policy, pushed the white Southerners to independence. Ironically, American independence resulted in continued slavery for blacks and an increase in racial tensions. The Southerners, still outnumbered by slaves which they were feverishly importing to rebuild their plantations, and with the fear of slave revolts fresh in their minds, passed laws that divided the races, dealt harshly with any slave that stepped out of line, and specifically disenfranchised free blacks.The black liberation movement continued as a struggle for cultural power within the context of religion. Evangelical religion did not become accepted in the South until its pr! eachers dropped the anti-slavery rhetoric. But, these Southern Baptist and Southern Methodist preachers didn't just ignore slavery, they preached that Christianity condoned slavery. They were allowed to preach to slaves because their message was that the slave's religious duty was to obey his master. While a great many slaves converted to Christianity, their interpretation of Christian theology and morality differed from that of white Southerners. Afro-Christianity, the black church movement, began before the Revolution and was the center of cultural, ethnic, and community identity. In the church, they were something other than &quot;someone's property.&quot; Although whites attempted to squash the movement after the great Vesey Plot of 1822, Afro-Christianity had already spread as far away as Kentucky. Afro-Christianity incorporated African cultural elements into Christianity and unified and organized the black community. The white Southerners had hoped that Christianity would incorporate blacks into a white-dominated society, instead it was the vehicle by which blacks were able to extricate themselves from white society and create a different value system and community."},{"Title":"Water from the Rock","review":"In no way is this an attempt to augment Geoffrey's excellent review of this text, for I believe that he hit upon the major strenghts of Frey's book. However, it is worth mentioning, for the sake of those scholars that take particular notice of the bibliograhys, that Frey's research seems particularly solid, having used sources that generally are not considered on this side of the Atlantic when considering the American Revolutionary War. Most notable of these are public war records from Great Britain, which help give a more full understanding of the role of African &quot;Americans&quot; within the Revolutionary War.In all, Frey's text is a solid and comprehensive study with some minor, yet somewhat forgivable flaws. For example, despite the presence of slaves in areas such as Pennsylvania and New York, Frey ignores everying in America north of Maryland (with the exception of some slave relocations in Novia Scotia). Furthermore, her presumptions of a present republican ideology seems somewhat misplaced at times, but generally, these are minors flaws in an otherwise compelling argument.A certain recomendation!"},{"Title":"Water from the Rock","review":"I bought this as required reading for a class on the Revolutionary War. I think I read maybe half a chapter before I gave up. Too wordy and too much text on the pages (college students will feel my pain on that... don't you just hate it when they squeeze so many flippin' letters on a page? Makes your eyes hurt!).I appreciate the unique perspective that the book and research offers, but it just was not as interesting as I would've hoped.Neither was the class though, I stopped going about mid way through the semester and took the fail...."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"&quot;Take your satisfaction not from whether the putt drops but from whether you got yourself in the right frame of mind to hit it.&quot; That quote summarizes the key point of this book.Think of Dr. Bob Rotella as someone who sees putting as being totally about controlling your mental processes, to eliminate the effect of your conscious mind. He is at the opposite end of the spectrum from Dave Pelz's engineering-based evaluations. I find much value in both approaches. Having taken lessons at Dave Pelz's Short Game School, one of the most useful parts was getting an automatic routine and rhythm for putting that clears my mind of tension-creating thoughts.The advice in the book is easy to understand, but you will probably find it hard to apply. I suggest that you find a pro to help you create a mind-clearing routine that you feel comfortable with. Then commit to using that routine always.Here are a few quotes that will give you a further sense of the book's advice:&quot;No matter how skilled you are . . . you're going to have to make roughly 40 percent of your shots with your putter.&quot;When you arrive at the green, you're going to think: &quot;Oh good! Now we get to putt!&quot;You will &quot;just focus on the target.&quot; You will have &quot;selective amnesia&quot; about putts you've missed in the past.You will spend 15 minutes a night &quot;visualizing making putts.&quot;Before putting, you will be &quot;always relaxed and confident.&quot;During the putt, you will &quot;putt as though the putt [is] conceded.&quot;When you putt, you will &quot;simply let the putt go and trust.&quot;I especially liked the metaphors from other sports like shooting baskets and making passes in football. Those actions are done in the flow of play, rather than in some rigid, controlled way with the conscious mind.The book has interesting sections on how to practice putting, and what top putters say about how they go about putting. Many of the pros quoted in the book use Dr. Rotella's methods, so they will help you to understand the message here. You will also find an exercise to encourage you to practice your chipping so you will have shorter putts to make.One of the most difficult aspects of any activity is explaining how champions think about the activity while they are doing it. I think that Dr. Rotella has done an outstanding job of sharing that information here.After you have finished enjoying and starting to apply this book to your putting, I suggest that you think about other places where you are trying to use your conscious mind when subconscious processes might work better. Imagine if you always tried to ride a bike by thinking about each thing that you do. That wouldn't be much fun or very successful, would it? Where do you find yourself tied up in tense knots now? That's where you need to let go.Trust yourself to accomplish more!"},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"I subscribe to a bunch of golf magazines. I own and occasionally re-read many of the best-selling golf instructional books ever written, including Golf Is A Game of Confidence. Most are good for knocking 1-3 strokes off your game per round over the course of 6-9 months. But this tape, with its suggestions for a simpler pre-shot routine and mind-clearing suggestions has taken 3-5 strokes off my putting alone in just 2 months. I listened to it 10 times before even trying out the suggestions, just to make sure they were ingrained in my thinking. It has actually made putting fun for me, rather than an afterthought. His bottom line: we let far too many thoughts run through our mind when we play golf, especially when we putt. His simple drills will help to keep self-doubt off the putting green. Spend the $...."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"If you are looking for a book that is a once informative and entertaining, you have to get this one. What I found interesting in this book are the insights that the author gives us as to how pros and ordinary players think, or should think when preparing to putt. He discusses the importance of the pre-shot routine . As 40% of the shots made in the course of a game are putts, it's simple logic that such a book should interest all golfers whatever the state of their game. If you wish elevate your game another notch, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"This book is a very enjoyable read and has many \\"Dr. Bob\\" insights that will help golfers of all levels. Unfortunately on the heels of his classic \\"Golf Is Not A Game Of Perfect\\" this exposition on putting is less fulfilling, but very good nonetheless. Ultimately the book recommends the following: 1) focus on the process of putting (developing a standard mental and physical pre-shot routine to clear your mind), not the mechanics or outcome of each putt; 2) don't worry about mechanics during practice or course putting, just focus on the target and aim to put each putt in the hole; and 3) the more relaxed and positive you are about your putting and the experience of putting the better the results will be. The messages in the book are simple. While they seem redundant at times the lessons are valuable and the book is an enjoyable and beneficial 4-5 hour read. As the author points out, 40% of strokes are putts so it's worth putting time into improving this part of your game."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"My golf game has been transformed by this CD. What is so valuable is the perspective he offers on the mental side of the game. I was a horrible putter only a couple of months ago, shooting in the mid to upper 80's, and my handicap of 8 was rising. After listening to this,practicing what he recommends, I just won my flight and low net champion at the Club, shooting a 1 over total for 2 days! It does work."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"If incorporated, you will improve your putting DRAMATICALLY!"},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"So simple....gives good practice drills and backs up recommendations with real data...a must read!! Doesnt try to change anything about your technique just improves what you have."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"This book was great. Rotella guides you right off that path you've been walking that's called the mental approach to putting. One of the biggest things you should learn from this book is that you won't make every putt you look at. What's more, is that Rotella tells you why you won't make every putt and then goes on to show you how you can think that you're a great putter even though you're not sinking every putt. Read this book carefully, once your putting improves your whole game will because you won't put pressure on yourself to hit everything close.Buy this book now!!!!"},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"All us linksters know that putting is where the score is at. Rotella's approach is mindclearing, taking away all the anxieties that can creep in. His admonition to have a rigid, preshot ritual which relaxes, then give yourself the best chance every time to putt for the ball to go in, is freeing.I listen to this tape on the drive to the course. Amazing what this approach will do for the shortstick."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much from a book on the mental aspect of putting. I pretty much already think the way the book tells you to so it didn't improve my outlook on how I approach putting. There wasn't too much that I took away from the book so wasn't that great for me. The book pretty much tells you to have confidence in the fact that you will sink your putt."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"This is all about the mental side of the golf game focusing on putting. It was easy to read and understand and perhaps it would have helped me more if I had read it again. Not my favorite golf book."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"I RECOMMEND HIGHLY. THIS TAPE REALLY PUTS YOU IN A BETTER FRAME OF MIND IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH PUTTING. VERY WELL DONE."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Dr. Bob aides putters with not expecting to hole every putt, but to make each and every putt have the great chance of dropping.From routine to feel to rhythm to confidence, Rotella provides in this good read the mental expertise he has demonstrated in his work with golfing greats. Now, it's here for all golfers.I find to listen to the tape on the way to the course helps prepare me for a great day of putting."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Good stuff.

It helped me quite a bit. Hope it helps you too."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"This book was the first book that I have read that is about putting. I enjoyed it very much and I would also recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book that will help your mental game. I feel with reading this book I have learned many thing that will help me next time I step on a green."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Having been a 6-10 handicap golfer for 30+ years I was being frustrated by missing short putts. This book lets you know the problem is not technique and doesn't need gimmicks to fix. Helped me the first round I played after reading only the first couple of chapters. Highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"It is mind blowing to me to see so many five star reviews. This book is, AT BEST, a good article in Golf Digest. Okay, here is the summary...1) Clear your head and don't think of anything other than putting; 2) Believe you are a good putter because if you believe in yourself you will be a good putter. That's it gang. Take those concepts and wrap some lame stories around some pro golfers who used that technique and you've got 150 pages of the lightest, breeziest, contentless book you've ever read.Oh, it was funny to read the part about Davis Love and how he practices. According to the book Davis takes only one ball to the practice green and practices single puts to many locations. Well, wasn't I surprised to see Davis Love on the TV this weekend in the 2012 PGA Championship and guess what! He had two balls!"},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"If you are going to play golf you need to read this book. It changed my attitude about putting. A lot of pro's count on Dr. Bob for help."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Only part of the way through this book but can tell you that I've dropped 2 strokes off my handicap already. Mind blowing."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Short, clear, and effective, Rotella's book opens a new window on putting, and for that matter on playing the game. So much of golf is between the ears -- especially putting -- and clearly this is Rotella's playground. I'd recommend this (and have recommended it) to anyone at any handicap level."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"After reading this book I can reflect on more of putting as stroking your putts rather than trying to force the ball to fall into the hole. I was able to think about how to make the ball go along the line of the putt and simply fall in. The putting aspect was to make it seem simple and effortless and thats what its all about."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"This was a gift for my grandson, an avid golfer. He was very happy with the book."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"This book tells you what great putters think . . . or don't think while putting.

This mental and technical guide to putting will help you improve your form."},{"Title":"Putting Out Of Your Mind","review":"Very straightforward and comensensical. Seems everything we read these days is about positive thinking. And it does work along with a good basic set up. I especially like his instruction that once you are over the ball, don't wait there and let negative thoughts sneak in. Go ahead and hit the ball. He says to trust your first instinct when you read a putt and I have always found that to be true.

It's a very good book!"},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"On the cover of my book it says &quot;Her (Iris Murdoch) wise, witty and compulsive novel. I have spent many hours of my life reading a wide variety of &quot;important&quot; authors, and finally got around to reading Iris Murdoch. The fact that IM is a philosopher was an added attraction to me.What to say. The only one word description of this novel that comes to my mind is &quot;pedestrian&quot;. It was an easy read. It had a few interesting people in it, and they had various issues in need of resolution. The story moves along at a good pace, but something is really lacking. I am sorry, but I did not find it &quot;wise, witty and compulsive&quot;. I found it to be a plain, uninspired narrative.Perhaps I picked the wrong Murdoch book. I'll try another one soon."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I begain to study this book as part as my a level english corse this year. I really liked the book and found it enjoyable. There is only one thing i can say about it: Has any one ever written a study guide? If you know of one please let me know. But I found this book a very good read. I suggest you read it too. My favouite character was dora Greenfeild. The book starts off when she has left her husband and then desides to return to him. At the present time he is working in a lay community. The other people living in this community are all completly mixed up. There is a new bell on the way to the abbey and the old one is rediscovered but trouble is lerkin everywhere."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"The Bell is an exceptional book.It resonates with spirituality. It reverberates with sensuality. It probes our identity and reveals a broad spectrum of darkness and light.In The Bell things are not as they seem. Murdoch creates a world in which nothing is mundane. See for instance how she describes the transforming magic of the evening sun: \\"They came quite suddenly out of the wood onto the wide expanse of grass near the drive. The great scene, the familiar scene, was there again before them, lit by a very yellow and almost vanished sun, the sky fading to a greenish blue. From here they looked a little down upon the lake and could see, intensely tinted and very still, the reflection in it of the farther slope and the house, clear and pearly grey in the revealing light, its detail sharply defined, starting into nearness. Beyond it on the pastureland, against a pallid line at the horizon, the trees took the declining sun, and one oak tree, its leaves already turning yellow, seemed to be on fire\\".Imber Court is the site of a lay community of spiritual seekers. They are struggling on a path of sanctification - living lives of hopeful but naive becoming. Across the brooding waters of a mysterious lake is Imber Abbey; a cloistered community presumably of those who already have become. The Abbey is imbued with supernatural power and light, even as a dark magic lurks beneath the surface of the lake. None in the community of seekers will escape this power encounter unscathed - though in the end for some there is a kind of freedom.This is a classic in every sense of the word and one that can be read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This story opens with Dora Greenfield, a creative spirit who has trapped herself in a marriage where the husband spends more time degrading her than nurturing her. She's ran away and shacked up with another free spirit but this doesn't last for long and she ends up following her husband Paul, an art historian, to a small community of God-fearing people who have set up a settlement out side a nunnery called Imber Abbey. This group is lead by Micheal Meade, a man with his own secrets and internal turmoil. Micheal owns the land outside the Abbey which the members affectionately call Imber Court. These two seem like the most unlikely duo to establish a relationship with one another but without knowing it they do.There are a host of other characters that affect their lives in both positive and negative ways. There's Noel the journalist, Toby the student, Nick the renegade, Catherine the future nun, Murphy the dog, and Gabriel... the bell. A reference to an old church bell buried in the sludge of the lake between the Abbey and the Court is made throughout the book giving it a position of an important character. Dora even suggests as much when the bell is finally unearthed. \\"She came near to the bell which seemed more and more like a living presence.\\"There are a number of strong issues throughout the Bell but the most dominant is religion. This is followed by a healthy dose of homosexuality, marriage and adultery. Some sources site a strong theme of good and evil (probably associated with religious beliefs) but I think evil is really too harsh a term. There are no real evil people or situations in this story. It's about a group of people trying to make it through this life as best they know how while dealing with the foreseen, unforeseen and exaggerated bumps they encounter along the way. Murdoch does use her philosophical background to insert interesting questions along the way like: \\"Could one recognize refinements of good if one did not recognize refinements of evil?\\"Iris Murdoch's The Bell is her fourth of twenty-six published novels. It was released in 1958 but takes place in England in the late forties. This is my second Murdoch novel and I found it flows and is much more vivid in detail than her first book, Under the Net. While I felt this book was certainly better than my first taste of Murdoch, as a whole it bored the heck out of me. Seriously, after the first chapter until they brought up the bell I was bored silly. I realized that is quite a subjective statement but if I had not committed myself to reading all her books I probably would have stopped here. Language differences often slow story down: \\"After breakfast he repaired as usual to the estate office to cast an eye over the day's correspondence (page 88).\\" Or just unusual, \\"From within the dog's barking was redoubled (page 53).\\" And while cliche is perfectly understandable to most I think it's the easy way for someone who was considered such an established writer. Perhaps it is still too early in her works for me to recognize her greatness. Reviewed by M. E. Wood."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Images from this book will echo in your memory. Symbolism and characters not so much.It is alot like finding a fabulous old tea set at the flea market. The discovery is so much fun, you forgive the fact there are a couple of chips in the saucer.May you enjoy the nun swimming to the rescue as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I love Murdoch and I love everything she writes. This novel had a particular focus on the religious life-- not faith exactly, but rather religious practice, icons and rituals. My favorite character was the least seen-- the Mother of the convent. She seemed, to me, to be the only character who had faith in addition to all the trappings of religion."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"2 stars actually! This is one selection from the first list of the 1001 books you must read before you die (and now it can be said that I read it). Perhaps, at the time it was written, it was a surprisingly refreshing read, but this literary novel has many flawed characters from Dora, the wife who doesn't know how or want to be a wife, to her husband Paul, an abusive man who loves Dora, to Michael, who has desires of the flesh that don't coincide with his desire to be a man of the cloth. None truly find happiness, but some of them find their lives to be okay. One of the most repeated words in the text: rebarbative (I had to look it up myself)!"},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"There's nothing much to say about this novel, since its characterization and story are already presented in these sixteen reviews, many of them being written by Murdoch's devotees. An additional point however might be that Murdoch does not make-up fictions. Characters' and place names, historical happenings, religious texts, etc imbue fictional facts with two or three allusions. To recognize these parallels is an exercise of memory and astute reading because the reader gets entangled in the emotional excitements of Toby, Dora, Michael, and others as a swimmer in the lake's slimy weeds or a walker on the unexpected forest path. One replay occurs between the monastery's legend of the trespasser and nun and the penetrating actions of Toby and Catherine, who respectively go deeper beyond the cloister's outer wall and into the wood and lake. The reader knows the mental workings of main characters and perceives how their companions assess them. Murdoch however does not reveal everyone's interior, keeping opaque the minds of Nick, Catherine, the Straffords, etc, who nevertheless are assessed by the lay community members. All is contained in the whole -- the still lake through which the mechanical noise cuts, the judgments of fitting in or being out, restrictive rules and wild freedom, the mixed-up attraction of males and females, the invisible life within the cloister and the open-air visibility of the laymen, and the retreat into innocence and the running with experience. This novel packs in everything as if the author is creating the world, consecrating A to Z with love rather than assessment. Each evolving, imperfect character is acceptable and valid without extraneous impositions. S/he naturally heads in the direction of the good."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I read before Her 'severe head' and 'Italian Girl'.Although both were very interesting , my favourite one is the 'Bell'. All characters were very interesting and Michael's passion for men were so real that makes you think a man can really be in love with another man . The idea about the bell was fantastic . I really recommend you to read it ."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Held my attention but not as funny and devastating or as well crafted at The Black Prince. Still worth reading for her brave exploration of homosexuality and repression alone."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I have to say of the two novels I read by Dame Iris Murdoch. I liked this one better than the other one which one the Booker Prize in 1978. Murdoch was an extraordinary person who appeared ordinary to us but had an amazing mind. I think that's part of the problem. She expects others to be similar as well, cerebral or trying to get somewhere higher than lower. Her characters in both novels never really appear content with their lives. While I love the novel cover on both texts, I found Iris' writing to be superb in bringing to life about mundane characters. I think Iris was a great observer in humanity and what she saw as their failings. In life, she was happily married for almost 50 years to John Bayley and led a very active career in the colleges and publishing. Her novels are not set to be easy but an labyrinth of wonder, questions, expectations, and disappointments. Iris' wrote longhand and she wasn't viewed as typically attractive but seen as fun and intelligent beyond belief. She was one of a kind. I don't think it ever occurred to her to leave John ever. THeir relationship was a union based on mutual trust, respect, understanding, and intelligence. They talked about the radio soap, THe ARchers, and lived without a television but in a pigsty. Of course, it was their home. IRis wrote this novel which showed her enormous capacity to love humanity when it doesn't love itself. It's sad but I think Iris was hoping that we evolved higher and sought comforts in the cerebral world. Sorry but I don't most of us have it in us and we resort to settling for spouses, lovers, friends, and jobs much like her characters. Even in this book, Dora seeks happiness elsewhere than London and her marriage. You wonder how many Doras are out there. It's interesting but Iris in both this and The Sea The Sea never really explored children as characters. Both novels seem utterly barren without the presence of children or babies. Maybe because Iris had no use for them herself in her own life, she does not include them in her novels. Maybe the adult characters are the children finding themselves and what makes them happy, content, or satisfied. We know what makes people unhappy, discontent, and unsatisfied."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Like to think i know the Malvern Hills et al. areas of Glouchestershire pretty well but even so this book completely took me by surprise. The insights and life lessons throughout were unobtrusive and the subtlety of putting all these very different people together and watching the relationships grow was really interesting."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"The Bell is the only Murdoch novel I've really liked. I've read it, probably, dozens of times, and it improves with each read. The language is of a poetic quality - my test for this is that it's best when read out loud.The theme of the book is the nature of human goodness, and the impossibility of human perfection. Murdoch was an Oxford Reader in Moral Philosophy at the time, and was well capable of producing a very dry account of this subject, but instead the book is a masterpiece of subtle comedy which gets its serious ideas across with great subtlety. The first two chapters, in particular, draw the reader into the life of the heroine with a piece of sustained artistry that is quite unparalleled, at least in my experience. It's a gorgeous piece of prose that I never tire of reading.Dora, the heroine (and I use the term deliberately), is presented as a totally amoral being (and therefore, like the dog, without sin). She is incapable of deciding to &quot;do the right thing&quot;, but also incapable of real wrong-doing. All the other characters are in some way struggling with their own moral turpitude, and in trying to intellectualize their struggle, accellerate their approaching doom. Dora meanwhile, guided only by her animal instincts, emerges as a Saint, cheered on at every stage by the reader (well, this reader at least). Furthermore, Dora's redemption occurs in spite of, rather than because of, the moral and intellectual strictures of Organised Religion. You cheer for Dora as she leaves the Chapel in disgust, just as you cheer for Austen's Elizabeth Bennet when she faces down Lady Catherine. It's that good!The Bell of the title is a symbol of untrammelled female sexuality that resounds throughout the book. This theme is explored, ironically, in a plot which takes place around the grounds of a convent. There's a disturbing painting by Millais called &quot;The Vale of Rest&quot; that I think must have inspired Murdoch. The picture of nuns digging a grave is a wonderful image of Victorian male sexual terror (conceived, incidentally, by Millais on his honeymoon). In the backgound swings the bell. When moved, it must sound.Apart from Dora, most of the other characters emerge from the events of the plot with their lives in ruins. Dora, in contrast, learns to value herself by finally detaching herself from the awful man she had married.I'm very conscious of the fact that not all readers would share my interpretation of the book, and in all probability Murdoch didn't mean it that way. She was on record as saying that if she'd known how readers would feel about Dora's awful husband, she would have treated him more sympathetically. But the book is as it is, and as a description of the triumph of the Human Spirit over priests and pedants, it's just fine for me.Incidentally, it was made into a very good television version by the BBC about 20 years ago. I hope they repeat it one day."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Iris Murdoch (1919-1999) spent most of her life working as a philosophy teacher at St. Anne's College, Oxford. During this presumably busy occupation, she wrote 26 novels, five plays, a collection of poetry, and five philosophical texts. I need to remember this the next time I have trouble getting out of bed because I am feeling a little tired. Just imagine writing 26 novels! And these are not simple tales banged out and published with a quick proofing. Murdoch wrote intricate, deeply emotional novels examining the psychological and philosophical implications of this crazy ride we call life. Murdoch's character driven writings work themselves out within carefully constructed, highly symbolic atmospheres full of intense sights and sounds. I once described Murdoch as a creator of universes, and that is exactly what she accomplishes in this highly acclaimed 1958 novel, \\"The Bell.\\" Unfortunately, Penguin got A.S. Byatt to do the introduction to the book. Byatt may be a highly regarded author, but her introductions are excruciating exercises in literary criticism that tax the hardiest souls. Skip the intro and dive right in.\\"The Bell\\" is a story about a group of very unhappy people living in a sort of quasi-religious support group home, called Imber Court, outside of Imber Abbey. The abbey is the home of a group of cloistered nuns who avoid having outsiders enter the abbey grounds. The big event for the abbey and the residents of Imber Court is the installation of a spanking new bell at the abbey. The bell will take the place of the long missing medieval bell lost in the mists of time. As the important event draws ever closer, Murdoch describes several of the residents of Imber Court in minute detail, leaving almost nothing to the imagination in her descriptions of the these fatally flawed yet likeable people.Several of the characters receive such loving attention from Murdoch that it is difficult to discern who is the main character. It is probably Dora Greenfield, as Murdoch opens and closes the novel with this seemingly shallow yet complex character. Dora goes to Imber to renew her relationship with Paul, her scholar husband who is staying at Imber Court in order to do research on manuscripts at the abbey. Paul is a jerk, a jealous, controlling twit who seeks to dominate every aspect of Dora's life. Dora likes to live the free life of the city, but oscillates between romantic affairs and the discipline she feels she needs from Paul. When Dora nervously arrives at Imber, she quickly becomes acquainted with some of the other lost souls rambling around the grounds. Arguably, the most important figure is Michael Meade, the leader of the community who has more problems than some of the people in his charge. A constant source of irritation to Michael is the presence of Nick, a man who Michael had an affair with years before. This affair resulted in Michael's expulsion from the teaching profession and a serious setback to his hopes of becoming a priest. Other characters fill the pages of \\"The Bell,\\" such as Catherine, Nick's sister who is in training to enter the abbey; James Tayper Pace, a jovial chap and potential rival to Michael's leadership; and Toby, a young lad doing service at Imber before he enters Oxford.While we go far into the heads of a few characters, Murdoch refuses to reveal to us the inner workings of other characters. This is not as frustrating as it sounds, for the depth of psychological insight we get into Dora and Michael more than makes up for the absence of other character analyses. Murdoch has a real flair for the workings of the human mind, and she makes her probing examinations so effortless that they leave the reader in absolute wonder at her abilities. You come to know these people better than they know themselves, seeing all of their awkward, painful foibles and the inevitable collisions they face in the future.Imber is a created universe, with Murdoch as all-knowing deity. The descriptive passages concerning the grounds of Imber are brilliantly detailed, putting the reader directly in the characters' world. Murdoch's creation is of such vivid totality that the occasional trips the characters take outside the grounds reveal a world of dullness and emptiness. Only when the characters return to Imber does comfort return. I cannot recall an author who has created this effect to such an amazing degree. It makes \\"The Bell\\" a fascinating book, more of an experience than a mundane read.Imber itself (meaning the grounds, the lake, the house, and the abbey) seem to me to be a microcosm of the world and the heavens. Imber Court represents the world, full of imperfect, lowly creatures yearning for salvation. The abbey is heaven, barely approachable except through occasional visits to a sealed prayer room and the rare glimpse of one of the nuns. Those that do go inside are quickly ushered out again, as though their imperfections prevent them from staying there for long. When carefully looked for, all sorts of religious symbolisms appear (the bell takes a dip in the lake before entering the abbey: is it in need of a sort of baptism before it can enter the abbey? The fact that part of the bridge crossing the lake from the house to the abbey was severed at one time is interesting.). Remember, Murdoch creates universes.Ultimately, only one character seems to find redemption at the conclusion of the story. Perhaps Murdoch is showing us that few among us ever find solace in this world. Whatever she is saying, it is worth reading \\"The Bell\\" in an attempt to seek it out. Murdoch is not for everyone, but everyone should make an effort to read one Murdoch book. This novel will stay in your head for a long time afterwards."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This profound and haunting novel features Murdoch's unique blend of religious preoccupations, sexual politics, and philosophy (or, as she more accurately referred to it elsewhere, \\"moral psychology\\")--but, in spite of its many-layered symbolism, it still manages to be surprisingly suspenseful. If you've never read a book by Iris Murdoch and are interested in finding a good place to start, read \\"The Bell.\\"A sort of psychological detective novel, the story is told through the eyes a leader of a lay religious community who is haunted by secrets from his past and also from the perspective of two visitors: a carefree woman returning to her boorish husband who is studying at a nearby convent and an innocent youth hoping to be inspired by the community's spiritual atmosphere before he goes to Oxford. The plot revolves around a bell missing for centuries and the community's plans to replace it with a new one, but I will say nothing else that might give it away.The first half of the book is a very British comedy of manners (and it is at times very funny), but then things get out of hand when the two visitors, both knowingly and unwittingly, set into motion a series of tragic events that shatter the faith and foundations of the group. Although I was constantly surprised by the book's twists and turns, when I finished the novel I felt that all the events were very nearly pre-ordained by the actions and ethics of its characters.Murdoch's genius is her ability to pose many complicated questions and provide just enough for readers to decide for themselves. Are the visitors responsible for destroying the community's equanimity or were they simply the catalyst that exposed the hypocrisies and self-centeredness of the commune's members? Must a person transcend selfishness in order to influence others for the better? Does it take tragedy to bring out the best in people? Is it ever really possible to wall oneself away from the rest of the world?It seems almost incidental in this day and age to acknowledge that the novel portrays two gay men in a sympathetic manner astonishing for a book published in 1958--yet another aspect that displays the power and forwardness of Murdoch's thinking."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"The first fifty or so pages of Iris Murdoch's The Bell chronicle how the terminally confused but kind Dora Greenfield leaves her emotionally sadistic husband only to retun in a still more confused mixture of guilt, fear and love. Murdoch's tone here is gently satarical and distant. In that opening act I found her wit amusing, never involving. Alarmingly it reminded me of highschool, when the Literature was rich, witty and clinical. It reminded me of homework.It is only in the second act when Dora joins her husband in the religious community of Imber that it becomes clear the author is building to what will ultimatly become one of the most remarkable examinations of faith I've ever read. The novel achieves critical mass with the introduction of Michael Meade, the founder of the community. He has always struggled with his homosexuality, and deep down we sense that in a bizzare way he enjoys the struggle &quot;like the souls in Dante who deliberately remained within the purifying fire&quot;. He believes that the struggle is faith, where he gets to define his own morality. By contrast the community's other figure head, the large affable James believes in clear black and white terms &quot;Sodomy is not disgusting its just forbidden&quot;, unlike Michael he believes that innoccense and authority are the measure of faith. While this unacknowledged philosophical debate wages on, Imber's cast of characters get into such a tangled web of flirtations, jealousy and mis-understanding so brilliantly weaved by Murdoch that we only upon reflection do we question the character's motivations.Right across from Imber is the Abbey where a faceless, nameless order of Nuns go about their business. We meet three of these nuns, the powerful Abbess who seems to know everything and is always bearing a smile. Sister Ursula who is her attache, and who also is constantly smiling. Finally there is Sister Clare, and as she saves a woman from drowning, Murdoch takes the time to point out that she too is smiling. The nuns are ever present, watching, mocking these mortals who can not give up the world but sill seek the Hereafter. As Murdoch observes &quot;Violence is born out of the desire to escape oneself&quot;. And all these characters are desperatly trying to escape. This is coupled by the much darker suggestion that although God exists and is just, he can also be uncaring. Why would he create homosexuality only to condemn it? Late in the game Michael observes that there is God but he may not believe in Him.It is clear from The Bell that Murdoch is not only a novelist but a philosopher(and indeed this is confirmed in the sleeve notes). The ideas, reflections and themes are far too complex to discuss here. But there are sequences so perfectly and soulbearingly written that they warrant reading the book more then once. What starts as a gentle satire grows a heart without ever losing its sense of humour or even a sense of whimsy. Although sometimes distant, the novel is never tedious. And if there is a lesson, then its the lesson Michael learns &quot;Love ought to be given without fear of its imperfection&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I just finished this novel a half hour ago and am moved to write immediately. It was one of the most moving and staggering novels I've read in my life (and I''ve read countless of the &quot;major&quot; works). What begins as an almost Austenian comedy of manners becomes a glorious, compelling novel of ideas, of the relationship between action and meditation and of the complicated ways of love. Filmed once for British TV, it would make a splendid film, particularly now that homosexuality is no longer taboo. Michael and Dora emerge as unlikely, yet extraordinary heroes, whose lives I will wonder about for a long, long time."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"I am studying 'The Bell' for A Level English Literature along with 'The End of the Affair' by Graham Greene and 'Loitering with Intent' by Muriel Spark. I enjoyed 'The Bell' and the fact that it is very easy to read probably attributed to this. The relationships between many of the characters worked well, especially between Michael and Nick. The links then between this relationship and Michael's feelings for Toby was also well constructed. Dora, as the main protaganist, is very skillfully developed and many parts of the book are written from her point of view. Another point which deserves praise is Murdoch's excellent physical description of Imber, this made the place seem realistic and also supports the intended images of the characters, for example Nick. Catherine is probably the only character that did not fully work, however this is mainly true towards the end. The plot is interesting and moves at a resonable pace with the main charaters becoming increasingly intriging. However, the book could be looked at on a deeper, more philosphical/religious level with characters such as the Abbess playing more of a symbolic part than the others. This is a book about community and the strive for perfection. The characters, though all very different, have a common need for salvation and through Imber have hope for this despite their pasts. 'The Bell' is enjoyable on several levels, it is both sad and humorous although I didn't find it quite as witty as the cover led me to expect. I would also highly recommend the other two books mentioned, especially if one wants to further investigate some of the themes raised in 'The Bell'."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This beautifully constructed novel begins and ends with a description of Dora Greenfield. I feel that it is Dora who makes this novel. All of the other characters are hugely inadequate, struggling as they are with the constant dilemma of how to deal with the pleasure of life. Dora has no qualms she knows that life can be full of fear ( the reason she returns to Imber Court and her estranged husband) but she desperately wants to live, to enjoy sensual pleasure. It is not possible to detach sensuality from fear in this novel. The bell is a symbol of this fear, it sits under the water, discovered by Toby. Toby has a sexual encounter with Dora which is interrupted by the bell resounding. Toby has a sexual encounter with Michael, who is obsessed with the new bell, seeing it as a source of liberation from his sexual imprisonment, from this sensuality which he despises.I really enjoyed this novel. It is almost perfect in form. The characters are explored slowly with wonderful skill they are slowly revealed to us .I would highly recommend this book for anyone seeking an introduction to Iris Murdoch's work"},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"After the burst of Modernist fiction in the first half of this century, it's refreshing to know that a novelist can return to a more traditional mode of writing in the Eliot-James lineage with success. &quot;The Bell&quot; is a great novel, with an admirable balance between direct dialogue, philosophical reflection, and psychological depiction, and between describing characters' motives with completeness and omitting enough so that the reader is surprised by the turn of events at the novel's climax. This is the way novels are supposed to be written."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"This early ('50's) Murdoch novel is quite a surprise. I wasn't expecting such an entertaining read. One would not expect it from the plot (misfits gathered at a religious retreat), or the dated themes of religious piety and homosexuality. But I found it an absorbing and fast read.Murdoch seems to have a talent for getting into the minds of her characters such that their thoughts are our thoughts; one knows exactly where they are coming from because one would have the same set of thoughts. Never a false note tracking the internal dialogue of Toby and Michael."},{"Title":"The Bell","review":"Dame Iris Murdoch(1919-1999) was a Dublin born philosophy scholar from Oxford University. Not only did this brilliant woman produce several works of philosophy but she was also a first rate novelist. Her works are noted for being:a. Richly crafted scenes writtein in stunning prose rich with the smell, taste, feel and beauty of the English landscape.b. She deals honestly with real men and women as three dimensional characters.c. Her works are filled with abstruse and important questions in the realms of revealed religion and philosophy. She takes time to develop our understanding of the chief protagonist in her long elegantly written works.d. Her books are rich in symbolism. They can be read on a literal level but also in an allegorical and religious way.Synopsis of the plot of \\"The Bell\\" which was published by Murdoch in 1958:The long novel tells the story of a lay community of Anglicans who run a market garden near Imber Abbey. The Abbey may symoblize heaven and the commune of lay believers reflects our fallen world of sin, love, hate and death. The story concerns the installation of a new bell in the abbey. Meanwhile, one of the characters Toby discovers that underneath the lake separating the community from the abbey is the medieval bell once used in the abbey. The Bell is named Gabriel because it is said to speak with the voice of that august archangel. Legend has it that in the 14th century a group of Benedictine nuns lived on the Imber property. A young nun had a lover who died whilst climbing a wall to reach her. He fell and broke his neck. The nun refused to confess her affair. The Bishop cursed the Abbey. The guilty nun committed suicide in the lake (another near suicide attempt will occur in the novel). The Bell was then believed to have flown like a bird on the wing out of the tower to fall into the lake. This perhaps may symbolize a refusal on the nun to repent of her sins. The character Dora an amoral and sexy woman will also fail to repent of her repeated adulteries during the course of the novel. The novel ends with tragedy and the experiment in communal living is a failed effort. As the novel ends, the wall separating the Abbey from the Lodge still stands symbolizing the huge distance between earth and heaven. The nuns such as Sister Ursula and Sister Clare seek to help the community people reminding us of guardian angels.There are many minor characters but the major figures in the work are:Michael Meade-The founder of the community. Michael is a homosexual who has affairs with young boys. He wanted to be a priest but is also a disullioned and guilt ridden man.Dora Greenfield-The leading female character. She has been married to a gruff and academic man Paul Greenfield. Paul works on ancient manuscripts in the abbey and is a resident of the community. Their marriage is a failure. Dora grows into maturity as the novel culminates.Toby-A young lad who will soon enter Cambridge as an engineering student. He finds the ancient bell under the lake. He is an innocent man who discovers both hetero and homosexual love at Imber.Nick and Catherine Fawley-Nick is a gloomy man who had a fleeting gay affair with Michael Meade. His sister Catherine is a fragile young woman who is planning to enter the Abbey. Tragedy is to upset her plans.The novel is difficult reading and its slow pace and deep insights inito the lives of the characters will not appeal to those seeking a page turner. Murdoch demands your attention as an intellectual and a woman interested in the human spirit.She is well worth reading. Recommended for mature and discerning readers of fiction."},{"Title":"Mokole: Changing Breed Book 6 (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"This is a great book. It helps to portray the true peril that the changing breeds are in and it also shows what those who truly desire to restore the balance, not just destroy the wyrm (dissolver) are capable of. This book has enthralled me since I bought it and now I really want to get an all Mokole game off the ground (too bad that my compadres insist on involving Bastet, Changeling, and Vamps :P). If you're considering buying it to this point, DO!"},{"Title":"Mokole: Changing Breed Book 6 (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"This book is everything you need to play the Mokole, were-reptiles who remember (and embody) Gaia's past, the days of the Dragon Kings (dinosaurs). As naturally, the book opens with a comic adventure telling of the Garou Peter Ward's quest to Australia to meet with the Mokole themselves and learn of his heritage. The book then gives the typical introduction, lexicon of terms and an explanation of what it is to embody the dragons, dinosaurs and sea serpents of the past through your Rage. From there it goes on to a great history, telling of the Mokole's creation and the reptilian civilizations of prehistoric times. The Mokole can even remember previous Apocalypses (like the one that destroyed the dinosaurs) and fully expect to live through this one. Details on the Wars of Rage and the War of Shame are given, along with lost Fera (were-bulls, boars and bats) known only to the Mokole. In addition, brief mention is made of human times, like ancient Egypt, the Slave Trade and so forth (&quot;western&quot; history doesn't really matter, since most Mokole come from the tropics).The next chapter covers the four Streams (tribes) of the Mokole: the Gumagan of Australia who share ties to the Dreamtime, the Makara priest-kings of India and neighboring lands, the primordial Mokole-Mbembe of Africa, the American Southeast and the Amazon and the scholarly Zhong Lung of East Asia's Hengeyokai. Specifics are given for each (like how the Gumagan have strong ties to the Umbra, differences in Mnesis and how the Zhong Long and Makara follow different auspices). Views on other Fera, vampires and even stranger factions (like mummies, voodooists, tribal shaman and Egyptian magi) are given, along with details on names and Duties (the Mokole Litany). The next chapter gives the crunchy bits, covering the Mokole solar auspices, new Traits, forms (not all are crocodiles or alligators; gila monsters, Komodo dragons and gharials are also represented) and Crinos traits (their Crinos form consists of various traits borrowed from other reptiles, like horns, armor, wings, frills, venom and so forth). Details on Totems are also given, along with new Totems, Fetishes and Merits/Flaws. All of these fit right in, from the reptile Totems to Fetishes drawn from Aboriginal culture.The next chapter covers Gifts for the Mokole, including general Gifts, solar/seasonal auspice Gifts and Stream Gifts, many of which are quite interesting. A number of useful (and uniquely Mokole) Rites are also presented. In the following chapter, we are given a look at useful information on Mokole breeding, Mnesis (their racial memory), the &quot;Innocents&quot; (ghosts of dead metis), camps and relationships with the Nagah (were-snakes). We also get the standard templates, like the Native Rights guerilla and the rainforest ethnobotanist, and NPCs, including Uncle Monday (a centuries old Florida Conjure Doctor), Sister Rae (who has True Faith in the sun), Morwangu (who was involved in the story in the book) and Braney (a Wyrm corrupted children's show host). The book closes out nicely with details on RL crocodilians, monitors and gila monsters, the hatred for vampires (particularly Setites), Mnesis spirits, the Dragon Kings, prehistoric birds and marsupials that once served as Mokole kin, and stories set in the final days or the War of Rage.The end also includes the typical template for creating and running Mokole characters. This can be used just as easily for western Mokole as it can for the eastern Makara/Zhong Lung (who follow slightly different creation rules). Needless to say, this book blew me away. The Mokole are probably my favorite Fera, and this book is invaluable for playing them. I also appreciated the strong focus on Australian Aboriginal culture which permeates much of this book. All in all, I think this book is quite useful for any Mokole Chronicles (and quite a head ache for those who want to try and figure out the World of Darkness's &quot;cosmology&quot;)."},{"Title":"Mokole: Changing Breed Book 6 (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"Mokole is a book for an addition to werewolf the apocalypse. You must have the &quot;werewolf: the apocalypse&quot; book in order to use this one to it's fullest ability. Mokole is a book about and how to play a were-alligator, were-crocodile, were-moniter lizards, were-gila monsters, were-caiman, and most importantly... they are all were-dragons! The mokole gives you mnesis, an ability to remember back to the time of the dinosaur kings. If you want to look like a big lizard, godzilla, dinosaur, sea serpent, fire breathing dragon, or oriental dragon.. then this is a book for you. The werewolves are the warriors of gaia, the mokole are her memory."},{"Title":"Mokole: Changing Breed Book 6 (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"Mokole is a wonderful book detailing the werecrocodiles and weredragons of the World of Darkness. The writing is superb, truly bringing to life the Mokole, and portraying what it is like to posess a racial memory back to the time of the dinosaurs. The feel of incredible antiquity, the weight of ages of Memory and wisdom, keenly permeates this Breedbook. This book does not merely describe the Mokole and their culture, it builds a vivid atmosphere, describing these ancient relics of a distant golden age, and does an excellent job of immersing the reader in their very unique worldview.The book focuses most on the Australian Aboriginal culture of the Gumagan tribe, although it also describes the other tribes and their cultures. I hardly know anything about Aboriginal culture, but it looks like the authors of Mokole did a good job of respectfully including it in the book without the dreadfulness of Rage Across Australia, and I am glad to see Australia covered in another W:tA book.The Mokole are an amazing race, and I am eager to play them someday. Their war-form, the Archid, is a dinosaur or dragon, and it is customizable and completely different for each character. The Mokole have all unique totems, rites, gifts, and fetishes, including ghostly totems from extinct species. Although they posess immense physical power - they are weredragons! - they are truly focused on peaceful functions. The are very different in feel and function from the Garou, and should provide many new opportunites for players and STs. Although the Mokole are usually antagonistic toward werewolves, they can work with Garou in the Hengeyokai and the Ahadi, and the book's metaplot provides possibilities for inter-Breed interaction outside of these coalitions.Every Breedbook includes the Breed's version of the history of the world and their part in it, but the Mokole's story of history spans 200 million years! The Mokole can remember a previous Apocalypse that wiped out the dinosaurs and an earlier intelligent race, the Lizard Kings, and they know of even earlier Apocalypses that came before that one. They believe that Gaia will survive the current crisis. Mokole revolutionizes the history of the World of Darkness. Even among Changing-Breeds, they take an extremely long view, and their insights and stories are interesting to say the least! The Mokole recall the Wars of Rage like they were yesterday, and their tales describe three entire Changing-Breeds that are now exinct. There are even basic rules for constructing games set in the Mesozoic, mostly intended for stories contained in a modern character's Memory.Finally, although the Mokole are weredinosaurs and speak frankly about evolution and geological Eras, the entire feel of the book is still as fully mystical as the rest of Werewolf, without drifting into genetics or other Weaverish explanations.The one major problem is the end of the fictional story. The resolution of the story's conflict makes no sense, is silly, and completely misrepresents the Red Talons. Except for that, this is a totally awesome book."},{"Title":"Mokole: Changing Breed Book 6 (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"This book made me love Werewolf again!

It seems to me too that it downplays the truth that many slim people are slim simply because they have the genetic make- up for this.In any case there is some excellent advice here. One such piece of advice is to avoid ' unconscious eating' i.e. Stuffing it in without paying any attention to it, or without enjoying it. Another good piece of advice , although a harder one to follow is to stop eating when one is 'satisfied' rather than when one is 'full'. Isn't 'full' what 'satisfied' really means sometimes? Another piece of advice is to listen to your body and know what it wants to eat. Still another is the one which tells you not to deny yourself a certain kind of food, because the 'temptation' will stay with you. 'Giving in to temptation is the best way to resist it\\" they say. And this is right . But 'giving in to temptation can also sometimes increase it more' One delight leading to another until one has eaten one's way through four refrigerators full of cake. My own sense is that if a person wants to lose weight they should place a limit on certain kinds of very fattening food, such as cake. It doesn't hurt I think to sometimes not give in to temptation. I think however that essentially the authors are right when they tell us we should consider ourselves able to eat any and every food. But I would add that the wisdom is simply in not over- doing it.All in all I think that this is a good helpful book which most people will be able to get some tips from.Will it solve the problem?No more than any diet -book will.Too much good food is available too easily- not slim people are multiplying not simply in the U.S. but throughout the world.I would recommend that most of all try to be as healthy as we can and not let our overweight become too great, or get us down too much.

I fully expect to succeed this time around."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Great commonsense information put together with a light, friendly tone.Chapters and steps are broken down into smaller, easy to do steps.No weeding through pages of fluff, or filler recipe pages, either."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I've had this book for years, and know it works.

THE SEVEN SECRETS OF SLIM PEOPLE helped me to accept my body as normal and to respect it as a perfectly-designed machine that NEEDS fuel (food). My car has a gauge to show when its low on fuel, my body doesn't. Recognizing my body's cues of degrees of fullness gives a real sense of power. Amazingly, I've found that my body actually craves the food pyramid every 10-12 day!!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Fantastic Book that I wish I could force all of America to read.

Please read this book if you have a problem with even a little weight or especially just overeating!!!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I found the 7 Secrets one of the most informative books I've read. The authors detail what diets do to your body and why we as a society overeat and they offer good real life solutions."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Easy to follow simple truths that will change your life. The book is structured into bite-sized pieces of advice that are incredibly easy to remember. Read and re-read the snippets and everything else will fall into place."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This was a wonderful book - an eye-opener! No more diets. Just instructions in learning to eat. Easy to read format - listings. Easy to reference. Each page filled with \\"gems\\" of wisdom."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I appreicate the way this book is written. It is easy to get through and doesn't have a lot of additional writing or unnessary information to fill the pages. I have started a lot of diet books, but never finished one until this book. It is not a typical diet book, rather it is a way of looking at how and when you eat, which in turn, affects your weight. It has changed my eating behavior, and in time, will change the amount of fat my body carries. It is not a quick fix, rather a permanent fix."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I am on a quest to begin thinking like a thin person and then to follow, looking like a thin person. This book is so practical and very easy to read. It has such good practical suggestions and tools to make this transition fairly easy. If you have struggled with weight loss all of your life like me... I encourage you to get this book. It isn't a \\"diet\\" it is a way to think and begin interacting with food in a healthier way, physically, mentally, and emotionally.God bless you on your journey!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"So first of all, I'd like to say that I have not actually tried the techniques in the book yet, so I can't way whether or not they work. But I did receive the book yesterday, and read it cover to cover.Like many reviewers have already noted, there are some \\"style\\" issues with the book. The font is fairly large, it is written in a sound bite fashion, and every other page is filled with a graphic and an idea that was just presented on the facing page. At the end of each chapter, in an attempt to waste more pace, are the worksheets. While the example worksheet is very handy to have, and maybe even one worksheet to make copies from (though who wants to make copies from a small paperback and then write on them), 7 worksheets, plus an extra page that says \\"additional thoughts\\" is a bit of a waste. 7 weeks X 7 worksheets X 1 (or two) thoughts pages= 56 pages of wasted space. So maybe not the most cost effective book.And like others have mentioned, a lot of the information in this book is not groundbreaking. Eat when you're hungry, stop when you're full. Ho hum. However, I did find that there were ways this statement was phrased that made me sit up and notice. Things that I felt like underlining in the book, or carrying around on a little card, or something.My problems with this book? Well, like another reviewer, I too was not pleased with how this book glosses over exercise and almost dismisses it as irrelevant. I get the point about why it may not be necessary for maintaining your ideal weight, but in a self help book regarding listening to your body and feeling your best, I expected at least a throwaway mention about the good health and mental effects of exercising. But my main problem was that in the end I don't see this plan to be so realistic. Eat only when you're hungry and about a fist size at a time. That seems to (because the book itself discusses the inconvenient times we get hungry) limit me to eating only leftovers at home, or convenience foods. My other problem is small, in that there was no sort of time scale on the levels of hunger. When I am a 2, does that mean I have time to make myself a nice dinner before I fall into a 1 (danger zone!) or does that mean I may have time to pop a bag of popcorn? Does that mean if I have a dinner that takes an hour to cook I should start cooking when I'm at a 3 or 4?All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Maybe not revolutionary, maybe the writing is a bit trite, maybe it isn't even anything new. But it made me think about things, and I hope it helps me win the battle against my body and food that I have been waging for at least the past 15 years."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I recently read this book and found it to be very elementary both in its information and writing style. I warn the buyer that half of this book is wasted; every other page is a large font reminder of something on the previous page.Though I agree with the authors about what it takes to become naturally slim: eat only when you're hungry, stop when you're full, eat only what you really want, etc..., I found it to be too simplistic. I instead highly recommend &quot;Diets Don't Work&quot; and &quot;It's Not About Food&quot;. My reviews for each are posted. The first book, &quot;Diets Don't Work&quot; is simple but it has lots of writing exercises to help you realize what your issues are with food and why you may be scared to NOT diet anymore. I found those written exercises to be extremely helpful! The second book, &quot;It's Not About Food&quot;, is geared more toward those with eating disorders (even overeating is consider an eating disorder), but really dug into the societal issues of why women are always dieting.If you want to stop dieting, you don't need this book. There are much better out there. Also, check out &quot;How to Become Naturally Thin by Eating More&quot; by Jean Antonello."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Seven Secrets is a down to earth helpful way to loose weight."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This is a message to all reviewers who think thin people eat whatever they want whenever they want. Two years ago, I lost about 30 pounds and have kept it off (without regaining) since. Most people would consider me thin. I exercise at least 3 times per week (ususally four) and eat nutritious food that falls within certain calorie ranges at each meal. There is no food I like that I refuse to eat, but I don't eat whatever I want whenever I want. Just last night, I ate a single scoop of ice cream for dessert. It's a new flavor and really good. After I finished, I really wanted to go back in the kitchen and get another scoop. But I didn't. I knew that, over the course of the day, I had met my body's needs and those unneeded extra scoops of pleasure add up (typically on my thighs!) You determine what your body needs. My stomach sure wanted that extra ice cream and my brain could have rationalized it. If I had &quot;listened to my body&quot;, eventually my jeans would be too tight.Part of what I have learned is that your appetite changes to accomodate the amount of food you eat. If you overeat occasionally, your stomach will feel stuffed and your brain will say &quot;Quit already!&quot; If you overeat routinely, your stomach will start to accomodate you and your brain will say &quot;Better have some more bread with that pasta.&quot; Been there many times. Point being, you need decide what your body needs and not rely on your stomach and brain to convey accurate information. Your body can be a bit self-serving.I will rate this book highly because I support books that help people reach their goals."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Ho-hum. An MTV book in that it is full of quick sound bites that have been said better in other books. Perused a used copy that I paid a buck for and frankly, it didn't compare with anything that geneen roth wrote or the book, \\"Diet's Don't Work.\\" If you actually read and want inspiration AND lasting insights into your eating habits so you don't have to continually follow rules, buy Roth -- she goes deep, cares about the long haul with her people."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a real solution to struggles with their weight. Whether you are slim and constanly fighting to stay there, or morbidly obese, this is a viable solution. Reading &quot;7 Secrets&quot;, you'll learn how and why you'll get fatter by dieting. My 'naturally slim' friends have verified that the 'secrets' revealed in the book are how they actually eat and percieve food. What I especially like about this book is the work sheets for each day of the seven weeks of the program. Worksheets make it very easy to transform the &quot;7 Secrets&quot; into your everyday life. I read the book cover to cover before beginning the worksheets and I recommend that you do too. The difference it is making in my life and my relationship with food is amazing. I have learned to eat food that makes me feel good, as a result, I am eating healthier and far less. I have learned to recognize when a food makes me feel bad so I can avoid it. It is psychologically freeing to be able to eat whatever you want, whenever you want it. I look and feel better than I have in 9 years and the weight is falling off effortlessly. The best part is, there is no dieting. You just have to be willing to relearn everything you thought about eating."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This book has helped me take back my life. I used to spend my days counting calories and fat grams, all the while suppressing my hunger with bottles and bottles of diet soda, until I bought this book, (actually thinking it was another set of dieting secrets). But boy, did it knock a lot of sense back into me! I knew &quot;the experts&quot; would always come up with more &quot;diet revolutions&quot;...cut the carbs, trap the fat with this pill, etc., but this book taught me why no matter how much willpower I thought I had, I would not be healthy, slim, and happy(yes, very important!) unless I ate NATURALLY...the way we're meant to eat. I'd always wondered how some people ate what they liked, as much as they wanted and still stayed so slim. No, not bulimia...they simply ate as their bodies (not their minds) saw fit. And this is what the book teaches you how to do. Each page is easy to understand and no longer than about a paragraph. No anecdotes, no calorie charts, no meal plans. You let nature(your body) tell you what to eat and how much. In addition, this book helped me climb out of the pit of waif-like body ideals. I've read this book twice--it's that easy!--and was already feeling better and slimmer in the first week off diet. One weak point about this book, though, is that it doesn't address well enough the issue of getting in all of one's daily nutrition with the natural way of eating. You might take a vitamin supplement to be on the safe side. Other than that, I highly recommend this book to chronic/potential dieters."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"The concept of stopping dieting to lose weight has interested me since reading several books by Geneen Roth. It wasn't until I happened onto this book that I once again considered that diets have made me fat. Being at my all time heaviest weight, the thought of going on another diet seemed dreadful. I have read nearly every diet concept that has been out in the past 15 years and tried most. They were all somewhat successful for a while. I would lose weight, get more comfortable with myself and return right back to eating the forbidden foods I liked. I purchased 'The 7 Secrets of Slim People' and read it in one evening. It is very well written &amp; enjoyable to read. The book was amazing and I finally feel free in life to enjoy food and stop when I am satisfied. The author acknowledges all aspects of food, physical, emotional and pleasure. This is the first book I have ever read on eating that actually encourages you to enjoy eating. I have stopped dieting, learned to eat between hungry and satisfied as taught in this book and lost 25 lbs in just two weeks. I have eaten all the foods I love. The concepts in this book make sense. BUY THIS BOOK! It will change you life and free you from the torture of dieting. STOP DIETING AND HARMING YOURSELF."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I have been following this plan for about six weeks now and am so grateful to have stumbled upon this book. I was miserable about the weight I had gained and dissatisfied w/various diets I had tried. I am now able to eat WHATEVER I want and have been steadily losing 1-2 lbs per week. This plan is sane, easy and enjoyable. Sounds too good to be true, but it's not! I am enjoying guilt-free eating for the first time in some years. Highly recommended for anyone who wants an easy, fun way to lose weight."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"It feels too easy to be true but once you apply the secrets amazing things happen. I heard about this book on this site and thought it was pretty interesting and best of all it went along with a notion I've always had, your body knows how to maintain your perfect weight, if you listen to it.I started following the principles over a month ago and I am absolutely amazed to find I've lost more than ten pounds and a dress, maybe even two because my clothes are pretty loose.Another thing that amazed me was how little I can eat! The first couple weeks were awkward to me because I'd dish out a meal based on habits then I started eating only when I was hungry and stopped when I was not hungry and sometimes that turned out to be a small piece of chicken with a few bites of vegetables and even less if I have a beverage. It took a little time to get accustomed to that but quickly I realized how much better I felt throughout the day. I was less tired, guiltless and I still ate exactly what I wanted.I learned that my body craved food about every two and a half hours, I learned to separate thrist from hunger, listening to my body I actually crave healthier foods and most important is I stopped obsessing over food.I highly recommend this book because with a little patience you'll see good things happen to your body too..."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I heard about this book on the radio and knew I had to read it.

(The book, that is!) I read the entire thing right there in the store. It was riveting, informative, interesting, and what was to become life changing."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This is not a diet book -- now that said, it may help you loose weight better than any diet you have ever been on! This book helps you to examine your relationship with food. It also helps you to understand why most diets fail and why many of us regain weight we lose on a diet, if we are lucky enough to lose weight on a restrictive diet at all. Any diet can be successful if you stay on it, but what happens after you stop dieting? This book also helps you examine why you overeat in the first place. It helps you see how you can still eat in moderation and live a normal life while getting to the size you want to be! No, this is not a diet, but it may very well revolutionize the way you see yourself and your relationship with food. This little book can change your life."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This book provides good, constructive facts and advice on overcoming overeating without dieting, but it is presented entirely in sound bites. Every page spread has a list of bullet points on the left side and a single, large-font pull quote on the right side. It could very easily be turned into a massive PowerPoint file.Depending on who you are, this could be just what you need. If you're in a hurry, or don't like to read, or need some quick inspiration, it could be great. If you don't mind reading and thinking, or you like self-help books that persuade rather than preach, or you're looking for \\"real-life\\" anecdotes to help inspire you, this might not be your cup of tea. If you're in the latter category, I recommend \\"Intuitive Eating: A Revolutionary Program That Works\\" over this book."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"The diet and fitness industry will have you believe that you need to go on the latest \\"hot\\" diet in order to loose weight, and it promises to change your life: look sexier, have more energy, lose inches, etc. Until the next fad diet comes around and promises the same thing. Currently, the Low-Carb diets are all the rage, and in the 90's it was all about Low-Fat diets. Then there's the high protien diets, the special food combination diets, the shake diets, then come the dangerous diet pills and powders...The list goes on and on. When you really think about it, if these diets truly worked like they claim to do, then the obesity rate in the US would not be what it is today (and experts are now saying that the obesity could rise up to 40% in 5 years!). This country is obsessed about being thin, which is painfully obvious: just turn on the tv and at any time there's another infomercial offering the latest weight loss gadget or diet plan. Yet, this country is the fattest one on Earth!Enter: The Seven Secrets of Slim People. This book, if read with an open mind and heart will change your life and the way you look at food and diets forever. In a simple and common sense manner, it describes the way the body works and teaches the reader how to be able to be friends with your body instead of being it's \\"enemy\\", and listen to your body's natural signals of hunger, which for many people have been distorted. It goes on to explain why this distortion can lead to overeating. It explains how to recognize your body's \\"full button\\" so you will know when you've had enough to eat. It has very simple but powerful exercises to be done each week and will allow the reader to slowly implement them as habits, and the reader will soon do these things automatically, and allow their body to lose the excess weight naturally.Forget DIETS, counting calories, carbs, and fat grams,and the overall OBSESSION with food! The beauty of it is that you can ENJOY food GUILT FREE and eat whatever you want. The diet industry will have you believe you have to follow their latest diet to lose weight, and any diet will cause you to lose weight BUT as soon as you come off it, the pounds will come back and then some more. FOOD IS NOT THE ENEMY. You can eat anything you want as long as you know WHEN and HOW to eat!!!!This book is helping me deprogram myself from all the media hype and brainwashing that has caused me to go on stupid diets that have only hurt my body, not NOURISHED it. I have started losing pounds and the best thing is that there is no deprivation WHATSOEVER. I wish that if you are reading this review, to get your hands on this book and free yourself from the bondage of diets for good."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"I can't say enough great things about this book and the eating program it contains. I lost 30 pounds over three years ago and it's still off. And I eat anything I want. Really! The biggest secret is to know WHEN to eat and WHEN to stop eating. If you can master that, it really doesn't matter WHAT you eat. And this program helps you understand those principles and apply them to your life.Try it yourself and see!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"The real problem is overeating, not your current weight. If you can just not eat when you are not hungry, your weight will drift down to a healthy level. I identified a number of situations where I overeat and have dealt with most of them. Examples: 1) Free food. It seemed to me I had to take advantage of it. 2) Finishing what is presented. Now I can save or throw part of a plateful or wrapperful. 3) Preventive eating. I &quot;might&quot; get hungry, so I ate preventively. Solution, take the snack in the briefcase. These examples give you the idea. You will have your own list. You MUST, however, tune in to your actual inner state of hunger. If you cannot do that, then go back to one of the control systems, calories, portions, etc. One of the greatest advantages of this approach is that you don't have to remember what you have eaten or keep records. Your body will send you the necessary information if you learn to listen."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This book does what no diet can do. It teaches you how to eat -- and the process is so simple, so logical, so easy that success is a natural by-product. The best thing of all is that you don't feel deprived, you know you can eat when you're hungry, you can eat whatever appeals to you, and you don't have to count calories or feel restricted. I think the only thing that would behoove the book would be a further explanation of the mechanics of the subsequent weight loss. Because you're only taking in enough calories to maintain your ideal body weight, your stored fat is burned in the process of its own maintenance.. at least that's what I devined after thinking about it for awhile. Eat when you're hungry -- what a novel idea!! Deal with your problems instead of burying them under food -- what a liberating approach!! Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This book is a rare gem for people looking for the real answer to weight loss. It is written in a very casual and easy to read format because it's message is simple; by trying to manually control your body's natural eating through dieting you are heading for trouble. I have tried several diets in the last 5 years; Body For Life, Atkins, Carbohydrate Addict's, Warrior Diet, etc. They all in the end tell you to ignore your hunger in some way or another. This is not healthy, and not natural. This kind of deprivation ineviatably will lead you to binge and gain weight. I weighed more after doing these diets then I ever did when I ate what I wanted when I wanted. I have enacted \\"The Seven Secrets of Slim People\\" along with \\"Your Body's Many Cries for Water\\" and have been losing weight ever since.

This lets you tune out all these influences that have tried to control your behavior and weight, while teaching you to listen to your body for guidance.

It offers lots of common sense advice and gives great tools for paying attention to your eating, all of which I have found to be very helpful. It offers excercises at the end of each chapter as well.

After reading and trying so many popular diets, it's comforting to find advice that makes sense and applies to everyday life. I thank the authors for presenting recommendations that a person can really use. They offer common sense advice that applies to any person who has struggled with their weight.

So I am now satisfied :)"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Weight loss is a by product of a non dieting lifestyle, not the focus. These authors put way too much emphasis on physical weight loss rather than love and unconditional acceptance. This book is not recognizing the two types of hunger, physical and psychological. It's okay to have both hungers in the recovery process (for compulsive overeating). The authors don't address this, but rather turn physical hunger into a 'rule' and that to me is what dieting is. Rules. I found this book to be a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This is a nice book, and the price is great! But I can't see what's so revolutionary. Keep a journal regarding snacking; face feelings rather than snacking, and so on. It's well-written, but not that new. The authors devote one paragraph to exercise, emphasizing food thoughtfulness on the other 300 pages. But so many people say they starting walking 2 miles a day consistently and lost 40 pounds, that maybe general exercise (not sweating/pain) should get more emphasis."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This book is easy to read and follow. The left page is all bulleted points, the right page has one inspirational point and at the end of each chapter is a worksheet to follow. It is inspirational. It takes a lot of committment and work to listen to our bodies and eat properly, but it is worth it. This book taught me how to listen to my body and take better care of myself by eating properly. The only thing missing in this book is emphasis on exercise/physical activity.Just by following the secrets in this book and doing Pilates 3-5 times a week, I have lost 20 pounds in two months. I have more energy and look better. This book has been a HUGE inspiration to me and has helped me eat properly and take care of my body the way it needs to be taken care of."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"A very good book on establishing a healthy relationship with food. Although the book is geared toward women, it can still be valuable to men willing to acknowledge their issues with food.The principles are practical, each aspect being introduced over the course of the book. Becoming aware of food and how it makes you feel is a great component. I also LOVED the books tone that food is a source of pleasure, something to be savored, something to be enjoyed.The book does well to point out that a large part of people's eating dysfunctions are because they don't actually savor their food - not making it a conscious pleasure. This book will teach you life skills, not how to lose weight in 30 days. But, follow the principles, and enjoy EVERY food you eat, and you will lose weight once you get your metabolism off the feast and famine roller coaster."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"It's about getting in touch with your body. I had an eating disorder twenty years ago and even though I recovered from it, for years thereafter I still struggled with wondering if I was eating too much, not enough, would this make me fat, felt guilty for any indulgence, and on and on. I read the book and decided to trust the author. Now I eat what I want, whenever I want, but I don't eat a lot of it because my body does not want a lot of it. When I am full but still want the taste, I give myself permission to come back to the food later if I still want it.Unlike diets, no foods are off limits. The most liberating thing about this book is the release from self-flagellation when I do overeat or make bad choices. I know I can trust my body to adjust if I will just listen. If I over-indulge one day, I have noticed that my body doesn't WANT as much the next day.So if dieting or an eating disorder or society has put you out of touch with your body, this book will help you learn to trust it again.It's simple, really: with the obvious exception of certain medical disorders, the human body WANTS to maintain a healthy weight. This book makes your body a partner in that endeavor instead of an adversary."},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"This book changed my life in an hour - that's how long it took to read it.

You may eat anything you want, you just have to be physically hungry and stop when satisfied. Those are limits that I can live with.

No longer do I spend my days obsessing over food, exercise and thoughts of weight loss.I use to work so hard, dieting, exercising and devoting my every thought to weight loss. I'd feel great when I'd reach my goal and I'd swear that I had changed my lifestyle forever but inevitably, a few months later the pounds would slowly creep back and so did my bad eating habits.But this method isn't about work(dieting) it's about letting go of the diet mentality that make us fat in the first place. By learning to listen to my body instead of my head, I no longer want to overeat or eat when I'm not hungry. I lost my excess weight without any effort this time and am *keeping* it off. Best of all, I'm finally free from the prison of food/exercise/weight obsession.I'm free, happy and THIN!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Amazing book! I feel like I just wasted the last 20 years of my life counting calories, and fat grams. Even in my thin years, I was obsessed and way too hard on myself! That is no way to live.After reading this book I have a new way of eating. I admit I am still counting Weight Watcher points, but as an afterthought, and mostly because it's so automatic. My main focus is just feeling physically the best every time I eat. I think of it as a gift to myself. So if I start to make toast when I'm not hungry, I think, \\"Will I feel light and energetic after this, or too full and bloated since I wasn't hungry to start with?\\" And if I am hungry I think, \\"Will 2 pieces of pizza make me feel heavy and in need of an antacid? Maybe 1 piece of pizza and a salad will leave me feeling satisfied and light at the same time.\\" The idea being that I'm not depriving myself or judging, because both of those things trigger me to binge.Yesterday I actually did eat 2 pieces of pizza and normally I'd think, \\"F--- it! I screwed up! Might as well have a third piece... and some cake. After all, it's Saturday. Don't need to weigh in for a week. I'll be good tomorrow.\\" But now that I have this new take on eating, I was thinking, \\"oh, I feel kinda barfy after those two pieces. I'm going to remember this feeling next time.\\" So I didn't eat another piece of pizza, because that is inconsistent with the emphasis on feeling physically the best.It's interesting because before this book, it was very hard to stay within my Weight Watcher points, but now that I have a new mentality, I find that I'm usually under my points for the day! Sometimes I'm over, but it always seems to even out over the course of a few days. I've lost six pounds in six weeks, when I've been at a plateau for a year! But the best part is, that I feel so good, that I don't think I need to lose the other 7 pounds I've been trying to take off. If I lose it naturally, great. But if not, it's worth keeping it on if it means that I'm not stressed out about everything I put in my mouth. Let's face it, I wasn't going to lose that weight by stressing out anyway.UPDATE: Now it's been three months and I've stopped counting Weight Watcher points at the end of the day to assure myself that I'm eating the right amount. I now trust myself fully. I actually have brownies on my counter right now, and they have no power of me! They taste incredible, but since I know I can eat them anytime I want, I don't feel like I'm fighting off the urge to eat them. In the past I would have eaten them all or been stressed out about feeling deprived. I went to Cheesecake Factory today and it was no big deal! Yippie! I'm free!"},{"Title":"The Seven Secrets of Slim People","review":"Three weeks into this book I'd lost a dress size. I have a metabolic illness which is made worse by calorie deprivation.

Colonial Radio has put together a very enjoyable series which cover the first five books in the series. They are well acted, and of course well written. They are a great way to spend a few hours trying to solve a mystery."},{"Title":"The case of the lucky legs","review":"It is easy to see why Gardner is correct in the opening note when he suggests that bar associations \\"shiver with apprehension\\" over the tactics often employed by the fictional Perry Mason. He often crosses the line between legal and illegal when he is defending a client and pursuing the truth, it is also easy to see why police officers would dislike the Perry Mason books. For it is a rare occasion when Gardner portrays officers as anything more than simple-minded and stiff in their approach. Occasionally, Gardner moves out of that mold, describing at least one police officer as having a bit of intelligence.The premise of this story is that a man named Frank Patton is running a legal racket that ensnares beautiful young women and takes money from local businesses. The scheme is that Patton goes into a town and claims to be looking for future movie starlets with great legs. When the women audition there is a winner, the woman with the \\"lucky legs.\\" Patton then gathers money from local businesses and organizations to invest in the movies that the new starlet will appear in. However, the scheme is organized so that the woman is a \\"flop\\" in Hollywood and the money is forfeited. The timeframe is when the speakeasy is still part of the American culture and Mason does not hesitate to partake of the food and drink they offer.A very clever man named J. B. Bradbury approaches Mason and informs him of this scheme and wants Mason to represent one of the female victims. When Patton is murdered, the plot begins moving in many different directions as Mason is fed many false stories and Bradbury proves to be a very intelligent and ruthless man. The climactic scene is one where there are two stupid cops as well as one more that is intelligent and willing to listen to Mason as he tells the story. Of course the case is solved in dramatic fashion, the culprit and complete story revealed.This story keeps your attention throughout because there is a character other than Mason that is a worthy adversary. Bradbury is able to reach the proper conclusions as to what Mason did that is considered improper and makes it clear that he will use it when necessary. It is a tactic that is a welcome relief from the dumb cop and district attorney characters that Gardner uses so often as adversaries to Mason."},{"Title":"The case of the lucky legs","review":"The Case of the Lucky LegsA note from the author tells about the bygone days when this story takes place. The early Perry Mason was not a stickler for the finer points of legal ethics, individual initiative counted to make a dramatic story. Other novels over the years warned of the beauty contest scams.Mr. J. R. Bradbury visited Perry Mason about a telegram and a picture. Promoter Frank Patton held a contest to pick the girl with \\"Lucky Legs\\" and sold scrip to merchants so they could get a share of the profits in a movie company. Marjorie Clune was sent to Hollywood, given a screen test, then her contract was canceled. It was a legal fraud. Bradbury wants Perry to find Marjorie and put Patton behind bars when he confesses to fraud (Chapter 1). Perry gets information from the D.A.'s office (Chapter 2). He plots strategy with Paul Drake. This racket must have been used elsewhere (Chapter 3). Perry goes to visit Patton and sees a distressed young woman leaving (Chapter 5). Patton's door is unlocked, Perry enters and finds a bloody knife near the body! As he leaves a police officer shows up because of a complaint. Perry calls his office to check on his client. Next he visits Thelma Bell to find Marjorie Clune (Chapter 6). The conversations carry the story forward, and explain strategy.Perry meets his client Bradbury to exchange information (Chapter 7). Perry discusses the case with Della Street (Chapter 8). Who impersonated Della Street to warn Dr. Doray (Chapter 9)? Who gave information to Paul Drake and where did he get it (Chapter 10)? Perry checked on Thelma's alibi. Perry is very active that night (Chapter 11). The police like Dr. Doray for the murder. Bradbury commands Perry to defend Dr. Doray and get an acquittal (Chapter 12). [What clew sent Perry after the mail plane?] Perry charters an airplane to Summerville on a search (Chapter 13). This is a crisis for Marjorie and Bob Doray! Perry acts to gain time to question Marjorie (Chapter 14). Then he smuggles her out of the hotel (Chapter 15). Perry finds out who was talking to the Drake Detective Bureau (Chapter 16). Marjorie knows her! Perry gets a record of Bradbury's local telephone calls! There is a showdown in Perry's office with Bradbury and two police detectives (Chapter 17). The police want to arrest Perry (Chapter 18)! Perry explains all he knows or surmises to the three detectives. This solves the murder mystery. The last chapter ties up the loose ends.This is the early Perry Mason who solves crimes like a private investigator. No courtroom scenes. Perry is more rough and gritty too. Della has more spirit, Paul more independence. They do not work like a well-oiled machine as in the later novels. The meeting at the end when the case is solved was typical of many mystery novels and films from that era."},{"Title":"Caesar's Gallic War (Allen & Greenough's Latin series)","review":"I bought this book for my homeschooled son who is 9 and his younger sister, both very advanced readers and history fans. The book was still a challenge. Wonderful in and of itself, its vocabulary, sentence structure and plot were above their heads. I had to concentrate real hard to follow the plot myself. Finally, I decided to read the book myself and retell it briefly to my children.If I had to read it all over again I would carefully keep track of the names of Gallic chiefs and who they conspired with and against.

I did not like the book at all because it was incredibly boring. Most of the book had nothing to do with the main climax. The whole book was filled with completly irelevant and confusing details. There were a lot of things that happened suddenly and were not sufficently explained-like when Hank got married. Overall there were to many details where they didn't need them and not enough details where they did need them. The book was also very unrealistic. If Hank knew all that he did in the book, he would have probably rivaled Einstien's IQ. There's no way one person could make telephones, gattling guns, revolvers, newspapers, and factories using 6th century tools.

The main characters were Merlin, King Arthur, Clarence and the main character Hank Morgan. I did not like this book. I think the book is very boring because it is hard to understand the complicated text. The way that the text was complicated was Mark Twain was writing how Middle Ages citizens would talk and one of his sentences went like this, &quot;Graddually as the time wore down one annoying fact still borne upon my understanding&quot;. Another reason I don't like this book is that it is to hard to know what is really going on and who is speaking in the book. At one point in this book I had a totaly different picture in my mind then what was happening in the book. I thought that Clarence and not Hank Morgan was going to get hanged and then burned.

Hank Morgan's intent to both dominate and liberate Arthurian England, and to \\"rescue\\" a supposedly benighted country so that it might become an image of the United States, foreshadows the American Exceptionalism that took us into Viet Nam and, later, into Iraq. When Arthurian England decides it does not want to be liberated, or to become like the United States, Hank in a fit of temper destroys a culture, using American technology to bring about its ruin.

I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand. Because it was set in the middle ages, the characters used old-fashioned words like &quot;Lo&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; etc. that i could not understand. Another reason why I would not reccomend this book to anyone is that it went off on differenbt subjects not pertaining to the story-line. Because it went off on weird subjects, I got confused easily and i would have to read parts of the story over-again.

For example, he blows up a tower by connecting gun powder to a lightning rod during a storm. Amazing....I think not. I thought this book was boring because there are to many unnecessary details. Who cares what each prison cell looks like? One whole chapter was on the prices of food and how they vary from town to town. Another reason I disliked this book is because it was hard to follow. All the different knights names are so hard to remember and its so slow paced that if you put the book down you can't remember what was going on and you're not interested enough to care.

Needless to say, he goes on an excursion with King Arthur experiencing many events along the way. On the journey he learns lessons of how to be noble and be a knight. My opinion of this book is that it lacks something, something that is entertaining. I do not find it interesting or appealing. Mark Twain uses many details like most books he has written. The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all.

Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat.

'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A nineteenth century Connecticut Yankee wakes up to find himself in sixth century Arthurian England.

It gave interesting ideas and showed the foolishness of the knights in the famed 'Camelot.' I loved it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A &quot;modern&quot; (late 1800s) man named Hank Morgan, after getting into a fight with a subordinate at his factory and being knocked on the head, is mysteriously transported back to Britain, 19 Jun 528 AD, the heyday of Camelot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round. The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period.

I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again. Mark Twain is a master story teller. I enjoyed it again,40 years later."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey.

He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his &quot;magic.&quot; Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before.

Which will I choose for my Kindle? No contest!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&iexcl;s Court&iexcl; is a hilarious story written by Mark Twain. The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books. There are also some great pictures included in the book, from portraits of Mark Twain to pictures of King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A fellow from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut finds himself back in early medieval England, specifically in King Arthur's Court. Our protagonist revolutionizes their society be introducing them to the printing press, the bicycle, and socialism, among other things. The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts.

Hank, the main character, manages to go back in time to the year 513. Hank then goes about the business of trying to modernize a soceity that seem to want to resist any improvement. Although the main objective of the story is Hank's attempt to modernize Britian, he has some pretty wacky adventures along the way. From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential. As for this edition, it is essentially bare bones. Anyone wanting supplemental material will need to look elsewhere, but this will do well for most, as the text stands very well on its own."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature.

Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them. Parts of it were slow, but it is a very old book, written in a different style than today's stories, so that is understandable."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I really liked this book very much.

One man with everyday knowledge and a little ingenuity can attain a position of power over a 6th century kingdom. I liked this book because it presented me with a challenge. Trying to figure out Twain's manerisms and 6th century ettiquette made this this book a little confusing at times, but at the same time it captured my interest. I just couldn't put it down until I had finished it . When I did finish it I ended up going back and re-reading parts to ensure a clear understanding of what was happening."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I would recomend this book for 6th grade and up. I give this book two thumbs up.The book is about a man named Hank Morgan who gets knocked out in a fight, then dreams that he has been sent back in time into the midievil times.He goes on many fun adventures."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I haven't read much of Twain's works, but this is undoubtly the best Twain book I have ever read (Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, jumping frogs...bleurgrht!).

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

Morgan keeps a diary of the events and happenings of what goes on during his crazy adventure at King Arthur's kingdom. Using 19th century technological advancments, Morgan fools everyone into believing that he is a great magician. After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't.

I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010.

What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM.

If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels.

In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain.

Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such.

I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This book was at first a huge disappointment. I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought. The Yankee observed some very dark and distrubing facts about people. The book was not the most entertaining book, but the insight to humanity makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility. He also points out how the tyranny of England in Arthur's time continued on 1300 years later. The book will make you laugh and will also make you examine the myths that people take as fact today"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title.

This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel.

There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot.

Although there were some parts in the novel that were slow and undeveloped, the best parts and the main parts over-shadow those. This novel is one you MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In this book, a man named Hank Morgan is transported from the 19th century to the Dark Ages.

Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;.

It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life.

And doesn't a pilot stand at the wheel and gently guides his craft down and back. Ha. Twain's description of the Mississippi River is a voluptuous exploration of his lifetime love, and of American history as well, and the complexity of it is astounding. There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him.

I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight?

It's true, some pieces of this are dated and, frankly, the facts regarding populations and cargo tonnage and numbers of schools in various towns is not very interesting, but there is only so much of that to put up with. Most of the rest is just pure fun to read. Some of it, laugh-out-loud fun to read.

As it says in the introduction, this is a great 'hodgepodge' of a book,being statistical journelese one moment,then pure Twain the next,and its this pure Twain that keeps you on board reading even the appendices at the end!Its obvious Twain couldn't stand the twee 'Merry England' novels of Sir Walter Scott,which no doubt he deplored as a boy,but I think he's dragging us into one of his famous exagerations when he blames Scott, not only for the outdated chivelry nonsense that plagued the Southern sensibilities of his day,but also for being the fundamental cause of the civil war!! As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there? Who better to read than Mark Twain?"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed. This account reads something more like a travelogue.Interspersed through this account are a number of anecdotes and commentaries, covering a various and sundry range of topics, including tall tales, legends, architecture, culture, grammar, mule racing, cockfighting, and Sir Walter Scott's detrimental effect on the American South. One could spend several pages listing the topics Twain covers, but suffice it to say that the majority will be of interest to the discerning modern reader. His tall tales (often related as fact) are particularly good.Twain is just as engaging here as he is in his fiction. He is self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek, and his style is completely endearing. And if a particular topic is not of interest to the reader, well, he moves on quickly enough.Ultimately, Life on the Mississippi is a fascinating read, not only for detailed insight into nineteenth-century life in America, but also for the countless tales Twain relates in his inimitable style."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This book is out of touch with modern education.

This book was anything but. It's nothing more than a 400 page rant about how evil wealthy people are, in contrast to the inherent goodness of the oppressed poor. He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating. As it stands, anyone looking for a time travel story is going to get little more than a meandering, endless, and plotless leftwing spiel."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Hi everyone!

Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book. His piloting writings were entertaining and interesting, even though not particularly relevant in today's world.However the later chapters ruin the book. Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes. These sections range from only mildly entertaining to just plain boring, as Twain doesn't even use his humor to save them.In the end the disappointment of the second half outweighs the enjoyment of the first half."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is a great author, but not here. I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters.

He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation. Although sounding interesting, parts of the novel are written in old English, therefore recommended from high school up. Personally, the book wasn't the best I had ever read. For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life. Sounding like you'll get a blast from the past, I myself only give this book two stars. Although many very strong readers may like the novel, many people may get lost in the book by falling asleep on the pages."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This book A CONNECITICUT YANKEE AT KING ARTHUR'S COURT by Mark Twain is very boaring. It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it. Overall I would not reccomend this book as a quick or fun read."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it.

The end made up for alot of the book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.)

It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I love this book.

It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse. However, the best part is the contrast between the author's confident early youthful years and the much later, postwar years of bittersweet reminiscence and regret for what has passed, never to return. A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard. If you've read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, you'll enjoy this, or even if you haven't, you should try A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review [...]*"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I did not think this was a good book at all. I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery. Besides that, many things in this book are too unrealistic and not well thought out in my opinion."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"My kids love the Arthur and Merlin stories. We have read T. H. White's \\"Sword in the Stone\\" many timesThe Sword in the Stoneas a family.This book pokes the Arthur legends, and pokes them, and turns them over and gives them their due, and then pokes them again. And again. The satire is simply wonderful -- twice as good if you have read Thomas Malory and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.The section on breaking the enchantment on the well, with the sensational German-sounding incantations, was wonderful. The whole book was entirely enjoyable.Little kids won't get this, unless you are willing to read it all together. Better for big kids.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else?

But this lesser known novel embodies all that is great in Twain's writing. It has the humor, but also represents Twain's great eye for social commentary. I highly recommend it to all fans of Twain."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything. But the world my never know."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small. The story is just as classic as always, and to it I give a galaxy of stars. However, to the knuckleheads at Bantam, I have only condemnation. The print is as small as I have ever seen. My thirty-something eyes are still strong, and are aided by glasses, but I find that after a half an hour, I must put the book down. Spend a little more money, and do yourself a favor, and buy a different version of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot. The book made me think, what would the world be like if some one actually did go back in time?"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Twain brings up a lot of interesting points which, although not new, may seem so because of the manner and voice he uses to bring them up. Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency... And, hey, you've gotta love Hello-Central!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier. Twain tells the story first-hand and with his unique combination of wit and descriptive narrative. This is truly an American literary classic and a must-read for anyone interested in 19th century America."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541. He then discusses in great detail his training and early career as a steamboat pilot before the Civil War, and the accompanying science of navigating the river. Mastering the river in Twain's time was a mind-boggling achievement - it required the memorization of the entire river from St. Louis to New Orleans, and this monumental task was complicated by the Mississippi's tendency to change its course constantly. Later in life, Twain and some companions traveled on a steamboat from St. Louis to New Orleans, and he discusses in great detail how the riverboating industry (as well as industry in general) has changed. This account reads something more like a travelogue.Interspersed through this account are a number of anecdotes and commentaries, covering a various and sundry range of topics, including tall tales, legends, architecture, culture, grammar, mule racing, cockfighting, and Sir Walter Scott's detrimental effect on the American South. One could spend several pages listing the topics Twain covers, but suffice it to say that the majority will be of interest to the discerning modern reader. His tall tales (often related as fact) are particularly good.Twain is just as engaging here as he is in his fiction. He is self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek, and his style is completely endearing. And if a particular topic is not of interest to the reader, well, he moves on quickly enough.Ultimately, Life on the Mississippi is a fascinating read, not only for detailed insight into nineteenth-century life in America, but also for the countless tales Twain relates in his inimitable style."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"This review relates to the Heritage 1944 edition...Heritage's Life on the Mississippi features a dusky green slipcase; book is covered in textured green cloth with a riverboat emblem.

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home. Quite accurate!"},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, a conecticut from the 19th centuries brings modernization into the 5-6th century and seems to change the world at that time. He is named the Boss after making amazing feats and everyone becomes scared of him and in awe. he puts Merlin the magician into shame and the Boss becomes the famous minister of king Arthur and the magician everyone is scared of. Yet, Hank( the connecticut's real name) is not a real magician. He uses his knowledge of the earths reaction and science of the 19 century to perform what seem like miracle and magic to the people of the 5 and 6th century.Hank goes through many things in the 5th century. In the end, all of britain goes against him and 53 other people, but he prevails using his knowledge and cunning. He sleeps for 16 centuries until the time comes for him to wake up and be in his own time again."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's time-machine drops the main character in this book in the 6th century of King Arthur's Great-Britain.What he sees is a nation of slaves under the heel of king, Church and noble ('a privileged class is but a band of slaveholders'): 'sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, go naked that they might wear silk and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them.'But the slaves were so poor-spirited that they took the thanks (cuffs and contempt) and the attention they got as an honor. They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"Life of the Mississippi","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion.

It was one of the wilder rides of our lives!He is a very human being; it shines through in his treatment of his subjects, be they abstract concepts, like emotion and memory, or real people, as he describes in his books.Even if one cannot finish a book...who of us with attentional problems can?!...this is the one to try, because one doesn't have to read it all! Just the first and last chapters are worth the admission fee; they explain the issue completely. And with one or two chapters from the middle, which detail specific conditions, one has a full experience!For anyone looking for a page or two to be convinced, I suggest the last two pages of the chapter on ADD: Prisoners of the Present; Ratey's description shows the depth of his understanding of not only the clinical manifestations but also the very real, personal, and agonizing element of how this condition affects the soul.Again, I say, this is a &quot;must read&quot; for any, but especially those of us who can't finish a book."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"I found this one at a dollar store, and devoured it. Very readable considering it's medical nonfiction, no doubt because of Catherine Johnson, who's really a magazine writer. Part of the interest lies in the somewhat disturbing notion that, given the soft definition of the major mental illnesses such as ADD and depression, most people we know could qualify for a diagnosis of a &quot;shadow syndrome.&quot; If you're willing to accept this revelation, then the explanation behind the theory, which is basically that the brain's biochemistry is responsible for generating much of what we normally think of as &quot;moods&quot; or &quot;personality,&quot; will be fascinating, especially considering that Ratey and Johnson are careful not to imply that biochemistry is the sole explanation for everything we think and feel. In fact, they do a fine job of integrating biochemistry and classical psychology as the driving forces of who we are.The book is also readable because of its nifty organization: a shadow per chapter, and soon you're an expert (or at least you could think of yourself as one, especially if you're slightly hypomanic). In addition, there's lots of compelling case studies inserted into the explanations.Overall just very readable and interesting, especially as an introduction to the latest styles of crazy. Would be most useful to someone attempting to learn about these issues from scratch, since the book doesn't necessarily reveal too much in-depth information. I rate it low because it ultimately leaves you with little to go on, other than a better understanding (perhaps) and a &quot;take-it-for-your-family&quot; view of psychopharmacology (potentially useful). Other than this, some parting words on exercise (karate: oh brother) do little to justify a perfunctory section on &quot;the care and feeding of the brain.&quot; This is an informative, not an empowering, read."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"When one has a sneaking suspicion that there could be an underlying condition affecting one's behavior then the time is right to read this book.

This book was a wonderful exploration of the complex biological and environmental factors that interplay to make each individual's personality.

They agree with Freud that \\"Every person is only normal on the average.\\" We each have oddities and dysfunctions that fly under the radar of formal diagnosis and treatment. Some of these quirks are less severe forms of well-researched mental illnesses. The authors suggest we can improve our lives by understanding the causes, effects, and treatments of these mental monsters and the lesser shadows they cast over our lives.The book begins with a general discussion of brain physiology and how low-level neurological problems create \\"noise\\" that interferes with smooth processing of information. Individuals respond to this \\"noisy\\" environment in different ways, including escape into anger or dependence. Much depends on what specific difficulty each person experiences. Successive chapter explore mild forms of depression, mania, rage, attention deficit, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, addiction and anxiety. Readers are introduced to each major disorder, alerted to signs of its milder form, and empowered with reduced-dosed treatments that match. The book closes with a further discussion of brain physiology and how we can adapt our lives to live happily with our imperfections.This book is recommended for eccentric readers who may recognize themselves in this catalogue of shadow syndromes--and find increased self-knowledge, self-acceptance and encouragement. It is also recommended to parents, teachers and managers looking for better ways to work with others. Interested readers may enjoy Sigmund Freud's earlier ideas about the disorders of normal people inPsychopathology of Everyday Life."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"The most important message of this book is, nobody has an optimum brain/mind with the best mixture of traits. The book even points the \\"excess of optimism\\" that some people exhibit, as yet another mild mental problem. And in fact, it has been that way for all the time; but as times change, some mental health issues are considered more like a \\"disease\\" than others. Even the social class you belong to, will make a difference (as the book tells a case where a poor guy was not diagnosed with ADD until mid-twenties).Being an Asperger myself, the book helped me to understand myself and my \\"problem\\", and actually understand that as a kind of trait, taking into consideration that every human being has its own \\"problem\\" and yet many people use that advantageously.

With 387 subtly reasoned pages, based on careful, detailed observations, it is intended for sophisticated readers. It is categorized as a popular psychology, but I believe this category underestimates its value. It articulates a major conundrum faced by mental health practitioners; it is a very practical guide for dealing with this conundrum.In the prison mental health treatment program in which I was a psychiatric social worker, the basic qualification for admission was the presence of a major mental disorder, such as schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, or major depression. There were about a dozen of these qualifying diagnoses.Not only did these disorders keep these men from functioning in prison, the disorders had often been at the root of their crimes: they had assaulted, kidnaped and murdered in response to hallucinations, in the throes of depression, in the grip of mania. They had been swept up by irresistible impulses.We certainly had our hands full with these severely mentally ill prisoners, but there was another, even larger subset of men who did not suffer full blown disorders, but whose mental state also caused them considerable distress and led them to inflict even greater distress upon their victims.These men, who did not hear voices, but were preoccupied by perpetual \\"noise.\\" They did not experience the hopelessness and despair, the disruption of sleep and appetite of full blown depression, but were perpetually unhappy. They did not explode, but were forever irritable.These men, not quite fully disordered, had done just as much harm as the men who did meet criteria for major mental disorders. They were just as miserable.Very, often, when I, and like minded clinicians, tried to get such men into treatment, we would be challenged by other clinicians who insisted that since they did not meet criteria as defined in DSM, whether III, IV, or IV-TR, they should be denied psychiatric treatment.No matter that treatment would help these men be safer to be around, both in prison and in the community. As far as these clinicians were concerned, if these prisoners didn't meet the qualifying diagnosis, they should not be admitted. These punitive professionals would declare that these prisoners were just trying to do easy time. They would gloat when they succeeded in getting these men kicked out of the program.I developed ad hoc ways of getting around these requirements, but never really thought it through. SHADOW SYNDROMES gave us validation for saying these men were not fakers, and that both they, and society would benefit if they received treatment."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"I will join the chorous of reviewers who very much liked this book. Drs. Ratney and Johnson even mention Dr. John Oldham's somewhat like-minded (my impression) book, \\"Personality Self-Portrait\\", which I also admire. Both psychiatrists Ratney and Oldham seem to extend the dotted lines from more typically recognized diagnostic (DSM) catagories to reflections (shadows) in acceptably normal \\"personality styles\\" - a la David Shapiro. I am personally disposed to place greater credibility in what has been gleamed from collective decades of clinical work than from more abstract constructs or outmoded four-letter Jungian constructs. Perhaps the authors might consider jointly writing something along the lines of a textbook fully incorporating their ideas and elaborating on some of the latest neuroscience findings?

The authors state- and I believe them- that a mental disorder is not a discrete box to fit people into; mental disorders exist on a continuum, from almost unnoticeable to full blown psychosis (or, in the case of autism, Kanner's syndrome). They examine mild forms of mania, ADHD, depression, OCD, anger, anxiety and autism, and say \\"If mild forms of mental disorders are making you (and those around you) miserable, you should seek treatment and be able to be happy\\". They also point out that some of these mild disorders can confer advantages as well as problems: a person with hypomania can get a lot of things done; people with mild autism can focus incredibly well. Obviously, not all shadow syndromes have good sides; constantly being sad, lacking emotions, being angry all the time, perpetual worrying and having obsessions are not good things.The authors are able to show that different mental disorders are caused by variations in brain chemistry; the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in various amounts create different effects. Antidepressants, tranquilizers, lithium and other psychiatric meds bring the neurotransmitters back into balance. Not that the authors feel everyone with a shadow syndrome needs to go on meds; their basic prescription for brain health is enough exercise, eating healthy, proper sleep, stress relieving techniques and therapy.I think this is a very good book that makes a very valuable point about mental disorders, that mild forms are being overlooked and the sufferer being left unhappy.

In many ways, this book is an extension of the ideas of Peter Kramer's Listening to Prozac and Michael Norden's Beyond Prozac, especially the former book. It's filled with useful information and plenty of detailed case studies, where I think case studies are a very useful and entertaining way to learn about the effects of psychiatric drugs. Is there really a large fraction of the population that exhibits symptoms bordering on overt mental illness?

Nor do I plan to. While in a local bookstore, I noticed the title on a shelf (it is familiar to me as an often cited reference in Autism literature). There, I read the chapter on Autistic Echoes (focusing especially on the the sub-section entitled 'Shy Gorillas' {a misnomer of course}). I must praise the book for raising the issue concerning the connection that the Schizoid Personality has with the Autism Spectrum. I believe it to address this issue most excellently."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"Having medical background and some preliminary knowledge on modus operandi of sensorimotor faculty of the brain and neuroplasticity, I find this book very interesting in terms of looking at a bigger picture: how psychiatry and neurology are smoothly blended together; why brain is not isolated from rest of the body; why environment brings about changes in our brain just like it does on our skin/body and how. I am just finishing first chapter and looking forward to going over rest of the book!"},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"An interesting book to read and understand all syndromes and how they appear. Although too much on the side of using Prozac which now is not used as much as many patients become hooked on such medicines . If you take that away,or do not pay much attention to this part, it is very informative and you can understand those who are near you who have these syndromes."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"This is a worthwhile book to read as an introduction to a number of fascinating personality disorders. The primary flaw: the authors assume that popular stereotypes equal scientific fact, and tailor their analysis to support the stereotypes. For example, the passage explaining that men 'act like men' because they have shadow ADHD accepts several negative stereotypes as premise. Certain comments, asides, and occasional cheap shots detract from the objectivity of this study, and hint that some of the conclusions are agenda-driven."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"Anyone who has ever thought that he might have some psychological problems should read this book. Why, then, do I give it only a 5?Because, in spite of years of extremely suggestive research on the role of brain chemistry in personality and psychological disorders, there are still no objective biochemical tests for the presence of such disorders.If the diagnosis is still based on talk and history, rather than chemistry, the causal connection assumed by the authors between chemistry and disorder must be regarded with skepticism.Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear that the pharmacological therapies (Ritalin, Prozac, etc.) actually work -- in some sense, at least -- and can have major life-changing effects. Indeed, that's the problem with psychopharmacology described in, e.g., _Listening_to_Prozac_: How much should we allow our personalities to be affected by the pills we take? If you function &quot;well enough&quot;, is it ethical for you to be given medication that will make you &quot;better than well&quot;?Finally, for those familiar with the traditional and ancient theories of personality (or character) based on humours (melancholic, saturnine, phlegmatic, splenetic), the book provides a thought-provoking new take. Not one, I hasten to add, that the authors endorse -- I don't recall even an allustion to it -- but one I was quite struck by"},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"The book don't share the objetive information that I waited.It don't help you to diagnose or perceive the \\"shadow syndromes\\".A lot of real cases but little epidemiologic, neuropsychiatric, and treatment information.And it don't do the most important in my opinion: to diferenciate from a shadow syndrome to the other."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"A nonsensical book based on the notion that your brain makes you crazy, and there's not a darned thing you can do about it.

There's a lot that's &quot;shadowy&quot; about this book--mostly the obscure writing and even more obscure premise. Skip it."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"Now we don't have to worry about trying to make good choices to make our lives work. We can just blame all our character flaws on &quot;bad brain chemistry.&quot; At least that's what the authors of this book would have you believe. Can you choose to stop being abusive to your wife? Naw, this book says. You were just born to abuse. Take a little Prozac, instead. That's the only way to cure the &quot;bad biology&quot; that makes you so angry. In this book of what you might call &quot;speculative philosophy,&quot; the authors make up a number of ways you could be secretly crazy, from being &quot;a whiz at math but clueless when it comes to people&quot; (mild autism) to my personal favorite: having too much &quot;vitality and vision&quot; (hypomania).They've given Americans a new excuse to avoid responsibility when their lives aren't working: my biology made me do it. But, in the end, the book sends a very despairing message: You're not in control of your own life. You have some mysterious brain chemistry that's really running the show and directing what you only imagine to be your free will. If you're desperate to find a way to escape all responsibility for your life, buy this book and take a few pills to adjust your bad biology (the pharmaceutical companies will love you). If you want to take charge of your problems and do something meaningful for yourself and mankind, don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"What some cynics will have you believe is that everyone is a little quirky, and that you should just accept that. Personally, I think that's a laugh. It's true ignorance shining through. The unwillingness to have an open mind and truly accept that there just might be biological reasons for behavior.I began reading about anxiety disorders years ago, because my wife was having true panic attacks. When my son was born 7 years ago, we knew we would have to keep an eye on him. Now, as a first grader, we're seeing signs of behavior that don't make sense. They aren't just as simple to brush off as saying &quot;he's just being a boy&quot;. So I've been reading more about bipolar, ADHD, ADD, and other conditions.In reading about some of the mental disorders, I was intrigued by the recent acknowledgement of adult ADD. I read the symptoms, and had to face the cold reality that they really fit me. I'm 41 years old with a BA, MS and I'm halfway through my MBA. I've done well in my career and I've been married for 13 years to the same person. By all rights, I'm pretty normal. But I have always been a terrible procrastinator. I've read books on the subject and tried...REALLY tried...to help myself get organized and on track. Nothing I've ever done has helped. As an example, I had a report to write for work last fall. The CEO wanted me to do this. I knew what needed to be done. I knew how to get the research. I knew what the final presentation should look like. I had 5 weeks to prepare. I would sit at my desk, tell myself I wasn't going to get up until I had a good chunk of it done...and then surf the internet. Or work on another project. Or enter addresses in my Palm Pilot. I was distracted by every noise, every conversation in the hallway...even though I had a financial stake in the outcome (my job!).These things happen all the time, and they have for over 25 years. I've always said they're just part of my personality. A reviewer below wants you to believe that this book is worthless. I can tell you from first hand experience, this book has helped me understand that there may be a biological answer to what I thought was &quot;just my personality&quot;. I believe, as one of the authors states, that it is my duty as a husband and father to explore the possibility that I have ADD in a mild form, and seek treatment. If that means I take a pill, so be it. I take a pill for my cholesterol, wear contacts for my eyes, so why wouldn't I treat this as I treat those other bio-conditions?If you think, just maybe, that you have a hint of one of these conditions, spend the bucks and the hours and read this book. Those of us with &quot;shadow symptoms&quot; are less likely to get diagnosed, because we're not as obvious. We need to help ourselves a little. Ignore the skeptics and cynics...make the decision yourself."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"I read this book because our child had just been diagnosed with one of the &quot;Shadow Syndromes,&quot; Asperger Disorder. As so often happens with childhood-onset brain disorders, he has symptoms that are a mixture of various disorders -- major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder. (These are hereditary disorders when appearing in one so young.) After reading this book, so many elements of our son's puzzling behavior, and the milder symptoms present in my husband and myself are more understandable. If you or your loved ones have mild forms of more serious brain disorders, this book is for you. I had an &quot;aha&quot; experience at every chapter.

The idea that there are &quot;mild&quot; forms of mental illness, which we may all have pieces of, is extraordinarily useful in understanding myself and others.The book absolutely cries out for a bibliography.

I suspect it isn't exactly right, but it explains a good deal more than any alternative I've seen.One warning - this isn't very valuable as a self-help book. It should be read mainly to improve your understanding of the human mind, not as a means of changing it."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"Shadows Syndromes is a worthy read, in that it does a good job of highlighting the major disconnect between diagnostic categories and reality. While the DSM model has its uses (research and billing being the only two I can think of right now), it also serves to reify the notion that mental illnesses are precise, discreet disorders. Any one with an ounce of clinic experience will tell you that real cases don't fit neatly into categories. The diagnostic questions sometimes help think through and organize the presenting concerns, signs and symptoms. But often the debate over whether someone is suffering from a pure mood disorder versus PTSD versus character pathology serves as a distraction. Or , another classic example: spinning wheels arguing whether a patient is an addict with psychiatric symptoms secondary to drug abuse or are they actually someone with a primary psychiatric diagnosis who is using substances to self-medicate their mental illness. It's a meaningless exercise based on an overly simplistic model. But that one does matter because insurance companies consider one of those scenarios worth paying to treat and the other worthy only of their contempt.In reality, just like any other organ in the body, the brain mediates a number of functions. It is responsible for mood regulation, memory, sustaining attention, shifting attention, interpreting social cues, integrating sensory information, regulating motivation of all manner of behaviors, and impulse control, to name a few. We all have various strengths and weaknesses, and we all fall somewhere on a bell-shaped curve for performance of each of these various tasks. People who shake out on the extremes ends in one particular area probably look like textbook definitions of specific illnesses (a \\"pure\\" mood disorder with no other comorbidities). That's rare. Looking at it even just from this sort of statistical model, one would expect that, for any given disorder, the number of people who unmistakably qualify for a specific diagnosis would be just a fraction of those who almost qualify. These \\"subclinical\\" cases are what Drs. Ratey and Johnson refer to as \\"shadow syndromes.\\" They go a step further and assert that these people actually suffer more from mental illness, because they slip through the cracks. They are not quite sick enough to find themselves needing treatment, but they are impaired by their symptoms.It's an important perspective that is explained in simple, readable terms in the first part of the text. The second part then breaks the shadow syndromes down into specific \\"mild\\" mental illnesses based on the traditional categories. So just imagine how densely the comorbidities can layer now. Is there anyone motivated to pick up this book that won't conclude that they have masked depression, are slightly bipolar, have a subthreshold intermittent rage disorder, mild attention deficit disorder, a touch of \\"autistic echoes\\" and are a shadow addicts? Then what are the implications? Does everyone need to be in therapy? Does everyone need to be on a finely tuned psychopharmacological regimen and a behavior plan?I recommend this book, I think it's well-written and thought provoking. It does succeed in explaining complex issues in a way that is understandable to people outside the field without being simplistic or dull to people within the field. That's a tough line to walk. And I like the emphasis on blurry boundaries to disorders, and the overall message of understanding how your brain works, what your relative strengths and weaknesses are and how to make the best of things. But I worry that the take-home message for many will be to feel these diagnostic categories expanding, billowing out of their margins, pathologizing every aspects of our humanity as it envelopes us. While it gets at the true complexity of these disorders, it also does so with the bias that mental illness primarily a Biological phenomenon. Perhaps this is to combat social stigma and people's assumptions that these deficiencies are due to personal weakness (or- just as damaging- all to be blamed on bad mothering). Or perhaps, it's that, as we learn more about these disorders (which we are doing at a rapid rate thanks to the new abundance of genetic data and advances in brain scanning that lets investigators see brain regions light up as they work), we learn more about the biological aspects, since that is what we are looking for and trained to interpret. So, now the authors expand the scope of these diagnoses and therefore lead us to the conclusion that more people could benefit from psychopharmacologic treatments. It's a nice book to recommend to your patients if you take only self-pay patients and only do psychopharm visits. But it skims over the real beauty of psychiatry, the reason it is the most intellectually challenging field in medicine and the most rewarding specialty to practice, which is the multifactorial, composite nature of everything our brain is and does at any moment. No doubt the genetics shape the brain, as does the metabolic and endocrine factors in the uterine environment during development, as does nutritional factors, and then near infinite environemental variables acting constantly on each individual. From things as foundational as the fit in temperament between primary caregiver and baby, all the way out to religion and culture. From the preconscious memories of the earliest childhood experiences all the way out to this morning's headline news.You can take the best brain in the world, if there is such a thing, but I guarantee the individual possessing it will be no healthier than the families, systems, and societies they inhabit.So thumbs up for a great read, and a perspective that broadens our view of the mind and mental illness. Too bad they interpret the new landscapes with tunnel vision, but it's to their credit that they left me wanting more."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"When one has suffered as intensely and for as long with many of the mental disorders described in this book--both major and mild--as I and 4 generations in my family have, FERVENT applause goes to Dr. Ratey for his elegant work. I can attest to his astonishing expertise and extraordinary compassion in this practical, uplifting, fascinating book. The authors make it look easy, but don't be deceived by the lack of jargon. The data is sound. Perhaps your interior life isn't as &quot;interesting&quot; as mine (bipolar II (hypomania), OCD, ADD, a soupcon of autism, a touch of Tourette's, and an eating disorder). You will still learn a lot and enjoy the process. I gained more profound personal insights in one brisk reading of Shadow Syndromes than I did in the last 40 years of slogging from crisis to crisis.

The authors have done a remarkable job of a difficult subject--formes fruste--a notion not clearly understood even by competant physicians. An example of the difficulty is given by a thoughtful reviewer, who wrote: &quot;there are still no objective biochemical tests for the presence of such disorders&quot; and who concludes &quot;If the diagnosis is still based on talk and history, rather than chemistry, the causal connection assumed by the authors between chemistry and disorder must be regarded with skepticism.&quot; This is the only criticism worthy of debate--but it is still wrong:The author mistakenly assumes that stand-alone biologic criteria (as parametric measures) are the sine qua non for objective diagnosis. This is simply untrue. It is sufficient to demonstrate that signs and symptoms cluster together in certain people in a manner that would not be predicted from chance and chance alone. If one of the measures is biologic (e.g. PET scan--Zimetsky's work) this adds a luster of credibility to the eventual diagnosis. But the converse is not true: the absence of a distinct biologic measure does *not* invalidate the diagnosis. Recognition of this concept expands the treatment armamentarium to include, where indicated, specific medications. Moreover, the very nature of the psychotherapy will change if biologic influences are strongly suspected.Failure on the part of the medical profession to understand this can be reversed by an enlightened public. Failure to act appropriately can result in tragedy. This is especially true when children suffer during their socialization and educational years. I know of what I speak.The only criticism I would make is that the authors did not include a bibliography."},{"Title":"Shadow Syndromes: The Mild Forms of Major Mental Disorders That Sabotage Us","review":"I heard John Ratey speak at a conference on ADD, and had to read this book.

If he had lived today he would undoubtedly be a frequent guest on talk shows. Now after many years of obscurity, Casanova has had a revival of sorts, and a following of scholars known as \\"casanovists.\\"Andrei Codrescu's book, based loosely on the facts of Casanova's life, details the declining years of Casanova, against the backdrop of European history. It is a time of spectacular decadence, the last days of a crumbling feudal aristocracy, the shock waves of the French revolution, and the personal decline of the once notorious Casanova, a man who has had many romantic escapades but has never formed a lasting relationship with a woman. Now he is lonely, disillusioned, desperately trying to achieve immortality through his writings. And in a way, as the author shows, he does.I love listening to Andrei Codrescu on National Public Radio, but Casanova in Bohemia was something of a letdown.

He represented both the greatest contradiction to those ideals and their staunchest defense. He was, you might say, the well-connected contrarian.Casanova in Bohemia is not a novel. Andrei Codrescu has written us instead a salon, a chance to eavesdrop on the conversation that the aging Casanova shares with the revolutionary age that's overwhelming his own. The conversation is enthralling. The fact that we are obviously listening to Codrescu's words behind Casanova's moving lips makes this particular piece of ventriloquism no less enchanting. The obvious connections between Casanova's declining world and our own and the playful sexuality of Codrescu's reconstruction of the Grand Lecher and the values of our times only make it more fun to read.An odd concession to the novelistic conceit gives the book a weird anachronistic conclusion, but you can skip it at no great loss.

The first is that Man had an ideal relationship with God in the Garden of Eden, which he ruined by eating the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. The subsequent interplay between Man and God since then consists of an elaborate attempt to reestablish that original Edenic bliss. In this view, Man essentially makes himself worthy of God by returning to a passive, submissive role and yielding to God's will.The alternative understanding of the story is that when God created Man he withheld two things from him: knowledge/reason and eternal life. Having eaten from the Tree of Knowledge, Man acquired the capacity to reason and develop knowledge. In order to make sure that Man did not also acquire the infinite lifespan in which to develop this knowledge, God banished him from the Garden. In this view, Man is in the process of becoming God. The subsequent relationship between Man and God consists of God putting obstacles in Man's way, like the multiplicicity of tongues as a result of the Tower of Babel, and man overcoming them.The difference between these two views is stark and explains much of Western history. The first view is a more spiritual and inspirational view; it is grounded in the emotions and the inchoate yearnings of human beings to be comforted. It is a slave ideology, conveying the message that externalities are insignificant and what really matters is a personal relationship with God. It requires no action on the part of Man, merely submission. On the other hand, the second understanding is a call to action on the part of Man and a challenge to God. It is an aspirational view, grounded on the belief that Man is perfectable. It reflects the belief that through reason, increasing knowledge and expanding life spans, Man will one day be God's equal. In this context, Genesis is not a tragedy but a revolutionary manifesto.All of which brings us to Martin Buber's I and Thou. We had to read this in Philosophy and Religion my Freshman year at Colgate and I found it excrutiating reading. Returning to it twenty years later has not helped. Stripped of all the obtuse language, repetition and other kerfluffle, Buber's point is this: humans are capable of two types of relationships, the I-It relationship is what we have with things or people whom we treat as objects. The I-Thou relationship is the type of mutual relationship we have with some people and which he thinks we should have with God. In the I-Thou relationship we recognize others as beings rather than things. (...)Buber's concept of I and Thou, with it's emphasis on recognizing interrelations and dependencies and then immersing oneself in them, resembles Taoist or Buddhist ideas, but it also harkens back to the first reading of Man in the Garden of Eden above. The goal is to experience this kind of completely internalized relationship with God. It is, by and large, an attempt to comfort Man with the notion that it is in fact possible to enjoy such a relationship with mysterious spiritual forces which we can perceive in the world around us but which we can not understand through pure reason. It is static, passive and wholly inner directed.If I understand him properly, which I doubt, the following analogy might help: think of Alexander Pope's image of the chain of being; in Buber's philosophy it suffices to recognize your place as a link in the chain and how you interlock with the other segments and that together you all form God's creation Through this realization, and acceptance of your role, you can then approach God. Simply being and accepting being is enough. It is this understanding of existence that has resulted in Buber being termed a religious existentialist.Buber's theology though, like Existential philosophy, has been utterly rejected in Western culture and a good thing it is. Instead we, by and large, believe in the infinite perfectability of Man. We are not content to live out our existence as mere links in a chain; we believe that we can follow that chain to it's end and understand God's secrets, thereby becoming God ourselves. (...)It is easy to see how this activist, outer directed understanding of Man's role in the Universe has led to the ascendancy of Western Civilization. While other peoples, believing in a Buberesque sufficiency of their current existence, have dithered away their days in purely spiritual and contemplative pursuits, we in the West have been driven by the idea of Progress. Perhaps this is even the best term to oppose to Existentialism; our culture is, in nonpolitical terms, Progressive rather than Existential. We refuse to just be, choosing instead a process of becoming, always becoming, whether that means becoming more intelligent, longer lived, or whatever.At any rate, the book is still just godawful--impenetrable prose joined to silly ideas--and whoever decided that eighteen year olds should start out their college educations by being required to read it should be flogged.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"item was received in a timely fashion. excellent condition. problem with printing. page 23 was missing. returned item only to find that the replacement had the same issue. there is a disconnect in reading. tried to go along without the missing page but had difficulty in making the connection. it may be a printer's error, but it is rathering annoying"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book is difficult to read or to understand.

It is, as another reviewer remarks, philosophy rather than Judaica, and it has profoundly influenced Christian thought as well as Jewish on the subject of human relationships. I agree with other reviewers on its value.That said, here I'm rating a translation, not the original German. This 1937 translation is not adequate, especially by modern standards. It's clunky and its choice of English words and expressions leaves much to be desired. Buber is not easy, and the thread of his thinking is sometime difficult to follow, but translator Ronald Gregor Smith adds unnecessary difficulty. In some cases his interpretation of the original German seems questionable to this reviewer.There is an Italian proverb, \\"Traduttore:traditore\\" (translator:traitor). For me, in this case the shoe fits. Read the original German if you can; if not, then Walter Kaufmann's 1970 English translation (also available on Amazon) is much, much better."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is the wisest book written in the last hundred years.

In experience, we are engaging the world as an objective observer rather than as a participant. Experience is the mode of science and philosophy, the mode through which we come to know things intellectually, and to put things to use for us. The object of experience (the It) is viewed as a thing to be utilized for some purpose. I and the experienced It: the one is the subject, and the other the object. In this relationship, the experiencing I is an objective observer rather than an active participant in this mode of engaging the world.* The second mode (the mode of I-You) is the mode of encounter, we enter into a relationship with the object encountered, we participate in something with that object, and both the I and the You are transformed by the relationship. The You we encounter is indulged in its entirety, not as a sum of its qualities, instead, it is encountered as if it were the entire universe, or rather, as if the entire universe somehow existed through the You.This \\"encounter can happen with any of the objects that we experience; but with another human the phenomena of encounter is best described as love. We can also, however, enter into encounter with a being that cannot be the object of experience: God.Western culture, according to Buber, has generally come to think that the first mode is the only mode available to human beings for engaging the world, as a result of this approach the modern man has come to feel alienated fundamentally because modern society is exclusively an It-world. We live in a world that strictly relies on experience not encounter. The only solution to modern man's woes is a true fulfilling community that can only be built by making proper use of the neglected second mode of engaging the world, and by using this mode to relate to God.Human alienation is a result of the emptiness we encounter with humans, where we feel that there could be something more, something more lasting and more fulfilling. This \\"more\\" is encounter with God, or absolute revelationThis divine revelation is the only salvation for humans, the only feeling that canKeep them from feeling the emptiness and loneliness associated with human kind. Once this revelation is achieved, we can deal with anything and anybody as you, and this transformation will give each human a sense of compassionate responsibility toward all others.All Buber's conclusions seem reasonable and plausible to me except for him joining Zionism in 1897. While I don't understand how Zionism is related to the needed compassionate revelation of humans, I'm glad that I took the time to understand how one of the main Jewish religious thinkers analyzed the world. It was time well spent."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is a difficult book that (purposefully) subverts all the standard modes of philosophical discourse in favor of metaphorical imagery. It does this because its subject matter, the spiritual happening that gives life its meaning, cannot be contained in static, philosophical concepts. The occurrence of the I/Thou, the event of meaningful relation, defies all notions of matter and logic. Matter and logic belong to the I/It world- the necessary but spiritually void public world. As the It world grows in strength, this book serves as a beautiful reminder of who we are and what we can be. And as philosophy again loses its soul and degenerates into mere technique, this little book can remind us what philosophy's true domain is- wisdom."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Ich und Du (badly) translated as I And Thou, by Martin Buber, takes me beyond any book I've ever read before. I had to read it with another selection, because after a few pages, my soul became saturated, and I had to read something else.I am at a loss for how to describe this book. The Third Testament hints at the idea.We construct the world in one of two ways: either through a relationship, which engages our entire being in the encounter (an I-You relationship), or through experiencing objects as the means to an end, engaging only a part of ourselves in an I-It relationship.From this simple seed, Buber grows three chapters and an afterward. Walter Kaufman, who translated the work, wrote a 50 page introduction, which is in itself a wonder to experience.The experience of reading the book was amazing, although I'm not sure that I learned as much as I might have. What Buber did was to give me words to explain how I believe, what I experience, and what I long for. I must read it again. And again.

The book talks about how life is just a collection of thoughts and process, and that is &quot;I and It&quot;. Occaisionally we MAY experience these beautiful moments that are gone as fast as they came, these are &quot;I and Thou&quot;, hence the title. If I were to endorse only one book this would be it.

Remarkably, it still is. It is the classic text for theistic personalism. Anyone who is embarking upon a spiritual path would be advised to read it. In an age when impersonalism in all its trendy forms permeates the religious universe of discourse, this small book might just save the spiritual seeker many years that would otherwise be squandered in pursuit of an illusory state of &quot;liberation.&quot; The sole purpose of spiritual practice is to redirect one's yearning from frivolous material pursuits and distractions to the Divine Person --- to return home to Godhead. Walking the path is difficult; finding it beneath the accumulated rubble of impersonalist ideologies is an even more daunting task. With the help of Buber's insights, the honest God seeker will find it much easier. Having gotten a sense of direction, he has only to tune out the siren song of New-Age cant to avoid running aground on the shoals of Impersonalism.

We must necessarily express it in objective terms; that is all we have for written communication. But our individual impressions really precede the objects.Before proceeding to where the primary words lead, I find that reading biographies of Martin Buber, rather than trying to absorb the introductory explanations of philosophers and scholars, facilitates my understanding. I think the most suitable for me is \\"Encounter on the Narrow Ridge\\", 1991, by Maurice S. Friedman.As a Christian, I don't seek conversion to Judaism (Christianity in its origin is best understood as a sect of Judaism anyway), but the book \\"I and Thou\\" speaks to everyone. I believe that to do it full justice it must be read over and over. If we don't have time for that right now, we can at least look ahead to where it leads.Practice in experiencing the I and Thou encounter will lead to its enrichment. Our appreciation of others will become warmer and more understanding. Finally Thou will become God. Atheists may not be willing to acknowledge this last step. But if they are truly resistant, they should understand that they have an open invitation to embrace God."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I think many people misread this book. Of course it is also possible that their interpretations are valid, but I think they miss what is for me the central and most interesting part of Buber's book.There are at least two strata of the contents of &lt;&lt;I and Thou&gt;&gt;. The deeper one is the metaphysical framework on which the upper one, like Buber's conclusions in the field of ethics, theology &amp;c. is based. Now this superficial part is the part of the contents that many readers exclusively notice. They are taken away by the poetic language and think that this book is some light and soft &quot;life philosophy&quot; or &quot;mystical literature&quot;. Many people do not realize the rigorous and exact metaphysical system behind these spectacular &quot;poetic prose&quot; items. Why Buber uses poetic language is because it is well nigh impossible to talk about his topics in a clear everyday language. Because our everyday language lacks the cathegories necessary for the elucidation of such a theory on the structure of being as that of Buber, the user of the language has to revert to writing some sort of myth or metaphors in the hope that some readers may see through. If Buber had used geometrical metaphors instead of &quot;poetic&quot; language, then his book would have become less popular but may have been taken more seriously, for example, by pro-&quot;analytic&quot; readers of philosophy. Instead, because of the difficult language (Buber's language IS difficult, because it is hard to see through the emotional and poetic tone the underlying logical structure), Buber is often discarded as 'obscure' or hailed as 'writing beautiful poetic text'. In some sense both evaluations are true but from another viewpoint neither one is important.I'm not going to outline the system of this book, I think anyone will find it if he re-reads the book more carefully. The metaphysical doctrine of Buber is unusual and offers interesting features like the possibility of rethinking (or eliminating?) such relations like 'subject vs. object' or 'matter vs. mind' and rethinking the concept of 'being', that of 'individual objects' &amp;c.When a thinker tries to subvert the traditional set of ontological concepts, he very likely begins to use 'obscure language' (like Buber did) or resorts to invent words (this was Heidegger's method). We, readers, often find such works obscure or we misread them because we already do have the 'everyday' scheme of concepts in our minds, which does not conform to the one used by the writer of the book.The already mentioned subversion of the traditional concept-scheme is revolutionary in philospohy in the sense that when traditional concept-patterns are disrupted, then many of the traditional problems are revealed as pseudo-problems or they can be solved and newer ones are found. That is why, for example, Heidegger is important, for he has once again set philosophy in motion with his radical new stance on the world. Buber, together with thinkers like Jaspers, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty etc. is one of the revolutionary philosophers of the 20th century. I don't mean that Buber is among the most important, but his work may be worth a reading because of its originality.And besides, it is still really beautiful a book and may be life-changing for many."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is probably one of the most simple yet elusive theological/philosophical writings I've encountered. My general complaint is that the writing is not necessarily systematic and it does not clearly define its terms very well. Also Buber never seems to explain what exactly the I is and why it is always related to either It or Thou. Despite some of the problems I had with Buber I enjoyed reading this but I never really squeezed the whole juice out of it. When I started reading other summaries and writings about Buber that's when I realize that what Buber was trying to say all along is the that experience of the Eternal-Thou is found through the authentic interaction with others. Whereas Heidegger had a very individualistic approach towards authentic living, Buber had a interpersonal approach towards authentic living, which is to have authentic personal relationships with people instead of treating them as commodities and objects. Basically, we are initially stuck in the world of \\"it\\" since we always analyze and reduce all things conceptually. but when we approach any object or \\"it\\" in a very personal manner in which we conceive of it as a whole rather than in parts, we see the \\"thou\\". Ironically, it is through the instant interaction with each individual thou that you are really interacting with the eternal Thou. This may not be an adequate summarization Buber's book, but I have to say that I enjoyed it fairly much since it seems to be connect the existential authenticity interpersonal relationship with the relationship with the Eternal Thou (God), which I find some-what refreshing because it seems some-what common to find among some Christians to approach the world with very ascetic and hermit-like attitude (\\"I should spend more time with God than with my friends!\\" kind of attitude)."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I was a philosophy major in college and I've read a lot of works out there.

We reach a new level of awareness when we choose to approach the other as a Thou - as a relational being and not as an It. We don't find this by seeking an object, but by grace. This book is also about true dialogue (for example, Hendrix - Getting the Love You Want). Buber is worth the effort!"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"How can you describe such a book?

The Introduction by Walter Kaufmann is superb. He accurately extracts some of the essence of Buber's text, and places it in the context of Judeo-Christian thought. I say \\"some of the essence\\" because Kaufmann would likely be the first to say that he is not an interpreter of Buber's complete vision of human relationship to the \\"Other.\\" Kaufmann prepares one for the shock of Buber's direct use of simple language (at least in Kaufmann's translation) to depict one's personal relationship with another. Key to the popularity of Buber is the fact that his philosophy of human interaction applies to human-human relationships as well human-God relationships."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Buber's not at all pedantic about his philosophy here. The book's structure utilizes a lyrical simplicity to broach the \\"between\\" that, in the full service of irony, has no spatial coordinates at all. Buber contentedly points at (more than reaches towards) the metaphysical glue that is the fingerprint of something much greater, and he uses repetition to soften the blow of its intellectual uncertainty. I, for one, think of Buber as akin to Kierkegaard (I'm sure to evoke scowls for overlooking the difference between Buber's traditional role in his religious community and Kierkegaard's arrant iconoclasm), especially in light of this work, which gives the terrifying recesses of irrationality a new humanism."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Martin Buber's \\"I and Thou\\" has long been acclaimed as a classic.

Fantastic!"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This outstanding book gives a vision of a human philosophy far from the dehumanising reductionism of most twentieth century Cartesian philosophy. While Buber uses poetic language, those interested in seeing an alternate, more philosophical rigorous working out of these ideas should look at the neglected work of the Scottish philosopher John Macmurray (1891-1976).Macmurray firstly proposes action, and not thought, as the fundamental basis for understanding what it is to be human. When Descartes says \\"I think\\", he is then already divorced from the world. One can ONLY exist in interaction with others and other things, it is absurd to imagine a person as existing in a universe where there is nothing else whatsoever. Action is the full state of the human being, and thinking is a lesser, abstracted state. Action is a full concrete activity of the Self employing all our capacities whereas thought is constituted by the exclusion of some of our powers and a WITHDRAWAL into an activity which is less concrete and less complex... a theory of knowledge is derived from and included in a theory of action.Secondly, Macmurray proposes another enormous paradigm shift for Western philosophy by saying that we cannot fully understand individuals in isolation, but only in relation to others. Relationship is constitutive of human living for Macmurray: 'We need one another to be ourselves. This complete and unlimited dependence of each of us upon the others is the central and crucial fact of personal existence.' The idea of an isolated agent is self-contradictory; any agent is necessarily in relationship with Others. Macmurray corresponded with Martin Buber, and his thought essentially extends Buber's vision.These two central tenets are explicated respectively in Macmurray's two major works, \\"The Self as Agent\\" and \\"Persons in Relation\\" (also published together as \\"The Form of the Personal\\"). Macmurray's writing is crystal clear, and filled with other fascinating points, such as his distinction between intellectual and emotional representations, in chapter 9 of \\"The Self as Agent\\".A great short introduction to Macmurray and his work can be found in David Creamer's book \\"Guides to the Journey\\"."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"this is a wonderful book, and the Smith translation is fine, but this binding isn't worth the high price for this edition.

Whereas Buber was well-acquainted with the works of many before him, it is clear from reading his own works (and 'I-Thou in particular) that he himself was concerned with, among other aspects of the 'human', the very problem(s) of the systematising of human experience.In this regard, the 'I-Thou' relation is in 'opposition' to any 'system' of thought, (philosophical/theological/ otherwise); although 'systematising' of the 'I-Thou' encounter can be done afterwards. In this regard, Buber's explication of the 'I-Thou' encounter is not meant to be approached from a 'systems point-of view' - it is to challenge and draw the reader's attention to the 'I-Thou' encounter."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Surely I AND THOU ranks among the twentieth century's ten most important books.

On the other hand, we are invited to enjoy an \\"I-you\\" relationship with the speaker, as subjects judging Man the object.Now, either the \\"I-you\\" relationship we *really* have in mind--without facing our tacit religiosity in the matter--is with God the unobjectifiable, or what we call the \\"perfecting\\" process is as imperfect as Man: it is, in the cold light of day, nothing more nor less than whatever action accommodates the objectifiers, however randomly these arbiters of perfection are chosen."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"never opened it once yet, but it looks pretty interesting. more words are required for me to type in this"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Got it.

This book transforms the relational world we live in; into a workable experience. People live in an I-You or an I-It world.

Eliot. Throughout I and Thou, Buber seducers the reader with wonderfully vivid analogies and metaphors to describe the entire catalogue of human emotions, from despair to love.Speaking of love, Buber gets right to the actual connection, the actual relationship between \\"Yous\\": soul touching and speaking with soul. Buber describes beautifully how love transcends not only social ranks and appearances, but even transcends the \\"I\\" and the ego.Feelings one \\"has\\"; love occurs. Feelings dwell in man, but man dwells in his love. This is no metaphor but actuality: love does not cling to an I, as if the You were merely its \\"content\\" or object; it is between I and You. Whoever does not know this, know this with his being, does not know love, even if he should ascribe to it the feelings that he lives through...Love is responsibility of an I for a You: in this consists what cannot consist in any feeling -- the equality of all lovers, from the smallest to the greatest.This certainly rings true for any and all who have ever truly loved; for any who has ever placed the happiness of another above their own. Buber even refers to this as \\"the simple magic of life\\", an endearing sentiment in the least.Buber also speaks of despair: \\"the sublime melancholy of our lot\\", \\"the moon and the dead who haunt him at night with pain or lust\\", glowing darkness of the chaos\\", and \\"the overseers give you a superior smile, but death lurks in their hearts\\" are all phrases that one can fit into anything Poe or Dante ever wrote (this is not true...Poe wrote plenty of poems and short stories that are anything but dark and gloomy, and of the Divine Comedy only Inferno appears hopeless and dark while Purgatorio and Paradiso express a multitude of hope in a heavenly world and being). Buber then begins offering solutions to this despair and this world, and his solution, ostensibly, is that of looking at the world not as an \\"I-It\\" relationship but as an \\"I-You\\" relationship.It comes as no surprise that someone who is pushing for an \\"I-You\\" relationship with the world is also pushing for community. However, this is quite an anomaly in the world of philosophy. While most theology and philosophy urge humanity to turn away from the world, while hermits and ascetic Hindu wanderers are upheld and revered throughout not only Christianity and Hinduism but throughout most secular philosophy as well, Buber's advice breaks the mold. He advises Man (and Woman) to relate, on a very spiritual level, with the rest of the world, the other \\"Yous\\", to include persons, animals, and...trees.Another striking break from most moral philosophers is Buber's acceptance of profit and power motives.Man's will to profit and will to power are natural and legitimate as long as they are tied to the will to human relations and carried by it.Unfortunately, this appears to be a contradiction in terms. Can a will to power (or to profit) ever be tied to a will to human relations? Doesn't the latter require equality while the former obliterates it? If Buber sees the \\"You\\" in everything (as stated earlier: persons, animals, plants), then what can Woman [or, Man (I am trying to give equal billing here)] aspire to hold power over?It is once I began to distance myself from the lure of Buber's language and, with a skeptical eye, discern the crux of his argument that I find more and more that I am uncomfortable with. Buber is a fatalist. He believes in a predetermined fate for each and every individual. It seems, though, that he understood his audience to be uncomfortable with the ideas of \\"fate\\" and \\"predestination\\" (he published in 1923...not 1536), so he did his best to mask his fatalism in an idea that everyone seems to love and promote: \\"freedom\\".Fate and freedom are promised to each other. Fate is encountered only by him that actualizes freedom.In terms of pure meaning, this statement is utter nonsense; yet, Buber further argues that one \\"does not feel oppressed by causal necessity\\". I would argue that \\"feeling\\" has nothing to do with oppression. In a highly-hyped, lackluster movie released in the late 1990s (1998), a man named Truman Burbank finally discovers that his entire life occurs within a bubble that is completely manipulated by a handful of people on the outside. Up to that point, Truman never feels as though he is oppressed; in fact, he is, from all appearances, a very happy person who feels positively free to live his life in whatever manner he sees fit. Once he discovers the sham though, he realizes he was oppressed all-along; if he had never discovered the rouse, though, he would have remained feeling free...and, of course, have remained completely oppressed.Buber writes a compelling book, as long as one ignores his central theme. He investigates the spirit and spiritual relations in ways that most philosophers (or, at least, Western philosophers) have not done. He brings to light a very compelling argument and indictment against science, stating that ultimately, science relies on just as much faith as religion and theology. Yet, he also indicts himself, unknowingly, when he inquires:How much intellectual eloquence and artistry is used today to prevent or at least conceal this occurrence?True. I will never begrudge Buber the title and honor of a very eloquent artist.For more book reviews and suggestions, please visit: http://www.theunemploymentbenefits.com"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"There is something about the German language (perhaps it's the abundance of compound words, or the complicated grammar) that promotes this kind of philosophy - by - obfuscation. The phenomenon is widespread, (cf. Hegel, Heidegger, Adorno, et al). Take a relatively simple idea, preferrably one based on sentiment rather than logic, and then try to convey it as obscurely as possible through the use of compound words, vast sentences brimming with dependent clauses, and the most paradoxical lines of reasoning available. The result will then be hailed as a masterpiece by those who make a living out of teaching courses on this material (and those who take the courses and are afraid to admit they didn't understand much).Out of the idea that the relations of the self to others are very important (and that God is the most important of those others), Buber has crafted this impenatrable monstrosity. Sadly, there are many others like him out there, whose livelihood comes from being as verbose as humanly possible.

Good luck reading..."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Unlike the usual philosophical endeavor, this book does not build an argument or make a case about a particular interpretation of the world or some aspect of it. Rather, Buber's seminal work begins with a key insight into our way of being in the world and goes on to weave an intricate web of variations on this theme, creating, if you let it, a sense of his core insight in the reader's own mind. Reading this book is not about reading a philosophical argument or thesis but rather about giving oneself up to the man and his insight: that there are two fundamental ways for us to be in the world, as subjects relating to objects (in order to use them for ourselves) or as subjects relating to subjects (which recognize ourselves in that which meets us at the other end of the &quot;relation&quot;). For Buber this is what it is all about. And, he tells us, we cannot choose one or the other but must (and do) have both though it is easy for us to lose sight of the subjectness of others when we embrace their objectness. And so he bangs away at the need to see the subjectness, not only in other persons but in other aspects of the world as well, and, indeed, in the world itself, holding that to &quot;see&quot; the subjectness that is there, in the world as a whole (through relating in this manner to its parts), is to see God. And this is where it gets somewhat abstruse for he offers no proof of God in the ordinary sense but rather the assertion alone that we must have access to the subjective aspect of being in order to fully live our lives and that this assumes God. He has no proofs to offer but only an ongoing spiraling prose poem that builds the sense of the world as he has seen it, a realm of subject to subject that overarches and informs the more mundane reality of subject to object in which we are generally mired. If you are looking for a philosophical work that builds an argument with proofs and rational discourse, this is not the book for you. But if you are willing to immerse yourself in his sometimes ecstatic prose, then this offers an experience worth having. Not all philosophy is about building logical edifices or exposing one's thinking to rigorous analytical critiques. Sometimes it's just about insight and seeing the world in a new way. And that is what Buber gave us with this book. -- SWM"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This small book is obscure at times and difficult to grasp, yet it completely changed my life. I honestly think Buber wrote it poetically to encourage the reader to slow down and potentially I have a true encounter with the ideas. Most of Buber's later books seem to be developing the ideas expounded in I and Thou, so it might be helpful to read another Buber text, like Between Man and Man, alongside I and Thou. He becomes his own commentary. If you have the patience, I think you'll find this book opens a whole new perspective on relationships, our perspective on the world, and the potential for truly divine encounters."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Martin Buber has achieved something amazing in this slim book. All you really need to read is Part One of I and Thou (more appropriately translated as 'I and You' in my opinion) to understand his very practical philosophy. There is more profundity in those 30 pages than in all the religious / &quot;metaphysical studies&quot; / spirituality aisle books you'll ever see.For some reason, Buber is always shelved under Judaica, when Philosophy seems like a better place for him, but anyway don't be scared off by the religious categorization. This book is as secular as they come, and therefore safe for the avowed atheists out there.Anyway, after reading enormous doses of literature, and a pretty good smattering of Western philosophy, this was the first book to have simple, applicable advice; it is at one and the same time a metaphysical system and a doctrine of how to live the good life. As far as I know, these two branches of philosophy usually seem pretty far apart, except in religion, in which case you are forced to accept absurdities as the price of this marriage.Buber is neither an optimist nor a pessimist. He's an existentialist but I find him more 'useful' than other Ex's because his theory is not just a laying bare of hypocrisy -- Buber actually gives you a way of taking positive action to enrich your life.Lest you misunderstand this convoluted review, there is nothing Anthony Robbins-ish about Buber. He's not a rah-rah go team life coach lightweight.Just read it."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Before I read &quot;I and Thou&quot; I was one person. After I read it, I was another.I can't think of any other book that has changed my life in so drastic a way.One actually only need read the first chapter to have their lives irrevocably altered, but I would suggest reading the entire work.That will fill out the picture in greater detail.Read this one slowly.

Because you will learn how to say &quot;you&quot; (as in 'I love you') and actually mean &quot;you&quot;.Too often, Buber teaches, when we say &quot;you&quot;, we really mean &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, which is really no more than an &quot;it&quot;.This &quot;it-world&quot; diminishes all involved.

It's that simple.Dave BeckwithCharlotte Internet Society"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"In 1988 my life was completely transformed by this tiny book, and those effects continue today. Buber's powerful stance on human (and divine) relations is even more relevant and poignant today as we spend more and more time in enclosed rooms trying to communicate with strangers through machines. Buber understood human isolation so well and so eloquently mourned its harmful effects, proposing a far better way to live and relate to others.I hope that readers will take the time to digest what Buber has to say. As for which transation to read, I began with the Kaufmann, but soon found the older one by Ronald Gregor Smith to be more direct, less wordy, and much more beautifullly written. However, regardless of which translation you read, this book is truly a gem."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Buber's basic distinction is between the I- It, and the I- Thou relationship. In the I-It relationship we treat others as objects and make use of them for our own selfish purposes. In the I - Thou relationship we treat others with full respect, and seek to understand their inwardness as we understand our own. In the I- Thou relationship as Buber conceives it true dialogue and true relationship is possible. And in this kind of meaningful relationship between two understanding and empathetic human beings we come into a kind of holy relationship. And this kind of holy human relationship parallels the proper relationship we are to have with God.While this single idea might seem too all encompassing to really analyze the complexity of our human relationships, I believe it is a basically right guiding concept.Buber in this short work sets out his theoretical understanding of the concept. Buber is ordinarily a clear writer, and a remarkable storyteller as in his 'Tales of the Hasidism' work. But here the theoretical structure means that there is much abstraction often difficult to understand. Philosophy meets poetry here but not always in a readily comprehensible way.But again this is the key concept of a major thinker, and a concept which illuminate the path for each of us to a better and more humanly fulfilling life."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book was truly amazing and I continual refer to it with my relationships with other people. And that is the central commandment - to realize that we have relationships with people, trees, dogs, and god (an I-You relationship). We do not experience the abovementioned as objects (an I-It relationship) but they have life that reciprocates our actions. Buber explains our relationships and how we should go about interpreting them. For example, animals and plants are a relationship beneath language, people our related to within language, and finally the eternal you (god) is above our function of language.\\"Feeling dwell in man, but man dwells in his love. This is no metaphor but actuality: love does not cling to an I, as if the You were merely its \\"content\\" or object; it is between I and You. Whoever does not know this...does not know love...\\"The only way one can find themselves is to experience the relationship. I highly recommend this book, but I do suggest a dictionary nearby because the wording can get rather tricky. Admittedly it is a difficult read, but taking your time with each paragraph and rereading when necessary, I am confident that if you truly want to find out more about a simple but thought provoking philosophy you will find yourself done with the book in a matter of weeks."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I find the notes of Walter Kaufmann very valuable and gives another way of understanding the Old Testament. If you get an edition of I AND THOU, I highly recommend getting one translated with notes by Walter Kaufmann. The main theme of Buber in this book is that there are two basic relationships with life I-Thou and I-It. When we meet life in I-Thou we enter the sacred and are truly authentic to each other. From this basic relationship comes a kind of Monotheism as well as the ethics of personal conscience and integrity and meeting another person in their fullness, rather than reducing them or life to a thing which can be manipulated or analyzed or even objectively known. I feel that Buber opened the heart and core of the Old Testament to me, beyond what my previously more Christian studies implied was there (making any message there inferior to what the New Testament gives). Before then all I could get was outmoded laws, grisly wars, strange folklore, and proverbial common sense with an occasionally wise statement which was a nugget of gold in the strange medley of books. But once I got what this kind of authentic relating was about, something seemed to unify for me about the Old Testament and the rest made sense. I still find a lot of what I used to find there, but with the key Buber gave, I could see something growing at the very heart of Judaism behind all those books about what it meant to meet each other authentically and to feel I divinity that says I AM."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"The image of the self is incomplete without the image of the other. There are very few books that resonate so meaningfully or reflect the human condition as accurately as does I and Thou. Buber presses upon his reader the importance of engaging all of one's self in experience in order to be fully attuned to one's environment and the entities present in it, not to view the other as separate from the self but as vital and purposeful in its own self."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I am actually going to try and do something novel and comment on the product. - I think the way to do that is to comment on Walter Kaufmann's Introduction and Buber's actual thought. There are other translations available, but I think they're out of print. -The attraction of Buber is his universality, and it is this that Kaufmann plays down from the start. Kaufmann emphasizes that Buber is a \\"Judaic thinker,\\" and while that is certainly true, it is clear that Kaufmann is more concerned with issues of Buber's Jewish identity and his not being a Gentile more than Buber's thought. I find Kaufmann's tendency is in line with Ruth Wisse to a degree - I remember her saying that \\"Jews want to be left alone\\" or some such thing in The Modern Jewish Canon. ...Buber himself probably would agree with Malamud's maxim \\"All men are Jews, though few men know it.\\" There is something universal about Judaism itself, of course, and it is not simply a matter of identity. It is simply a matter of being human, knowing God, and knowing one's community and one's family. And I know Buber would agree with what I'm saying in this paragraph, because it was through reading Buber I learned these things.I want to end these comments by saying that this is a book I recommend to everyone I meet; I just wanted you to take Kaufmann's comments with a grain of salt, and maybe earn Buber a disciple before you even read the book."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Even though it is described as the Kaufman translation, the Kindle version seems to be the earlier translation that is described above as problematic. While it would be interesting to compare the differences between the two, I think I'd rather start with the newer translation."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Friends,If you happen to be a nature mystic, this book is inspirational.Jim Olsen"},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Not only the book content is revolutionary, but the form.

Martin Buber will long stand as the seminal work for dialog and interpersonal interactions. But, don't take my word for it, read the book."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"Ich und Du (\\"I and Thou\\") is one of those philosophical texts which, like Schopenhauer's Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung, consist of the elaboration of a single thought. The thought is stated up front: human beings have a double relation to the world: Ich-Du and Ich-Es. The Ich-Es relation reifies and separates things out (whether they be \\"internal\\" or \\"external\\" things), while the Ich-Du relation is nothing but relation itself. The Eswelt is a world of nebeneinander and the laws that govern nebeneinander, while the Duwelt is a seamless experience of \\"presence.\\" The Ich that reaches out and the Du that reaches back (neither of which reflects on \\"what\\" they individually are) constitute an exclusive circular reality (Ausschlie&szlig;lickheit) untroubled by causal and spatiotemporal regress. To be sure, the Duwelt collapses into the Eswelt, which means that the Ich and the Du degenerate into so many instances of Es, but there is always the possibility of resurrecting the Ich & Du hidden within the Es.There are different kinds of Ich-Du relation: 1) with nature (presumably before we know to call it \\"nature\\"), in which case we stand at the \\"threshold of speech\\"; 2) with human beings, in which case speech coincides with the Ich-Du relation; and 3) with \\"spiritual beings,\\" in which case the relation itself is speechless, but it can generate speech. (This third relation is very much in the spirit of romantic poesis.) A special subset of the third relation is the relation to God, who is the Du beyond every particular Du. God is the only Du with whom our relation cannot degrade into an Ich-Es relation, because there is no Es beyond every individual Es for which God could be mistaken. (There are, too be sure, many things which people falsely call \\"God,\\" things which are really part of nature or of ourselves, such as Schleiermacher's Abhangigkeitsgef&uuml;hl or Rudolf Otto's Kreaturgef&uuml;hl, as Buber specifically points out).What is essential in every case is the duality of the relation. Buber warns against interpreting the Ich-Du as a self-relation of the Ich (i.e. Hegel) or as a kind of \\"symmetry breaking\\" (to use a term from physics), which can be restored to oneness at the proper mystical \\"heat.\\"One of the explicit objects of this text is to move beyond liberal Protestant theology, i.e. beyond a theology that grounds the religious in some quality of subjective experience. For Buber, religion occurs before there is a subject, and once we arrive at the subject, we find it impossible to even think of religion apart from the subject's relation to another. Buber exploits the pronoun Du (\\"you\\") to draw our attention to an experience of encounter (rather than reflection or feeling) inadequately addressed by rational philosophy, and he employs this experience in the service of religion.Buber may not go far enough, however. He moves beyond the subject, but he does not move beyond religion-as-experience, which is the real drawback of liberal theology. In a sense, Buber is freeing God from the subject only to bind him down to \\"relation\\" (Beziehung), which hovers somewhere between subject and object, and is not obviously \\"religious\\" at all. There is nothing in Buber's argument protecting it, for example, from a biological-evolutionary explanation of the Ich-Du relation, or a psychoanalytic one. Buber overcomes one obstacle only to land himself before another one.Sorry if that was a little technical."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book should destroy any psychological notion that people exist in separate subjectivities. Buber's beautifully written psycho-mystical prose leaves one breathless. A deserved classic."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This book took me be surprise. I stumbled on it by accident when bouncing around between Heidegger, Jung, and a book on Jewish customs (nothing quite like being eclectic). It was just serendipitous at the time while I was trying to put together a thesis on non-foundational friendship. I have since read 'Between Man and Man' which, while actually longer, is actually an easier read so on reflection it may be better to start with that first. Nevertheless anytime that you spend with I-Thou is never wasted and has not just profound philosophical insights but also tremendous wisdom from practical living. Coming to grips with the I-Thou mode of being-in-the-world has been life changing for me and has launched my thinking in new and productive directions, so much so that I am tempted to write that it is the most influential philosophical work that I have read. It sits within the spectrum of continental philosophy, and it particular existentialism but it maintains it's Jewish distinctiveness with it's emphasis on the 'other'. If this sounds like you then I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"I AND THOU by Martin BuberI think this book will delight everyone who likes Buber,or who appreciates sentences like\\"Of course God is the wholly Other\\"; but He is also the wholly Same, the wholly Present.\\"I love that book and bought it from amazon one month ago - after I had heard people talk of itfor ages..."},{"Title":"I and thou","review":"This is a great book, written originally in German. The German language has two second person singular pronouns: &quot;dich&quot;, and &quot;du&quot;. &quot;Du&quot; is reserved for intimate friends. RG Smith, in the 30's, translated Buber's book &quot;Ich und Du&quot;, rendering &quot;du&quot; as &quot;Thou&quot;. In 1969, after Buber died, his son asked Walter Kaufmann, himself a well-known philosopher and translater, to retranslate the text. Kaufmann renders &quot;du&quot; as &quot;You&quot;. I think this makes all the difference in the world, whether you think of &quot;Thou&quot; as aloof and transcendent, or as &quot;You&quot;, intimate and immanent. I recommend the Kaufmann translation over the Smith."},{"Title":"Hellish Nell","review":"In Hellish Nell - Last of Britains's Witches the historian Malcolm Gaskill reveals the life story of Victoria Helen Duncan, a Scottish woman, born in 1867, who had supernatural abilities that eventually proved to be her downfall.The book is divided into three main parts. Part one, Helen Valorized, deals with Helen's childhood, depicting in a very detailed way the recognition and development of her second sight skills. Moreover, the first part gives insight to her position in society and illustrates her ambiguous reputation she enjoyed already in her early life: she was either treated with respect, anxiety or hatred. Gaskill goes on to describe Helen's days after her banishment from her family because of pregnancy in 1914, illustrating the events that led up to her first encounter with Henry Duncan, their marriage, their tormented relationship, which was mainly due to illnesses, and finally her development as a medium to its fullest potential.In part two, Helen Vilified, the author vividly depicts Helen's growth in reputation, gives insight to her private s&eacute;ances she started to hold in the early 1930s and profoundly illustrates her engagement with several research organization in London, which not only helped the Duncans to attain financial stability but also followed the aim in accusing Helen's performances as fraudulent and deceiving. Especially Harry Price, the founder of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research (NLPR), who did some research work with Helen and eyed her activity more sceptical as anybody else, is skilfully depicted by Gaskill as the main reason for Helen's final physical and mental breakdown. Apart from Helen's ups and downs as a living medium and detailed descriptions of various occurrences during her private as well as public sittings, part two also concentrates on the importance of the war for Helen's and other mediums' increasing status in society at that time. The main focus of this part of the book is however given to the events that led up to her final imprisonment in 1944 and the trial itself, which was held at the Old Bailey in London and ended with Helen's imprisonment for nine months.In part three, Helen Vindicated, the question of phenomena versus fraud is risen by the author and he tries to investigate this seemingly irresolvable problem by citing opinions of several scientists and other mediums. Gaskill also lists some prominent people who allegedly were spiritualists or even mediums themselves, such as Abraham Lincoln, Charles Dickens, Edgar Allen Poe or Benjamin Franklin. At the end of part three he finally returns to Helen Duncan's fate, demonstrates a mixture of reactions that followed her imprisonment and in the end refers to her last few years as a medium after her release that were marked by a tremendous decline in the overal interest in Spiritualism.Hellish Nell is a highly recommendable book for one whose interest lies not only in the personality of Helen Duncan as such but is also interested in rather exhaustive information about the spirit of the age and background information on witch hunt Gaskill gives.However, there are sections of the book that are hard to follow since Gaskill tends to jump back and forth in his descriptions, mixing the illustration of Helen Duncan's life with historical details that in some occasion could easily be left out for the convenience of the reader. Consequently, the book might leave one in a state of utter confusion because the author seems to have failed to concentrate only on the essential facts, namely the fate of Hellish Nell. If some of the detailed information and explanations were left out the book would be easier to comprehend not only for a scholarly but also for a ordinary readership."},{"Title":"Hellish Nell","review":"Hellish Nell - Last of Britain's witches by the historian Malcolm Gaskill is concerned with the story of Victoria Helen Duncan who was tried at London's Central Criminal Court under the Witchcraft Act of 1735 in 1944.This book contains several pictures, a prologue, three parts - each subdivided into three sec-tions - and an epilogue. It deals with Helen's early life, her career as a medium and the inci-dent that almost destroyed it.Helen McFarlane - with her nickname Hellish Nell for her tomboyish behaviour - was born in Scotland, to be more precise in a small Perthshire town called Callander. Helen was told by her mother that she would be burnt as a witch if she refused to be silent.Furthermore, Nell was banished from home because of her illegitimate child. Helen finally found work in Dundee and married Henry Duncan, who had been invalided out of the army. The Duncan family consisted of six children, and they had to live under bad conditions, until Helen developed her gift of passing messages from deceased people to their relatives - she became a successful spiritualist medium. Mrs. Duncan could contact the spirits of dead people and manifest them. Clothed in ectoplasm, luminous matter generated inside the medium's body, these spirits would be reunited with their friends and family before returning to the other side.Nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that Mrs. Duncan raised the attention of sceptics, as well. One day Helen had given a seance in the naval base of Portsmouth. The spirit of a dead sailor had materialised for his mother, upon his cap-band the name HMS Barham, a warship sta-tioned in the eastern Mediterranean. His mother contacted the naval authorities; they knew that HMS Barham had been sunk, but the government was hiding this fact from the public and would not state this for three months. It seemed to be nearly impossible for Mrs Duncan to know that the crew of the Barham was dead, so she appeared to have psychic powers. There-fore Helen Duncan was arrested - the police raided this seance. Towards the end of March Duncan was found guilty and prosecuted at London's Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, for conspiracy to break the Witchcraft Act of 1735. Helen had to spend nine months in Hol-loway Prison.After Duncan's sentence, she seemed to be rather exhausted, but she continued to hold se-ances. In December 1956 Helen Duncan fell ill and diet at the age of 59 at home in Edin-burgh.This book by Malcolm Gaskill is very detailed and depicts all the friends and enemies of spiritualism, for instance Harry Houdini is mentioned, moreover Helen's case came to the attention of Winston Churchill.Today it is said that Helen Duncan still makes contact in her work as a spirit-guide to another generation of mediums."},{"Title":"James Turrell: The Other Horizon","review":"&quot;The question is not what you look at, but what you SEE.&quot;- -H.D. ThoreauThis quote from Thoreau aptly applies to the work of Flagstaff, AZ. artist James Turrell. Turrell has been fascinated all his life with the concept of light and its use in art and architecture. Add to this his notion that the individual should experience this art alone, embracing what the piece has, and does not have, to offer, and one has the basic mindset to take on his art.To best experience Turrell, one needs to go to an exhibit and take the time necessary to participate IN his art. Like a good book or good music, art reqires a level of active participation to fully realize the piece's potential and to maximize its impact. A Turrell exhibit is a glorious thing- each person actively participates, taking in his color concepts, becoming one with them. Whether in one of his famed &quot;skyspaces,&quot; where the participants sit in a consistently lighted room to look through an oval shaped hole in the roof at dusk to watch the changing lighting patterns- the light from the roof diminishes and the consistent railing lighting in the room dominates- or vice versa if one sees the exhibit at dawn, to his &quot;dark rooms&quot; where the viewer is in a 99.9% darkened room with the faint glimpse of an outline of light, allowing the mind and eyes of the viewer to re-conceive its surroundings and realities- not unlike an ink blot test, but in the dark, Turrell's pieces are challenging the concept of light and how each of us perceive it and use it in our lives.What his art offers is vividly displayed in this book, a wonderfully in-depth one that showcases his growth and remarkable consistency brilliantly. His art is eclectic, ranging from the aforementioned &quot;dark rooms,&quot; &quot;Skyscapes,&quot; &quot;blue rooms&quot; (viewers in a room with a blue light dominating it, again, challenging perceptions and optics), to a recent &quot;skyscape&quot; that allowed perceived viewings of an eclipse, to his re-construction of a dormant crater (outside of Flagstaff, AZ) to allow unique views of the sky, light, the world. Each piece of art challenges the concept of optical illusion vs. reality- the light offers 3 dimenstional viewing in a 2 dimensional world based on angles of the light, the walls, etc- as well as the common perceptions of light in art.Again, Turrell should be viewed in a proper exhibit, but this book offers a brilliant overview of his career. The text is in both German and English, but still offers precise pictures, diagrams,and Turrell's philosophies on art, light, and the world. It's a brilliant work by one of today's foremost artists."},{"Title":"Oracle8i for Linux Starter Kit (Book/CD-ROM Package)","review":"I already own the same book for Oracle8i on Windows NT &amp; was again impressed with the ease of installation &amp; learning.

After trying in vain to install a download of Oracle 8.1.5 standard edition for linux I bought this book for a help reference. It comes with Oracle 8.1.6 enterprise. I got it installed and configured on Linux Mandrake 7 in about 3 hours. The Oracle instructions were great, but the linux/unix parts provide little explanation. Some knowledge of Linux is expected but I am by no means an expert. I got by with a combination of the Linux Mandrake docs and the Redhat 6.2 administrators study guide."},{"Title":"Oracle8i for Linux Starter Kit (Book/CD-ROM Package)","review":"I have wanted to get my own copy of Oracle for some time. I looked at the Oracle web site back in May 2000 and noticed that Oracle for Linux was available at a price of several hundred dollars. As much as I wanted a copy, I thought the price was a little steep, so I gave the idea away.I was therefore, very pleasantly surprised when I came across this book at a far lower price, offering essentially the same deal.The book consists of 12 Chapters grouped into 3 Sections. These are Getting Started, Fundamentals of Application Development, and Basic Database Administration.Part 1 covers the installation and configuration of Oracle. If you follow the instructions carefully you shouldn't have any problems installing Oracle. In particular, if you read the System Requirements Section in Chapter 2 you will quickly find out if your system is able to handle the job of running Oracle. In my case I found that I needed a memory upgrade, which I duly carried out before installation. The installation instructions are very detailed and well laid out.Part 2 of the book deals with Introductory SQL, PL/SQL, Using Java and extending Oracl;e Objects. Part 3 deals with Securing Database Access, Managing Database Space, Database Protection and Basic Tuning.Each chapter,(except for Chapter 1) consists of 1 to 3 paragraphs of text, possibly with a screen shot or diagram, followed by an exercise based on the previous text. This is followed by some more text followed by an exercise , and so on. Some Chapters have close to 30 exercises. In a lot of cases you cannot really move onto the later exercises till you've done the earlier ones. Even the Installation of Oracle is presented as an exercise.The typeface used in the book is quite large, and there are nearly 200 Exercises altogether. As a result the explanatory material is quite terse. A little too terse for my liking.Leaving aside the fact that the book is a bargain for the CD alone, it's best described as an Assignment Book for people learning the Basics of Oracle.Using the book by itself, is the Oracle equivalent of trying to teach yourself C programming by using Kernighan and Ritchie by itself. (Yes I know it can probably be done ... but would would you want to do it that way?)If you were attending a formal course of lectures in introductory Oracle, this book would be perfect for a bunch of assignments to go with the course. Basically, what the book needs is far more explanation. The explanations given in the book are OK, but they are a little too brief.I am now looking at buying one or more other books on Oracle to give me a little more background so I don't just know the &quot;how&quot; of Oracle but the &quot;why&quot; as well. (One book I looked at was Oracle Development Unleashed ... that seems to be on the other side of the spectrum ...all chat with very little practical material ... but I digress... ) I am not going to throw this book away, but I badly need some other material to supplement it.There are a couple of minor errors in the chapters 3 and 4 as well. For example, the location of the initialization file on page 43. It says ... /usr/oraInventory......./initoralin. Thats not where mine was installed. Also there is a minor typo on page 80 where it explains how to use @ command. Also I think there's a bug in the oraenv script in the downloadable zip file. There may well be other errors further on. At the moment I'm reading other Oracle books to try and find out what schemas and instances and user rights etc etc are. I plan to work my way through the remaining chapters when I have a little more background knowledge.One nice touch is the inclusion of a script so that you can get Oracle to start up with the other system programs when you boot up and shut down nicely when you shutdown.Notwithstanding its shortcomings I think the book is well worth purchasing. The CD is worth getting and the Exercises, although they are badly in need of some supplementary explanation, have at least given me a list of activities to do with Oracle.OK so, how do I rate this book ? I am rating it in three parts, each worth a maximum of 5. I give it 5 out of 5 for value for money (mainly because of the CD), I give it 5 out of 5 for the exercises, and I give it 2 out of 5 for its explanation of what is actually happening with all the commands and assignments. I'm not criticizing the quality of the explanations, just the quantity.OK that's 5 plus 5 plus 2 which is 12. Divide by 3 gives an overall rating of 4."},{"Title":"Oracle8i for Linux Starter Kit (Book/CD-ROM Package)","review":"This book is perfect for a reasonably resourceful and talented beginner with Oracle. It provides a much better practical hands on approach than the various OReilly books, which however are also good.I have installed it on RedHat 6.2, and also on RedHat 7.1, after following the instructions that come with that distribution regarding compatibility issues with the Java Virtual Machine, which is what Oracle Installer uses. I think it is completely unfair of reviewers here to pile on with 1 star reviews because Oracle and RedHat didn't coordinate sufficiently to make sure Oracle would install cleanly on RedHat versions subsequent to 6.2. How on earth is that the author's fault?This is not a book for Linux newbies, nor should it be (I've been using Linux for virtual web accounts, and at home, on and off, for 3 years). It is also not a book for intermediate/advanced Oracle users, nor should it be: that's why it's an Oracle &quot;Starter Kit&quot;.I'd have given this book five stars except that the book does not advocate the implementation of &quot;OFA&quot; or &quot;Optimal Flexible Architecture&quot;, as far as partioning and/or organizing Oracle files on Linux. Partitioning in particular is more of a Linux issue, but this is one place where I think the author should have gotten more deeply into such concerns.I'm tempted to give this book 5 stars to offset the one star reviews, but that would be dishonest, and I am not going to stoop to the level of most of those reviewers who in my opinion have completely unreasonable expectations of the author."},{"Title":"Oracle8i for Linux Starter Kit (Book/CD-ROM Package)","review":"NOTE: RED HAT USERS SHOULD READ THIS BEFORE BUYINGOverall I really liked this book. I have a lot of industry experience but not much experience with Oracle and this book was a perfect introduction. The material was extremely well organized and presented in an easy to read format.The strength of this book is that it will give you enough information to get up and running without bogging you down with too much details that you won't initially need. The chapter on PL/SQL is very helpful for a person with SQL knowledge. Once you work through the compatibility issues (see below) you should have the database installed in no time at all.Now the reason this book lost a star. After buying the book I realized that the Oracle installer (Oracle Bug) will not run on Red Hat 7.0. It should run fine on version 6.2 so you may not want to upgrade. If you want to upgrade make sure you move directly to Red Hat 7.1 which was released with new compatibility libraries which are backwards compatible. I did not use the version of Oracle which came with the book but instead downloaded 8.1.7 from Oracle's web site and successfully installed it on Red Hat 7.1.To find the neccessary information to install under version 7.1, go to Red Hat's site and search for &quot;7.1 last minute oracle&quot;."},{"Title":"Oracle8i for Linux Starter Kit (Book/CD-ROM Package)","review":"Had to figure out by myself why CD wasn't installing on my RedHat 7.0.

I used RedHat 6.2 after I ran into problems with Redhat 7.0. The problem seems to be with Redhat as it was suggesting most of the time to report a bug. I then put in 6.2 and paid more attention to the text in italics in Steve's book ( be careful there). The installation was a breeze and I have now what I had wanted for a long while. Infact I have DB2UDB also (7.1) running in the same machine. I have 256 MB memory. My suggestion is to have another Linux reference as a stand by esp. if you are not very conversant with Linux.

Now, after experimenting, Oracle resides on my Linux box in the correct location(/db/oracle8i)Here is what you get and do not get from this book.You are advised to follow the installation precisely, and to install oracle8i in a directory called: /usr/oracle. This is not the most appropriate place for most systems - but it works.The problems begin when reinstalling the software to the change the home directory. The oracle unistall program does not remove all existing files and directories so your oracle DB is inaccessible the second time around. (Steve skirts around all trouble shooting issues)The ORACLE CDROM documentation, however, shows this fix and many more. (Remember to delete all of the .ora files and oracle directories before a new install)Plus there is no mention of DB Assistant hanging endlessly at the end of the installer program. (The CDROM documentation clearly states this is a known bug under Linux - but Steve doesn't - So use the dbassist script/ program after the install.)Finally, For those of you having trouble. Try this. Delete all of the oracle files and directories. Start over again, this time call the user something different, such as: oracle8i Call the SID: oralin2 (2nd database) Then try Steve's directions again.

The authors do an excellent job of providing a comprehensive collection of theory, research and treament guidelines to practicing clinicians in a way that is useful and practical. Each chapter contains an overview of the use of CBT theory in practice and ties in pharmacological recommendations in addition! Truly comprehensive! The first chapter integrates a nursing model of practice (Roy's Adaptation Model) with the CBT model - something I believe is the first publication to actually bring psychology and nursing together in a cohesive manner. The chapters that follow discuss depression, anxiety, substance misuse, pain, medical disorders, brain injury, end of life problems, personality disorders, psychotic spectrum disorders, group therapy, aging, couples and finally children and families. Overall a tremendous asset to both CBT and nursing!"},{"Title":"Cognitive Behavior Therapy In Nursing Practice","review":"The Freeman's text, while investigating a new branch of nursing practice (i.e. CBT) and discussing the application of this type of psychotherapy to one's own advanced nursing practice, is marred by something as simple as typos.

If you can read around the errors and pretend that educated people don't normally proofread their work, then this book shouldn't bother you too much.The meat of the text is interesting and the application of CBT to a wide range of disorders is explored.

We found that we had read many of the same novels, but one author she mentioned was new to me. Candace Robb and her Owen Archer mysteries were among her favorites, and as she described them, I felt that they might appeal to me as well. At the lady's suggestion, The Cross-Legged Knight was my first introduction to Ms Robb's work.At first I was uncertain that I would like the author's style. I find that some writers of historical fiction, of which this is a form, are somewhat pedantic in their efforts to get their readers up to speed with respect to their chosen period. Whether this is to lend verisimilitude to their work, or because they can't bear to waste even a scrap of their hard won research, I can't say. I needn't have worried, though. Most of the author's descriptions of the medieval environment, of the various occupations, of clothing and speech were smoothly introduced, and the meanings of unfamiliar words were easily taken from their context. In checking Ms Robb's vita, I discovered that she had prepared for a PhD dissertation in medieval history and literature. Having done thesis for at least Master's level in two different areas myself, I can honestly say that one lives with these hard won scraps of information day in and day out until they become part of one. For Ms Robb, the 14th Century is \\"home,\\" and it shows!I enjoy the work of Ellis Peters and her Brother Cadfael series very much. Spending time with her delightful characters is a satisfying way to \\"get away from it all.\\" In fact, I find that when I read fiction-when I read it at all-I do so at least as much for the company of the characters as for the story. Creating this type of ambiance is a difficult task, so I expected to find myself unimpressed with Robb's sense of character and personal history. Again I was mistaken. She peoples her 14th Century city of York with individuals with whom the reader is pleased to spend time. Owen Archer and his wife, the apothecary Lucie Wilton, are wonderful people, and their household is a delight to visit. Owen's \\"boss\\" the Archbishop of York, with whom Owen has an uneasy relationship, is a complex and interesting person. The other families have at least as much of a history as the central characters, giving the book an ambiance similar in many ways to the charming Barsetshire stories of Angela Thirkell.The mystery itself was well penned. It begins almost at once with an attack on Wykeham, the new Bishop of Winchester, and progresses to the murder of a midwife, keeping the reader guessing at every paragraph. Like Colin Dexter and the Morse mysteries, The Cross-Legged Knight takes several twists before the guilty individual is brought to justice.I enjoyed the book enough to look for all the others."},{"Title":"The Cross Legged Knight (Owen Archer Mysteries 08)","review":"As I only live 20 miles from York where most of these books are set, I can perhaps visualise better than most the area of England the books take place in. Many of the streets of York mentioned in the books are still there and of the course so is the Minster.Owen Archer the lead character in the book is a Welsh longbow man who works for a high church dignitary and spends some of his spare time helping in his wife's apothecary shop. He is called upon by William of Wykeham, the Bishop of Winchester, to help him with a serious problem. I myself am interested in this period of English history and the author's authenticity cannot be questioned and her excellent story telling is spellbinding. I cannot recommend her books too highly."},{"Title":"The Cross Legged Knight (Owen Archer Mysteries 08)","review":"I love the Owen Archer series. However, I was a bit disappointed in the latest book after having read and loved the last one in which he travels to Wales.The Cross-Legged Knight was very dark and depressing. Owen is unhappy and unfulfilled, Thoresby is old and depressed, Lucie is sad and depressed. Jasper's character was utterly unused as were Bess &amp; Tom Merchet &amp; Brother Michaelo (OK he spied a little).I usually finish one of Robb's Owen Archer novels on a thrilling high, smacking the book shut with utter satisfaction. This time it was not to be. I can't help wonder if the author was distracted away from Owen's tales by her new baby, the scottish medieval series.What I disliked most about this one aside from the dark and depressed atmosphere was the dangling unresolved question of how did the murderer and victim know each other. I felt betrayed by the author, who's never left me the reader like that before."},{"Title":"The Cross Legged Knight (Owen Archer Mysteries 08)","review":"Owen Archer is back in York, after a long sojourn in Wales.

William and his entourage travel to the palace of the Archbishop hoping to make peace with the Pagnell family who blame him for their father's death in a French prison. The family believes the Bishop stole some of the ransom money, which led to the French king's refusal to release his prisoner.While the bishop looks at a church that is being rebuilt, a piece of the roof falls off and nearly kills him. He believes it is a Lancastrian plot to murder him and becomes further convinced when his York property burns to the ground, killing a herbalist and severely wounding a tenant's servants. The Archbishop charges his steward and captain of his guard to find out who is responsible for these events, a job made easier in resolving but more difficult on Owen Archer's gut by his wife's insisting she help him.The events of this book take place during the period the Duke of Lancaster tries to establish his influence over his nephew who will one day be King Richard II. Knowing the time frame help the reader understand the political undertones of the story line that serves as a reference point to the behavior of the characters. Owen Archer is a heroic figure who worries so much about his wife that he endears himself to the audience.

What is a spy,married to York's only female apothecary, to do?Whatever direction he choose, he's bound to find a puzzle. For one, the Bishop ofWinchester has created a situation that could plunge the country into a civil war. Throughthe bishop's apparent bungling, a trusted friend to King Edward III and knight of therealm has been captured by the French and before a ransom could be negotiated, he dies inprison. His widow, the Lady Pagnell, holds the bishop fully responsible and wishes toextract her own pound of flesh (to borrow from Shakespeare some two hundred yearslater).While in York to try to smooth things over with the Pagnell family, the bishop finds hisown life in danger. Coupled with what appears to be attempts to assassinate him, murderis discovered when a fire goes up in flames, leaving the victim inside. Thus, Owen Archer'ssleuthing skills are called in. Owen's wife Lucy, the co-protagonists of Robb's series, hasrecently had a miscarriage and her recovery, both mentally and physically, is taking its tollon the Archer household. The woman murdered had been responsible for helping Lucy inher recovery and both Lucy and Owen feel driven to find her murderer.And, of course, the hunt is afoot and with Robb's usual good skill, York is eventually giventhe solution. But before the murderer is revealed, Robb has a story to tell and, once again,she does it with exciting readability. Weaving quite effectively history with fiction, theRobb stories appeal to both historians and whodunit readers. Her ability to capture thelandscape and atmosphere of 14th century England is noteworthy and her plot designs wellworth the time."},{"Title":"The Cross Legged Knight (Owen Archer Mysteries 08)","review":"Having read and enjoyed the other Owen Archer books, I want to concur with the previous reviewer who found this book disappointing. I found it extremely disappointing. With the exception of the wonderful character of Magda the Riverwoman, all the main characters are too old, too sick, too depressed, or too self doubting to be credible in their problem solving ability. Lucy's whining in particular becomes very tedious. The plot is also weaker than usual. Its seems to serve mostly as backgrund for expoloring the angst of the chracters, and the ending leaves a major puzzle piece unanswered.

As it turns out, there were some things I had failed to learn.This isn't an easy book to read. It is painfully easy to follow, but it sure isn't easy to look at. What I mean to say is that, is there anyone who likes to look at their own skeletons in the closet? Not me. But it is something we all have to do if we ever plan to get anywhere in this world.I shall ask Mr. Mitchell's forgiveness in advance if I speak incorrectly of his past. It is not my intent to do anything but shed light on the plight of the Native American Vietnam veteran. They are rarely spoken of, written about or honored. These men are all bigger people than I. If my grandfathers had their hair cut off, land and language stolen from them, I am not sure if I would be so eager to serve a government that had done this. I sometimes hear people ask, \\"Why don't the Indians just get over it? That was a long time ago.\\" My answer would be, they have. They have fought and died for this country since before this country even had its own name. It seems odd to me that despite a man's heritage, he can be expected to lay his life down in a foreign land, maybe even for a foreign cause, but in his very own homeland, he is not honored for that sacrifice. That is so disrespectful and sad. Those are some of the reasons this book is so difficult to read. And that, like it or not, it isn't so easy to \\"move on\\" or to \\"get over it.\\"There are many scars a man can possess. A bullet wound will heal, ask a soldier with a Purple Heart. It may even be worth a good story or two. Scars on the forearm from jungle rot will make people gasp, but it doesn't hurt the veteran anymore. But there are some scars on the inside that, try as you might, you can't get to them, you can't bandage them or suture them. You can't blow them up, you can't ignore them, you can't outflank them and you can't run from them. They become part of you: in a way, they are you.Then the question becomes \\"How do you live your life with the person you have been made to be?\\" The author speaks with great eloquence of this. He seems to have few regrets about serving his country, and yet one can barely hesitate when asking why? He has been ignored, taunted, refused and mistreated. What would you do if the tables were reversed? That is your big question. Would you be able to rise above it? Would you sink beneath that burden? I was halfway through the book when I thought I could not continue, I did not want to find out what happened to the author on the breakneck pace of self-destruction he was on. I figured someone else must have finished writing the book for him, for surely he was in prison or dead. He is neither. Please read on if you hit the middle ground, as I did. The ending will touch your heart.The author looks you square in the eyes, as is the way of any honorable man, and he never lets his eyes blink through the entire book. It made me want to look away, to cry in shame, anger and want to have met this man back then to prove not all people are like many that he had met. I wanted to tell him that people don't treat veterans that way in Oregon. That he would have had it better here. But I don't really know that, do I? Maybe I see things from the eyes of a person who has always had the door opened for me, always had options, never been afraid to sleep for fear of what my mind would do while I tried to escape into slumber. I am safe because of the sacrifices men like Mr. Mitchell have made.I have always been safe. Maybe that is why I felt so helpless reading this book. It just didn't feel right. I was left unsettled. But maybe that is the purpose of some things in life. Shake people up now and then. Challenge some of their notions, shake their ivory towers, maybe some of us will fall out and jog some sense back into our heads. It should not matter to me or you if the Vietnam War ended 30 years ago or 30 minutes ago. The fact is that millions served, thousands sacrificed all that they had, their lives, souls, minds, arms and legs. I have given them nothing in return. What have you given them? A parade? A job when they needed one? A swift kick in the teeth? A hand? I don't know what you are going to do, but I can make a suggestion. Read this book. Then think about it for a while. Then decide if there isn't some little something you owe a veteran you know. I know what I am going to do. I shall start off by writing Larry Mitchell a letter of appreciation. I think I shall also make him a batch of cookies - every soldier needs a box of cookies in the mail.\\"-Joni Bour"},{"Title":"Potawatomi Tracks: The Ballad of Vietnam and Other Stories","review":"Potawatomi poet and Vietnam veteran Larry Mitchell takes us on a harrowing journey fraught with danger and drug addiction during his tour of duty in Vietnam and afterwards.

Others never came home. \\"Potawatomi Tracks\\" is one man's personal record, yet it rings with universal truths.In strong cadences and vivid images, Mr. Mitchell tells of his struggles with PTSD, drug addiction, and aimlessness as well as poverty as he returned to civilian life on the reservation and later spent time stationed in Germany. Now married with two grown sons, he teaches writing, secure in his tribal community and visions for the future. Ultimately, his story becomes a testament of spiritual survival and the healing power of the drum.\\"Potatawomi Tracks\\" does more than educate us and touch the heart. These poems bridge a cultural gap and issue yet another challenge to our government to pay heed to voices from Indian country. This book belongs in homes and libraries everywhere.It's ironic that Native Americans have always loyally served our country overseas, only to be treated as second-class citizens back home. From the code talkers of World War II to soldiers who've died in Iraq such as Navajo mother Lori Piestawa, Indians have fought and died for America. Surely they deserve the recognition that other veterans receive."},{"Title":"Potawatomi Tracks: The Ballad of Vietnam and Other Stories","review":"\\"Potawatomi Tracks\\", Larry Mitchell's poetic chronicle relating the events of his year-long tour of duty in Vietnam and the path back to his home in the Northeast corner of Kansas on the Potawatomi Reservation is followed by years of drug abuse, alcoholism, homelessness and racial discrimination before he is able to overcome his feelings of despair to regain his dignity, self respect and take back control of his life.From a Native Unity Review"},{"Title":"Potawatomi Tracks: The Ballad of Vietnam and Other Stories","review":"I read Larry's personal account of his tour of duty several years ago.

It was written afterward, but it tells the story of the adults in the first book. In the first book, a creation of the evil toymaker Malkin was carried over the mountains by eagles to the Anders family's home. Marta's secret was that that she was not a real gril, but a doll -- and her challenge was to rid herself of the evil ways she learned from her maker and grow the heart of a real little girl.In this story, we learn that the Anders patriarch was once a toymaker himself, and once upon a time he and Malkin were rivals in a royal toymaking contest. The story follows the journey the toymakers take through the woods, which involves avoiding the traps set for them by the insidious Malkin. The results of the contest make for a predictable ending, but the journey is fun to read about.All in all, it's not as good as \\"The Toymaker's Daughter,\\" but it's well worth reading for those who know and love the original story and want to learn more about the characters."},{"Title":"archy and mehitabel","review":"Pythagorian philosopher and surviving cockroach of note, Archy ranks with the immortals of modern verse-craft, taking turns with Mehitabel, queen errant of alley cats (Cleopatra in a previous incarnation), in expounding upon the mysteries of the universe and society from the high vantage point of a Brooklyn garbage can.Archy's buggy genius is exceeded only by that of New Orleans-born cartoonist George Herriman -- also creator of Krazy Kat -- Louis Armstrong of the Crow Quill pen.Compared to this, T.S.

The short archy essays ran for years in a major big-city newspaper (I forget which one...Chicago, I believe), and were beloved for their subtle humor and sharp satire. Because he's a cockroach, at home alone in the nighttime newspaper office, archy has typewriters at his disposal, but no way to type, other than hurling himself head down upon each key. Thus, his poetry has no punctuation and no capital letters, but it is grand poetry nonetheless.As a longtime fan of fine humor, I regard this small book, and its sequels, as valuable gems.

The time was 1916. The US wasn't even involved in World War I and Prohibition was yet to come.Marquis was a columnist and reporter for the New York Sun but he was also a frustrated poet. His way out was to write columns in blank verse about Archy, a free verse poet reborn as a cockroach, and archy's raggle taggle alleycat friend mehitabel, who claimed to have been Cleopatra in a former life. His columns had been supposedly written by archy, one letter at a time. archy would climb to the top of Marquis's typewriter, then throw himself head first at the key he wanted to hit. He couldn't print capitals because he didn\`t have the strength or reach to work the shift bar and a letter at the same time. Thus everything he wrote was in lower case with no punctuation.)archy's missals to his reporter friend are as enjoyable to read now as they were when they first appeared between 1916-1930. The political and social commentary that surfaces in some of them is dated now. It's the pieces about archy and mehitabel -a strange friendship--that are timeless. How can you not like a creature who writes: \\"i see things from the underside now/ thank you for the apple peelings in the wastepaper basket boss/ but your glue is getting so stale/ i cant eat it\\"? And mehitabel's devil-may-care approach to life (which usually treats her badly)? \\"i have had my ups and downs/ but wotthehell wotthehell/ yesterday scepters and crowns/ fried oysters and velvet gowns/ and today i herd with bums/ but wotthehell wotthehell...\\"archy and mehitabel was made into a not very good musical called Shinbone Alley. Carol Channing sang mehitabel's role on the short version recording of it. Channing was probably as good as you could get for mehitabel but unfortunately, the vehicle was inferior. For the true stuff, you still have to go these three collections of Marquis's columns.

It is about Archie, a poet and philosopher in a former life, transmigrated into the body of a cockroach. At night he takes over the typewriter of a human writer who is kind enough to always leave an empty sheet of paper in it before retiring. Archie pounds out stories about himself, his views and feelings, working with all his might. The other character is Archie's friend Mehitibel, a very precocious alley cat, transmigrated into her present form but having once been Cleopatra. Mehitabel exhibits a special savoir-faire. She has many adventures which Archie types out so the world will know how Mehitabel survives on the streets, her philosophy and off-handed views of life. It also shows her acceptance of life as it is and her philosophical turnings. Their adventures are a delight for those who enjoy the whimsical, have a vivid imagination, and are fun-loving in spirit."},{"Title":"archy and mehitabel","review":"I have an old hard cover copy that at belonged to my dad.

I highly recommend it, especially as a gift to stuffed shirts, preachers, and high society."},{"Title":"archy and mehitabel","review":"\\"Archy and Mehitabel\\" is a strange, funny little book. Drawing from the conversational poetry found in books like Edgar Lee Masters \\"Spoon River Anthology,\\" Marquis uses a colloquial style which not only suits his characters, but works in a poem. Lots of laughs, some decent writing, and a tasty way to spend a Saturday afternoon.Talking animals are easy to find in literature. Good ones, like a cat and a cockroach of this caliber, are not. Marquis brings humanity by allowing his animals to stay animals. Spiders still are poisonous, rats are still threatening, and cockroaches have never been able to type the capital letters on a typewriter. Marquis pushes reality, keeping his characters grounded in truth (OK, he fudges with truth a lot, but don't let that stop you).While filled with humorous tales, moments are sad, like in the ninth poem, \\"freddy the rat perishes.\\" Dear Freddy has a run in with a spider who is up to no good. In a valiant struggle, a tough South American spider (\\"raised on red pepper and blood\\" and \\"nursed on tabasco sauce\\") Freddy is killed while saving his friends. Freddy ate some poisoned cheese the night before and let the spider bite him, knowing he had nothing to lose. After it was over, Archy and Mehitabel dropped Freddy \\"off the fire escape into the alley with/military honors\\". Despite the whole premise being ridiculous, a tear might well up.Children will love being read the stories, and younger teens may find poetry readable (before you send them on to Keats and Byron!).

But for children who don't yet have their perception of heroism so transformed by academia and experience, this book conveys the essential battle of good and evil as greater than mere moments of conflict, and furthermore shows that heroism is not so obvious, nor so predictable as many tales suggest. This is a complex book, and no doubt the criticisms of it not being appropriate for children are well meant, but the things this book teaches about handicaps, about self-esteem and its value, and about the reality of heroic sacrifice, are more valuable than sugar coated Disney Fantasy.This is really an essential piece of fantasy literature. It is honed and unshirking in its duty to dig into what it means to be heroic even in these unheroic times. It is strange to me how few people seem to have read it.

It is supposed to be a heroe myth for our time. The book was fairly interesting but overstated. It kept pounding home that all stories are one and showing small differences between them. The main difference with this heroe is he knows what heroes have come before him, what he must face, and that he is only eight years old. Still the writing has a haunting effect that can make it hard to put it down and the plot is well thought out. Even though the reader knows what is coming in a general sense, there are enough plot twists and changes to create suspense and drama"},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"I read this book yesterday for the first time and I think it is one of the best books that I have ever read. I literally couldn't put it down and read it in a span of only a few hours. A really great read. While I would recommend this book to many people, I am extremely surprised that it is mostly recommended for small children and as a bedtime story no less.True, the main character is an eight year old boy, but that doesn't make the story a children's book. If that were true you would also have to believe that movies like Witness and books like The Shining were aimed at an audience consisting of small children, which certainly isn't true. While this book isn't exactly a horror novel to you and me, it could seem one for your average seven to eight year old. Whereas books like Harry Potter are about fantastic and fanciful things that even small children know aren't real, Prince Ombra is tied very much into the real world and real problems that ordinary people face every day. It would be easy for a small child to become convinced that the story was real and that maybe some horrible supreme evil being is out to get him too.Also, there are many references to stories and characters that small children have most likely never been introduced to. How many children of seven to eight years know who Agamemnon, Achilleus, Hektor, or Odysseus are? Or know ANY of the actual King Arthur tales? How many are well versed in Japanese or Native American mythology? A very precious few, I'm sure, and those very stories are a large part of the backbone of this novel. There is no way you can possibly realise the true feeling the author was trying to convey without having at least a little knowlege of these things, as well as the general &quot;hero's journey&quot; structure of most myths and legends.In short, children may find this book interesting, and a lot of them may not be afraid or worried about it, as I think they would be. But the truth is that there is no way they can really understand the book when they have been introduced to so little of it's content. If you want your children to read it and understand it, you should wait until they're a little older. In the meantime get them ready for it by reading them a few myths and legends. They're just as entertaining and far less threatening than Prince Ombra could be for them."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. I read this book to my son and he went back and read it himself later, which was really rare for him. I always feel better after reading it. I've looked for a copy since I lent out my original and never got it back. I just hope they enjoyed it as much as I did. Now I\\"m going to settle down and read it again."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"Most of us enter the world not knowing where our souls have come from, what the purpose of our life is, and who our enemies are. A few, however, know these things and they are the heroes of mankind. The eight-year-old Bentley Ellicott is one of these few and around him Ombra, Prince of Evil, will arrange torments, disasters and even wars. What can a mere child do against an age-old power? Bentley does not know: all he knows is that he must some day fight Ombra. But Bentley will not be alone. First he makes friends with Sally, a girl of about his age, who, through some strange impairment, cannot speak English: she speaks her own slurred version of a language which only Bentley understands. Next Bentley meets Dr. Kreistein, an aging psychologist, who all his life has studied mythology in an attempt to understand what ancient man understood but modern man has forgotten. Together these unlikely three discover Bentley's weak point, and having fortified him, battle Ombra.Where this book really excels is in the depiction of small-town American life: where everybody knows everybody, where everybody thinks they know each others' secrets, and where everybody certainly has an opinion of the others (for better or worse). Mrs. Tally, for example, is an almost perfect instance of an interfering old bitch, who supposedly has high morals, but actually is high in venom. But even Mrs. Tally has her human, softer side, which prevents her becoming the caricature she so easily could have been. This 'real-life' side of the novel is so well written that the fantasy elements sometimes jarred with me as my brain refused to switch to 'make-believe'. Don't get me wrong! The fantasy is quite competently written, but I did not feel it shined like the social realism.Macleish has chosen to give Ombra a large part to play in the narrative, and, as a result, the Prince does not come across as quite the ultimate evil he should be. Even Tolkien, the master story-teller, decided to keep Lord Sauron, his equivalent character, out of the text, describing only his searching eyes. Once again I do not want to overstate my criticism as I did enjoy this book.As with most fantasy novels the theme is of course the fight between good and evil, but this book is more overtly 'religious' than most of the genre. Certainly Macleish quotes Plato as a frontispiece, but the idea expressed is not far from the Christian Heaven. Certainly Macleish speaks of \\"the god that is all gods worshiped by man\\" and \\"Ombra\\", but these are very thin disguises for the Christian Jehovah and Satan. Other elements, such as angels and faith are openly included in the text.Comparison with some of Stephen King's novels, particularly _Salem's Lot_, seems inevitable (small town America and ultimate evil), but I will leave it to fans to fight out which is better. There is also some similarity between this novel's ending and the climax of Ursula Le Guin's _A Wizard of Earthsea_ (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1). I think Le Guin wins in the comparison, but you may feel differently. Le Guin certainly predates Macleish."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"It was one of the best books i ever read.At first it's a little hard to understand,but it gets easier,and the more you read the more interesting it gets.It's hard to put down,you always want to see what happens next.It doesnt get boring at all like some books do.I'm going to start reading it again tomorrow!"},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"An incredible journey for anyone familiar with the myths; and thinking to themselves &quot;I wonder how this began?

I must confess, I never finished it. But when I read a book I don't like I always seem to remember all the parts that I DID like. Some fave details were the 'philtrum' myth.

Well you supposedly get it before birth when an angel presses her finger there and says 'shh' to keep you from telling the secrets of the world. Bently doesn't have one. One of my fave characters was Slally, the girl who talked in gibberish. Well, Bently UNDERSTOOD her gibberish. I never finshed the book but near the end I saw a sentence that added suspense to the book. I won't tell you what it is though. :) But I've seen good reviews for this book. Some like it, I didn't. Whether or not you like this book depends on your taste in style of writing.

And a thousand times, a special person has been born into the world to attempt his defeat. These stories are well known: David and Goliath, King Arthur, etc. However, Roderick MacLeish tells a less memorable story of one such warrior who is only 8 years old. The tale is set in modern times. The child is hunted by a lunatic with a gun. His \\"Merlin\\" is a doctor. The dangers and perils are not so grand, and the form that Prince Ombra takes isn't very fantastical. The idea behind the story was interesting, but it could have been developed better. Yes, I suppose it was entertaining, but what kept the pages turning for me was knowing I could get on to a better book when I finished this one."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"\\"Prince Ombra\\" is one of the more obscure, unusual fantasy books that will have people blankly staring if you mention that you enjoyed it. However, it is also an insightful study of human nature, good and evil, and an intriguing philosophical fantasy.Bentley Ellicott was literally born to be a hero -- with a massive store of mythical knowledge and the information and a crippled leg. He knows that he was meant, like the thousand heroes before him since the beginning of time, to battle the incorporeal evil called Prince Ombra, who appears every so often to try to corrupt the world. Though he is considered peculiar and even dangerous by the inhabitants of his home town, he makes two friends: Slally, a girl who speaks in a nonsense language that only Bentley can understand, and Dietrich Kreistein, an elderly German shrink who gradually realizes who and what Bentley is.The town is gradually being corrupted by malice as Ombra draws ever closer with confrontation in mind. Despite the finding of a magical stone that is the key to defeating Ombra, Bentley is tempted and shocked by new revelations about his family, his friends, the people around him -- and about himself. Will the thousand-and-first hero with a \\"borrowed heart\\" overcome his weaknesses and fears, or will Ombra triumph?Perhaps the most moving message of \\"Prince Ombra\\" is that true heroes are not perfect, that they are tempted, sometimes fail, and need help like any other person. They also can't do everything: Bentley is unable to help everyone he loves. And defeating evil is more than simply getting rid of an evil person, but also overcoming one's own weaknesses as well. And while Bentley is the conflicted hero, the story also involves several subplots: Straitlaced Mrs. Tally and the much-maligned pretty girl Polly Woodhouse, the widowed, always-sad Mr. Ellicott and Slally's mother Ellen; McGraw, the embittered police chief who unknowingly combats Ombra's influence and questions his lack of faith; Slally, the lonely little girl who comes out of her shell for Bentley; Doctor Kreistein, the Merlin to Bentley's Arthur, who remembers Ombra's influence during World War II and is determined to help his charge.It's also quite pleasant that rather than outright scares and cartoonish badness, Ombra's influence is quite realistic and all the more chilling. He enhances rage and negative emotions in even the nicest, most well-meaning of people. And people who are already rotten at heart willingly become his pawns, a disturbing and realistic portrayal of evil.This book is more suited to young adults than to younger children, as there is some profanity (nothing too obscene), a tastefully-written but very disturbing scene of attempted child molestation, and a few sexual references (also discreet), and a truly horrifying scene with an insane pastor. Additionally, younger children may be confused by Bentley's confrontations with Ombra, and not catch on to the deeper undertones of this book. Fans of mythology will have a heyday with the variety of obscure hero stories from various cultures, and those who enjoy good writing will like the evocative, detailed language interspersed with small-town atmosphere.However, teen or adult fantasy/horror fans will undoubtledly give \\"Prince Ombra\\" a permanent place on their shelves. A fast-paced, thought-provoking, one-of-a-kind book."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"I agree with all the positive reviews of this story and the older editions of the book. HOWEVER! This edition has been edited to be more appropriate for younger readers even though it was not written for children. The result is that the narrative is non-sensical at times due to the slipshod manner of the edits.The end of chapter 13 is the worst example that I am aware of as I have only had the mistakes drawn to my attention by my friend reading the story for the first time. Imagine my disappointment when she asked why a part of the story I remembered as very powerful simply did not make sense. I checked with an older edition and found missing paragraphs and rewritten sentences. I have no idea whether there are other significant problems, but this one was enough for me.I will be buying a used copy to replace my friend's 'defective' edition."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"Prince Ombra is an amazingly well-written novel that has the ability to capture its audience and keep them reading from the first page to the very end. Roderkick MacLeish's brilliant themes and characterization bring the book to life and make it meaningful to every reader--whether they are young or old. It is well worth the money to buy and time spent on reading this book, because it is full of meaning and intrinsic value which makes it a rare jewel in the literary world.The characterization in Prince Ombra is a major factor in what makes this novel so enticing and enjoyable. The main character is Bentley Ellicott--an eight-year old boy with a life changing secret: he remembers where he came from before coming to earth, and beating within his body is the heart of a thousand previous heroes, including King Arthur and Hector from the Iliad. He knows that with this gift he has been given, he must defeat the essence of evil in the world: Prince Ombra. Because of this great task that he has been faced with, the development that Bentley goes through throughout the novel is stunning and realistic. He must come face to face with his fears and insecurities to save the world, and by doing so, he transforms into a mature and intelligent boy to fulfill his destiny. He is given a friend to help him along the way: Sally Drake. Sally is an interesting character in herself because she doesn't have the ability to speak coherently, and no one can understand her--except Bentley. When we are first introduced to Sally, she is shy and insecure, and is simply scared of everything around her. However, as the novel progresses and as her best friend works at becoming the hero he is destined to be, Sally matures and must face many hardships and trials that are placed upon her. She becomes Bentley's main support in his battle against the evils of the world. This friendship that Sally and Bentley share is full of happiness and realistic struggles that are enjoyable to read about and to learn from.Every character in this novel develops in a stunningly realistic manner, and that makes Prince Ombra even more enjoyable. Multiple types of people are portrayed in this novel, and are changed and shaped by the events that take place. Bentley's father, Richard, must deal with the death of his wife and the apathetic feelings that he finds himself experiencing towards his son. Sally's mother, Ellen, has been through a hard divorce and attempts to let herself love again. Dietrich Kreistein, Bentley's psychologist, must decide whether to believe the seemingly insane claims that Bentley has given him, and must try to help himself overcome past horrors that he has had to face in his life. Every character is beset with realistic challenges and important decisions that they must make, which makes these characters relatable to the reader, and makes the novel even more enjoyable to read.The themes portrayed in Prince Ombra are very deep and evoke many theological questions important to self-discovery, such as: is there such a thing as destiny? How can our fears be detrimental to our growth and fulfillment of our destiny? Were we chosen before coming to this earth to do a work for mankind? What is the true nature of evil and good in the world? All of these questions are addressed in Prince Ombra and whether we take the answers given in the novel literally or symbolically is up to us. Either way, this book promotes deep thinking and analysis of ourselves and our goals in life, yet is still adventurous and fun, and could be enjoyed by an expert of philosophy or a ten-year old boy.The theme of friendship helping to overcome the obstacles in our lives is also very prominent and inspiring in this novel. Every character is beset with their unique set of challenges, and in order to overcome them, they are given friends to help them along the way. Bentley is given Sally, Richard is given Ellen, Mrs. Tally, a self-proclaimed widow, helps Polly Woodhouse, who, in turn, attempts to help Charlie Feavey. Through working together and providing support, these characters are better able to adapt to the changes that are wrought upon the town of Stonehaven where they live. These same ideas can be applied to our lives. Everyone needs a friend to help them get through challenges, and by becoming a friend to someone, you are helped as well. Although it is hard to get along with everyone all the time, it is possible to find compromises in stressful situations that make everyone as happy as possible. Prince Ombra reminds us of the importance of friendship and the impact we can make on someone's life by becoming their friend. Lives are changed by friendship, and lasting impressions can be made. We see this with all of the friendships in the novel, especially those of Bentley and Sally, and Richard and Ellen.The realistic struggles of life in this novel are counter-balanced by the adventurous fun that the characters go through. Because of this, children could be just as satisfied with this novel as the adults that read it. There are many different layers of meaning in this book, and the reader can choose whether to delve down into the depths of human essence portrayed, or to keep their minds at the surface of the story, to enjoy it for its intrinsic amusement. Because the main character, Bentley, is only eight years old, the younger readers of this novel could better relate to him, and enjoy the fact that he is neither boring nor intimidating. There are many older characters in the novel as well, which face more adult problems that the more mature readers of this book would be able to relate to and learn from. The themes, although deep, are also simple, like the idea of fear, insecurity, and friendship. Everyone, whether young or old, faces these issues in their life, and because there is such a wide range of character types in this novel, this story can be appreciated and enjoyed by everyone who reads it.Prince Ombra is so amazingly well done and contains such deep questions about the essence of life and being, and has such realistic character development, that it is easy to say that it has become one of the best books that I have had the privilege to read. It is versatile and could be enjoyed by many different audiences because of the nature of the characters and the adventurous plot that is mixed in with thought-provoking themes and motifs. I would suggest it to anyone who loves psychological fantasies and child-narrated adventure stories. I guarantee that those who read it will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"It's been a long time since I read this book, but it has never left me. I was so impressed by it that I keep recommending it to people to read.I think it has one of the most wonderful and intriguing beginnings:It is said-and it is true-that just before we are born,a cavern angel holds his finger to our mouths and whispers, \\"Hush! Don't tell what you know.\\"This is why we have a cleft on our upper lips and remember nothing of where we came from.Towards the end of the last century-in 1978, to be precise-a smooth-lipped boy appeared in the world.Doesn't that totally make you want to read it??? ;-)"},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"Bentley Ellicott embodies the soul of the child, wanting at the same time to grow up and remain young forever. He has an impossible task ahead of him from square one in his life and he's known it since before he traveled the birth canal to join this mortal coil! I have read the book over 10 times since I found it in 1984, and I never grow tired of it. Every character is so special--from Polly to the misguided Mrs. Tally, to Bentley and Slally, the rememberer. I don't understand why Roderick MacLeish didn't write hundreds of books--I was so disappointed to find that there are basically only two or three. However, even if Prince Ombra were the only one MacLeish ever wrote, he spoke VOLUMES to our hearts as readers and humans. Don't miss this book--keep a copy on your book shelves, give it to your friends AND your enemies. You'll be doing the greatest mitzvah of all--teaching people to love each other, even when all the odds tell you NOT TO. Peace. . ."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"While some ads have likened this book to a cross between J.R.R. Tolkien, H.P. Lovecraft and Piers Anthony I found it to be closer to Ray Bradbury and some Stephen King.Good and Evil have fought many times. Sometimes Good has won and sometimes Evil has. The time is fast approaching for the one-thousandth battle. A young boy will be the champion for Good. He remembers all that has occurred in these battles of the past. To prepare for his own battle he will have to find a teacher. Then he will have to steel himself to face the champion of Evil which will take the form of that which he fears the most.As this secret war develops in a small American town we are given small glimpses of how the town, and the world in general, are being affected by the struggle. Eventually the final conflict occurs. I will not say how the battle goes or what the representative of Evil is, you'll just have to read it.PRINCE OMBRA, while being a tale of Good vs. Evil, is also an interesting look into history. The book makes some very interesting points, including the true nature of Arthur and Excalibur. I have recommended this book to quite a number of people over the years and all who took my advice enjoyed it. It truly is one of the superior fantasy novels."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"My father's and my taste in literature rarely concur, as I love horror and he is partial to Civil War adventures. One day many years ago when I had snubbed a suggestion of reading material he proffered-he came back later and handed me Prince Ombra. After I had turned him down I thought I'd be magnanamous and give this one a go. I read it in one sitting. I loved it. And since that day, my father and I are more openminded about one anothers suggestions. We both recognized and appreciated the tale of good vs evil. This book has everything a story should have . It took us both away and yet it gave us something in return-the simple realization that love is all-important and everything else will come out the way it is supposed to, in its own time. And Life does go on."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"But Prince Ombra has stayed with me ever since I read it many years ago. The climax of the story, the confrontation between the champion of light with his most feared enemy (an event which has occurred many times in history), was a stunning revelation to me personally. The writing style is swift and yet deep. I got my teenage kids to read it and it was a hit with them too. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"Stunning... That's all I can say about this book.Comparison to Tolkien seems off base to me, though MacLeish is every bit as good a writer as Tolkien. Rather, this book is stylistically a contender with the very best of Ray Bradbury -- I'm thinking about \\"Something Evil This Way Comes\\". The use of language is deft and powerful, the characterizations are compelling despite their simplicity, and the thematic content left me contemplating the elemental stuff of existence.When I started, I was not aware this book was supposed to be child's literature. At age 32, I found it absolutely gripping. Despite the mature themes -- and in part perhaps because of them -- I would like to read this book to my son (now age 4), chapter-style at bedtimes, when he is 8 or 10."},{"Title":"Prince Ombra","review":"This book takes place in the late 20th century in a town on the northern coast of America, called Stonehaven. Here a bright, slightly crippled 8-year-old boy (Bentley Ellicott) has been chosen before birth to combat the evil in this world, like so many heroes before him. With him are two friends who will help prepare him for his destiny--Slally Drake, a 7-year-old &quot;mute&quot; girl who is Bentley's rememberer (a person who passes on history to weaken Prince Ombra's power on Earth), and Dr. Dietrich Kreistein, an old German psychologist who teaches Bentley through myths and stories how to defeat Prince Ombra. Out of all the characters in this book, Dr. Kreistein has to be my favorite.As one reviewer on the back of this book wisely put it, Prince Ombra is &quot;a combination of Tolkien and Stephen King&quot;. Although I've never read anything by Tolkien, there is a sense of fantasy and magic in this story. As for King, this book reminded me of Needful Things with the intertwining of small-town life. So, if you're a fan of either writer, then I highly recommend this book. It's a very interesting look at the continuous struggle between good and evil--and the overwhelming power of hope."},{"Title":"Farmer Takes a Wife","review":"I read this book when I was quite young, and I was happy to find a good used copy.

I highly recommend couples read this together!"},{"Title":"I Know You Love Me but Do You Like Me?: How to Become Your Mate's Best Friend","review":"This was a marvelous book. A very easy and quick read without all the difficult to understand psychological verbage in many relationship books. Joey O'conner recognizes that for a relationship to be robust and not end, one must be true friends, as well as be in love. Yes, there is a difference. The content of this work is relevant for the adult as well as the young person anticiapting a first relationship. I also recommend Eknath Easwaran's &quot;Bghagavad Gita for Daily Living, to Love me is to Know me&quot;. A rather dated book, but factual still today."},{"Title":"Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution","review":"The tiny State of Rhode Island certainly played a significant role during the American Revolution. Few recall that when Roger Williams established Rhode Island in 1644 it was for all practical purposes the first practicing democratic state since the fall of Athens. Rhode Islanders were an exceptionally independent lot. The burning of the two masted British schooner \\"Gaspee\\" in June of 1772 by a group of leading citizens of the colony essentially struck the first blow in the nations quest for independence. In \\"Sons of Providence\\" author Charles Rappleye recalls the historic events that were unfolding in Rhode Island in those years and focuses on two brothers, John and Moses Brown, who would find themselves on opposite sides of so many of the important questions of their day. It is a compelling story.Until recently I never realized how important the issue of the slave trade was as the nations march toward independence proceeded. It seems slavery was a highly emotional issue even in the 1770's and 1780's. John and Moses Brown along with brothers James and Nicholas were members of one of the most prominent families in colonial Providence. The Brown family was involved in all manner of commerce and in 1765 they made the decision to enter the slave trade. And so it was that they outfitted a ship they christened \\"Sally\\" to make the voyage. In \\"Sons of Providence\\" you will discover why the slave trade was such a controversial and dirty business. If you have never read about the conditions that existed on these ships then you are sure to be horrified. It turns out that roughly half the slaves that were picked up on the West Coast of Africa died during the return voyage.In any event, in the years following the \\"Sally\\" debacle John Brown and his brother Moses would pursue entirely different paths. John was first and foremost a businessman and lobbied for laws and policies favorable to the merchant class. For the rest of his life John Brown would continue to oppose any measures that would outlaw slavery and restict commerce in any way. Moses Brown on the other hand would renounce his Baptist heritage (his great grandfather Chad Brown was the first pastor of the First Baptist Church in America)and become a Quaker. Quakers were among the earliest and most vocal opponents of slavery and the simple Quaker lifestyle held much appeal for Moses Brown. Moses Brown would divest himself of much of his fortune and become one of the leading abolitionists of his day.Although John and Moses Brown would continue to collaborate on a number of projects over the next quarter century they would nonetheless find themselves on opposite sides of any number of important issues.In his extraordinary book \\"John Adams\\" author David McCullough gets much of his source material from the voluminous letters between John and Abigail Adams. Likewise, much of the material for \\"Sons of Providence\\" appears to be culled from letters between John and Moses Brown. As such this book provides tremendous insight into the thought processes of those on both sides of so many of the important issues of that era. \\"Sons of Providence\\" is exceptionally well-written and meticulously researched. This is a must read for history buffs and a great choice for general readers as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sons of Providence: The Brown Brothers, the Slave Trade, and the American Revolution","review":"This is the best kind of popular history book.
