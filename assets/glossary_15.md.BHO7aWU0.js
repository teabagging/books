A girl's fiance' is reported dead in World War One, but she has reason to doubt the report. She tracks down leads for years, with the sort of perseverance only such a motivation brings. In the process she encounters help and hindrance, lies and truth, wisdom and incompetence, enough so that those who detest suspense can value this book while pretending to ignore it.Only after more than half of the story has been told are we given a glimpse of our heroine's pre-war happiness. The scene could stand alone, but is unbearably beautiful when read in its place."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I picked up this novel in part due to the many glowing reviews here. In retrospect, I have to wonder if these people were lauding the book or the movie. The book is very tedious in many respects due to its format. I think that Japrisot based his writing partially upon Calvino's work, such as the novel 'If on a Winters Night a Traveler,' or 'Invisible Cities.' The chapters of Japrisot weave from here to there in time and perspective dealing with first hand accounts, letters, and conversations. I think that all of this was a little too clever for Japrisot and that after a while the cumbersome nature of all this forces a collapse of will and you as a reader will be overwhelmed by its overworked zeal. I brought up Calvino because where-as 'Winters Night' is magical in many ways, 'Engagement' comes across as sort of typical.You might disagree with my summation here. The story is pretty good, though I would not recommend it to anyone. I think that Japrisot's cleverness smothers a lot of what was enjoyable in regards to the plot. I would say that if you enjoyed this book, you are in for a nice treat if you have not read 'Winters Night...' by Calvino. You might also be interested in Murakami's 'Wind Up Bird Chronicle'."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"It is a shame that I saw &quot;Amalie&quot; before reading this book. Though I loved the movie, I kept seeing that actress as the main character of this book. And though there are some similarities in personality, Mathilde exposes herself to our examination far more deeply than Amalie did.Many books have been written about missing fiances, missing lovers, war widows. This book takes those stories and binds them into a gripping mystery. This novel is NOT a tear-jerker and for that alone, it is wonderful. It is a novel about strength and love and a wish for what could have been. It is about who you would want to be if your lover was lost in the war. I will be buying this book for my mother and my best friends. It is something different. I loved it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I didn't expect to love this book. I'm not much of a history buff and hardly ever read mysteries, so I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. The love story is great and the images are wonderful. I can't say enough about it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"In 1917 five French soldiers are sentenced to death for desertion. Instead of being normally executed, they are taken to the French front to be shot dead by the Germans.Mathilde Donnay, the seventeen-year-old fiancee of one of the five, is told her lover died bravely in combat. But two years later she's contacted a dying officer who tells her otherwise. Some facts are missing from his story. There's a slim chance one or two of the men survived, and so, Mathilde undertakes a heroic search for the truth.A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is the story of Mathilde's search, told in a collage of scenes, letters, and narrating voices of those who knew the five men. What emerges is a gripping, sometimes thrilling mystery as Mathilde uncovers one piece of a very complex puzzle after another. Along the way we get to know not only the man Mathilde loves but also the other four (a carpenter, a welder, a pimp and a farmer) and their loved ones.Mathilde is a wonderful heroine. A fall off a ladder at age three left her bound to a wheelchair, but she's completely free of self pity. She is above all stubborn, someone who will not give up no matter what. Many people try to tell her that her search is futile, but she persists with doggedness that is at times a little selfish, but also a measure of her loyalty and love for her fiance.Most of the characters in A VERY LONG ENGAGMENT are very likeable. While their circumstances are sometimes sad, and we see how the war has affected their lives, the book is also uplifting because so many of them go out of their way to help others.The first chapter is a bit slow, but after that, the book takes off like a roller coaster. Clue after clue falls into place, and Japrisot keeps the reader guessing. The setting, France 1919-1924, is beautifully and authentically rendered.I enjoyed A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT tremendously. It is a story about devotion and dedication, as well as a story about the tragedy of war, and the beauty of life."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Sebastien Japrisot -- what a discovery! &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; is everything you could possibly want in a novel. It is divine and picturesque. It is unbelievably sad and beautiful, competantly evoking anger and pain in even the most jaded of readers. I found myself in tears and rapture countless times over. For the first time, I am hoping desperately for a second novel as I was completely tormented at having to come to the end of this one. An absolute must read for anyone looking for real literature in the existing sea of legal deception, post-mortum examination, and intellectual cannabalism."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"More than a year has gone by since Mathilde received word of her lover's death in the war, when in the summer of 1919 she is contacted by an ex-soldier dying in a hospital who tells her he knew Manech (her fiance) and that Manech's death was not what was officially reported. Instead of dying in combat as she had believed, Manech was part of a group charged with cowardice & to set an example for other soldiers was condemned to die by being tossed into \\"no man's land\\", the area between the French & German trenches to be killed by the Germans. Mathilde needs to know exactly what happened to Manech, has the money to pursue the truth & does so, and along the way it begins to appear possible that not all 5 men died that night, 1 or maybe even 2 may have survived, but if they did and were found they would now have prison terms to serve.The author has given us an intricate puzzle, Japrisot's style of writing is something new to me there is no one I can think of to compare him to. This is a first rate detective story for the intelligent reader, definitely not a \\"formula\\" mystery, also it is a war novel with grim descriptions of trench life. The prose is blunt, there are no wasted words in the main plot, yet along the way there are so many \\"asides\\", little anecdotes and fascinating glimpses into the private lives and motivations of ordinary people during the war, the book is never dull.Highly recommend this bestseller from France."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've read this book twice and am ordering another copy to give away. At once a literary mystery, a WWI history lesson, and a love story with a true heroine, A Very Long Engagement will keep you turning pages until the very end. The characters were beautifully drawn (though I had to make notes to keep them all straight) and the story is totally engaging and baffling. Don't plan to do anything else while you're reading this book!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"After I finished this book, I went online and ordered all the books of Mr. Japrisot's from Amazon. Some of the reviews cautioned against expecting the same level of narrative in the other books, but who cares? I'd try anything by this author. The other books haven't arrived yet and meanwhile I am chewing over parts of this book, so wonderfully painful, uplifting and chock-full of truths about &quot;the ways of the world&quot;."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was one of the most beautiful and moving books I have ever read. I have avoided literature based around WWI and reading this book certainly raised my general knowledge of the conditions that existed for the soldiers. I certainly had no idea.I'm not sure if this book has been turned into a film but I hope that the French do soon - it would be wonderful I think."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was a rare, intelligent, beautiful love story . It is particularly deft in its handling of the war scenes. It was the perfect balance between mystery, historic fact and clever story telling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this for a book discussion group about three years ago - I had a month to read it, but devoured it in a matter of three days! (I would have done in one sitting if I were not obliged to go to work.) This is a flawlessly written mystery that captures very eloquently the devastating horrors of war - poetically integrating ironic twists of fate with the tenacity of hope in the human heart. Japrisot has created an absolutely lovable three-dimensional heroine in Mathilde - who the reader can't help but follow across any vast expanse or obstacle - holding on to scarcely even a thread of hope - to find the true fate of her fianc&eacute; lost in the \\"no man's land\\" of WWI. This is a fine read - but be forewarned - you'll have a very hard time putting this one down!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a marvelous book. It is a powerful indictment of the hideous way in which WWI was fought. The central event of the story provides us with a clear picture of the inhumane nature of that conflict. The writer weaves an engrossing tale of love, mystery and history. There is however, an air of unreality to the gentle and kind nature of most of the characters that Mathilde comes in contact with. These characters are in stark juxtaposition with the shadowy figures that caused the inhumane sentence to be carried out. The only fault I can find is that the characters could have been more complicated."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I discovered this book in the library several years ago, but was not able to read it at the time and lost track of it. A friend's book club read it last year, but I did not hear many comments. I ran across it in a used book shop recently and was re-interested because I had enjoyed &quot;Birdsong&quot; (by Sebastian Faulks), also a love/war story set in WWI France. &quot;Birdsong&quot; follows a young Englishman through a disappointed love affair with the wife of his French employer into the trenches and tunnels of a very ugly war. The detail is unsurpassed -- how could this be written by someone who had never experienced it? If you enjoyed Japrisot's novel, you should give &quot;Birdsong&quot; a read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Although I am not a big fan of war-related novels, this book kept me riveted by its brilliant plot and it's treatment of the realities of the First World War. As a piece of story-telling it is absolutely first-rate and entirely compelling. What stops me from giving it 5 stars is the one-dimensional characterization of Mathilde and her family, and the occasional simplistic descriptions that leaves little room for the reader's imagination. These are very minor complaints in a novel that I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"My bookclub hated this book, just hated it. This was a very good sign (they hated Frankenstein, too, one of my favorites!). I, as usual, hadn't even bought (let alone read) the book in time for our bookclub meeting, so when I received it as a gift last year, I moved it to the top of the ever-growing pile of fiction, New Yorker magazines, and miscellaneous other printed matter mounting up on my bedside table.This is a really powerful and evocative story. It pulled me in right away, in part due to the mysterious plot line, but also because of the curious structure of the book. It's unlike anything else I've read for a long time. Brings to mind &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; and &quot;The Shipping News&quot; in that past and present are intermingled seamlessly, adding depth and dimension to an otherwise simple story.I can absolutely understand why the members of my (now ex-) bookgroup didn't like this book: it requires some close reading, some flipping around to remind yourself who's who, and it unfolds relatively slowly (but very vividly). But the descriptions of WWI France, the characters, and the appalling reality of open-trench warfare are plausably and deftly rendered. I learned a lot, and I cared a lot for the characters. I can't say that about many books I've read lately.Not everyone will like it. Only way to find out which side you're on is... throw it in the shopping basket! Strongly recommended"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Sebastien Japrisot is a world class author and this is his best work to date.Part mystery, part historical fiction, part war novel, part romance, A Very Long Engagement follows the exploits of one Mathilde Donnay as she tries to establish just what really happened to her fianc&eacute; on the front lines during a battle at Picardy in WW1.Mathilde is one of the truly unique protagonists to appear in many a year. Her determination and unyielding spirit are quite inspiring.This is a book that speaks to many things-honor, devotion, love, the chaos and cruelties of war, friendship, the triumph of the individual. It's the sort of novel that warms your soul while concomitantly breaking your heart. In the end, it stands as a remarkable spiritual work that will stay with you forever.Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Five desperate men shoot themselves in order to be relieved from the horrifying frontline at the Somme, in WWI. A court-martial decides to punish them by leaving them alone in no-man's land, to be killed in the crossfire. Then all hell breaks loose and they all die. Or not?One of these men's fianc&eacute;e, a young girl who can't walk since age 3, receives information that makes her suspect his boyfriend might have gotten away alive. So she embarks in a painful, long and often frustrating ordeal to find out the truth.Along the way, I got to really love Matti. She's kinda spoiled and obstinate, but she is a wonderful person, full of true love. Other characters are equally appealing, and the story of Manech and his infortunate companions at war is revealed bit by it, through confusing memories and even contradictory pieces of information.We discover a terrible but beautiful story through what Clausewitz called \\"the fog of war\\". And this story is about courage, nobility, cruelty, loyalty, friendship and, above all, true love.Absolutely recommended, it is a novel that will easily remain in your memory."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"War is not glorious. Especially if you're Manech, a 20-year old French soldier convicted by a military court, along with four others, of committing self-mutilation with the intent of escaping service in the front lines of World War I. The punishment is grotesque. Rather than death by a firing squad, the five are to be thrust, hands bound, over the wire fronting the most forward trench and into the No Man's Land between the French and German positions - there to die by whatever bullet, mortar shell, or bomb strikes them down. The subsequent deaths of all five are attested to. Letters are sent to surviving family members by the French authorities saying their boys \\"died in battle\\". This was in 1917.Mathilde was Manech's fianc&eacute;e when he marched off to battle. She's also confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk since she fell off a stepladder at age 3. In 1919, she's contacted by a dying survivor of the war, ex-Sergeant Esperanza, who'd been in charge of the provost detail assigned to escort the five condemned men to the front trench, as well as act as censor for the last letter each was permitted to write home. He tells Mathilde of their bizarre fate, and gives her copies of their last letters, transcribed by him personally. Using these copies and the veteran's story to provide clues, Mathilde embarks on a multi-year search for the truth behind Manech's death. Interviewing friends, family members, and lovers of Marech's four condemned companions, as well as other soldiers present in the trench, Mathilde needs to answer the question, \\"Is he truly dead?\\" She has doubts. The evidence is inconsistent.A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is an odyssey of mystery, official cover-ups, lies, misperceptions, secrets, coincidence, tenuous clues, guilt, innocence, and honor. And, ultimately, love. Astute and sardonic Mathilde, perhaps because of her affliction, is a take-no-prisoners dynamo of perseverance. No obstacle is too great that it can't be overcome. In the end, she finds ... Truth.This novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot is an unusual and unusually intelligent detective story, as well as a look at an almost-forgotten time and place strewn with the wreckage - physical, emotional and psychological - of the War to End All Wars. You'll put it down feeling ... satisfied. I recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is one of the best WWI stories I have read, including Pat Barker's Resurrection trilogy. The rhythm of the opening section, with it's repeated Watch Out For The Wire holds you immediately. You want to know what is going to happen, not just to the prisoners, but to all of the men whose eyes stare out at them from the trenches. The writing is beautiful; the characters unforgettable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A quick, engrossing, thought-provoking read. A first-glance, the story sounds like a repackaging of Kubrick's 1957 film, Paths of Glory: the insanity of WWI military (in)justice, etc. We already know that bad things happen to soldiers who are branded as cowards by the French army. You wonder where Japriscot will take the story that could possibly be fresh. He succeeds by casting it as a mystery rather than a courtroom drama, and by forcing the reader to peel back memories of seemingly inconsequential details with each new piece of evidence. The writing is elegant and restrained, the pacing brisk and mesmerizing. Japriscot pulls off an intricate plot with ingenious narrative devices, without pounding us on the head with post-modernism for its own sake. It's part war novel, part romance, part mystery--sort of a French Snow Falling on Cedars. Very unlikely to disappoint."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was a very engrossing book whose story is told from many viewpoints. I especially enjoyed the character of Mathilde and her enthusiasm and tenacity to find the &quot;truth&quot;. However, I found the translation quite stilted. Having read many translated books and thoroughly enjoying them, this title was quite a chore. I found some of the translated content to be almost elementary in nature. I only wish that I was fluent in French, as I know I would have enjoyed this title immensely. Don't let this stop you, however, from chosing this book, as the story is a good one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This isn't a mystery in the widely-accepted sense of a mystery. But it is a story of putting together clues to discover the truth. I don't need to summarize the book again (there are plenty of good ones already submitted), but I wanted to add my five stars to the review page. By the way, I read this after I saw the film version (which I also recommend). It's worth reading even after seeing it performed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"All the other reviewers have said it all--this is a good book. I am adding my two cents because I am having such a hard time finding books of this quality to read. Something different, something well written (my interpretation of the translation was that it is Etchevery's style of writing--a little bit Hemingway), something that makes you think.I rely a lot on these reader reviews to help me find those types of books. I hope you find this review helpful."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"S&eacute;bastien Japrisot, an author, screenwriter and director was was born in Marseille in 1931. \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" was first published in France in 1991.The book opens on a cold night in January 1917, during the First World War. Five French soldiers are being marched to Bingo Cr&eacute;puscule, a frontline trench at the Somme. All five had been found guilty of self-mutilation, in an attempt to be invalided out of the war : as a result, they have been sentenced to death. Unarmed and wIth their hands bound, the five - known to their fellow soldiers as the Eskimo, Six-Sous, That Man, Common Law and the Cornflower - are thrown into no-man's land as night falls.While the sentence isn't exactly fair on any of the five men, it's the Cornflower's inclusion on the list that's hardest to take. Still only a teenager, he was shellshocked to the point of total amnesia - he had no real idea of who he was, let alone what was happening to him. The Cornflower's real name was Jean Etchervery, although he was known as Manech to his friends and family, and he grew up in Cap Breton near Biarritz. Manech had left a fiancee behind, Mathilde Donnay, and - just before he'd been sent over, he'd been allowed to write her a letter. Just over two and a half years later, Mathilde receives another letter - this time from a nun. A former soldier in her care is dying, and he wants to meet her. Daniel Esperanza had been at the Somme, and had met Manech in January 1917. What Esperanza has to tell her leads Mathilde to investigate what really happened that day - and all the little clues, all the slight inconsistencies gives her some, slight hope that Manech might still be alive.A very easily read, beautifully written book - totally recommended. (Jeunet's film version is excellent too, so long as you don't mind subttiles)."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A Very Long Engagement is not a \\"casual\\" read. It demands careful attention, that and a pad of paper to keep all the characters and their various nicknames straight. Without this forethought the story could easily be construed as confusing and convoluted. It may not easy keeping all the details in order but once you do the result is immensely worthy of your time. Mathilde is a wonderful heroine, loyal, witty and relentless in her pursuit of the truth. Just the kind of gal you would want on your side. This gripping story of devotion and fearless determination coupled with the insanity and cruelty of war is a must read. 4.5 stars"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book was recommended by a co-worker and, boy, am I glad it was. The book is a bit slow getting going but I quickly found I didn't want to put it down. The cross-genre aspect (part romance, part mystery, part historical fiction) was amazingly well-done. I doubt that few authors could pull this off; Japrisot did so beautifully. The character development is also incredibly well done. Although you never meet many of the characters, by the time you're done reading the book, you feel like you knew each and every one intimately. I've recommended this book to a friend who teaches high school English as a study in Character development--she intends to incorporate this into her class next year! GREAT book!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I chose this book after hearing it reviewed on NPR. It touched so many feelings, the horror of war, the comedy of errors, the discipline of the military, the passion of young love, the depth of maternal love, the loyalty of friends, the determination to seek the truth. I found it hard to believe this book was authored by a man! Definitely on my list of books to bring along to a desert island."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"It's a beautiful story told through the soul of a passionate and persistent young heroine. Her lost fiance is named Cornflower, not because of his youth (as indicated in another review) but because of his clear blue eyes. This comes from the French word for cornflower, &quot;bleuet.&quot; These clear blue eyes and innocent soul frozen in boyhood are the quest that holds the story together. Some will find it hard to follow because of the jigsaw-like pieces that come from multiple voices, through letters and a few personal meetings. But it holds together and in the end, a believeable sense of peace descends... bringing an end to &quot;the Great War&quot; and a new life for those who survived. I read it in French and English, and it should be noted that the translation, as always, leaves a few things out. It also helps to have a sense of French geography (or a map) to appreciate the full range of the quest."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and keep scanning the bookstores to see if any of his other novels have been translated into English.

So I approached the book with great anticipation. Sadly, after an interesting beginning, the book became quite tedious. Ultimately I finished it just so I could get it done with, not because I was enjoying it . Some prior reviewers have blamed the translation but the problem lies in the story itself. There is a very linear simple and obvious plot which is made overly complicated by a plethora of ancillary inessential characters and confusing twists and turns which are impossible to keep straight. In addition there is no character development - the characters are drawn once (very simply and always sentimentally) and never change, and are drawn with thick crayon at that. The depiction of WWI was well done, but other than that it is not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book was chosen by my twelve-year-long book group. I would not have found Sebastian Japrisot otherwise. This isn't the kind of novel I normally search for, and although the translation made some sentences seem choppy, the story line is so vivid. I could feel the fright of crawling through the trenches with bullets buzzing over my head, of the agony of the smell of death, of the soldier's despair of seeing loved ones ever again. This was beautifully written, but I found I had to write down the character's names while reading, in order to remember who each one was. This was compelling to one who has never been in a war."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"\\"A Very Long Engagement, \\"(\\"Un long dimanche de fianailles,\\") (1994), by the best-selling French author Sebastien Japrisot, is a dark, dramatic, emotional and romantic mystery of a sort, set in France shortly after the end of World War I. The novel won the 1991 Prix Interallie. It concerns Mathilde Donnay, a wealthy, crippled young Frenchwoman who wants to know for sure what happened to Manech, her missing fisherman fianc&eacute;, during World War I. Manech appears to have died at the Somme River, after being found guilty of self-mutilation - to get sent home from the front--at a court-martial with 27 other soldiers. But statements made by witnesses, as to what happened at the trench Bingo Crepuscule that cold morning in January, 1917, conflict.There can be no doubt that the First World War, which was fought largely in the trenches dug by each side, was a terrible killer of men, as the Allies - French, British, and eventually American; and the Germans, struggled repeatedly over the same soil. In fact, historians and demographers say that the French lost so many men in the 19th century Napoleonic Wars that it has had a negative impact on the size of the French populace to this day, and then came World War I a century later. So there are millions fewer French than there otherwise might have been. The author makes his negative feelings on World War I, which I imagine were shared by many French, and British, crystal clear in this book.Japrisot has done a remarkable job in creating this novel. He gives us a very accurate, evocative portrait of the French nation at war, and shortly afterward. Excellent dialog, narrative and descriptive writing, and a complex, multi-strand mystery, of which he pulls a few strands out to give us a powerful ending I sure didn't see coming. His characters, even the minor ones, are vividly drawn. However, Manech, and four other men, a carpenter, a farmer, a pimp and a mechanic, are sent to Bingo Crepuscule to be thrown into no-man's land with arms bound, and killed by German bullets. And I must admit that, as vividly as Japrisot has drawn the men and their circumstances, and as likely as it is, in reality, that five sentenced men should face execution together, I had a difficult time following the five men, their women, and the others in their lives, particularly, I'm sorry to say, with all those French names. Duh! I have been known actually to chart characters, if I like a book enough, and the characters are confusing enough: I did that with the Chinese-named mothers and daughters in Amy Tan's enchanting THE JOY LUCK CLUB. But I didn't feel like doing so much work here. And I was able to get at least the book's riveting conclusion straight.The Marseille-born Japrisot, who was called France's Graham Greene, was well-known and loved in the French-speaking world, and little-known in the English-speaking world. He was an author, screen writer and director: a number of his books have been translated into English and other languages, and made into films. This one was made into a French film of the same name,A Very Long Engagement, starring Audrey Tautou (Amelie).The Sleeping Car Murderswas also made into a film of the same name, THE SLEEPING CAR MURDERS, and is pretty much an all-star production as French actors go, featuring Simone Signoret (Room at the Top), her husband Yves Montand (The Wages of Fear - Criterion Collection), and Signoret's daughter, Catherine Allegret , as well as Michel Piccoli, Claude Mann, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. It was directed by Costa-Gavras. I remember seeing this film and enjoying it. Unfortunately, however, my enjoyment of this book was lessened by my difficulty in following all those characters. But you may have an easier time of it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. It truly makes one realize what World War I must have been like. The combination of a bittersweet love story told in conjunction with the battle scenes is very compelling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was different than anything else I've ever read and I enjoyed exploring a new author and style. I was wondering about the last page though.

What are the dates about? I'd appreciate it if anyone would like to answer. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Few books attempt to bring together the disparate genres of mystery, war, and romance. This one does and pulls it off wonderfully.

I've since recommended it to several (female) friends and they've all loved it too."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've just finished Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement\\", and I loved it. The story is beautifully realized, and the characters very lifelike and human. I was a little disappointed at the publishers reviews as well as the blurb on the back of the book - I felt as though it gave away a bit too much of the story. Japrisot, however, leaves the reader in complete suspense until the end of the novel. There were parts where the story dragged a bit - about forty percent is told in the form of letters to the main character, and some of these letters should have been two or three pages shorter. I also had a bit of trouble keeping all of the minor characters straight.

Don't miss it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Like your other reviewers,I loved this novel,so much so that Ihave reread it twice.Next,I began three of his other books. I have been sorely disappointed.The rest is pulp. How could the same author write such a sublime Engagement and such potboilers?"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"it is rare to find an author who could successfully and gracefully blend mystery, romance, poetry, and history into one glorious novel. buy this book! buy this book! and again, buy this book."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"As a translation, the text has that awkward charm that occurs when phrases are not quite equivalent. I tend to like that stilted flavor. The author's use of present tense verbs in describing the action was also interesting. The plot itself was quite simple. The opening descriptions of the five condemned men and the surreal horror of WWI was the best part of the book. The conclusion also grabbed the reader's attention as it offerd a resolution to the question of the plot. The middle of the book, however, dragged. How long can a person write letters, ask questions, and talk about a missing lover before getting tedious? I have mixed feelings about the whole impression made by the book and probably would have liked it better as a condensation."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Talk about inter-genre. S&eacute;bastien Japrisot's novel \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" hardly fits one single genre. The book is at first --and most of it a war drama--, but at some point --still early in the beginning-- the narrative is also a love story. As the pages move, the novel becomes a thriller. But, above all, it is a fable. Just check the first sentence, the classic \\"Once upon a time...\\" The result may generate mixed feelings among the readers, but not by chance.As the story goes, \\"once upon a time, there were five French soldiers, who had gone off to war because that's the way of the world\\". From the beginning we meet the five soldiers. Japrisot describes with details who these soldiers are, and where and why -- actually not much of the \`why', after all, this is the quest of the book. Then we're introduced to Mathilde, a young girl, whose fianc&eacute; was one of the five soldiers -- or so the thinks.Years later, she receives a letter from a dying man, claiming to have information on her boyfriend. This is the beginning of Mathilde's journey, which will take many years until its heartbreaking conclusion. Throughout her quest, she'll come across the most different kind of people, some will be helpful and others not. Because that's the way of the world.The non-linear narrative is enhanced by the many devices used by Japrisot. From digressions to flashbacks, and many letters, the readers discoveries events before Mathilde. However, one will be able to fully understand some pieces of information only later -- when the girl can place the piece on her giant war jigsaw.The gallery of supporting characters is as colorful and the main ones. Mathilde is a strange girl. Confined to a wheelchair since her childhood, she has created many different lives inside her mind. At some point, one wonders if this fianc&eacute; really exists. There are many small plots surrounding Mathilde's secondary lives -- but it will all converge in the end.The five soldiers also have a special place in the narrative. Alongside with their friends, wives, children, they become a portray of the human condition, affected by the WWI. Letters from both sides are the perfect device to give dimension of their dramas.As the narrative advances, it becomes stranger, until its surprising climax. With this novel Japrisot (1931-2003) proved to be a great storyteller, whose talent will be largely missed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was one of the most compelling books I ever read. It is hard and demanding, but worht it. The details you need to remember are legion (in fact, after 100 pages, I started over -- this time with a notebook and pen). But the plot is very well done, intricate and fascinating. The characters are equally compelling [I really enjoy books in which the lead characters are likable and complex]. The protrayal of war is eye opening (and I think the new movie version does an excellent - if gorey - job of doing that). The movie is also very good -- but focuses on images that movies do well. The book is its own reward and I as many would say is better than the movie (only because it can be more detailed and longer). OK, so I really enjoyed both.Buy it. I'm recommending it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Part historical, part detective-mystery, this is quite a remarkable work which combines fiction and fact and evokes a whole gamut of emotions from pain, anxiety, curiousity to some precious moments of beauty. The title may form preconceptions, but this isn't Mills &amp; Boon romance, or even a love story in the accepted sense. The reality of the horrors of war, particularly trenchlife in the 1st World War are vividly brought to life--the story relolves around the grim sentence of 5 soldiers caught for desertion and thrown into No Mans Land between the French &amp; German Lines at the Front Line of the Somme; and Mathilde Donnay, a cripple from childhood who is afianced to one of those soldiers. Her courage and fortitude to discover what happened to her fiance isn't super hero(ine) stuff, but her character grabs you so much, that you, the reader, can't bear not to find out too. Linda Coverdale has done a superb translation, although this book was a best seller and prize winner in France there was no guarantee that much of the essence would be lost (as happens with so many translations fronm one language to another), but she has done full justice to the original work. She has captured it all in the well-written, even flowing, riveting and compulsive reading--nothing has been lost in the translation. You don't have to be a war-story buff to enjoy this poignant tale. I whole-heartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I'm amazed at how many people loved this book. I did not enjoy it at all and only finished it because it was a book club choice. I thought the writing was poor and confusing (maybe something was lost in the translation), the characters were dull, and the story was draggy and boring. This is the first book in a long time that I disliked so much."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A wonderful book. Read it! One of the two best books I have ever read about WWI. The other is &quot;Soldier of the Great War&quot; by Mark Helprin"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I was assigned to read this novel for my college humanities class. I was immediately drawn into the intense and mysterious love story. I loved the characters, especially the strong and intelligent Mathilde who goes on a quest to seek answers. It is worth the time to read and I recommend this excellent book to everyone and I rarely give my kudos. I also have to answer to the riddle on the last page. Hossegor 1989, and Noisy-sur-ecole 1991 is where the places and years when the author started and finished his novel, not the deaths of Manech and Mathilde as some have speculated."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Great read, came really fast. This is much better than the movie...must read this first before you see it. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was a good story although a lot of characters to keep up with. The author did a good job tying the characters together at the end. I wondered if he intentionally made the story line scattered and inconsistent as that is how communication was in that time period. I would recommend it if someone likes to read about history."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've read this book twice, and it has stayed with me in a way few books do. The juxtaposition of the horrors of war and the pure gleam of enduring love is beautiful and heartrending at the same time. The soldiers' emotions feel very relevant today - this novel explores the personal costs of war in a way few stories can - with elegance and grace to balance the gritty realities of warfare. I highly recommend this book - it might very well become a part of you as it has for me."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I love the book. I couldn't wait to see the movie. I must admit the movie fell flat. Don't waste your time with movie, but definitely read the novel. It is set during and just after WWI. Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay is told that her fianc&eacute; has died honorably during the war. She notices discrepancies in the official story and is convinced that her fianc&eacute; is still alive. This is a love story set in a historical setting, but what I loved about the novel was the mystery or I should say mysteries because there are several in this novel that Mathilde must solve. I really admired Mathilde's tenacity to find the truth about her fianc&eacute;. The twists and turns this story took while investigating her fianc&eacute;s whereabouts and the mysteries that are discovered and solved during this time really keep you guessing about what actually happened to her fianc&eacute; right up to the end of the novel. I read this novel in 2 days, something I haven't done in quite some time."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is an excellent book. Its greatest strength is the main character Mathilde. She is a complex, three-dimensional character who is believable and interesting. At times maddening, you still can't help but like and admire her.The plot is a kind of mystery which does make for compelling reading. However, since it incorporates so many different stories, story lines, and characters it becomes needlessly complicated at times and, yes, might even strain your patience.Still, after reading this book I now want to see the movie to see how the director approached this ultra-complex story."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Wow! I just finished this book after reading it every spare minute for the last 2 days. I did not want to put it down. The beginning of this novel is probably the best introduction to a group of characters that I have ever read. Not only for its character development but for the rhythm of the language. A spectacular achievement considering this is translated from the original French.This is a love story and an intriguing mystery as well as an indictment of the carnage of WWI. And in the midst of the climax of the story, the author gives further detail to a minor character (Mathilde's mother cancelling the cheese course) that had me laughing out loud. How did he know that I needed a break in the tension?This is a well told story that had me enthralled from beginning to end, deepened my definition of love, taught me more about WWI (Pat Barker's trilogy is fabulous for this also, and just as fascinating) and caused me to appreciate again the privilege of reading great literature and all the benefits truly great books bring to life.A must read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A Very Long Engagement is a magical book, one which weaves a tale and catches you in its spell--it will haunt you long after you put it down. The novel begins as five condemned French soldiers walk to their doom during World War I. They have all shot themselves, trying to get out of fighting and as punishment, will be thrown into the no-man's-land between the French trenches and the German trenches. Their families know nothing of this and after they die, are told them men died honorably. A few years later, Mathilde, the fiance of one of the men discovers some of the truth about what happened and she becomes convinced that her fiance has did not die--or at least did not die as she was told. She tries, doggedly, to uncover the truth. Along the way, she discovers many atrocities of that war. The novel pulls you along to its rather unexpected, yet still deeply satisfying ending, pulls you so much you won't be able to put this one down. The power of love, the strength of friendship, the failure of memory--all these come into play in this outstanding novel. I highly recommend this novel to all devoted readers. It's a bit of a challenge, following all the little clues Matilde gets, putting the truth together and tossing out the lies, but it's worth it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. Japrisot not only artfully held the suspense until the last possible moment, he gave me such wonderful characters to care about that I couldn't *help* but frantically turn the pages trying to find out Did Manech die or didn't he?? But it's not just a good mystery story. It's realistic historical fiction that gave me a vivid sense of the trenches and post-war life. It's a beautiful, painful romance story. It's a clever, astute rendering of how people help each other and lie to each other and care for each other and punish each other. All of this, brilliant at every facet, in one little book. It's a brilliantly *woven* story...like Mathilde, the heroine, you have to hold on tho the wire and don't let go until you get to the end as Japrisot winds you through his labyrinthine tale."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The plot, the characters, the story, these are all very good, and very compelling, but I can't help but be annoyed at the translation.If you speak French, you can see right through lines that have been poorly translated too literally, and areas where too much liberty has been taken to get a particular point. At least, I hope this is the fault of the translator and the original is not this poorly done. My experience of French literature has been such that I can't imagine muddled phrases and incomplete lines would receive the resounding praise in France as is advertised on the book jacket.Worst of all, I have found myself frequently reading the re-reading a sentence three or four times to discover in vain what the devil is going on.In a description of Angel and another soldier's pact to shot each other in the hand (p.14): &quot;At the last moment, because his entire being felt revulsion at the prospect of keeping his word, Angel had snatched his hand away from the mouth of the other man's gun and had closed his eyes. He'd pulled the trigger on his own gun, however. Now he was missing two joints from a ring finger and the tip of a middle finger, but the cootie-counting days of the other poor clod were over for good, as he'd taken Angel's blast full in the face, and the horses, desperate to escape this mess of human lunacy, had trampled the rest of him to a pulp.&quot;First off, it sounds as if Angel pulls his hand away totally, but you find that's not so. Then, it makes you go back and re-read the passage a few more times, wondering, &quot;Did Angel shoot this guy in the face? What am I missing?&quot; My only conclusion is that the translator could have used different words, such as &quot;full on in the hand.&quot; For all that, the translator could also have avoided the painful use of phrases such as &quot;cootie-counting days.&quot;Is the original this bad as well?I like a good story as much as the next person, but part of what makes it great is the telling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this for my book club, and was surprised to find that so many women in my group could not get into this book! Some gave up after 5, 10 or even 50 pages. They were frustrated by what they saw as choppy translations and hard-to-remember French names. Those who did finish the book, like me, found it to be so rewarding! (Actually, I didn't have any difficulty getting into it from the get-go, but I do admit to making a cheat sheet to keep track of the characters' names and aliases.) The end is not cheesy, where many American writers and film makers would take this path. I did see it coming a bit, but it was still handled beautifully and with sincere emotion. I really liked how the author took a circular approach to this story, returning again and again to the same scene, each time with a new perspective or missing piece of the puzzle. Well worth the effort. I would definitely recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I confess that I feel just a bit stingy in offering only four stars to this book, because I cannot identify a single area in which it is lacking. Japrisot's story is both moving and entertaining, the characters are richly developed and easy to care about, and the events described seem completely credible.I guess I find myself comparing it to books like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is, of course, grossly unfair. For one thing, it could reasonably be argued that those books are among the best written in the twentieth century, and how fair is it to judge every new novel on its ability to measure up favorably to such a standard? Secondly, although ENGAGEMENT is about the First World War, it is more accurately read as mystery/love story.My favorite thing about this novel is the way in which Japrisot offers the reader an opportunity to form quick intitial judgements about many of the characters, and then slowly provides the reader a deeper understanding of these individuals and their motives as the book progresses. I found that, by the end of the book, I liked almost everyone involved in this story. Perhaps not a &quot;great&quot; book, but certainly a very good one - and a damned sight better than most of what has proven to be publishable/marketable over the last fifteen to twenty years."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I made the mistake of starting this book, misplacing it, finding it, and discovering I couldn't pick up where I'd left off and had to start at the beginning again. It's just not a book to read casually. You've got to concentrate and pay attention and read long chunks at a time.Dissatisfied with the official account of her lovers death in WWI, crippled artist Mathilde sets out to learn the truth. Here's the deal: five soldiers were condemned to death for self-mutilation. The manner of their execution was odd: they were forced into the no-man's-land between the French and German lines and left to fend for themselves. Everyone assumed they would all quickly die, but it seems at least one didn't . And there's confusion about his identity. And there's the fact that one of the buried men was wearing German boots, so what's that all about?A spellbinding and enchanting story, Japrisot's A Very Long Engagement is a little of everything: history, mystery, romance, intrigue, and all done in a splendidly literary style.This book was translated from the French, which may account for a small bit of the obscureness of the writing. But oh boy, is it worth sticking with it. If you're not smokin' anything, not drinkin' anything - if you're paying attention all the time, you're in for a superb reading experience."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I never would have guessed a book like this out of Japrisot after reading his 60s noir stuff -- I read it once when it first came out in English, read it too fast in the way that dogs and children are apt to gobble their food faster than the speed of tasteability, and then (as is the way with most good books) everyone I knew borrowed it and then leant it to their friends, and so on -- 2.5 years went by -- the book wound up in the hands of my friend Ted, one of the ten or twelve inhabitants of the planet who actually have the cojones to return a long-overdue book (I am NOT one of that rare dozen, by the way)mailed it back to me, and I read it twice, and it was even better than I remembered it, especially at Round 3, when I actually chilled out and read it at an excruciating turtlespace... To be able, at the cranky and over-post-post-contemporarized fin de siecle, to write such an overwhelmingly beautiful and downright odd love story without resorting to worn-lace nostalgia or otherwise bowing away from what presently squats before us as the toadlike specter of our world -- that's a feat worth more than ten million silly opinions. My own included."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and I wish it was seventy-five thousand million trillion pages longer. Japrisot's prose is elegant, the plot is riveting, and the protagonist is someone I wish I knew in real life. You will want to read it in one sitting; it's that good. I'm a voracious reader who generally reads 1-3 books each week, and I would rank this one as the best I've read in the last six months (and there have been some contenders, let me tell you.) The translation manages to let the elegance of the writing shine through. I can't say enough good things, so I'll just stop here!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I love this book. I first got into the world of A Very Long Engagement through the movie, and I immediately decided to read the book. The book is very well written, holding its different subplots and and the main plot together nearly seamlessly. At the end the elements that become key are ones that you have nearly forgotten or, possibly, skipped over, the reason why I give it four stars.

Also recommended: BIRDSONG by Sebastian Faulks and EASTER ISLAND by Jennifer Vanderbes."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"What would you do, and how far would you go, to bring back the love of your life? That question is at the heart of Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement,\\" a quiet little story about love and war. While the story drags a little at times, the exquisite story of Matti and the love for a man whom she won't believe is dead.Wheelchair-bound Mathilde grew up with Manech, and as teenagers they fell in love and became engaged. But Manech is killed in action, leaving Matti to dwell on her imaginary adventures. But one day she is contacted by a dying veteran, Daniel Esperanza, who tells her a terrible story -- Manech was one of five men who shot themselves in the hand to avoid fighting. Because of that, they were condemned to death: sent to the front lines with their hands bound.But Matti doesn't accept it -- she believes that there is chance, even a small one, that Manech survived somehow. She has her friends assist her in searching through mounds of paperwork, and she herself writes to anyone who might be able to help her -- ex-officers, widows, and lovers. And slowly Matti begins to piece together what happened that day -- and why Manech might still be alive.\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" is complex and a bit confusing, but it's also worth the effort. Japrisot takes a simple plot and gives it some extra twists, a few lessons about war and misery -- but at its heart, \\"Engagement\\" is just about love and determination. It's difficult not to be stirred by Matti's long quest to find her lover.Japrisot's complex paper trail is a bit hard to follow, and the novel tends to drag in the middle, which is mostly Matti reading and writing letters. Japrisot seems uncertain where to go at that point. But the novel is also a jigsaw puzzle -- the German boots, the color of a young man's eyes, a lost hand, and a packet of old letters are all pieces. And many scenes in it are exceptionally tender and beautifully written. Matti's flashbacks and fantasies are dreamy, and even the real world seems to be a bit hazy. The climactic scene is without a doubt the most beautiful, understated and yet deeply romantic.Japrisot created a wonderful character in Matti. Despite being stuck in a wheelchair, she doesn't let this hold her back; she lets her mind fly in all sorts of fantasies. Perhaps it's that childlike belief in the unbelievable that lets her hold on to the belief that Manech is alive. And though Manech only appears for a few pages over the whole book, he becomes as strong as presence as Matti is. Japrisot avoids the cliches of young lovers, while convincing readers that what Matti and Manech share is stronger than anything that comes between them.\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" (now a movie starring Audrey Tautou) is an exquisite love story, heartbreaking and uplifting at once. And it will leave readers with a question -- how long would you look for your one true love?"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I also loved this book and I couldn't put it down towards the end.The war descriptions were very moving,especially the part about the prisoners going into &quot;No-mans Land&quot;.This book will teach you a lot about World War 1-especially about the effects of it,not only on the soldiers,but on their families also."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Winner of an Audie award for her presentation of The Time Traveler's Wife, Maggi-Meg Reed gives a haunting, memorable portrayal of narrator Mathilde Donnay on the Abridged version of A Very Long Engagement.Another equally gifted actress, Isabel Keating is impressive and affecting as she gives voice to the Unabridged Edition of this emotionally riveting story of a search for a lost love.France is the backdrop and the time is before and after World War I. Mathilde has been unable to walk since childhood. Although confined to a wheelchair she has gained some reputation as a painter, yet she's unable to recover from the loss of her fiance. Jean Etchevery was a soldier in the war and declared dead; it was a dishonorable death. He was accused and found guilty of deliberately mutilating himself so he would not have to go into battle. He and four others were taken among the trenches and left to die.Mathilde cannot accept this explanation and with the aid of a private defective and interviews with families of other soldiers she believes Jean is still alive. But, if that is the truth, many more questions arise.Listeners will not soon forget this story of the dreadful toll of war.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is an amazing story of love and hope.

The army has decided to &quot;execute&quot; these men in a gruesome show, to discourage others from wounding themselves to get out of the war. In the dead of night, with hands tied behind their backs, the five are thrown out of the trench into no-man's land between the French and German troops and left to die as the fighting begins. Two years later, wheelchair bound, Mathilde Donnay, fiance of one of the doomed soldiers, receives a letter from a sergeant who was at the front and met her fiance that fateful night. After visiting him and hearing his story, she is convinced that at least one of the men survived and is still alive somewhere in France, hopefully her fiance. The very resourceful and tenacious Mathilde begins a relentless search to find out exactly what happened that night and after..... A Very Long Engagement is a magical, spellbinding novel that has it all...history, mystery, romance, intrigue and suspense...From the first page, you are pulled into the story and transported back in time to France during and after World War I. The original, interesting characters are beautifully drawn; the plot, intricate and compelling, full of twists, turns and surprises that will keep you off balance and turning pages to the end and the scenes, vivid and riveting.

This is an amazing story told with insight, wisdom and sensitivity and a novel that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The storyline in this book is great and the author certainly does a good job educating the reader in the psychological horrors of war. However, the story is often difficult to follow with lots of new names appearing throughout that are hard to keep track of. It is by no means a &quot;fast read&quot;, but if your willing to really concentrate and wade through it, its a pretty good one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've been reviewing for over 5 years. In that time, there is only one book that I ever started that I did not finish, and I never reviewed that book because I barely got 20 pages into it (if that). Well, now that number is increasing to two.I won't give a summary as many, many others have given a really detailed summary that is far better than anything I could ever have done justice to. Instead, let me tell you why I stopped at page 113 and why I have no inclination to finish this book.The first twenty pages are spent introducing five soldiers--their names, their prison numbers, their family, their main characteristics. The next thirty or so pages are spent reintroducing those five soldiers and continuing a few moments ahead in their story. And finally, at page 60, we are introduced, in a large, very exposition-heavy 5 page section, our main character.I found the writing to be terribly confusing. I don't know if it was meant to be that way, or if that is a fault of translating from French, or maybe I am just plain stupid, but sentences sounded weird, the writing was dense, and I had to start skimming in order to make any progress in this book. The book is written in present tense, but that felt more unwieldy and clumsy than some YA books I've read. Sections switched points of view sometimes without a section break, leading from first-person to third-person in just a paragraph. And it seems an omniscient narrator is dictating this...except for a few places where I thought it was Mathilde.The characters are painfully dull. First of all, I could hardly keep them all straight. They were like a deck of only red cards, which the author flashed at me. I couldn't tell who was a diamond, who was a heart, if that person was a 3 of hearts or perhaps a 6 of diamonds. The characters were so flat, it would be a compliment to call them two-dimensional. About the only one I cared for was the soldier wrongfully accused of self-mutilation...and I have absolutely no idea what his name is or who he is beyond that he didn't self-mutilate and was wrongfully charged. Mathilde was a horrible character, in my opinion. She was stiff, unlikeable (calling random people \\"sh&& kicker\\" is NOT a way to endear a character to me), and oddly characterized. I don't mind having a woman proud of her body, but this passage just doesn't sound like any woman I know:\\"She has very lovely breasts. She's proud of them: they're heavy, well-rounded, and softer than silk. When she caresses her *CENSORED* she soon feels like making love. She makes love all by herself.\\"Male fantasy? Bad translation? A very, extremely confident woman that I've never encountered? I don't have a clue.Mathilde exchanges letters with various people. These people are startlingly open about their private lives, sometimes going on pages and pages (when they supposedly aren't big on writing) to elaborate on every last detail of that person's life to a complete stranger.The story is supposed to be about a mystery, but it really didn't kick into gear until the last 20 pages that I read. Even then, I have no drive to figure it out, because I can predict one of three outcomes: 1) Mathilde finds Manech and reunites (unlikely), 2) Mathilde finds Manech and doesn't reunite (most likely), and 3) Mathilde finds Manech dead (unlikely). It doesn't really matter what ending will be chosen. Lessons will be Learned; People will Change; Morals will be Passed on.And this is why I am giving up on this book. There is no way I can force myself to read another page, and with so many other better books out there, I am going to pass on this one.HOWEVER, just because I didn't like it, doesn't mean it's horrible. I rated it 2 stars because \\"I didn't like it\\"; I'm sure lots of people who love mysteries, historicals, and books about World War I will love this. To them, I say, go ahead and give this book a try. I hope you have a much more enjoyable read than I did.Brought to you by:*C.S.

The story is actually quite interesting and the ending is beautiful but the way it was composed was poor.I understand the author wanted to introduce numerous characters due to the fact that this was an investigation and many people would be involved. However, I had a hard time keep all the characters straight. The book is also composed of a lot of letter correspondence, half the time I didn't know wrote the letter or what relevance it. Most letters began with a story of the writers life when we really only wanted to know what exactly you know about the day in question or persons involved. I thought there was a lot of useless information and useless characters when I really just wanted to get to the point.I ended up skimming the last few pages just so I could finish the book and move on to something else.

Poor little rich girl. She had too much time on her hands and used her wealthy Daddy's money to pursue her curiosity.... hurting others while she was at it!

She is a spoiled girl who happens to be handicapped but who also has more advantages than the countless others in the book who also lost loved ones. Her ability to &quot;overcome the odds and search for her lover&quot; are only made possible by the wealth of her father, as is her ability to &quot;overcome the odds and become an artist&quot;. Her character is trite and predictable. Secondly, the many characters in this story only detract from the main plot line and only force the reader to endure more of this book.I carefully considered attributing some of the arduousness of reading this book to its translation (or poor translation). However, when considering the magnitude of the translated works of Hugo, Dostoyevsky, Chekov, Kafka, and others, I do not think that there is any excuse for the poor quality of this read.In short, this is the worst book I have read in a LONG TIME!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"In my previous review of this book, I mentioned Pat Barker's WWI trilogy and incorrectly referred to it at &quot;Resurrection&quot; when in fact it is the &quot;Regeneration&quot; trilogy.

I read someparts of Leaves of Grass but I was not impressed. Now, when I am old,I haverecently met a young poet who thinks highly of Whitman as the Father ofModern American Poetry. Therefore, I decided to try him again.I bought a copy of Leaves of Grass with an introduction by Justin Kaplan.First I read Kaplan's introduction; then I read Leaves of Grass four times.After the second reading, I finally 'got it'. Then I wanted to learn moreabout Whitman so I sent for Kaplan's biography of Whitman.I found this biography answered many questions I had about Whitman's life.Kaplan's writing is very accessible and extremely informative. He citescontemporary sources for facts about Whitman's life. I would recommendthis book highly to anyone who wants to know more about Walt Whitman.(I just hope my review comes through cyberspace intact. This space keepscutting off the ends of words.)"},{"Title":"Walt Whitman, a life","review":"There isn't much by way of analysis of the poems, but there is a trove of information about Whitman the poet and enigmatic man."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman, a life","review":"As stated above, the author drew a lot of Whitman and friends' letters and notes so it makes it a more personal portrait."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman, a life","review":"I looked forward to reading this book and learning a lot about what inspired Walt Whitman, hoping to discover what made him the representative poet of America. But the information is poorly presented. I found myself craving some sort of context, an axis. The author relies far too much on quotes from WW's books and letters to fill the page, rather than using those sources to back up some sort of theory. In short, this is a badly written sophomore English paper. There is no logical progression of his age/place/time and WW's writing. We learn that WW updated and reissued \\"Leaves of Grass\\" numerous times, but what informed those changes, for example? The text jumps from one year to another, but the reader is never quite sure where he is in the \\"story.\\" It's a lot of disjointed notes and snippets that result in a fractured and unbalanced account of WW's life. I wish I'd started with a different WW biography."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman, a life","review":"Appearing in 1980, a time when popular understanding of gay sensibilities and ways of being homosexual in straight American society were still sketchy, Kaplan adroitly and with admirable nuance addresses Whitman's sexual \\"otherness\\" and its impact on his friendships and literary art. I write this in 2011; Kaplan did his research when NY's Stonewall Riots were a recent memory, and the Village People an ironic musical act for sophisticates who got the joke. I doubt there were yet any \\"queer studies\\" programs in academia.Whether Whitman was gay or bi-sexual, we should be careful to not read into his life the mores and assumptions of our time. To be clear, there was no niche for non-heterosexuals in America in the 1850s, when Leaves of Grass first gained public notoriety, and earned only a few critical raves.Who in the mid-19th century literary establishment expected this?:\\"The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from theirlong hair,Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.\\"An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\\"Kaplan's account of Whitman struck me as that of a man who sought to be robustly physical and all-embracing of the world when puritanical restraint was the strict norm among the white protestant middle class. Whitman's poetic language of sexuality was candid and bracingly artistic; much of the rest of America cloaked sexuality in sentimentalism or dread.Life in such a culture meant for Whitman the sublimation of his feelings and alternative expressive outlets. Kaplan's recounts the poet's summer \\"Adamic rituals\\" in his garden, stripping himself naked, rolling in the creekside mud, rinsing himself and scrubbing his body until his skin reddened - followed by another rinse and a frolic in the sun while chanting joyfully.The strength of WWAL is Kaplan's ability to use language that compliments Whitman's own: expansive, bold, colorful - with carefully crafted judiciousness. Happily, there is very little speculation in this biography, a flaw of many biographies written in the later 20th century. The book especially brings home the culture of Civil War Washington and the shockingly high numbers of injured soldiers. Whitman served as a nurse and comforter to many who either recovered or died from their wounds.If there is a flaw in this fine book, perhaps it is Kaplan's decision to open WWAL with 2 chapters that are the final years of Whitman's life -- THEN the biography begins chronologically with Chap. 3, running up to 1880, just after the poet turned 60. Perhaps Kaplan wants the reader to return to the first 2 chapters to deepen the understanding of his subject's life.If you are unfamiliar with Whitman and want to know something of his life story before you venture into Leaves of Grass, Democratic Vistas or Specimen Days, start with this book. Winner of a Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, it is a fine biographical introduction, here and there seasoned with sections of Whitman's poetry and prose, augmenting Kaplan's interpretive narrative. THEN acquire the Library of America's definitive collection of Whitman's poetry and prose, finely edited by none other than....Justin Kaplan."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"Classical evangelicalism is to be congratulated for stepping up to the plate to answer the threat of open theism. In the last 7 years or so, nearly a dozen major books and many more journal articles and debates have been produced critiquing the open theist perspective. The result has been a growing awareness on the part of the larger body of Christ that open theism, while appealing to us in our humanness, is a fatally flawed theology of inconsistency that results in a different god and a different view of the world from the one articulated in Scripture.This particular book is one of the books that have attempted to demonstrate the inadequacy of open theism. As I will mention below, there are several very good aspects of this book, and I believe that the parts of this book that are good are good enough to recommend the book. But on balance, and particularly in comparison to other evangelical books on this subject, it comes up short to a degree that a 3 star rating is called for.Like other books critiquing open theism, this is a collaborative effort where specific authors are asked to write about specific topics related to open theism. As I will mention below, this approach comes back to haunt this book. But one of things about this that is good is that there are specific chapters written by specific authors that stand on their own as being outstanding and are fairly untainted by the other less than superb chapters written by others.Of the 12 chapters of the book, about half of them deserve commendation. I found Jones' chapter on metaphor to be the most engaging and scholarly. In this chapter, he demonstrates quite effectively that the hermeneutic of open theism is unbiblical in its selective denial of the legitimacy of metaphor, and that this denial at its core, is the worst kind of illogic since it regularly results in the views of open theists being rampantly self defeating. A number of other books have tackled this foundational weakness of open theism, but in many ways, Jones' contribution here might be the best succinct critique available.In addition, Frame provides a very good chapter on foreknowledge, although the reader should take Frame to heart when he comments in some of his footnotes that his 'Doctrine of God' book is really the place to go to get a more comprehensive and scholarly critique of the foreknowledge debate. MacArthur's chapter on the atonement was solid, though it could have stood for improvement. Johnson's chapter on impassibility is another very good chapter that attempts to take on what is perhaps the biggest area of theology where open theists believe they hold the best cards. Wilson's chapter on theological knowledge is also good and to some degree, makes up for his rather bad chapter on the loveliness of orthodoxy and the epilogue. Lastly, Ascol provides a good pastoral critique of open theism. These chapters, and particularly the chapters by Johnson and Jones, make the book worthy of purchase.Given what I've said above, I was most dismayed that the quality of those chapters were comingled with other chapters that were as weak as they are. In many of the remaining chapters, the authors routinely set up strawmen to tear down (Sproul Jr. in particular was guilty of this), played a game of what I call 'scholarly demonization' where they attempted to lump open theists into other groups of thinkers that Christians more easily recognize as threats. And in the end, this fundamentally undermines the integrity of the book. One of the stated goals is that open theism is nothing new, but is merely the latest reincarnation of socinian and enlightenment thinking. A number of chapters are dedicated to attempting to prove this link. Those efforts are only partially successful in large part because other authors undermine this assertion by saying that open theism is actually a product of postmodern, feel-good thinking, which is antithetical to enlightenment modernism. The discerning reader might well conclude that the authors are not only unsure of exactly what they're trying to prove, but actively employ an 'any stick will do' approach to go after open theism, even if such an approach results in assertions flatly contradicting each other from chapter to chapter. I have respect for Douglas Wilson, who is the editor of this book. But he fails rather badly in his role here, and allows the book to become an inconsistent and emotionalistic rant at times, which is quite dubious since in many ways, this ends up only immitating many of the 'scholarly' works put out by open theists.So overall, a mixed bag. A number of quality contributions that definitely deserve reading and contemplation are unfortunately mixed in with several chapters that frankly never should have made it to print. As a result, I recommend this book with the urgent caveat of separating the wheat from the chaff."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"This 2001 collection contains twelve essays by authors such as R.C. Sproul, John M. Frame, John MacArthur, Peter Leithart, Steve Schissel, etc.Editor Douglas Wilson suggests that some Open Theist statements about God \\"make one feel that our Open god is soon to appear as a guest on Oprah.\\" (Pg. 24) MacArthur accuses Open Theists of creating \\"a quasi-divine being who has been divested of all the features of divine glory and majesty that might provoke any fear or dread in the creature. Instead, they have made Him into a kindly, nonthreatening heavenly valet.\\" (Pg. 97) Another essayist suggests that they replace an \\"apathetic\\" God with one \\"who is merely pathetic.\\" (Pg. 113)Wilson observes that the debate over free will theism is not a debate between Calvinists and Arminians, since both of these groups maintain that \\"God knows the end from the beginning.\\" (Pg. 146) He suggests that we must either recognize in the Bible an infinite God who occasionally condescends to appear \\"to finite men in a finite form,\\" or else \\"we wind up with an Olympian Zeus---a god who sleeps, finds things out, gets hungry... as it pleases him.\\" (Pg. 153)An essayist suggests that the Open Theist view reduces God to a \\"cosmic gambler---and not a very successful one at that.\\" (Pg. 177) Another essayist notes that foreknowledge of future events is a mark of deity, while the absence of that ability is \\"an attribute of vain idols.\\" (Pg. 216)This is not the most \\"in depth\\" critique of open theism available, but its breadth of different authors (frequently of the Presbyterian/Reformed perspective) makes it an interesting collection, and a valuable addition to the ongoing debate."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"This book is only worth one star, or even half. While the authors make a few thought-provoking arguments, these are obscured by the book's snide tone, sarcasm, and name-calling. How seriously can you take what it says, when, for example, one essay likens openness theologians to drag queens? This book is only fit for those who are convinced that the rightness of their doctrine exempts them from the command to love. Any Christian who is trying to make a serious assesment of open theism's claims would be well-advised to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"This book is so effective at decimating the speculative,conjectural,unbiblical Open Theory of Bible interpretation that it elicits responses and reviews like the 'consistent non-evangelical' who can't handle Biblical Truth.The essays of this book examine Open Theory from many differentangles and find them all woefully deficient in properlyunderstanding the Bible. One only has to check out Open TheoristClark Pinnock's 'Most Moved Mover'(see separate review) and thequasi-mormon view postulated to see where Open Theory logicallyand 'consistently' leads.As has been well said, what good is it to be sympathetic to abelief system that may seem superficially more consistent andso-called logical only to find it is abysmally erroneous as awhole and unable to account for maximum Biblical texts in a fair and plenary way? Such is the fatal flaw with Open Theory whichthis book does a great job in thoroughly, almost embarrassingly,exposing.Open Theory is a 'consistent' house of cards which collapses inone breath of fresh air from correct biblical interpretationand a bit of deeper thought applied to Who God is and What He canknow and When He can know it and how God's UnconditionalSovereignty is compatible/complementary with mortal agency.The reactions from liberal,uninformed,biblically deficientcritics who crave 'consistency' over correctness,cogency andconformity to Scripture are in desperate need of reading'Exegetical Fallacies' by D.A.Carson. In fact, Carson should come out with Volume II using Open Theory exclusively as how NOT to do Biblical Interpretation!See Norm Geisler's 'Battle For God' and John Frame's 'No OtherGod' for excellent elaboration of many points found in this book.Bruce Ware's 'God's Lesser Glory' is also a powerful antidoteto the craving of 'new over true' of the Open Theory movement."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"A book should succeed in its premise: John Armstrong, in the introduction makes the following statement: \\"Bound Only Once\\" is a useful, original, and helpful entry into this growing debate.\\"Sadly, I have never read words that were more off the mark.Bound Only Once is basically a book that allows Calvinists to feel proud of how right they are and to cast judgment on the \\"fools\\" who would dare challenge their view of the Christian God. The true ironic thing is that as one reads it, one feels the fear behind the words. Calvinists recognize the hard truth that open theism is not going to go away and that it has true biblical support.The authors of this book wade back and forth, covering so much unrelated ground sometimes you wonder if they understand that they are suppose to be talking about open theism, not what they want it to be (or think it is). Only John Frame actually takes a shot at relevant scripture, yet the points he makes are over shadowed by his and his fellow author's assumption of rightness.And that is definitely the problem: the authors assume their position is right and when their position is unintelligble, well, hey, that's God and we just have to believe in him that way because that's what God has revealed (such a position would work better if one made an attempt at proving your position, something none of these authors even attempt). Such is the view thoroughout the book.Finally, there is nothing but sadness surrounding this book. Sadness at opportunity missed at truly wanting to engage open theists, at opportunity lost that someone who isn't a Christian might pick up this book and mistakenly believe that all Christians treat others like this when they disagree with them. There is truly not an ounce of Christian love in this book. Definitely a book that one should read to see how not to treat others.A final note: I apologize for not citing specific references to support my thoughts, but that would require quoting the entire work."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"The fervor over Open Theism is akin to the pot calling the kettle black. Until those opposed to O.T can agree among themselves their attempted refutations will hold little punch.It is laughable to see the likes of Erickson, Sproul, McArthur,and Norman Geisler all gang up on Open Theism when they cannot even agree among themselves.This latest attack on O.T. shows just how much hypocrisy, politics and inconsistency exists among Evangelicals. Watch out Gregory Boyd the inquisitors are coming! Only this time they wear the banner of Evangelicalism.The introduction to \\"Bound only Once\\" is filled with the sort of banter and silliness one finds among children arguing for attention.It is indeed a sad day when Evangelicals have to resort to this sort of theological arrogance and anecdotal fanaticism in order to defend the theological status quo.These evangelicals fail time and again to make logical sense of their adherence to the contradictory notions of free will and determinism.I read Erickson's middle of the road position before. His \\"Christian Theology\\" is a good example of the confusion created when one picks and chooses among the petals of the TULIP. Once again we have rationalist apologist Norman Giesler wanting it both ways opting for the silly idea that we are \\"Chosen but free.\\"I could go on. Suffice to say that Wilson's book is another sad tribute to Evangelicalism's confused state of affairs. A state of affairs were myopic ego centered personalities battle for theological supremacy while claiming to hold forth THE Biblical view of a God they cannot even agree upon."},{"Title":"Bound Only Once: The Failure of Open Theism","review":"This is one of the finest entries into the current debate between the Evangelical community and Open Theists who are trying to join the ranks and make their Socinian/Processisticviews acceptable among Evangelicalism.Fortunately, Openness has failed before it has begun combat, even though it appears here and there to be winning a few battles. Because of books like this and Millard Erickson's&quot;God the Father Almighty&quot;,&quot;Evangelical Left&quot;; Bruce Ware'sGod's Lesser Glory-Diminished God of Open Theism&quot;; John Frame's&quot;No Other God&quot;, the Bible ensures that Classical Theism has already won the war.For those who appreciate Dr. John MacArthur's careful,expert and accurate Biblical scholarship these past thirty years, here is an excerpt from his chapter &quot;Openness Attack on the Atonement:Evangelicalism? Hardly!&quot;&quot;In C.S.Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, Aslan, the fierce but loving lion,represents Christ the 'wild,not tame lion,both good and fearsome. 'People who have not been in Narnia sometimes think a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time.'That same basic false assumption was the starting point for the heresy of Open Theism.New-model theologians (Pinnock,Boyd,et al) begin with the assumption that the God of the Bible could not be good and terrible at the same time, so they set out to divest Him of whatever attributes they didn't like.Like Socinians and liberals (processists) who preceded them, they are on a misguided quest to make God 'good' according to humanistic,earthbound definition of 'good',devising a deity of their own making.In the final book of Narnia series, a wicked ape drapes a lion skin over a witless jackass and pretends it to be Aslan, a sinister and dangerous pretense leading countless Narnians astray. The deity of Open theism is like the jackass in an ill-fitting lion's skin,leading many sincere seekers away from the glorious Son of God of Scripture.God is both good and fearsome ('Consider the kindness and sternness/severity of God'-Ro.11:22).His wrath is just as real as His love, His fur as real as His fangs, His cuddliness as real as His claws.&quot;Much Biblical food for thought, categorically refuting the aberration of Open Theism for those open to Scriptural witness.A tour de force!

But more than that this is a positive affirmation of the correct, evangelical Christian view of a truly Omniscient God Who has complete awareness of all things (Exhaustive Definite/Divine Foreknowledge of all creaturely free-will future decisions). Anything less is quasi-omniscience. Open Theism is warmed-over processistic thinking synthesized with Classical Theism to create a brand new hybrid which is Biblically and rationally unsatisfying and demeaning to the LORD GOD. Open Theism is desperately trapped in two-dimensional, pygmy thinking-(x,y) coordinates only- in their truncated space-time understanding. What is sadly lacking is the z coordinate, the divine dimension of understanding what Scripture and science say about time, space, divine attributes and what is possible for God. Must reading for those concerned about a dangerous dilution of evangelical understanding of Who God is and What He knows and When He can know it.

Yet one of the countries I've never really read a picture book from is beautiful South Africa. Here we have a country steeped in color and beauty and yet the schoolchildren of America know relatively little about it. Heck, I'll go so far as to say that MOST U.S. schoolchildren probably couldn't even find it on a map. Fortunately, that's all changed with the presence of author/illustrator Niki Daly and his heroine Jamela. If you've met Jamela in the past, you know what to expect from her. If you've never met her before, you're in for a real treat.Jamela and her mother, residents of South Africa, are out shopping for dress fabric on fine and frolicksome day. After locating a beautiful but costly skein of orange/yellow weave, the two buy it up and wash the stiffness out of it. As the fabric dries on the line, Jamela's mama tells her daughter, in no uncertain terms, to keep the dog off of it. She doesn't want anything messing it up. Technically, Jamela obeys her mother's orders. The dog never gets the fabric dirty. Jamela, on the other hand, takes it on a joyous walk down the street, drawing the attention of many friends and neighbors. Too soon, however, Jamela must face the consequences of her actions and her mama is left unconsolable. It's only through an odd quirk of fate that Jamela is inadvertently responsible for her mother's new dress and a little surprise of her own.Niki Daly must have kids. I've never said that about a single picture book illustrator before, but I think I have to say it now. There's something in Jamela's face that is dead on. When she wraps herself in the lovely remains of the fabric as her acquaintance Archie takes her picture, her face is a glowing combination of smugness and preschool pride. In fact, Daly has also captured the movements of his characters beautifully in this story. From Jamela's traipse along the dusty dirty street to the rambunctious clamering of friends and neighbors, Daly has an eye for natural human relations. There are delightful tiny details to observe as well. Note that when Jamela takes her walk she has obviously outfitted herself as well in her mama's too large red sandals.And then there are the colors and fabrics in this story. The only picture book I've read that rivals this one in delightful material selection would have to be Lloyd Alexander's, \\"The Fortune Teller\\". Together, these two books would make one heckuva good storytime session. In this book, every person in this book wears realistic and fitting clothing. Archie sports a remarkable matching print suit while Jamela eventual comes to wear an elephant infused jumper. And Daly's so adept that you can sometimes make out the shifting colors and shades that make up each one of Jamela's dredlocks.In an Author's Note at the end, Niki Daly gives some additional information about the history of the term \\"Kwela\\" (a word that pops up more than once in this book) giving the reader a little more information about South Africa itself. It fits the book well. I'd often heard wonderful things about the Jamela book series, but I'd never had the pleasure of actually reading one before. Now that I have, I'm happy to have found it. It's a vibrant and entirely pleasing concoction."},{"Title":"Jamela's Dress","review":"&quot;I first saw this book in my book club magazine, I became really interested in it because I wanted a book that my daughters could enjoy.

Jamela's Dress is a unique representation of the simple joys in a child's life and how imagination can sometimes lead to trouble. Niki Daly's illustrations are a brilliant use of color that not only are appealing to the eye but also represent that of the African culture.

Jamela and her Mama shop for some material with which her mother will make a new dress to be worn on the occasion of a family wedding. They take it home, wash it, and hang it up to dry. As Jamela guards it against harm she becomes so excited by the beauty of the cloth that she wraps it about herself and parades through the town. Inevitably the cloth is ruined but through a clever plot device all turns out well and Jamela redeems herself. The wonderfully warm watercolors bring Jamela's neighborhood to life in all its energy and drama.

The setting is different from our urban/surburban American life, but my daughter could relate to Jamela, particularly her dream of wearing a beautiful dress and her disappointment when she seemed to botch things up for her mother.

And the fabric is ruined. There's a bit of a contrived happy ending, though I guess children mightn't realize it.I love how realistically Jamela is portrayed. Volunteering to keep the fabric safe and the forgetting is *exactly* how children act. And I like that \\"Even Jamela was cross with Jamela\\" at the end - children really can be their own harshest critics. But what I really love is the final sequence - armed with new fabric, Jamela's mother (clearly having learned her lesson) stays with her and sings and plays as the fabric dries on the clothesline, and then she makes a dress for her daughter. It's clear how much they love each other, and it just sends warm fuzzy feelings everywhere."},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Eastern Europe","review":"This book rarely, if ever, failed me on a 8 country jaunt through Eastern Europe.

He fell asleep over his unread book the night before his report was due.Elmo woke up feeling sick, and no wonder--his feet were green and webbed.He called the author, Dr. Frank Galoof, for advice and found a cab outside his apartment building that spirited him--actually floated--to Frogtown, where Dr. Galoof said it was no wonder he was turning into a frog. Lunch in a swamp-colored restaurant, where the waiters were frogs like the good Dr. and the fare consisted of slugs and insects, Galoof told poor Elmo,&quot;You see, the longer you put a problem off, the worse it becomes. It's all in my book.&quot; Elmo replied, &quot;I had no idea frogs led such interesting lives.&quot;Elmo took the advice--&quot;Just read the book&quot;--and liked it!

Lee, who had been the United States Solicitor General, and was president of Brigham Young University from 1989-1995, before his death from cancer.This is a casual and easy read. I read it in about three hours, and I think it gives a great look at what the Saints believe. It is not an official church publication, so the book has a lot of personality and bounce.I though the chapter on his confirmation-hearing to be Solicitor General was quite interesting. Remembering the Bork and Thomas hearings, these can be very bloody. He was asked about any conflicts of interest between his church and his office as Solicitor General. He said that he was an employee of the United States Government, so that is where his loyalty would lie. He then made a comment that this question should have been settled with Kennedy. A man can be a good president and a good Catholic, so he could be a good Saint and a good Solicitor.I recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about the Church of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Believe","review":"This book provides a quick and helpful summary of the beliefs of the Mormon Church, presented for non-Mormons.

Rex Lee does a great job of introducing the LDS church to those with little or no knowledge about Mormons (or who want to know if their knowledge is accurate). He presents a basic overview of Mormon beliefs and practices. Contrary to what a previous reviewer said, Mr. Lee was well-versed in the Bible (as most Mormons are) and does not say that Mormons are \\"just another Protestant sect\\", since Mormons do not believe they are. This is an excellent resource for the beginner seeking to know more about the LDS church."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Believe","review":"Many people have attempted to define the Mormon beliefs. Who could do it better than the president of the Mormon University, BYU?The first chapter of the book describes the primary difference between the Mormons and other Christian denominations, namely the restoration of the gospel through the modern Prophet Joseph Smith after centuries of apostacy. Many a bible-basher overlooks the need for a restoration of doctrine in the traditional Christian theology. This is because of fear that the Mormons may be right. They will criticise Mormons for not being able to back up their every belief with Bible quotes. Once you understand the notion that the traditional Christian church is based on the philosophies of men and not upon current revelation, you will see, at least from the Mormon perspective, just how inept these bible-bashers are.Please read the book. If you want to learn more about the Mormons, do not read books by disgruntled ex-Mormons! Do not read books by non-Mormon ministers and scholars. Instead read credible works by active and faithful Mormons. Or visit the church website. Don't be fooled by impostors who's only goal is to defame or seek revenge."},{"Title":"What Do Mormons Believe","review":"As a non-mormon looking to increase my knowledge of Mormonism, I was disappointed. Like other works by Mormons I have read,the Bible references were taken totally out of context when they refered to the subject at all. Most of the unusual Mormon practices were not justified with references to the Bible. This work uses words not in any dictionary and known only to Mormons, see in particular the pages on the three levels of heaven. Mr. Lee does not have enough knowledge of the Bible or Christian theology to understand the message of the New Testament. For this reason he claims Mormons are just another Protestant sect. This work displays clearly how different Mormons are from Christians. Read this with the Bible in one hand and &quot;What Do Mormons Really Believe&quot; in the other."},{"Title":"For Self-Examination/Judge for Yourselves : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 21","review":"This book, page for page, may be Kierkegaard's best ever. This is a rather slim volume, but is packed with Kierkegaard's most profound and life-changing philosophy. Compared to his other works (almost all of which I highly, HIGHLY recommend) this book comes across as one of the most potent and dense. Therefore, I would recommend this one first and foremost to a reader who is pressed for time and is intimidated by the sheer length of Kierkegaard's other works. If you have not devoted every minute of your spare time to reading every page of every book ever written by Kierkegaard, my first question, of course, is WHY NOT?!?!? What are you thinking??? Get with the program!!! I am willing to forgive you, however, if you could just find time in your busy schedule to read this one slim pamphlet. It is the \\"Reader's Digest\\" condensed Kierkegaard for realistic 50-hour-a-week men, and it could radically change your life for the better. Profound, uplifting, loving, hopeful, and positive, I recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"For Self-Examination/Judge for Yourselves : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 21","review":"Kierkegaard exposes what it means to be a Christian.

Individual's life including Scripture study is the core of this book."},{"Title":"For Self-Examination/Judge for Yourselves : Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol 21","review":"Kierkegaard is at once a daunting and fantastic author. So much so that it is often hard enough to know where to start. I have many Christian friends who want to know where to start, and I can recommend no book more highly than this one. With vivid examples and metaphors, incisive observations, and piercing wit, Kierkegaard takes aim at anything that would preport to be Christianity but that eschews the true costs and beauty of following Christ. Whether it is redefining what it means to live soberly or how one could ever hope to serve only one master, Kierkegaard is absolutely serious about the actualization of faith and the sanctity of what he dubs \\"the eternal.\\" You will be convicted."},{"Title":"Fashion Photography Now","review":"Shying away from the standard sort of fashion photography (read: flawless and posed) seen in most collections, this book compiles fabulous work by both prominent and up and coming photographers. Pulling shots from the pages of international magazines, as well as a handful of unpublished works, Chermayeff has presented a myriad of lovely contemporary images. The paper stock used is fantastic, the color saturation first-rate. Whether for the rabid fashionista, the art collector, or the photography buff, this tome makes a stylish gift. Those with an eye for photography can see that these phtotgraphers will be the Irving Penn's, the Horst's, and the Scavullo's of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fashion Photography Now","review":"This is a collection of photos where the emphasis is on the fashion and yet the clothes on the people do not dominate the image. Sometimes the emphasis is on what the people are doing, other times it is on the other objects in the photo and sometimes the person the clothes are covering. And yet, the clothing still manages to be a significant component of the image. Those characteristics make the best fashion photographs, which these certainly are. I looked through it and was impressed with the appearance of each person and their clothes, independent of whether they were in fact wearing them."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"I always read a book written by a woman about gender issues with a lot of caution and suspicion.

However, maturity and the fact that I have 2 daughters who needlessly suffer because of deep-rooted misogyny have forever changed me. I bought this book because I'm interested in solutions to the problem of subtle and not-so-subtle woman-hating.

They just want to destroy every man, whether or not he can read and write. Artists are the first to go.To be reasonable with them is impossible. They are extremists, and can only be dealt with by isolating them.They are created by families that are completely dysfunctional, and where they hate both their parents, but usually the mother even more intensely than the father.The fourth commandment to honor thy father and mother is completely in abeyance among feminists and most other radicals.These people can't be reasoned with any more than the Khmer Rouge could be reasoned with. Moreover, their tactics and their sensibility is exactly like the Khmer Rouge. They will only be content when every man is dead, and all their books are burned, and every trace of them is destroyed.Young is too optimistic, but I like how she lays out the problem. There is no way young feminists will ever be able to take over from inside. They are trained by the older Khmer Rouge, so they don't have the perspective that a liberal education might have otherwise given them.The situation is simply hopeless. People don't arrive at their opinions through reasonableness. They get there through emotional situations, and then the opinions coalesce.Nature, not opinion, will straighten them out. Nature requires men and women to cooperate. Those who don't get this will live sad and lonely lives and eventually commit suicide. Reason can't straighten anybody out. Nature straightens everybody out. It's the unwritten laws.

Why not read Germaine Greer's new book instead of this trash?"},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"It is symptomatic of the times that any criticism of feminist orthodoxy can only be delivered by a woman. Even then, any hint of allegiance to conservative politics is an automatic disqualifier. It labels one as a reactionary mouthpiece for the alleged forces of patriarchy. Fortunately, there are a growing number of young women challenging feminism's victim-cult politics. Unfortunately, contemporary pioneers for sanity in gender politics such as Rene Denfeld and Christina Hoff Sommers are not likely to get equal time - if they get any at all - in university women's studies departments.Equally so, Cathy Young, a regular columnist for the Detroit News and contributor to Reason Magazine, is not likely to hit the recommended reading lists of those with a partisan interest in the exploitation male female differences. As the title Ceasfire! suggests, the gender war has gone too far and, as Young exhaustively documents within its covers, damaged too many innocents.Says Young, &quot;Things were simpler a decade ago, when there were just feminists and anti-feminists.&quot; But today there are two feminisms. One is 'equity' feminism; that is simply the commonsense call for equal rights and opportunities. Young is solidly in this camp. No problem there, but its radical counterpart, dubbed 'gender' feminism, defines itself in warlike terms against male oppression. Proclaiming victim status for women leads to a hoard of injustices, not only against men, but nearly as often against women.Young doesn't suggest men and women are androgynous, but unlike suggestions of Mars and Venus, she places them both solidly on planet earth. They share substantially the same ability to wrong each other - and that they do. Chapter by chapter, myths which are promoted by feminism's fringe, but nonetheless widely accepted in today's political climate, are systematically exploded.Among these are the tenets of (I dare not say, but Young does) the battered women's movement. Young doesn't deny the existence of domestic violence, only that it can be a two-way street. As she points out, respected University of New Hampshire researchers consistently report women as often as men initiate aggressive physical contact - the so-called 'first punch.' This is a human problem, not part of the feminist declared &quot;epidemic of male violence against women.&quot; Mainstream media, as Young repeatedly reveals, either submerges, misreports or misunderstands these complicated dynamics. From there, legislation is enacted on false assumptions.By and large, gender feminism denies the inherent capacity for violence by women. Women's transgression are dismissed as reactions to an oppressive patriarchal world. Men are presumed guilty, both in feminist theory and in practical application of the law. But recent studies reveal that lesbians (presumably they are feminists) have high rates of violence toward their own partners.However, Ceasfire! is not an anti-women polemic. A chapter headed &quot;The Conservative Mistake&quot; points at the confusions attached to this issue. A paradox exists. Radical feminism posits that women are moral superiors to males, i.e., they would never file a false claim of rape, they have an inherent capacity civilize and nurture which brutish oaf men lack. Old fashioned Victorian morality agrees - so do some traditionalist conservatives. Women are the fragile guardians of good - a civilizing force - who must be placed on pedestals and protected.Young notes this &quot;strange convergence of radical feminism and patriarchal conservatism - and the alienation of both ideologies from real life.&quot; She points us to the confrontation between the Christian fundamentalist Promise Keepers and the National Organization of Women. Despite initial appearances as polar opposites, they both campaign on a platform of male irresponsibility. Unwittingly, they are working from the same premises.Another strand of conservatism, agreeable with equity feminism, points to the progress women have made in recent years. Here the belief is &quot;how ridiculous it is to talk about American women as an oppressed group.&quot; Indeed, there are statistics the National Organization of Women prefers to avoid.Young's conclusions are pragmatic. Her twelve proposals are directed toward balance, not vindication of any particular viewpoint. The theme is the de-politicization of gender issues, but one does not ask for balance unless the status quo is skewed, and Young is clear about that. We need to get along. Women have sons and husbands; daughters have fathers and brothers - our issues are family ones. We are the same species.But radical feminism cannot maintain its cohesion without an enemy. That is why Young's friend and colleague Christina Hoff Sommers once warned, &quot;When feminists quote statistics, reach for your common sense.&quot; The &quot;its always his fault attitude&quot; is the mantra of a movement that doesn't want peace. That is the balloon Young seeks to puncture.Popular media seldom probes for deeper truth. Whether that is due to political ideology, a lemming-like like tendency to follow the herd, or the rushed atmosphere of daily production, false and misleading examples of advocacy research are too often presented as authoritative. Its is a straight line from an interest group press release to the front page - once there, falsehood is elevated to truth. Young has produced a comprehensive counterpoint to the standard wisdom. She wants us to &quot;Get the facts straight.&quot; Ceasfire! is directed toward those who prefer truth and insight over perjury and manipulation."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"We on the left have a tendency to make a hero of the &quot;victim&quot; whoever he or she may be. To do so, we need our &quot;reasons.&quot; We concoct statistics of victimhood, rely on our gurus (e.g., Catherine McKinnon, et al), usually avoiding decadent &quot;male&quot; critical thinking, to develop abstractions to prove the victimhood of same. When our findings are challenged, we throw flames at the straw person into which we've transformed the challenger, claiming most often that the challenge is of no merit because of the credentials, political affiliation, or alleged diabolical objectives of the challenger. As the challenges become more substantial, the flames become hotter.While the person who recommended the book to me is one whom I trust, I had some reservations about it as Young is affiliated with the Cato Institute, a conservative libertarian think tank. I was relieved to find that, while the book seems aimed at a conservative readership--there is a chapter dedicated to the mistakes of conservatives--by and large the book is a pretty safe analysis of contemporary feminists who are so dedicated to their status as victims that they've endorsed a veritable &quot;paleo-sexism&quot; as Young calls it. And this victimhood is, to me, the opposite of what feminism is supposed to be about! The feminists I've admired have insisted on claiming their own turf, on demanding their rights as citizens, not insisting that their rights are contingent upon their subservience to the omnipotent men.Oh, and Young had the audacity to acknowledge that women too abuse their kids--and their spouses--much more than many a feminist or court is willing to acknowledge. Thank you, Ms. Young. If a man were to say the same thing, he'd be accused of bitter cynicism. You've at least opened the door to that dimension of honesty.While I am a strong advocate of women's equality (and racial equality, and...) to the degree that most people from Cato would probably despise me, the present wave of feminists have infantilized themselves. That I do not advocate. Between some women claiming they've been &quot;sexually harassed&quot; on claims that are so abstract that if a man were to claim the same he'd be laughed out of court, and redefinitions of rape to ensure the place of comfortable women in the realm of the rape victim, there seems to be something wrong with the claims. (A Democratic congressman of my acquaintance was recently accused of abuse by his ex-wife. Her attorney implied that the charge itself, despite evidence, should be enough to convict him, or at least seriously challenge his reelection prospects. If I were in a position to do so, I'd have her disbarred!)Then there are the emotive statements, &quot;if such-and-such were a men's disease, its research would be funded,&quot; and the dubious studies by those catering to the latest feminist fads (many of which have been refuted by Christina Hoff Sommers, and others). Young does a pretty commendable job of exposing these fallacies. For instance, the amount spent on breast cancer has surpassed that of prostate cancer by a factor of 50, relative to the number of victims of each! And if I hear one more reference to Faludi's screed &quot;Backlash,&quot; I may get into book burning.Young is wise in covering some dimensions of the &quot;men's movement.&quot; And I agree with her approach. It seems that Warren Farrell, in &quot;The Myth of Male Power,&quot; may have a good point or two. But he seemed to want to make men into victims too. How about both sexes help each other out and not claim that &quot;other&quot; is subjecting &quot;us&quot; to unspeakable horrors. Then there is the bizarre and dangerous misconception that the &quot;us&quot; are our allies and the &quot;other&quot; our enemies. (Do such claims sell that many newspapers, or that much air time?)I suspect that a little of Young's speculation meets the needs of her ideology too; there is a little of &quot;it seems to me,&quot; or &quot;probably...&quot; But her closing recommendations as to &quot;get a life&quot; (my phrase, not hers) are sound. And I don't see anything wrong with women and men (blacks and whites; gays and straights...) working together. I have this wild fantasy that we'll be able to get something done if we learn to do so!What's more, I don't see the book as a cheap shot at feminism. (That's one of those flames, of course, aimed at Young). Rather, she exposes fallacies that need to be exposed if we are to work together, instead of against each other. While reading it, you might consider other victimologies, e.g., recovered memory, satanic abuse and other travesties, and ask where they correlate with victim feminism."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"First of all let me assure you that there is nothing wrong with American women. There is something very wrong, though, why American feminism &quot;group-think&quot;, notably &quot;victim feminism&quot; (Oh, come on, is there *really* any other kind of influential feminism nowadays?). Which strikes me as very, very odd. Blame it on my European identity, cultural and otherwise, but the increasingly virulent rethoric of victim feminism makes absolutely no sense to me. It takes women who are born into one of the richest societies in the civilised world and clothes them in the garments of a Third World-esque &quot;oppression&quot;. The irony is, of course, that most of these women have not met with much oppression during their lives and that they have a world of opportunities open to them in a way undreamt to their ancestors, both male and female.Not that I intend to deny that the odd male chauvinist still exists, but to claim that the way to eliminate anti-woman attitudes is by encouraging anti-male attitudes is unacceptable in my book. And for anyone with more than a nodding acquaintace with moral and ethics, it is not only unacceptable, it is positively totalitarian. Another thing that I find intriguing (and I say intriguing to avoid the over-emotional conotations of &quot;downright angry&quot;) is this mindless connection of victimhood with power. I look at the real victims: at the Third World children who die of hunger in countries brimming with natural riches, at refugees that wait and wait for a peace that will never come, and wonder where does all this &quot;patriarchal oppression&quot; rethoric comes from. I have a little game to pose to those women who are bent on blaming men for their every personal shortcomings. I have a little game to pose to those men whose feelings of self-loathing are so intense that they have to rationalise them into that tiresome &quot;I am oppressive by nature, deserving of contempt, blah, blah, blah&quot; mantra: how about growing up into a full human being for a while? How about starting to assume full responsibility for your actions once in a while? Oh, I can sympathise with these trends. I can sympathise completely. It is easier to say &quot;We live in a society that oppresses women&quot; than to say &quot;If I do not develop my full potential it is my fault&quot;. It is easier to say &quot;I'm not being promoted because I am a woman&quot; than to say &quot;I'm not being promoted because I'm not qualified enough&quot;. It's easier to say &quot;I'm not violent, I'm a victim&quot; than to assume responsibilty for your bad actions and accept the just punishment. But ultimately, this is counter-producive. It is only a form of neo-paternalism.And what is so good about Young's book is that she sees this. She is able to see through all that screechy rethoric and poke at the deep truths beneath it. She knows that although there are certainly individual men and women who are victims of one thing or the other, neither women nor men are &quot;victims&quot; or &quot;oppressed&quot; or anything else. Real feminism was always about equality, about fairness for *all*, women and men, whites and non-whites, etc. It was never about moral superiority or claiming a privileged victim status. It was about realising how traditional sex-roles hurt both women and men, by imposing rigid behaviour rules and forcing them to follow expectations no one could keep. Where have those ideas gone? We live in a world of professional worriers. A bizarre world where people would rather distort the truth than to sigh in relief with the fact that, say, spouse battering rather than being a epidemic, constitutes unnaceptable and devious behaviour.It takes bravery to write such a book in contemporary America, although I think there would be much less fuss here in Europe. Only a woman could have gotten away with it, although Ms. Young still has to contend with the screechy no-brainers of (mostly) &quot;gender feminists&quot; whose hate-mail is protected by the very right to free speech they seek to abolish, simply for suggesting that men and women should work together to achieve common goals and that we should stop thinking about &quot;women&quot; and &quot;men&quot; and start thinking about &quot;human beings&quot;.Of course that such ideas, given the present thwarted state of gender politics, come across as revolutionary. To me though, a woman fed on a diet of real equality and critical thinking, to whom humanity consists in assuming your faults along with your virtues and accepting the consequences of your deeds, Ms. Young's ideas come across as solid, commonsensical sanity."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"If Cathy Young was a man she would have been accused of being a sexist, misogynist, battering, child-molesting, anti-lesbian rapist, for having the audacity to write this book. And the fact that I completely applaud it probably makes me one in most anti-male feminist (male or female) minds.I personally do not understand how anybody could see anything in this book that has to do with promoting misogyny, rape, abuse, violence etc. In fact I challenge anybody to present one statement from this book that makes light of ONE of women's true woes. I defy anyone to state one provable lie i.e. untruth in all the facts Ms. Young has presented.The thought to me of all the critics of this book is that they had already made up their minds before they read it. I mean, if I discover that, truly, only 1 in 1000000 foxes die of human cruelty every year and publish fact this when the Protect The Fox organisation says 400 in 1000000 die using faulty methods of research, am I then anti-fox?! Likewise, if rape rates are lower than NOW thinks, is it &quot;pro-rape&quot; to make known the lower number?Tell me true, is it anti-woman to note that a father can often be just as good at taking care of the children as the mother? Is it anti-woman to tell the truth that a father is as important as a mother in a child's life? Is there any justification for the belief that a father is only as welcome in the child's life as the mother wants him to be? Is this not anti-child?Ms. Young deals with issues that have brought the sexes into conflict in the past thirty years, fueled by agenda driven people (you may accuse me of being a rapist here, if you like) who are more dedicated to an ideology than the lives of the women they claim to represent. The agenda driven people I talk of know that to admit that they have made progress means that they stand to lose their jobs so they continue to inject more venom into the relations between the sexes, causing more misery to all.Feminism has done many wonderful things, and I will move heaven and earth to ensure my wife's, sister's, mother's, aunt's, niece's and (especially) daughter's rights to equal opportunity, security, to pursue love and joy in their lives, but not at the expnense of my brother's father's, uncle's, nephew's and son's rights to the same. And I refuse to take sides. The truth is we can achieve both, and we should, even if it means pissing NOW off.Thank you Ms. Cathy Young. You are a gem."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Browsing through the &quot;reader&quot; reviews of this book I am even more convinced that Ms. Young is on the right track with her critique of gender feminism. We live in a society that increasingly sees men as inherently evil and women as saviors of the world. It seems that human nature leads us toward such polarization from time to time only to later discover that the power inherent in casting ourselves in the role of savior always comes at a price.Ms. Young's book merely serves to illustrate the price we are paying for the excesses of gender feminism, and provides some well reasoned thoughts on how to put things into better balance. If we do not do so, our sons are destined to become second class citizens in a world where they will be blamed for all that is evil and ignored for all that is good.Ceasefire argues that a world like that is one none of us will be happy with...Even those people who seem to want it so badly."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Well, it appears we have a woman who is not quite entranced by miss Young's theses. Perhaps I can mince a word or two on that subject.We can take the bad reviews as a glowing thumbs up for this book; anything that only gets long five star reviews on the one hand and hate-email from one or two determined Berkely undergrads on the other has to be good by simple logic. Hated by Berkely undergrad= good book, quod erat demonstradum.The negative attention paid to her also lends creedence to Miss Youngs ideas in themselves- has anyone noticed the hatefull and avalanch-like attacks come form the political leftist feminists? Sort of throws a little doubt on the monumentally oppressive patriarchial culture notions and the idea of a backlash, doesn't it?Or to put it another way- If there is a war going on, why are all the vicious and intolerant fighters on the left-feminist side?All you hep cats take note- the side that won't even consider other ideas is the side that is on the wrong side of history. Read Miss Young. I am."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Cathy Young defends women's right to be bad, to do bad things, to be wrong, to be violent - and to accept the responsibility for such actions. Who would want these rights? Well, today's women should want them - they are the right to be fully human. Common wisdom, fed by advocacy groups (as Young so skilfully delineates), gives us two images of women: 1) the forbearing and sensitive nun, easily offended by the slightest hint of sex or physical confrontation, and 2) the &quot;woman warrior&quot; - infinitely capable and contemptuous of men. If women commit violent acts (and, as Young proves beyond doubt, they commit these acts regularly) it must be in self-defense (the media and the Ad Council tell us). Young's idea is revolutionary and could get us out of the Edwardian simplicities of our current dogma - that men are predators and women are pure and innocent. Women are human, capable of evil, and deserve the right to be held responsible when they do wrong. Now that's equality."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"does trying to give the other half a voice, as Mrs. Young does in Ceasefire!, get anything but praise? This book is essential reading for anyone with a natural inclination towards balance.Mrs. Young eloquently and systematically calls for collective empathy from all of us. To deny that women are still not treated as equals in the U.S. is pure ignorance but, as Ceasefire! so clearly depicts, to deny the sufferings of men is equally so.Nowhere in this book does Young downplay the women's struggle, she merely strives to show that no one is innocent these days. That an Us VS. Them attitude will only work to distance us further.By the way, isn't it strange that almost none of the negative reviews have been backed up as helpful?"},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"It is sad that &quot;readers&quot; of this book feel compelled to say that Young is not really a woman. This can only be because she dares to defend men, who - common wisdom tells us - are beneath contempt. Young speaks out against sexism."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Ceasefire! is the most nuanced, sensitive and objective portrayal of the &quot;war of the sexes&quot; that I've read yet. The picture she paints is especially familiar to any college undergrad: on one side, we have the MacKinnonite victim feminists, on the other, backward-thinking conservatives. With an imposing array of relavent statistics, Young makes a calm, reasoned case for a more equal, just, and peaceful dialouge. The first chapter summarizes the book's theme perfectly - &quot;Men Are From Earth, Women Are From Earth&quot;. Disregard this insightful work at your own risk."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"This is a very well thought out, researched, and written book exposing and debunking the radical gender feminists' myth of &quot;patriarchy&quot; and &quot;oppressed women.&quot; Ms. Young deserves accolades for having the courage to stand up as an educated, intelligent woman and shatter feminist myths. This will rank up there with Professor Sommers' &quot;Who Stole Feminism&quot; as one of the most powerful books written by women to expose the lies of feminism."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"A fair, balanced, and constructive book on gender issue. It clears many mythes due to radical feminist, comments on men's movement fairly, and proposes a way to true equality (no one has privileges). The author spends most contents to criticize or comment existing thoughts and movements and less on its proposals. Technically, it is a well written and easy to read book."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"I agree with almost everything this book says about radical feminism. Of course, Ms Young is really just pointing out the obvious.Despite the title of the book, the only gender war so far has been the war waged by women against men, particularly against young men and boys. Now that some men are beginning to grumble that enough is enough, women like Ms Young are finally saying \\"ceasefire.\\"How ironic. I wonder how much of this is to do with women's inherent sense of fairness and compassion for men, and how much of it is to do with women's fear that men might (finally) declare war right back on women.Such a fear is not entirely misplaced. One of the few benefits of the psych war waged against our sons through the media and our educational institutions is that feminists have unwittingly created a generation of young men who have few illusions about feminism or women in general.Once the Boomers retire, we will have a very different generation of men filling positions of power (despite the best efforts of our feminist educators). Perhaps women like Ms Young are unconciously aware that a day of reckoning is approaching.With that in mind, it would be logical indeed for women to disassociate themselves from the worst excesses of radical feminism. If not, they risk being tarred with the same brush."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"I loved this book and I have so much respect for Cathy Young. She and a few others have dared to show the male point of view on gender related issues. Believe it or not, ladies, life can be incredibly unfair to men. Recent laws passed by stupid politicians have gone way too far in some cases in expanding the rights and priviledges of women and dramtically decreasing the those of men. Ms. Young shows us this in incredible detail and with tremendous documentation. I can assure you that no one who criticizes this book can do so based on its merits. It is way too scholarly for that. This book should be a wake up call to all men and for the women who love them and believe in fairness. Women who believe that bad things happen exclusively to women, and that women deserve special rights and privileges that men don't have will hate this book."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Only in the feeble minds of those individuals not blessed with an intellect exceeding that of a box of rocks does paying attention to men's and boys' issues (FOR A CHANGE!) and not believing the unfounded claims (OH, women are SOOOOOO oppressed) constitute anti-womanism.

When someone is lambasted by nutty extremists on both 'sides', that person is usually doing something right.

What else is new? Ignore all the misunderstanding, hyperbole and whining from the adolescent feminists and see where the last thirty years of the woman-run gender wars has gotten us. Definitely a wide-ranging and eye-opening book, certain to encourage discussion (or worse!) at a higher level.

This woman is different,she actually offers a reasonable,workable solution to help resolve the problems between the sexes,to actually work together instead of in opposition to the other.

As Young and Sommers have said, changing the knowledge base of our institutions is not the answer to achieving true equality of the sexes--we need to both take hold of the level playing field we now have and forge together to further form and then take a advantage of a world where NEITHER gender is depicted as inferior.

Young's research was reassuring, and offered me an explanation of why these people are so insecure about their beliefs. Her constantly qualifying her criticisms of feminism with criticisms of the right at first seems wishy-washy, but by demonstrating that conservative views on gender are at least as outrageous as the views of radical feminists, she provides an important warning of the danger of overreacting to bad experiences.

In criticizing masculists, Young must reach out to a few self-published authors to show that she is criticizing more than the single author - Farrell. And to top this off she completely blows the treatment of Kadar's writings on health care by sex.

For the traditional 'dinosaur' feminist since the 60s, equality has meant demanding a share in man's advantages but not wanting anything to do with his disadvantages (e.g. the demands for women to have an equal share of leadership roles is not shared by an equal demand to play an equal role in the world's most unpleasant jobs, etc.), while fighting to keep female advantages while losing their disadvantages (e.g. dominating the world's cushiest and most fulfilling jobs while demanding equal pay as those that make up 96% of the USA's occupational deaths). Cathy Young's book is not perfect for some of the reasons listed below, but we should all be grateful that people like her are helping those who have been blinded by so many decades of dinosaur feminism, with it's perverted notions of equality. So thank you Kathy, for hammering one more nail into the crumbling edifice of modern feminism, and lets hope that we're all still around to reap the rewards of books like yours.

She turns the tables quite neatly on dozens of hypocrisies currently being put forth from many different camps, by no means picking only upon feminism. I can't say that her style is exciting but this, after all, isn't a novel; it's a serious, dispassionate look at issues that touch all of us every day.She ends the book with a listing of common-sense recommendations as to how we (both women and men) can and should stop and think before we start making claims of sexism, harassment and maltreatment. It is important to note that Young isn't any happier about spouse abuse, rape or the 'glass ceiling' than anyone else; she simply challenges us to carefully consider our definitions of these and other injustices. She does not minimize the achievements of women's rights advocates in the past, but her concern is for where we are today, and how we should deal with one another so as to live in amity. I found it especially interesting to read the reviews of the book in light of what Young has to say.Recommended, especially to those who feel almost certain they will disagree with everything Young is saying: if you do not find yourself seeing the merit in her viewpoints, you will then understand that much better why you dissent from them."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"If your looking for a balanced treatment of the current gender unpleasantness this book is a good place to start.

To present the rising 'misandrny' that exists in our society, as Ms. Young does authoritatively, does not diminish concerns over abuses of women.

The inescapable truth here is that it's time for a truce at the fiftieth parallel.With unremitting intelligence, deliberate sobriety, and the balanced perspective of a first-hand historian, Cathy Young re-acquaints us with the epiphany that revolutions which rip apart the entire fabric of any human society have dire consequences.Those adults who can march as courageously as Ms Young into the valley of truth - and many will fail - will find a twelve-step remedy that provides the ineluctable antidote - and be compelled to Ceasefire!Charge!"},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Cathy Young has written a book that cuts through the rhetoric and the politics of gender.

She has made enemies among the whiners of both Right and Left for puncturing their inflated self-pity balloons. She observes how the myths of victimization and power serve to divide men and women, rather than unite. She wants men and women to call for a &quot;ceasefire&quot; and instead work together for a freer and more productive future."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"From time to time, a book may be published which by rights shouldbe recognized as a flawed yet creative, courageous, well-documentedcontribution to an issue of profound social importance. And yetthe book may be underestimated and overlooked due to a paradoxicalcombination of its contrarian perspective and the natural-seemingnature of its arguments and conclusions.Cathy Young's contribution to ending the gender wars, Ceasefire!,is such a book. The Russian-born journalist painstakinglydocuments and then demolishes shibboleth after feminist shibboleth.It is violence against MEN which is treated more callously bysociety. Often, \\"even if it's the woman's fault, it's the man'sfault\\" somehow. The author skewers the current \\"moratorium onfemale responsibility.\\"One favorite pastime of Young's is calling the feminists on theirpropensity for trying to have it both ways: women are weak analogsto children when that is strategically advantageous, morphing at amoment's notice into amazons as physically strong as the toughestman when THAT claim will result in further advantages to women.Women claim they are equal to men, often denying even obviousbiological differences, and yet they simultaneously imply or evenstate openly that their sex is the morally superior one. Womenclaim to be physical equals of men, except in the sphere ofdomestic violence. Mothers complain that they want their husbandsto be more involved in child care, but they do not want them TOOMUCH more involved.Young reminds us that feminist tendencies harm women as well asmen. Placing nearly all blame for all societal problems on menencourages women to avoid taking responsibility and becoming trulyequal partners of men. A man can be railroaded in a domesticviolence case even where the woman implores the authorities to dropall charges.Young is not a lawyer but she devotes significant space to thedisastrous effects feminist dogma have wrought on our legal system.She demolishes the so-called thinking behind modern courtinterpretations of Title 9, the federal law whose recentinterpretations have forced the dismantling of men's universitysports programs in pursuit of a false equality. She documents howgrotesquely feminist concepts--rape shield laws, sexual harassmentlaw--have distorted our laws nearly beyond the breaking point,thereby obscuring the genuinely grievous cases.Without any particular justification other than political pressure,special exceptions in certain areas of feminist interest have beengrafted onto time-honored legal principles. Meaningfuldistinctions with real implications for the lives of thousands ofmen and women have been eroded or eradicated. And the placement ofthe sexual harassment standard in the eye of the beholder hascreated an utterly unprecedented, subjective legal standard. So itis that hugging your secretary after her mother's death becomes a\\"crime\\" which can destroy a career. If traffic laws were modeledon sexual harassment laws, she writes, \\"there would be no stopsigns or speed limits; you could be fined for failing to stop whensomeone expected you to, or going at a speed that made anotherdriver uncomfortable.\\"Young is not afraid to cry from the mountaintops that of coursethere is a difference between violent stranger rape and date rape.Some rapes ARE worse than others, and some \\"rapes\\" aren't rape atall. She supplies several dreadful stories documenting the harmcaused to innocent men, under the rape shield law, by utterlyfrivolous or even vengefully false rape allegations. Our approachto domestic violence, which refuses to consider relationshipdynamics and joint responsibility as contributing to domesticviolence, is of course exactly wrong.Though not without her own blind spots in this regard, Youngskewers society's lack of compassion for men. Why does outrageover rape trials typically only run in one direction, and fail toencompass the false accusee whose life may be ruined despitecomplete innocence? Why do we make it so difficult for men toobtain adjustments in their child support after a job is lost orwages are cut? We often define \\"primary caretaker\\" without eventhinking that this very concept excludes the provider role from thedefinition of \\"care.\\"But Ceasefire! has some grave flaws too. Young is least compellingwhen she talks about the men's movement which strives to correctmany of these wrongs. Unfortunately, she analogizes masculism toradical feminism, and she dismisses the mythopoetic movementwithout serious evaluation. Even more regrettably, she minimizesthe harm to males caused by such phenomena as circumcision,football, and even reduced lifespan. In a generally well-researched book she attempts to discount Warren Farrell's excellentwork documenting women's power in the home based on one possible,relatively trivial error. Such an approach seems more akin to thatof the feminists whom the author, elsewhere in this book, sorightly calls on their selective use of data.In sum, I highly--if less than wholeheartedly--recommend Ceasefire!The book contains much of value, and may offer more documented,referenced information on masculist issues than any work this sideof Warren Farrell. Cathy Young does care about men, and those ofus who care about men have much we can learn from her.'"},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Cathy Young's &quot;Ceasefire&quot; picks up where Christina Hoff Sommers' &quot;Who Stole Feminism?&quot; left off and provides a devastating critique of both mainstream feminism and its more extreme conservative critics. Young presents a cavalcade of facts, figures, studies and quotes to back up her contention that both conservatives and feminists exagerrate (and in some cases wholly fabricate) the differences between men and women to serve their own ideological purposes. Well written and exhaustively foot-noted, this is easily the single best book available today providing a reasonable criticism of contemporary feminism (if you like this check out Daphne Patai's &quot;Heterophobia&quot;)."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"Kudos Ms. Young!!It seems that feminists trash and dismiss any informed opinion that does not toe their &quot;women are sweet angels, men are abusive rapists&quot; ideaology.

Cathy Young offers her take on all the issues you would expect, such as sexual harrassment, rape, domestic violence, and believe me when I tell you, she doesn't worship in the usual feminist sacred cows in these and other areas. But she also takes no prisoners in the men's movement, either. Warren Farrell, Jack Kammer, Robert Bly are all mentioned here, and Young's opinion of their views is not always complimentary. She kind of mocks Bly for his retreats where there is growling and beating of drums, but much of the time spent on the men's movement,is spent attempting to dissect Farrell's The Myth of Male Power. To be honest, when I skimmed ahead and saw what Young was going to say about Farrell, she kind of lost me, since I am a Farrell fan, but I finished nonetheless, which I do not regret, although I still do not understand why she attempts to minimize Farrell, whose later books, especially Father and Child Reunion, which she appears not to have read. If she had been able to, she might have come to the conclusion that she and Warren have more in common than she believes. Perhaps she is waiting to do another book. We'll see. I found Young's attempt to diminish Farrell and other leaders in the men's movement disturbing for other reasons. When she takes on these men, whom she continually refers to as masculists, practitioners of the male equivalent of victim feminism, according to her definition, I found it oddly condescending. I don't know that any of these men really should be catagorized as victim masculists, or any term using either of those two terms, because I don't think that is what they are about, at all. What is Young saying, that none of these men should be leaders in any effective future men's movement? If that is the case, then that begs the question, whom WOULD she choose? Maybe she wouldn't have a men's movement at all, but rather, as she calls it, a gender equality movement, a idea also endorsed by Farrell, by the way. A gender equality movement is a good idea, but one that may be at least a few years away. Or maybe we are seeing the beginnings of it now, I hope. In any event, I did find Ms. Young a little patronizing [or should I say &quot;matronizing?&quot;] when she critiques the men's movement to the extent she does. She might want to consider men like these leaders for the gender equality movement she envisions."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"This book is interesting because it deals with a lot of contemporary issues in our society relating to gender issues such as sexual harassment and rape and how better to address gender problems in our society like clearer definitions in law of sexual harassment and consent. If a few women are joking around about a picutre in a playgirl magazine, is it sexual harassment towards men? The courts have said yes. It also deals with how people still don's really want as much as gender equality as they say including women. It seems that over the past generation or so there has been a big push to make fathers involved in their children and doing more things aroudn the house which is a good thing of course but now there are many women who now feel unfcomtorble with this now because they feel that they should have more power in those areas after trying to get men more involved. Often there is conflict between groups on issues but this book seems to emphasize that both men and women need to come toghether and work toghether to find solutions to our problems and that we need to be gender neutral in all aspects of our lives. The last chapter in the book &quot;where do we go from here&quot; is really good because it deal a lot with how to improve things in the future like not blaming all of women's problems on sexism and you should try to reverse gender roles wehn making judgments relating to gener."},{"Title":"Ceasefire!: Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality","review":"This is the best critique yet of contemporary feminism and the ideological dry rot afflicting it."},{"Title":"The Witch Doctor's Dance","review":"An intersting and revealing account of medical training and practice in the mid 1950s.

In this book, Mr. Utterson finds himself trying to solve a mystery about this same situation, with an old friend and a new foe.The plot of this book is hard to explain because it's very easy to give this book away. I'll just say that there is a situation between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde that involves murder, drugs, death(s), and an unexplained ending.Mr. Stevenson also did a good job of making the genre difficult to figure out in this book. The book could go under mystery because of the plot, but I say it goes under science fiction because none of the actual drugs in this book have been created yet.

The insights of a Christian mystic and a Buddhist differ in words, but reflect the same underlying experience of union with the Ineffable Suchness that is God or Tathata. I value this book deeply for its subject matter. Be advised, this is not light reading or \\"beach reading\\" as Eckhart can be somewhat impenetrable at times. But Suzuki is very adept at interpreting him and gets to the essentials, making it a book to be ingested slowly, meditatively."},{"Title":"Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist: The eastern and western way (World perspectives)","review":"D.T. Suzuki was in his time a well known scholar on Buddhism, especially the Japanese Zen variety, and was later appointed a Professor of Buddhist Philosophy.In 1948 Suzuki studied some sermons of Meister Eckhart and wrote this little book, pointing out what he felt were the close connections between the Meister's ideas and those of Zen Buddhism.Having studied both Christian and Buddhist spiritual traditions myself quite closely, I think Suzuki has tried but failed to find common ground between these two great world religions.Nowhere in Eckhart's sermons or tracts for example, does Eckhart conceive of God as Buddhist 'emptiness' or 'shunyata.' While it is true Eckhart felt God was One, and this One was above being itself, Eckhart also believed this One was a Trinity and contained a super-richness or overflowing of being, rather than a void which mysteriously and transcendently is the source of all other things. The Buddhist ideas which Suzuki refers to have far more in common with those of Oriental mysticism, such as the Tao of Lao Tzu or the Brahman of the Upanishads. Eckhart's idea is closer to Gregory of Nyssa or Dionysius, who saw God as infinite, perfectly One, incomprehensible but also a Trinity.However many of Eckhart's ideas do have paralells in Buddhism, especially those on 'detachment', imageless contemplation (something shared with Evagrius Ponticus, a 4th century Eastern Christian monk) and the ground of the soul, which may be compared with the Buddhist notion of the inherent 'Buddha nature' shared by all beings. Yet, I think Eckhart is best considered what he really was, a Catholic mystic who saw himself as an Orthodox Christian through and through, rather than a Zen master in disguise."},{"Title":"Mysticism: Christian and Buddhist: The eastern and western way (World perspectives)","review":"Suzuki basically has written this book, which primarily about Buddhism rather than Christianity, as a way of drawing connections between the different mysticisms present in Christian tradition and how some of these mysticisms share common traits and insights with Buddhism. Not surprisingly, the mystic whom he chooses to do this with is almost exclusively Meister Eckhart. This is, thus, no comparative history but a Buddhist slant on Eckchart's thought and spirituality. It is a slant that might make some Christians uncomfortable but it is interesting nonetheless. This serves a window through which he continues to discussion Buddhist mysticism at large in the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Seeds of Greatness","review":"I read this going on thirty years ago and it was a great book then, and still a great one now.

Max Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), and a few books such as SOG. Collectively, these readings focused my goals and clarified my life strategy.

Waitley pointed out ten important traits of high-achieving people. To me, the more interesting ones among them are: persevarence and having definite goals in life. The book contains ten chapters corresponding to the ten traits. In each chapter he explains what he means by a particular trait, and gives examples to illustrate what he means, and how this trait is important. I quite often found his examples not very convincing or even irrelevant. For instance, in the chapter &quot;The Seed of Purpose&quot;, he gave this example of how his children got him into buying a dog he didn't want to buy. I wasn't quite sure what he wanted to show by that example, if he had to include it in his book, it should probably be better included in the chapter &quot;perseverance&quot;.Still, many of the things from the book are true.

Several self-help authors have quoted or used many of Waitley's first-hand accounts of how to achieve greatness.For example, Waitley actually spoke with the man who interviewed billionaire Mr. Hunt, and Waitley met a woman born with polio who went on to win Olympic gold. Moreover, Waitley listened to cassettes of oft-quoted coach Vince Lombardi, who reportedly said \\"winning's not everything, it's the only thing\\". As it turns out, that is not quite what Lombardi said. Waitley feels you in on the facts.While Waitley's ten points for greatness are inspiring, I was most moved by his use of primary resources.

Observing the unhappy trio is a traveler, forced to take shelter with the strange family because of the blizzard that rages outside. Of the three, one is proud, stoic, and hard-bitten; one is shrewish and whiny, and one works silently at the tasks that must be done -- stoking the fire, setting the table for dinner. What brought these three to their present state, and what holds them here in this living hell? This book is an incisive character study with an unexpected ending. The portrayal of the three in the final chapter left me with chills."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. Instead of just telling the plot, Edith Wharton used a lot of symbolism to tell the story and show the characters emotions, because the point of view is that of an objective bystander. It isn't a very good book if you just want to read for plot, but if you want to read something a little deeper, it's a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"As in many of Edith Wharton's works, Ethan Frome eloquently tells the story of a love that can never be, because of the trapping of society and moral obligation. Mattie's and Ethan's plight touches the deep recesses of the human soul. The beauty and ending sadness of this novel leaves one misty-eyed and tugs at the the heart strings. This is a delight to read. It is truly a treasure of 20th century literature."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"I thought Ethan Frome was an average book. At times though, I had to push myself to read it because I'm not really into romance novels. Edith Wharton (the Author) gives the book a lot of details at times and I think thats why I found the book to be only average. Although, I like the way that Edith Wharton brought Jotham into the story. He doesn't play a major role like Ethan, Zeena, or Mattie, but his character helped bring their house to life. The book was about a young lady who took care of Ethans mother in her last hours (Zeena) and Ethan and her begin to fall in love. The interesting twist to the story is that when Zeena begins to also have a life threatening disease, her cousin Mattie comes to live with them to help out around the house. Ethan and Mattie start to fall in love and the rest of the story takes off from there. I don't want to give away the ending because that is about the only part in the book that I actually liked and enjoyed reading."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"Don't read this book! The book was too short to tell the story that was so long. The author was cleary trying to fulfill a publishing quota and didn't put the effort or thought that is necesary to create a good novel."},{"Title":"Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome (Barron's Book Notes)","review":"Edith Wharton is a wonderful author, but this is definitely NOT one of her better works. The story is not of her norm, and in my opinion she should have stayed with her standard story. The characters are not realistic: Mattie is perfect for Ethan, and Zeena is too overbearing and just plain evil. This book, although short, seems too long once you start reading it. Don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"Indian Controversies: Essays on Religion in Politics","review":"This is considered a celebrated work of Arun Shourie, and is a collection of essays and articles he wrote over the years, on topics ranging from the Ayodhya dispute, Salman Rushdie, Shah Bano controversy, etc.. The writings on the Babri Masjid proved to be prophetic, and articulate very cogently the reasons and frustrations that led to the mosque's destruction. Personally, I found the best chapter to be the one on Muslim personal law, titled 'Your Wives Are your Fields...'. This chapter outlines the present status of the Muslim Personal Law in India, the outlook the courts have taken and the absence of any leeway that courts are supposed to have in interpreting it, and the reasons behind such a mindset. Arun Shourie then proceeds to explain in detail why such positions are not justified or sustainable. This particular chapter is a must read.

Open warfare is waged against the dissident youth of the state. One-third of the population earns a living manufacturing bombs, misiles, napalm and rockets. The educational system is rent by political pressure and internal dissension. Blatant racism continues in a pattern which is centuries old. Acute alcoholism, drug adiction, mental illness, divorce nad suicide scar private lives at a frequency which is sometimes twice the national average.Is fascism a serious possibility? According to Kenneth Lamont, it is not only possible - it is here. What is worse, its presence in California - for years a reliable barometer of America's political and social temperment - clearly and undeniably predicts the future of every state in the union.Anti-Californa is a lucid and eloquent analysis of conditions in this glorified and misunderstood state, a frightening report on its public corruption and private sickness. In it the voices of Ronald Reagan and Bobby Seale, S.I. Hayakawa and Mario Savio, Max Rafferty and Dr. William McGill mingle with those of the forgotten - the street people, San Quentin inmates, residents of San Francisco's Tenderloin, rebel priests and the quietly troubled who seek out every kind of therapy imaginable.

From the historical significance and traditions of each day of the year to the calendars and time-reckoning systems used all over the world throughout history, the Oxford Companion to the Year is chock-full of obscure bits of history, poems, quotations, and illustrations. Absolutely fascinating reading--a must-have for the new millennium!"},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to the Year: An Exploration of Calendar Customs and Time-Reckoning","review":"This 937 page reference work of calendar customs and time-reckoning is a modern day version of Robert Chambers's &quot;Book of Days&quot; (1864), and is now surely THE definitive reference work on the subject. For every day of the year (including February 30, which has been observed three times in past calendars, once in Sweden and twice in the Soviet Union), there is a listing of the date (e.g., 25 Abril), the Roman date (e.g., a.d. VII Kalendas Maias), a list of Holidays and Anniversaries (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga: ANZAC Day) or Holy Days (e.g., Mark the Evangelist) or perhaps something from Ancient Rome (e.g., &quot;On this day was held the ceremony for keeping rust off crops, the Robigalia,&quot;). Moreover, there are usually one or two paragraphs given to explain the origins of various holidays or as biographical background. Sometimes poems or literary excerpts are inserted to further enliven the entry. Additionally, a generous amount of humor and bonhomie are sprinkled throughout the text.Other calendar customs such as the moveable feasts of the western church year, days of the week, Red-Letter days, Dog Days, terms at Oxford or Cambridge, Handsel Monday, Thanksgiving, or the Lord Mayor's Show each have their own entries and explanations. Part II follows, with investigation into calendars and chronology. Here the international scope of the book receives greater exposure, with discussion of the Roman Calendar, Chinese Calendar, Egyptian Calendar, Greek Calendar, Hindu Calendar, Jewish Calendar, Muslim Calendar, Anglo-Saxon Calendar, or Celtic Calendar being some of the many discussed. Explanations of the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, calculating the date of Easter, use of symbolic calendars, as well as many other topics round out a thoroughly researched section.My only demurring remark about this excellent book is that sometimes the academic writing can be a little dry and murky, drifting into the pedantic, so that at times I found myself nodding off to sleep. This style of presentation also led to occasional difficulties when trying to understand the discussion at hand. Nevertheless, on the whole, the book is most interesting. A great deal of research obviously went into this wonderfully thorough and accurate reference work. It may be used either as a source for information, or alternatively its daily entries may be read throughout the year as a short daily entertainment. To sum, it is a book well worth obtaining."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to the Year: An Exploration of Calendar Customs and Time-Reckoning","review":"This work is the ultimate reference tool for the calendar. It is divided into two parts. In the first part on Calendar Customs we have a rich but not exhaustive chronology of the days of the year (from pages 1-544) recording historic events which occurred on specific dates as well as notable holidays. This is followed by material covering the seasons, months, days, Western moveable feasts, Orthodox moveable feasts and miscellaneous holidays that were not incorporated in the main chronology, e.g Handsel Monday.The second part of the work deals with Calendars and Chronology. This section consists of several important world calendars (such as the Hindu, Jewish, Zoroastian and even the French Republican, etc. - yet certain noteworthy calendars like that of the Hopi Indians are absent). There is also information pertaining to the date of Easter, appendices, a glossary, bibliography as well as an index.There is a great deal of information contained in this volume. However, the authors' main speciality is classics. Whilst reasonable coverage of folk customs is provided, neither of these prestigious authors are folklorists. This is evident from the lack of certain material. For instance, in the analysis of the days of the week (pp. 571-582), while after each day there are a few phrases like Fig Sunday and Mothering Sunday, these phrases could well have been increased. For example, even though there is a reference to Simnel cakes (once brought to one's mother on Mothering Sunday) there is no reference here to Simnel Sunday. Likewise there is no mention of Sugar Cup Sunday, Spanish Sunday or Shaking Sunday (all synonyms of Palm Sunday - the etymologies of which would have made interesting details). Neither is Stir up Sunday recorded (the is the last Sunday before Advent when traditionally Christmas puddings were prepared - 'stirred'). Also excluded are Refreshment Sunday (a synonym of Mothering Sunday)and Peasen Sunday (a synonym of Carling Sunday - yet this latter term is recorded - so called since peas or 'carlings' were eaten). Moreover, there is no mention of Plague Sunday (last Sunday in August) or Pig Face Sunday in Avening, Stroud (after September 14th). Analogous phrases after the other days of the week are similarly unrepresented.On the subject of the days of ther week, it must be noted that the bibliography does not constitute a complete list of works cited. It is merely a collection of published works suggested for further reading. On the whole the text is not annotated and the bibliography does not include all the important articles which have provided the authors with information for this work. For instance, on p. 577 with reference to Tuesday, the authors are correct in observing that in Greece this day not Friday is the unlucky day. This point is followed by an obscure allusion to Digenes Akritas which is only marginally of relevance. The only English-language source of this association (though not acknowledged in the text or bibliography) is a brief article taken from 'FLS News' (newsletter of the English Folklore Society) about 'Tuesday (not Friday) the Thirteenth'(FLS News, No. 21, June 1995). This article should have been cited since it was obviously used ; and in the rare event that this information was taken directly from Greek-language sources (e.g. the folklore journal 'Laographia'), then if this were the case such a reference is likewise missing in the bibliography.In a work of such mammoth proportions compiled by just two (rather than a whole team of) distinguished authors, it is inevitable that a certain amount of pertinent material has been excluded or overlooked. Nevertheless I still give this work a five-star rating and (until it is reprinted in larger improved editions)this will still remain the best (or rather only) work of its kind."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to the Year: An Exploration of Calendar Customs and Time-Reckoning","review":"This is an exhaustive review of the CHristian calendar systems and contais biref explanations of many others.

This free e-book is in the public domain. This is the German language Kindle edition, it has 8004 locations. This edition contains footnotes and a biography.This book is about the Renaissance in Italy, which experienced its pinnacle around 1500. Burckhardt did extensive research in archives before writing this book, he used sources from the times itself. Even though Burckhardt was an art-historian, this book is a book about history, there is little about art in this book. Burckhardt not only writes about states, but also about people, language, clothes, religion and every day life, universities and schools, immorality, poetry and much more. This is a great book, in spite of its age it is still very readable, Burckhardt had a lively way of writing. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history, this is not only one of the most important history-books ever written, it is still a nice read.The only negative thing I can say about it is that Burckhardt's idea of a complete break between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance is now obsolete; today it is genarally believed that it was not a complete and sudden break but a slow process, in which some people moved faster towards the modern times than other people.If you liked this book, then you'll probably will also like the works by Johan Huizinga (1872-1945).The contents of this book are 6 'books', each of those has several chapters.

Most of the time I'm not clear on where I am or why a certain battle is strategically significant. I take for granted that it must be and I move on. A sense of desperation is difficult to fully appreciate as the critical battles of book #7 are located (and becoming more so with every book) further and further away on different fronts... a la World War One. Maps would allow me to see for myself the incredible logistical problems the humans are facing, rather than taking the author's word on it.Have to agree with others on the battles getting old hat. What I mean by this is the battles are getting bigger and bloodier, but the humans find themselves in the same situation in every book: they are attacked, they defend, they win. We're apparently cruising past WWI trench warfare (which tanks ended in our timeline and seem to have done in theirs) and I guess we'll be seeing blitzkrieg action soon, along with carriers, subs, and carpet bombing. This progression, considering the influx of newer technology through the Tunnels of Light is acceptable, however I would like to see the humans make offensive use of this technology. They are always reacting to the Bantag (or Merki or Tugars). Their society and spirit must be close to the breaking point and their will to fight sucked dry. Something has to happen soon. No war is won by fighting defensively and the humans are ALWAYS fighting withdrawals. William, can you not write a mega book, initiating some human campaing to bring the Bantag to their knees? I believe it would show a fresh characteristic to the war.In any case, I'm riveted to the book, despite all that I've said. The story is too intense, the situation too dire, the problems too overwhelming for me to turn away.

However, as the series continues, he is killing off some of the more interesting characters and is not replacing them with other characters who are just as interesting. Also, the portrayals of some of the characters seems to be in contradiction of earlier portrayals (President Kal for instance). The technological advances are interesting to a point, but as a point of personnal preference, I found the civil war tactics a much more interesting premise than the World War I/II tactics that are developing in the later books. That is just my personnal preference, and I can see how others might strenuously disagree with me on that point. All in all, though it was still an interesting read and with work and school, I still 'gulped it down' in less than 24 hours, having waited a year for it.

In spite of some problems with proof-reading, which never really got in the way, this novel, like all its predecessors, manages to combine hard science-fiction, masterful military and general history, and anthropological and sociopsychological insight in a blend that cannot fail to move even the most dedicated critic. William R. Forstchen's greatest skills lie in so accurately and insightfully portraying an entire alien culture that one cannot fail to identify with those characters that are drawn from that culture -- and thus be set up for hideous disllusionment when the darker side of that culture is revealed. He presents the alien Bantag with the skill of a master antrhropologist, revealing them in all their barbaric glory, giving us glimpses of their religious and domestic life side-by-side with their enormous military skill and powerful grasp of the principles of war, so that one can't help but sympathize with them -- and then jerks the rug out from under the reader by showing the monstrous aspects of their culture. Further, he shows the Bantag in contrast with the human beings who have come to this world by accident, bringing their own strnegths, skills, weaknesses, their culture, their hopes, dreams, and fears with them, showing the two species, human and alien, locked in a life-or-death struggle to determine which will ultimately populate and master this world -- and for all their cultural glories and tremendous physical size and strength, the aliens finally come off the losers, lacking as they do any real understanding of what human beings can do, the value of such knowledge for military purposes, and even the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of humanity, the capacity for compassion even toward defeated enemies, love of others that spurs them on to supreme effort when by all rights they should fall and be defeated, and their capacity for vision and creativity by means of which they are able, even in the face of overwhelmingly superior numbers, to crate a military machine capable of utterly destroying their monstrous enemies. Couldn't put any of the novels in the series down until I had finished them. I am looking forward to new novels in which that battle-torn world is presented to us a century after the events taking place in A BAND OF BROTHERS, to see what has become of the human beings and their alien foes during that time. I would also like to see a comprehensive atlas of that world, perhaps a world globe to set on my desk. William Forstchen is a serious rival to Harry Turtledove and Harry Harrison, the mastera of alternative-history science-fiction, as well as Frank Herbert, author of DUNE, and a true heir of Murray Leinster and H. P. Lovecraft. May he live for many long, productive years more, opening countless clear windows not only on this world, but many others besides."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"Band of Brothers continues the Lost Regiment series, an intriguing blend of historical and military science fiction.

A US civil war regiment is transported to a world where humans are kept as slaves - &quot;cattle&quot; - to be eaten by a race of monstrous nine-feet high aliens reminiscent of Genghis Khan's Mongols. By the time Band of Brothers comes around, it is 10 years after the 51st Maine arrived, 10 years in which they have freed several human states and defeated two of the many hordes that feasted on them, all through the application of 19th century technology such as rifles and artillery. Beginning pretty much where book six left off, Republic troops are engaging in skirmishes with the Bantag Horde after narrowly escaping annihilation in book six. It is no secret to reveal Andrew Keane, the Commander of the 51st Maine and of the Republic's armies, is wounded (the book has the scene on the inside cover). The action focuses around Pat O'Donald, the gruff Irish artilleryman as he tries to hold the armies together. Most of the action takes place in Roum, in brutal city fighting which Forstchen writes quite well. His military actions are much better described than the tortuous scenes in Harold Coyles contemporary Civil War novels, and at least as good as Bernard Cornwell's Starbuck novels. But Band of Brothers, while not the weakest of the Lost Regiment series, is not the best, an honour I reserve for numbers three and four, Terrible Swift Sword and Fateful Lightning. Forstchen's narrative sometimes gets bogged down in descriptions of battle which are all too similar, a problem with a series like this. The technology once again takes small leaps forward in the book, one of the best parts of this series. You keep asking yourself, &quot;what if the civil war kept going?&quot;, &quot;What if technology leaps were injected, such as the Horde's harnessing of powered flight&quot;. But for novels which rely so much on descriptions of logistics, the lack of a map is not only annoying, but a serious omission. Forstchen should rectify this as soon as possible, even by posting one on the Net, so fans can properly appreciate his vision. In all, a good read, I stayed up till 3am to finish it."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"An epic, that is all I can call it. While waiting for #8 Men of War, I sat down and re-read all seven books and believe now more than ever that these are some of the finest books I have ever read. I have a library of over one thousand books in my home, and The Lost Resiment stands high as the best I have read. Never has a book or series of books so moved me as an American and a student of American history. You can feel the power and the pain of their struggle as these fine men fight against overwhelming odds for one simple reason - to live free. The most important factor of the stories is that the heroes are people just like you and me. Just like any hero, a moment before they were a hero they were plain old folks, just another person. You can connect with the people in the story because of that, you feel for them, you feel their joy and pain, when they laugh, you laugh, and when they cry you cry with them. When one of them quotes &quot;We few we happy few, we band of brothers&quot; tears will well up into your eyes, because you feel the brotherhood he speaks of. I am now going to sit down and read &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; by Steven Pressfield, which was recommended to me by William R. Forstchen. 'Nuff said!"},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"This is the seventh in the series. Not the best one, but a very good installment. This one picks up right where the previous one left off. The author does not spend much time introducing the characters or the plot. It gets right into the action.In the previous book, the humans have just been defeated soundly and are in full retreat to the lands of the Roum. The Bantag are in hot pursuit. The humans are counting on the winter weather to halt the Bantag campaign. However, since Ha'ark is from a different (modern) world, he understands the importance of continueing the campaign once the enemy is on the run. He pursues the humans and begins the seige in the dead of winter.Ha'arks lines of communication and supply are tied to a single rail line leading all the way back to the Great Sea. Several hundred miles. The port city is resupplied via sea from the land of the Chin. Ha'arks supplies take 10 days to reach the front lines from the Chin. Ha'ark has plenty of trains and ships ferrying supplies.I tell all this because resupply is the only Bantag weakness. If the humans can disrupt the resupply, even for only a few days, the tide of the battle will turn. That's all I will tell about the battle.If you're reading the series, this one has to be read in the correct order. If you are not reading the series, a lot of the storyline may be confusing. There are lots of reference to events and people in the previous books.Bottom line, this is a good book."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"Keane is hurt and that changes him. The leader of the humans becomes the most deeply human of the lot, forced to face his fear and his guilt, while a vicious street by street fight erupts in the city of Roum, from the sewers to the buildings. The Redeemer shows himself as a less than ideal tactician, reacting to the circunstances more than creating them, which is actually what has been documented as real war, where combat is changing and fluid. Hans will end up leading &quot;his&quot; people, the Chin, into battle against the Bantag with little more than their hands. This is stirring writing, which appeals to our emotions as much as to our rationality. This alien world is very possible, and the technology to get there is part of theoretical physics, with wormholes between universes and/or galaxies, or sectors of galaxies, and the reversion of the hordes to primitive nomads after their ancestors &quot;walked between the stars.&quot; &quot;A Band Of Brothers&quot; manages to keep the suspense alive just at the moment (the seventh installment) when most series that last this long wind down and either die, or crawl ahead to ever-diminishing interest. By shifting the focus and by making his characters more fallible and, therefore, more human, Forstchen has written a dark, different winner."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"The only reason this book did not get three stars was the fact that William Forsthcen is one of my favorite authors, but otherwise it was not the best in the series. The Bantag War, compared to the Tugar and Merki Wars, is quite dull. The land ironclads are somewhat interesting, but they don't really add anything overly exciting to the tale. There were some odd things going on in Roum, as well. The Senate building (the Curia) kept being called a palace, even though it is not, and now suddenly Marcus's name has gone from Graccus to Crassus. The late Ferguson's wife is still called Varinna for some reason, even though she was originally named Olivia. Vincent kept being referred to as Chuck, which was creepy considering Chuck is dead! The airship stuff is getting boring and repetitive, and a few characters are becoming rather dull. The battle scenes, especially Hans's scuffle by the Ebro, were slow moving and confusing, and maps would have been somewhat helpful. Jurak's actions towards Ha'ark at the end of the book were predictable-- it's already happened a couple times in this series. No shocker there. The only real exciting parts in the book were the opening and the free-for-all in the Temple of Venus. Band of Brothers, I'm sorry to say, is one of my least favorite entries in the Lost Regiment series, and now that I begin Men of War, I'm hoping for much better from Mr. Forstchen."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"Forstchen continues building this excellent series, his own academic interests in military and technological history, and the American Civil War coming to the fore, in which a stranded Union regeiment bootstraps both a medieval Russian and a clasical Roman society into the 19th century and beyond...This book, the seventh in the series, is not quite as good as its prequels, if only because it is too short. Forstchen zips along the story at a fair clip, and tells it well, but still does this brevity mean that the author is becoming bored with his own tale? This is evident in that there are leaps in the story, which are not that jarring, but irritating all the same.Otherwise, there is little to complain about. Forstchen's characterisation and technological description remains solid, but some of the actions that characters take do seem to come out of left field and are a little unexpected.As a whole this series remains still relatively unexplored. Forstchen has concentrated upon one area of this world, so there could yet be a lot of stories beyond this. I for one would like to see this. Two areas that continue to let this series down are the lack of maps and also of a timeline - the seven books cover ten years of history and it can be difficult to place which event happens where and when... One other complaint is the inability to get these books in the UK at anything other than specialist dealers!Further, it might be interesting to see this setting developed in other media - a computer game or role-playing supplement perhaps?In summary, if you liked the rest of this series, you will enjoy this latest addition."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"Book 7 of the Lost Regiment series stays true to form. The Bantag horde, led by Haark the Redeemer is closing in on Roum.The transplanted Yankees, led by Civil War Colonel Andrew Keane have been on this alternative Earth for ten years. Under the very real threat of being killed and eaten by Merki warriors, the humans have advanced 50 to 75 years in military technology in only ten years and three wars.They have tanks (land ironclads), hybrid blimp/airplanes, hand grenades, and hollow charge anti-tank rockets. Fortchen does a good job of showing the difficulties of using these new weapons effectively. He also spends a lot of time on logistics, weather, morale, etc.My only complaint is that the book is too short at only 315 pages. I finished it in less than a day, and now I have to wait too long for the next installment."},{"Title":"A Band of Brothers (The Lost Regiment #7)","review":"I looked forward to Band of Brothers, preordering the book.

That is missing from this book. Still, I think it is better than book #6 and it moves the story forward.

Even some of the names are getting mushed from one book to the next. Still, it is a great book and a great series. I would advise someone to start with the first one before this one though.

Buffy Summers arrives in Sunnydale and discovers not only a new Watcher and new friends, but a Master Vampire just begging to be slayed. Then there is that mysterious dark stranger named Angel. The first ten chapters of the novel cover Episode 1 &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth,&quot; with the rest of the book covering Episode 2, &quot;The Harvest,&quot; which is just fine since it really is just one giant story. Of course, this is just the beginning, and fortunately the complete first season of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is out on DVD so that you can find out the rest of the Master story arc.Since Cusick's did the novelization of the original Buffy film he was obviously the ideal writer for this initial Buffy television book and he does an adequate job. If you read the film novelization it is fascinating to see how the Buffy idea was revamped for the television series. In addition to toning down the film's camp comedy style, Buffy is given a much better supporting cast with the Scooby gang, an elegant counterpoint with Giles the new Watcher, and a vampire with a soul for the character twist that would give the show its greatest pathos. The various chronicles collected under the names of the characters (Angel, Xander, Willow, et al.) continued to provide adaptations of the show's episodes, these chronicles are neither chronologically organized nor complete, but they are interesting on their own terms."},{"Title":"Gates Book Catalog (Cancelli)","review":"I must have mis-understood what this book was.

He remains an objective observer and paints a picture of the development of an often cold literary statesman who finds it difficult to form personal relationships. Prater does not dwell on the genesis of Mann's literary production despite his insistence that Mann was not principally a political writer but an artist. Instead he gives a long-winded account of Mann's travels throughout Europe and America, his departure from Nazi Germany and naturalisation in the USA. The latter section of the text is larded with references to meetings with his children and other literary figures in the USA which do little to aid the reading of Mann's major works of fiction. The author is at pains to justify Mann's behaviour after the Second World War and emphasise his disgust for Nazism and anti-Semitic thought. Despite being a detailed and carefully researched manuscript, he text is not an inspiring exploration of Mann's life and work and often verges on the tedious. It will be an invaluable companion to the research student who wishes to verify precise details in the history of Thomas Mann, but as a companion to the study of Mann's oeuvre it is not successful. A superior guide must always be TJ Reed's 'The Uses of Tradition' which, after 25 years, continues to be the best English Language companion to the life and works of Thomas Mann, providing intelligent interpretation and valuable insight into the biography of the writer."},{"Title":"Thomas Mann: A Life","review":"Found this today at the annual library sale for $1 and now that I have read the reviews on Amazon I am anxious to read it."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"Title: George Whitefield, Vol. 2Author: Arnold DallimoreFirst Copy Right: 1970Type of Book: HardbackGeneral Subject: BiographicalPrice: $29.57ISBN: 978-0-85151-026-2The purpose of Volume Two is to trace the period of 1741-1770. This period covers the doctrinal conflict of Whitefield with the Wesleys and the serious division within the Methodist rank and file. This volume also includes Whitefield's marriage and death of his son in infancy.The theme and thesis remain the same in this volume as it was in volume one. Dallimore continues to develop both his theme and thesis by his in depth narration of the salient events in the life of Whitefield in a chronological order. Dallimore is a master story teller and relates these events in Whitefield's life in such a way that holds the attention of the reader.Again, Volume Two is an extremely interesting book, painstakingly researched, and accurate presented. Volume Two is just as important as Volume One was. Volume Two completes the life and ministry of this great man of God. It is just as complementative to Volume One as Eve was to Adam.In Volume One Dallimore recorded for us the beginnings of doctrinal differences between Wesley (John) and Whitefield. Volume Two opens with the actual differences that brought about the controversy and the separation. Volume two continues with the story of the ministry of Whitefield in England, Scotland, and New England.Another topic with Dallimore handles with care and detail is the event known as \\"The Great Awakening.\\" Dallimore details the effect of the \\"awakening,\\" the problems that developed from it, and the general attitude of those contemporary with the revival.The value of Volume Two lies in the summary Dallimore gives of the inner man of George Whitefield. Dallimore entitles this summary and final chapter, \\"The Measure of the Man.\\" Dallimore has not been content with just telling us the outward actions of Whitefield, but he wants us to know him through his motives, aims, and desires. This gives the reader a healthy look into the heart and soul of this man. Dallimore is not afraid to share with us the faults of Whitefield. As Dallimore summarizes Whitefield it is not just a one sided summary of all of his good points and accomplishments.Dallimore includes in this summary of Whitefield the question of \\"What is Whitefield's place upon the field of history? Dallimore supplies three well thought out answers to this question.Volume Two includes an extensive bibliography and index. It also contains footnotes throughout the entire volume.George Whitefield is a massive two volume, 1135 page biography of one of the greatest men of God to have ever lived. Dallimore has done an excellent job in trying to define, describe, and develop this great man of God. I highly recommend this biography to any true student of the word, of mankind, of God, and of the work of God in the awakening of dead sinners to the newness of life."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"After spending more than 1200 pages with a man, you feel like you know him quite well. Dallimore has set the standard for me as I read biographers and I would venture to guess that this book has permanently shaped my expectations as to the detail with which an author seeking to write the definitive biography, should write with. Dallimore shines in the details. I think that I read somewhere that he spent 30 years in preparation for this work and if that is true, I'd believe it. He seems to have read every imaginable primary and secondary source and brought in so much evidence for his arguments that this work will likely never be topped. I feel like I went with Whitefield on every single ministry circuit, read every one of his letters, and knew each one of his friends. Dallimore's contribution is remarkable.The danger in reading the biographies of such extraordinary humans is discouragement. Whitefield is probably the most extraordinary man I've ever heard of. His unique ministerial gifts, his gospel energy, and the holiness of his life make him feel superhuman to me and I find it quite difficult to relate to him. I attribute most of this simply to the fact that God gifted him in extraordinary ways. Yet, I also direct a modest portion of blame towards the author. My largest disappointment with this work is that though the author acknowledged numerous faults possessed by Whitefield, it often felt as if he did it only out of obligation. On pp 519-20 of vol. II Dallimore briefly summarizes 6 of Whitefield's faults but it felt disproportional to me. After 1200 pages of admiration, I'd suggest that the credibility of this work would be bolstered if at least 5% of the space had been given to a consideration of his faults. In particular, I was troubled by Whitefield's neglect of his wife and felt that many of his life's troubles came from overextending himself in ministry. I'm really surprised that the latter concern was not addressed as the author cites countless of accounts of how his friends seemed to share my concern.However, these criticisms should not detract much from this work. To borrow a common assessment of Whitefield, the weaknesses of Dallimore's work are like 'spots on the sun,' thus hardly noticeable. The power of this work, like any decent biography is the opportunity it provides not only for education for historical events such as the Great Awakening, or the Whitefield v. Wesley controversy, but also for personal reflection. It would be far too ambitious of a task for me to attempt to account for the numerous bits of both large and small wisdom that I gained from observing this man's life.The bottom line is that if you are interested in Whitefield, Wesley, or the Great Awakening this book is indispensable. This is the unrivaled, definitive work on Whitefield's life and should be widely read by pastors, church historians, and aspiring leaders across many denominations. Additionally, I commend Banner of Truth for the quality of this sewn binding. These two books are the best constructed books I own."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"This is the second volume which covers the much publicized controversy between George Whitefield and John Wesley. Two men who shaped the Methodist Movement and were mightily used by God to turn the world upside down. The work that George Whitefield did to open up the gospel to people that had not heard is to this day not equaled. This was the \\"prince of preachers of the 18th century.\\" The only other to earn that esteemed title would come some hundred years later, C.H. Spurgeon.

The second volume has some very interesting chapters on Whitefield's impact on history and the measure of the man. Although, it may be argued that he started Methodism, the Wesleys are more associated with that denomination. Whitefield concentrated on his preaching and stepped down from leadership roles. In spite of that decision, he was crucial in starting two universities in North America (Princeton and Dartmouth). He was instrumental in the spiritual awakening on both sides of the Atlantic. He started open air preaching and shook up the Church of England from its slumbers. He preached the Gospel until literally his breath gave out. No matter what you think of his doctrine or decisions, you have to respect his dedication. His death is well written in this volume and it is a painful read for an asthmatic.These volumes should be read by all preachers so they can learn from both the wisdom and folly of Whitefield."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"DALLIMORE'S TREATMENT OF WHITEFIELD IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP IN ITS SCOPE.

Dallimore writes well, if only he wouldn't use direct quotes so much it'd shine through more clearly. It was sometimes tedious to read though, because he would divert from the main subject quite frequently. Dallimore & any reader of this book certainly will gain a lot of knowledge not just about Whitefield, but about many of his contemporaries. At the same time there was rather limited broad historical context. My chief complaint is still that Dallimore thrusts too much upon the reader his own very high opinion of Whitefield. I don't think Whitefield needs Dallimore to tell us that he was a great man - his life speaks well enough on its own (in many ways). At the same time, Whitefield had some major flaws - chiefly in his marital conduct it seems (not providing well) - but this gets scant notice. Even errors Dallimore admits are brushed aside largely, which is a shame, because it's far too easy to become discouraged when a biographer paints a too rosy picture of a man: how can I compare?? For a time as I read this, I questioned whether or not it was Whitefield or God that was popular - as it seemed that his works fell apart whenever he was on the other side of the Atlantic. As he settled into a ministry in England, more steadily, I felt like there was less of that perhaps \\"personality\\" draw & more work of the Spirit. Of course, this is just my sense from this one biography & it certain is no dis-credit to the instrument that it is fine or that people love to hear it; I just struggled for a while with the question of who (in the listeners' minds) was the chief delight. I haven't seen Dallimore's more recent single volume work, but if, on flipping through it, I found fewer \\"rabbit trails\\" & much less direct quotations (including an entire page of Lord's & Lady's names!!) I'm sure it would be a much finer work."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"Few believers have inspired me as much as George Whitefield. This is not surprising in light of C.H. Spurgeon's description of the man who led the Great Awakening in the 18th century:\\"There is no end to the interest which attaches to such a man as George Whitefield. Often as I have read his life, I am conscious of distinct quickening whenever I turn to it. He lived. Other men seem to be only half alive; but Whitefield was all life, fire, wing, force. My own model, if I may have such a thing in due subordination to my Lord, is George Whitefield; but with unequal footsteps must I follow in his glorious track.\\"What follows are some reasons why I have been so encouraged by, in the words of Martyn Lloyd-Jones, the greatest preacher that England has ever produced, or as David Hume stated, \\"the most ingenious preacher I ever heard; it is worth going twenty miles to hear him.\\"Upon conversion in college, George Whitefield daily visited and ministered to convicts in prison where it was reported the guard dogs feared to enter into because of the fierce rats that infested the place. At age 24, he was preaching to crowds twenty to thirty thousand in attendance often in open fields without the aid of amplifying devices. On average he was preaching forty to sixty hours a week and at the end of thirty years he had preached nearly forty thousand sermons. This schedule took its toll on his health, and after sermons he often had to spit out great amounts of blood due to the blood vessels that had burst in his vocal chords from the strain of having to speak to so large an audience for so long a period.Though by far the most famous man of his age, speaking regularly to the nobility of England as well as to commoners, slaves in America, and children, Whitefield enjoyed as his favorite meal a cow's heel in keeping with his personal motto, \\"Poor, yet making others rich.\\" An associate mentioned that during the year that he was with him Whitefield slept three or four hours a day and in lieu of sleep was counseling, writing encouraging letters, and on his knees while praying and studying the Bible. Whitefield himself recorded in his diary that one night the Lord's glory had shown upon him to such a degree and for such a length that he had asked God to shield him from His glory so that he could get some rest.Though slandered by John Wesley for upholding Calvinist doctrines and by many clergy of the established church for his zeal and popularity, Whitefield did not respond in kind but gave up to him and others his various societies and buildings and even the denomination known as Methodism - all of which he had founded - in order to avoid hindering the movement of God that had taken England and the Colonies by storm of which he was principally credited. The fact that 99% of believers today in America have no knowledge of George Whitefield is a testimony to the man's uncommon humility and desire that the name of Whitefield perish so long as Christ's name was lifted high.During his evangelistic outreaches, mobs would sometimes disrupt the sermon by beating the crowd and throwing eggs and dirt at Whitefield. Children with tears in their eyes would often try to shield him from the thrown objects, wishing they could receive the blows for him. One coal-mining town whose inhabitants often raided neighboring places greeted Whitefield with equal animosity. But they were soon drawn to his preaching, and it was reported that a mass of coal-stained faces had streams of water flowing from their eyes. It was observed that Whitefield rarely preached a sermon in which he himself had not wept. What came to be known as the Great Awakening was in large part stirred by the compassionate preaching of George Whitefield. When the flame was dying down in Jonathan Edwards' own church, Whitefield preached there and Edwards himself was moved to tears.The Great Evangelist made six Atlantic voyages to America which were often treacherous. During one of his trips, Whitefield ministered to the crew and passengers amidst a particularly terrible voyage such that by the end of the trip, most of the heathen crew had been converted and regular services on deck were conducted. Ministry for Whitefield was his life, not an occupation with a set time and place to \\"do mission work.\\"Whitefield's integrity, though often maligned by jealous clergy and opponents to his religious fervor, was attested to by none other than Benjamin Franklin, who published Whitefield's journals and financially supported his work for the establishment of the first house of charity in America where orphans could be raised and educated.To read the biography of George Whitefield is to read the life of a saint, a man who loved God with all his heart, soul and mind. May God inspire more Whitefields in our generation."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"Well, I finally saved up the money and sprung for this two-volume full-length account of the life of George Whitefield.

I can honestly say this is one of the best investments I've ever made.

I had to wait an extra few months to recieve the first volume before I could begin reading either. Each volume is about 600 pages in length and is chock full of stories, information and insightful commentary. Dallimore does not spare the details of the lives of those closest to Whitfield--including John Cennick, Howell Harris, Jonathan Edwards, and of course John and Charles Wesley. This second volume deals with the period of time from Whitefield's return to England in the wake of Wesley's controversial ministry, his reconciliation with the Wesleys and continued work in both England and America, and finally his death.The Subject Matter: Wow. Simply wow. I mean--who knew? I'd always heard that John Wesley was the sole founder of Methodism. In fact, the only thing I knew about George Whitefield was that he was attributed with a few neat quotes (ie. \\"Let the name of Whitefield perish, but Christ be glorified!\\", \\"I am weary in Thy work, but not weary of it\\", etc.) and that he once spoke at Jonathan Edwards' Northhampton church (at which time he left Edwards in tears). I fully expect that if it were not for this work of Dallimore, the name of Whitefield truly would be lost to persons such as myself. What I expected was another (Calvinistic) Wesley. What I found was a man whose zeal, love, holiness of life and passion for Christ seemed to equal even those I hold in highest regard (among whom are Martin Luther and Charles Spurgeon). Whitefield was a tireless worker for God and his zeal for the gospel was only matched by his selfless compassion for his fellow man. He was the first of the great open-air preachers and nudged both John and Charles Wesley into evangelistic ministry. Whitefield's life is a beautiful illustration of Christian ministry and evangelistic zeal. I cannot recommend this man highly enough.The Author: Dallimore was a Baptist pastor and semi-prolific biographer. This two-volume biography of George Whitefield is truly Dallimore's magnum opus. He has delved deeper into the mind and heart of this great evangelist than any of his previous biographers. It is both informative and inspirational. No space feels wasted despite the length of the account and the multitudinous strands of the storyline are brought together in a masterful way.The Reader: Who should read this book? I would recommend it most highly to pastors and other evangelical Christians whose zeal for God and spiritual wells have begun to run dry. Evangelical Calvinistic Christians will get the greatest benefit from this read. But it may also prove of great interest to those of the Methodist heritage. Also, all who are called to the ministry of evangelism (teaching and preaching) could not but benefit from this work. Whitefield's zeal is contagious and his meekness humbling. The mere historian might enjoy the factual aspects of the book, but it was written from a distinctively evangelical Christian perspective.\\"Weary in Thy work, but not weary of it.\\" -G.

II of this extraordinary work. He was pastoring Immanuel Baptist Church, Windsor, Ontario, and I had the good privelige of assisting him in that work for several years. My wife Marsha helped by typing the manuscripts as he finished them long hand. I was fortunate to get a sneak preview and discuss with Dr. Dallimore the writing. These two volumes and my time spent with the author changed my views of ministry and the work of God considerably. You cannot read this work without developing a deeper sense of the wonder and majesty of God as displayed during extraordinary times of refreshing in the church. The main character of course is Whitfield, the subject is the revivals of his times but the lessons learned go far beyond mere historical studies. Great lessons of spiritual discipline are conveyed through the eyes of wise Dr. Dallimore. If you are a Pastor or aspire to be one and haven't read this you must! It will change your ministry. Dr. Dallimore, was not only an author but a sincere Minister of the Word, and his works deserve to be read by the Church for ages to come."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"In place of my Bible, no other books in my library have my heart like Dr. Dallimore's two volume biography on the Rev. George Whitefield. Dr. Dallimore spent 10 years writing the first volume. The demand from all over the world to have a second volume prompted Dr. Dallimore to resign his pastorate of over 20 years and proceed to spend the next 15 years writing the sequel. It is a masterpiece.He travelled to England five times in his research and is known around the world as the Whitefieldian expert. Dr. Dallimore was 86 years old when he died on March 20, 1998, in Cottam, Ontario, Canada. I had the blessed opportunity of meeting Dr. Dallimore and his dear wife, May, on two occasions late in 1997. Every Christian ought to have all of Dr. Dallimore's books on their bookshelf, but especially &quot;George Whitefield.&quot; Reading these books was like talking with a good friend.Paul Miller 11/9/98"},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"Few recent books have so wide and so deep an impact as Arnold Dallimore's magisterial biography of George Whitefield. The first volume, stretching from Whitefield's birth in 1714 to his section visit to American in 1740 was published in 1970 and has since been reprinted six times. The second volume, which stretches from 1740 until Whitefield's death in 1770, was published ten years later in 1980. It has been reprinted three times. Together the volumes comprise some 1200 pages of detailed biography. Rarely have I had a biography recommended to me by so many and by men of such distinction. Rarely have I benefited more from reading about another man's life.I have noticed a strange phenomenon with this biography. Where most books of this one's scope and impact have been widely and thoroughly reviewed, this one seems to be an exception. As I attempted to write a review I may have found out why this is: it is very difficult to adequately sum up so much content in just a few words. And, as with any biography, it is difficult to measure and summarize the impact of such a book. Instead I am left doing what others have done--writing thoughts on the book that somehow seem disconnected and inadequate. Even Gary Gilley, a reviewer who is rarely lost for words, can write no more than this: \\"It would be difficult to lavish too much praise on Dallimore's two volume biography of the famous eighteenth century evangelist George Whitefield. This is the definitive work of Whitefield's life and ministry, dispelling many misconceptions while showing the true character and impact of this most remarkable man. Along the way the reader also receives valuable insight into the lives of the Wesleys, Jonathan Edwards and the Moravians. This is one of the greatest biographies ever written.\\"The Foreword to the first volume is supplied by no one less than Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones. The Doctor suggests that he waited decades to find a thorough and authoritative biography of Whitefield, a man he regarded as a historical hero. This book, he felt, which appeared on the bi-centenary of Whitefield's death, achieves the excellence Lloyd-Jones knew had long been missing. Reflecting on the life of the subject he writes \\"May the reading of this book produce in us the same spirit of utter submission, ready obedience, and unshakeable reliance upon the power of the Holy Spirit that characterized his life and ministry. Whitefield never drew attention to himself but always pointed people to his God and exalted his Lord and Savior. May he, though now dead for nearly 200 years, do the same for countless thousands through the reading of this book!\\" The intervening years, almost forty of them, have shown this to be the case.This book's subtitle, The life and times of the great evangelist of the 18th century revival, is important in understanding the book. Whitefield found himself one of the sparks of the the Great Awakening and the revival of the 18th century. While other men played important roles, Whitefield was the pin at the center of the wheel. His tireless itinerancy took his preaching ministry to almost every corner of the United Kingdom and to almost the whole of the settled portion of the United States. But for illness he would also have extended his ministry to Canada. Perhaps one of this book's greatest contributions is in helping people separate the life and contributions of George Whitefield from those of John Wesley--a man who Whitefield always loved but who so often opposed him. This biographies shows conclusively that it was Whitefield's ministry that sparked the awakening.I was grateful to see that Dallimore deals fairly with Whitefield's shortcomings in these volumes. This is no hagiography--worship of a saint that is free from difficult examinations of the subject's failings. Though Dallimore has to confess that he finds surprisingly little fault with the man, he deals frankly and forthrightly with those areas in which Whitefield showed immaturity, poor judgment or poor discernment. He questions Whitefield's decision to marry and the unusual circumstances surrounding his first rejected proposal of marriage. He does not shy from discussing Whitefield's role in justifying and even promoting slavery in the colonies. He does not allow the passing of the years or his deep respect for his subject to mislead him or to excuse sin. Experience shows that this quality is surprisingly rare in such biographies.Eminently readable despite its length and depth, this biography only reinforces my belief that biographies can be among the greatest catalysts to spiritual growth. It is a classic and one that takes its place among my favorite biographies along with such great titles as Marsden's Jonathan Edwards and Dallimore's own Spurgeon. It will prove valuable to pastors or evangelists as they see the example of a man who labored tirelessly for the gospel; it will prove valuable to all Christians as they see the example of a man who labored tirelessly to grow even and ever closer to his Savior. Whitefield is a man who stands as an example to all of us. Dallimore has done us a great service in opening up to us the life of this great man of God.Together these two volumes represent a financial investment that is not insignificant. Purchased together they are likely to cost at least sixty or seventy dollars. But I can testify, as can a long list of people of far greater wisdom and discernment than I, that they are well worth the investment."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"\\"Justice has at last been done to the greatest preacher that England every produced.\\" This was the judgment of Martyn Lloyd-Jones concerning the first volume of Arnold Dallimore's biography of George Whitefield. This is perhaps the most authoritative work to date on the life of Whitefield, surpassing the older work of Luke Tyreman in both breadth (since Dallimore had access to far more material than Tyreman) and objectivity (Tyreman was a Wesleyan who was somewhat unsympathetic with Whitefield's theology).The two volumes together are divided into eight parts, which help give some navigation to understanding Whitefield's life. The sections are: (Volume 1): I. The Years of Preparation; II. The Youthful Ministry; III. The Period of Transition; (Volume 2): IV. The Controversy; V. The Calvinist Evangelist of Two Continents; VI. The Helper of all the Revival; VII. The Years of Failing Strength; and VIII. Death and Commemoration.Volume 1 traces Whitefield's life from birth to conversion through the early years of the Great Awakening which came under his preaching in England, Wales, and the Colonies of North America. It is full of details about his travels, excerpts from sermons and journals, and is exceptionally well documented. Special attention is rightfully given to Whitefield's relationship with John Wesley, and several mistaken notions concerning the two men are corrected with careful research supporting the conclusions.The second volume begins with an introduction that gives more attention to the mistaken conceptions about Whitefield's relationship with the Wesleys. Chapter one then steers the reader back into the narrative, picking up where volume 1 left off with Whitefield's return to England from America in 1739. Several chapters are then devoted to the controversy between the Whitefield and Wesley. A broad-brush coverage is given to Whitefield's work in both Great Britain and America, with occasional detours detailing events such as the Cambuslang Revival and the contributions of other prominent figures in the revival such Howell Harris and John Cennick.Dallimore writes with an obvious admiration and appreciation for Whitefield, yet he does not whitewash his faults. Whitefield's respectable, though less than ideal marriage to the widow, Elizabeth James (who had also been courted by Howell Harris - an interesting love-triangle there!) is discussed, as well has the enormous load of debt he carried for the Orphan House founded in Georgia. While there was nothing in Whitefield's life to tarnish his integrity, his humanity is clearly evident in more than one instance.The interest and usefulness of this excellent biography is enhanced by the thorough index (at the end of volume 2), thirteen appendices (six in volume 1, seven in volume 2), thorough documentation (with hundreds - maybe thousands - of footnotes), nine-page bibliography (volume 2) and over sixty illustrations.But the true value of the two volumes lies in their soul-stirring account of the great work of God in and through Whitefield's life. A Christian could hardly ask for more delightful reading. To quote Lloyd-Jones again, \\"To read the wonderful story of his life is to be reminded again of what is possible to a truly consecrated Christian, and how even in the darkest and most sinful ages God in His sovereign power is able to revive His work and shower blessings upon His people.\\""},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"Volume 2 is as good as Volume 1. After reading volume 1, I wondered what more could be said about George Whitefield. The author is very thorough in his coverage of the G.W. And there is so much to tell. I felt I was reading a story about 3 or 4 men, it was so much.My favorite story in these books is an incident that shows his generosity. One day G.W. came upon a poor person in need and so he gave the person some money. It bothered his friend that was traveling with him that it was too much to give and he told G.W. about it. G.W.'s response was that the person was in obvious need, and why should he not be generous. A little later G.W. was robbed and G.W. said he was glad that the poor person got the money rather than the thief. A little later, the thief came back and demanded G.W.'s coat and left him his old ragged coat. It wasn't long and the thief came back again running wildly after them. G.W. and his friend ran, thinking the man was going to kill them. They were able to get to a house and away from the thief. When G.W. took off the thief's old ragged coat, inside he found a bag of money that was much larger than G.W. had started with. We would call this irony, but to G.W. it was like the Lord had rewarded him for his generosity to the poor person. He was able to bless the poor person and still come out ahead.I was impressed at the ability of G.W. to preach over 18,000 sermons in his lifetime. His travels on a horse, a 2 wheel buggy, or a carriage for 1,000's of miles is incredible. His vision of all the places where he wanted to go and preach was never ending. What seemed to others as chaos was really G.W.'s well organized itinerary to reach as many as he could. He did have a plan.I was impressed at the kindness of G.W. when dealing with other men and women, especially those who were not very nice to him. The author does a good job at showing the relationship between G.W. and the Wesleys as it started, became strained, was partially mended, strained again, and finally restored. But this mending and restoring was due in large part to G.W. His ability to keep a level head was not always easy, but he comes through so many times. People noticed the special noncritical spirit about G.W. and they noticed how helpful it was for the revival and ministry. He was able to stay above the pettiness of others and keep focused on his mission. He was not easily offended and did not seem to hold a grudge when wronged.I was impressed at the way G.W. could write to Benjamin Franklin and share the gospel. He made it plain that he wanted B.F to experience the new birth. G.W. was constantly trying to build a bridge to B.F.'s heart to allow Jesus to walk over. Sadly B.F. never did become a Christian. But G.W. was faithful. This is a good example for us, even today. I felt like G.W. was a real person. He rejoiced with B.F. on his knowledge of electricity, but then would encouraged him to understand something even greater - the new birth. His correspondence with B.F. is inspiring.I think that it was obvious that people really, really liked G.W. He rubbed elbows with many of the greats of his day, but was equally received and liked by children.This is a lot to read, but I am glad that I have taken the time getting to know the life of George Whitefield. This material is straight out of the 100's of letters and correspondences that G.W. received and sent and is not just the author's biased feelings. Very historical."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"This second volume continues to display the immensity of the breadth and lasting influence of Whitefield's ministry in England, Scotland, Wales and America, and the astronomical number of his crowd. Benjamin Franklin remarked on the effect of Whitefield's preaching that \\"it seemed as if all the world were growing religious\\" (p.441). In addition, there are also more exposures on Whitefield's personal side. Here we learn about his marriage, the lifestyle he and his wife adopted as a married couple, his outreach to the nobles; particularly in England, and how he handled bitter oppositions and criticism with grace, even from some of his closest fellow laborers; John and Charles Wesley. John Wesley started \\"the flames of controversy\\" by publishing his Arminian sermon \\"Free Grace\\" and continued to attack the Calvinist Methodists with harsh and uncharitable words. Howell Harris, one of Whitefield's closest associates in Wales, describes it in this way,\\"John Wesley... by his rash and inconsiderate speeches he has not only grieved the hearts of God's people, but has given occasion for the enemies of the Lord to rejoice\\" (p.33).Whitefield refuted Wesley's objections against Calvinism in truth and meekness, in the spirit of 1 Pet 3:15-16 without any slight hint of resentment, bitterness, anger, hatred, or retaliation (p.551-569). And the surprising fact is, despite the firmness in defending what he thought to be true, Whitefield treated the Wesleys as \\"These dear, dear old friends, whom I still love as my own soul,\\" and his affection toward them was described as \\"remain as warm as ever\\" (p.44). This charitable spirit is one crucial lesson every Christian from all denominations ought to learn from. Instead of deciding to form his own Whitefieldian denomination in opposition to the Wesleyans, he decided to work together not only with the Wesleys, but also other denominations he came in contact with according to his resolution to be \\"the servant of all.\\" With this attitude, Whitefield shouldn't be mistaken as a man-pleaser, however, because in calling himself the servant of all, he did not compromise his doctrinal conviction. It means Whitefield did not become an Arminian when he preached to the Wesleyans or a Baptist when he preached to Baptists, but he hanged on to the doctrines of grace resulting from the study of Scriptures, his reading of Reformed and Puritan authors, and also from the influence of the many men of Calvinistic beliefs he had met in America (p.43). His principle can be summarized as follows,\\"My heart does not reproach me, for my kindness and friendship with those that differ from me. I think I have been led by the Word and Spirit of God into this part of my conduct... I cannot renounce those precious truths that I have felt the power of, and which were taught me not of man, but of God. At the same time, I would love all that love Jesus, though they differ from me in some points\\" (p.76).\\"Let my name die everywhere, let even my friends forget me, if by that means the cause of the blessed Jesus may be promoted. I want to bring souls, not to a party... but to a sense of their undone condition by nature, and to true faith in Jesus Christ. But what is Calvin, or what is Luther? Let us look above names and parties; let Jesus be our all in all - so that He be preached... I care not who is uppermost. I know my place... even to be the servant of all. I want not to have a people called after my name\\" (p.258).\\"I would love all that love Jesus, though they differ from me in some points\\" What! This is so unlike, so uncharacteristic of today's Western Reformed Culture I am familiar with. I thought I am supposed to despise, belittle, make fun of those who disagree with me and vehemently fight to prove I am right and they are wrong if they are not Calvinists, or if they are not Cessationists, or if they are not Paedobaptists? I have to say I shouldn't generalize this tendency, but I believe Whitefield is right. I am glad he wrote it. I have to agree with him. O that my attitude be rectified and be made like his. O that I may learn to be a kind Calvinist...Whitefield's marriage with Elizabeth James shows the bitter sweet reality of marriage of a true minister of the gospel, who didn't work for money or his family or personal fame (\\"Let my name be forgotten, let me be trodden under the feet of all men, if Jesus may thereby be glorified, p.257), but for his Master. It was not the Cinderella happily-ever-after one that many dream of, but one filled with intense longings caused by a prolonged inter-continental separation due to ministerial work, the death of an infant child because of an inadequate fund to secure a warm travel through the winter, and other miscarriages. This is where one would hesitate if Whitefield was being irresponsible, specifically in the death of his first son, by spending too much of his time and energy on travel, preaching, charitable and ecclesiastical work while neglecting his family altogether. But on the other hand, Elizabeth James proved herself to be a woman of virtue, gladly, humbly and fully submissive to God's providence and an excellent helper to her husband till death did they part.Another stunningly sobering yet happy account unique to this second volume is the account of his early 1742 evangelistic effort in Moorfield where he met with so intense of an abuse from the crowd that he \\"narrowly escaped\\" with his life. Here is a representative description of the kind of crowd Whitefield had to deal with as well as the breadth of his outreach that had a profound influence on children as well,\\"... Several little boys and girls who were fond of sitting round me on the pulpit while I preached, and handing to me people's notes, though they were often pelted with eggs, dirt etc thrown at me, never once gave way; but on the contrary, every time I was struck, turned up their little weeping eyes, and seemed to wish they could receive the blows for me\\" (p.118).The outreach to the upper-class in England is no less stunning. Here we learn about the noble character of Selina Hesting, the Countess of Huntingdon, converted under Whitefield's ministry, and who turned out to be God's instrument to connect him to the Dukes and Duchess, Lords, Earls, Sirs, and Marquis, Field Marshall and Secretary of State in England, Scotland and Wales; in short, \\"a glittering array of the great and rich,\\" so that he may carry the gospel to them through the gatherings she held in her home. She has much to commend as an assistant of Whitefield's work in \\"laboring in prayer, exercising her personal witness and using her wealth and influence to the fullest extent possible in the furtherance of the Gospel. Whatever she had formerly admired and pursued, she now voluntarily laid at the feet of her Lord; and dedicated her time, her studies, her acquisitions and her substance to the service of God... desiring at once to present him with her whole being, a living sacrifice, expressive of her entire devotion\\" (p.263).Whitefield was someone who could barely say no to the requests and popular demands to preach that kept coming to him like a flood. Only when he was ill; a condition that he struggled with more and more as he aged, he reduced his preaching activity from two or three times a day to four or five times a week. The day when he died, he preached once at noon and once in the evening. He was about ready to rest after dinner when the street in front of the house he lodged at that night was filled with people begging him to preach. Here is the account of his last moments,\\"Unwilling, despite his weariness, to forego any opportunity to declare the Gospel, he responded to the request and stood on the landing, halfway up the stairs, candle in hand, preaching Christ. He was soon greatly alive to his subject and becoming heedless of time he continued to speak, till finally, the candle flickered, burned itself out and died away. That dying flame and that burned-out candle were representative that evening of the man himself and of his life\\" (p. 504).I don't think it is an exaggeration to describe this two volume set of biography as the happiest biography I have ever read. It has a humbling, sobering yet joyful effect that still lingers with me and I hope to linger for a long time so I can continue to relish the reminiscence of it with the hope someday if the Lord wills it, I could be a part of such a blessed labor of an evangelist and such great of a revival."},{"Title":"George Whitefield: The Life and Times of the Great Evangelist of the Eighteenth Century - Volume II","review":"Charles Spurgeon said, \\"There is no end to the interest which attaches to such a man as George Whitefield. Often as I have read his life, I am conscious of distinct quickening whenever I turn to it. He LIVED. Other men seem to be only half alive; but Whitefield was all life, fire, wing, force. My own model, if I may have such a thing in due subordination to my Lord, is George Whitefield; but with unequal footsteps must I follow in his glorious track.\\"Vol. 2 picks up with Whitefield returning to England from America, to raise funds for his orphanage in Georgia, and to deal with the growing breach with Wesley. It covers the years from 1741-70. Dallimore starts the book with an overview and assessment of the relationship between Whitefield and Wesley, and a correction of \\"The Common Concept\\" of their relationship. From here, the rest of Whitefield's labors are detailed, in Wales, Scotland, England, and America. His associations with men like Howell Harris, Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Franklin, and Lady Huntingdon are all given attention. This biography gives treatment to the many periphal characters to Whitefield's life, and serves as a history of the entire period, hence, \\"The Life and Times.\\" Where others may find this \\"meandering\\" I found all of it fascinating and was glad for it.In the end, Whitefield wore himself out preaching. He would travel and preach until he had no more strength, rest for a few days, and then go and preach some more. His only real rest was on the ship voyages between England and America. He preached twice the day he died, the last time on the steps on the way up to his room! He really did, \\"in the harness die.\\"I cannot recommend this biography highly enough.

His worldview can be summed up very simply: those who are not incredibly liberal - those who are not completely dismissive of tradition - are ignorant, self-seeking, or corrupt. On the other hand, those who are liberal are seen invariably as enlightened and progressive - the more so the better.Please do not misinterpret this as a negative statement about Blessed John XXIII or the Second Vatican Council. My criticism lies solely with the author, whose Liberal Catholic philosophy is built on a foundation of sand. I would be curious to hear what a truly intelligent scholar like Alasdair MacIntyre would have to say about the straw men Cahill presents page after page.The truth is never determined by majority vote, Thomas.

It is, as the author states on pg. 239 (which is much too late to be helpful), a \\"biographical essay,\\" which apparently means the author is at liberty to insert his own (sometimes lurid) suppositions among the facts he reports. He begins with an unfavorable review of the history of the papacy and doesn't get to John XXIII until page 73. He follows the pope's death with commentary on his successors, again, unfavorable. Other reviewers have commented on the bias the author reveals in his \\"essay\\" so no more about that.What bothers me is how this book is packaged. It proves the adage that you cannot judge a book by it's cover, and the one about a wolf in sheep's clothing. I can't help but wonder at what the humble, truth-loving Pope John XXIII would say in response to this work.For a biography of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, Pope John XXIII, I recommend Patricia Treece's \\"Meet John XXIII\\""},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I am a Catholic and I found this book to be both inspiring and refreshing.

Very refreshing and spiritually enlightening."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I have taught Church History for several years, and have also bought and read everyone of Cahill's books. I have even used his Ireland and Hills books as supporting references in my teachings. They are always well -written and for the most part well researched. This book is no exception to that premise. What I find in this book is a bit more mean-spiritedness than in his prior books. Reporting on the less than spirit-driven, oftimes nefarious actions of popes is not new history, nor unfortunately is it wholly inaccurate. Several authors have made good money from taking Popes to task, and even bashing on occasion. The Church is both human and divine, and despite the human actions done in it's name, the Divine has managed to keep it from cratering through people like John the XXIII not to mention a lot of lesser titled Catholics.But to use terms like &quot;oddball&quot; etc. strikes me that Cahill is offering his own personal view of the Church in general - and that view more from personal anger and his own apparent negative experiences rather than a complete, and as much as can be, a balanced historical perspective.I still rate it at a four-star, because his writing is always enlightening and always enjoyable to read. In this case however, I was more enlightened on Cahill's negative views of the Catholic Church. In this case, it is not so much what is said in the name of history, it is how it is said that can be misleading. A wise man once told me, never read one book on any subject, and particularly any pertaining to history.

Therefore, put aside what you've heard about this guy and read this book."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I wanted to get a look at the pope, but I couldn't see past the chip on Cahill's shoulder. Make no mistake, this book is not primarily about Pope John XXIII (Angelo Roncalli). It is primarily about Cahill's opinion of the papacy as an institution. John just serves as a model for Cahill's ideal. A good half the book is spent bemoaning the shortcomings of other popes.Even once the author gets around to talking about Roncalli's life, he still spends a fair amount of words complaining of the conservative programs of the popes at the given time. It's not until Roncalli becomes pope that the story squarely centers on him, at which point the book actually becomes quite good. If Cahill would have kept his focus on Roncalli throughout, the book would have been much better.I'm a protestant, so I have no particular love for the idea of the papacy, but I was distinctly turned off by the scornful, condescending tone that Cahill takes toward even the idea of orthodoxy. In short, there's just too much of the author in this book."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I discovered the author on the wonderful world of C-Span where one find authors not invited to Letterman, et all.Thought now retired, I am still a slow reader-- and thus liked the brevity of Cahill's book. A still \\"recovering\\" Catholic, I wss enchanted with the story of John XXIII. Whatever the current Vatican may do, I regard him as saintly. Cahill's bio may be brief, but one gets a clear picture of a boy from a poor but devout rural Italian family. His pastor is well described, who was a lovig mentor. One sees this boy become the man Angelo Rancalli. And beyond as a priest he finds leaders who---it seems to me--- practice what they preach. At the same time Angelo manages to survive and become a leader, with no loss of integrity--in times of repression.His success in helping Jews escape the Nazis is touched on, as well as the dramatic way he changed elements of anti-semitic liturgy.This was a radical man--- in the best sense of the word. As I learned from the nuns years ago, Jesus was a true radical.Cahill give us a history of the Church before and after John XXIII. At times witty, caustic, but clearly fond of this remarkable man."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I read all of the reviews here and then bought the book. I wasn't all that familiar with papal history and found that interesting. Still, it is one person's opinion and little space for such a huge undertaking. It's utility is that it helps to frame John XXIII's life. And obviously, that is what we want to learn about. Unfortunately, I feel we didn't spend much time with the pope and walk away feeling like we glimpsed him from a distance. Cahill's opinions abound, and he uses strong language in conveying them. Like a couple of reviewers, I feel that Cahill wanted to send a message about the Church and used this book as the vehicle. That's OK. I would not have minded a longer work with more evidence and analysis to provide an overview of the papacy or the Church in general. For me, John XXIII was someone I wanted to get to know more about. This book could have given me more. Still, while I feel this is a deficit, I still think this book is very much worth reading and recommend it...for the history, occasionally jarring opinions, and truncated bio.John XXIII was one of the rarest of humans...a gentle, loving and merciful soul who touched the world in ways that will long be remembered. One can't help but wish for more time with him. Let us hope that we do not wait another age for another like him."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"This is a short biographical essay on John XXIII sandwiched between pages and pages of anti-papal screed and pseudo-history. I have read all of the author's \\"Hinges of History\\" series, but will read him no more; Mr. Cahill's bias and cant are a barrier to the necessary trust between author and reader. Here's the book in a nutshell: reforming/liberal popes = good, conservative/traditional popes = bad. I am exaggerating only a little in my encapsulation! The author frequently substitutes assertion for argument, particularly in regard to the last pope, John Paul II. After re-reading the book, I am still unsure what it is that the author dislikes so much about the current pope except that he appears to be holding the line on traditional Catholic teaching. For all the much-vaunted tolerance of liberal believers, I was shocked by the author's repeated ad hominem attacks upon the character of popes and others who take views not sanctioned by the author. As for Mr. Cahill's liberal utopia, I suggest that he look at the Episcopal Church in the US for a picture of what the Church will look like if we vote on our doctrine and elect our bishops; I don't think it is an improvement! This book is a perfect example of the saying that \\"when orthodoxy becomes optional, orthodoxy will soon be prohibited.\\" I have tried but cannot understand those (like the author) who want to belong to an organization with which they completely disagree and then want to make the organization over in their own image. There are plenty of non-hierarchical denominations out there if Mr. Cahill truly wants one. I recommend that you avoid this book or read only that portion of it dealing directly with John XXIII. A more scholarly alternative from the same perspective without the cant is Eamon Duffy'sSaints and Sinners: A History of the Popes; Third Edition (Yale Nota Bene)orTen Popes Who Shook the World."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I just completed reading this book and found it to be a concise biography of a great man. I do admit that it left me wanting more.It is obvious that Thomas Cahill has enormous respect for Pope John XXIII and feels that he is the most important pope of the modern era. I do agree with this.I am a &quot;cradle&quot; Catholic who had lapsed for about 10 years and recently returned to the Church. However, I still have many problems with the conservative nature of the Catholic Church today and reading a book like this (as well as Hans Kung's book on the Church) gives me hope that the Church can return to the spirit of Vatican II."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"POPE JOHN XXIII is not a long book but the author does try to cover a lot of territory as he traces the history of the church and especially the papacy from its beginnings to the present day.He also manages to give us a short biography of Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the 258th successor to the apostle Peter.Two passages in the book stand out as beacons of optimism. The first is a description of John walking up the central aisle of Saint Peter's at the start of Vatican II while 2500 bishops, patriarchs and abbots sing and pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit.The second passage contains Cahill's prediction that the Holy Spirit will descend again on the church as it surely did at Vatican II and also 2000 years ago at Pentecost in Jerusalem.For those who love the Roman Catholic Church, another Pentecost will be most welcome."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Whether you are a Catholic or a non-Catholic will doubtless have massive implications for how you approach this book. I am a non-Catholic with very little grounding in the history or structure of the Western Church or of the Papacy. For myself, I would not have fully understood why Angelo Roncalli's Papacy was considered successful without the not so brief but engaging Papal history that takes up 72 of the book's 241 pages. It is a dizzying survey of Papal history, and obviously not definitive, but it gives Pope John XXIII a context within which to appreciate him. Some Catholics may take such a history for granted, and want to get to the meat of Roncalli's story. But, the author has to take into consideration those without a Catholic background so they can understand why he was not only a good Pope, but a good person.Cahill does make much out of what Pope John XXIII had to contend with in the form of conservative Cardinals and Vatican administrators. There are times Cahill seems too harsh towards these people, and possibly he overplays it to demonstrate Roncalli's legacy. However, the Catholic church does have the reputation as one of the most conservative institutions in the world (there are many examples as to why, the case of forgiving Galileo about 300 years after the fact is only one), so perhaps Cahill's depiction is accurate. It is ultimately hard to know for a Vatican outsider, but Cahill's book, skewed or not, is a great starting place for non-Catholics on the subject of the Papacy."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"This is a wonderful biography of the pudgy man born to a poor peasant family who became, in his old age, the much-beloved (at least by the people) Pope John XXIII. I was a ten-year old Protestant boy when Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli ascended to the throne of St. Peter. I remember reading about him and his Vatican Council over the next five years and hearing my Catholic friends talk favorably about the new pope. Then in 1963 the pope died and a few months later the young American president was assassinated and the whole world changed (or at least it seemed--and seems--to me).Thomas Cahill's addition to the Penguin Lives series of brief biographies is the best so far. Cahill's prose is easily read; his history flows smoothly. The book open with an account of the church's history and its long line of mostly undistinguished popes. Then Cahill focuses on the long life of Roncalli: his service in the Italian army during World War I; his rise to some significance in the church in Italy; then his unexpected posting to mostly Orthodox Bulgaria; and then to the plum job in sophisticated and free-thinking Paris. Somehow this widely varied experience combined with his native empathy for people and love of the soil to deliver a remarkably liberal and unfettered man to the head of the Roman Catholic church for a brief, but monumental, five years.Cahill concludes with a negative, almost searing, overview of Pope John's successors including a pretty nasty picture of Pope John Paul II who he thinks represents a weird, Polish kind of Catholcism. I can't comment on the fairness of that, but am encouraged that Cahill feels that the waters representing John's humanism and warmth run near the surface and will emerge again. Frankly, I hope so."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Admittedly I was hesitant to buy this book. The life of John XXIII and Vatican II is one of the more significant stories about the Catholic Church and I was concerned that the short length of this book was not enough space to appropriately address the topic. Well, I was right, but for the wrong reasons.Cahill spends almost the first third of the book providing a \\"brief history\\" of Catholic Popes from Peter to John XXIII. While an undertaking of that magnitude may have been appropriate in a more comprehensive biography, it was out of place in a book of this brevity. While I am certainly not a Catholic apologist, I was amazed at Cahill's ability to present a National Enquirer-type story without the slightest effort to present a more realistic historical context. I am not suggesting that anything Cahill presented was untrue, but he was so tabloidish in both his writing style (he actually used the phrase \\"getting laid\\") and objectivity, that it was hard for me to continue. But continue I did.Unfortunately, continuing was a further disappointment. Once again, Cahill insists on a conclusory writing style without expounding on truly significant points. At one point, Cahill suggests that John XXIII was gay based on a \\"hunch\\" (his word, not mine). In my opinion, if you are going to make such a conclusion, you either back it up or leave it alone. This cocktail party approach to his book simply because too much to take.The sad thing is was that I would probably agree with most of the positions Cahill advocates for the reform of the Catholic Church. The problem is that he advocates for them so poorly and with such an amateurish style that I actually found myself wanting to disagree with him.Certainly not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"This is a splendid work, exquisitely written by one of our best contemporary historians. Pope John XXIII has been forgotten in recent years, perhaps because it is more fashionable to seem moral rather than to be so. John XXIII wasn't flashy enough for the late twentieth/early twenty-first centuries. Nor has his reputation been helped by the facts that his pontificate lasted barely five years, and that the last forty-three years have seen a reaction to many of the reforms that resulted from the Vatican II council that he initiated. Cahill's short, beautiful biography rectifies this historical amnesia by bringing into sharp focus the life of this gentle, humorous Italian peasant who, to the surprise of nearly everyone became the head of the Catholic Church. But, as is typical of Cahill's work, this is more than just biography. He begins with a condensed history of the Catholic Church, concentrating on its gradual accumulation of power and, incidentally, its drift from its responsibilities toward humanity. This provides a background for the life and career of Angelo Roncalli, the man who would become Pope John XXIII. Throughout, Cahill provides a contrast between the priest and the organization (with its numerous heroes and villains) that he served. Out of this gripping story, which reads easily as well as any novel, Cahill depicts the life of an ideal Christian, a model for human behavior that may well inspire the reader."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"As a Cathlic born in the mid 20th Century, I grew up under the benevolent shadow of John XXIII and was looking forward to reading a biography of the man who had such a great influence on my spiritual life. But, in all honesty, I was very disappointed by Mr. Cahill's book which I found to be very superficial and subjective.The first 90 pages or so gave a synopsis of the history of the papacy which I suppose was trying to set the stage for the time in which John XXIII lived but I really didn't see any need to go back to the first century. The more relevant time frame for the history would have been from the early 19th century when all European institutions came under question and concetrationg on the papacy of Pius IX and Vatican I.Mr. Cahill also tended to use leading terms such as \\"propaganda\\", \\"puritanical\\", \\"cloak of infallibility\\" or \\"contemporary reader\\" to make his point that Catholic Tradititon was not only historically questionable but archaic and perhaps bogus to the enligthened \\"contemporary reader\\". Ironically, while John may have had no problem with honest historical analysis, I can't help but believe that he would have taken issue with Mr. Cahill over some of his other implications.Angelo Roncalli was truly the pope of the century as another writer has put it. He had a vision of the full potential of the Catholic Tradition in a modern society which is a vision that seems to be getting lost today as a more conservative wind blows through the Catholic Church. But, Mr. Cahill barely scratched the surface with regards to this beloved man. The book offers some basics but its hardly worth the price."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"In the first part of POPE JOHN XIII Cahill describes in brief the history of the papacy. He pulls no punches when he cites for instance that Peter was never Bishop of Rome because the early Christians used a congregational style of governance. Cahill goes on to describe the evolution of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome which gains momentum after the Council at Nicea in 325 and is aided by the support of Emperor Constantine who wishes to use Christianity to better unite his empire. The leadership of the Bishop of Rome is never really accepted by the churches of the East and ultimately is challenged in the West as well by Martin Luther and the Reformation of the sixteenth century. Cahill describes the ups and downs of the papacy and by the time he reaches the 20th century the reader has a better appreciation for the tensions which exist between the churches of the East and West in addition to the reasons for the Reformation and the competing claims of Roman Catholic apologists. In short, we begin to understand the challenges facing John XIII when he becomes pope.The author clearly likes John XXIII who was born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli into a large family of tenant farmers near the small city of Bergamo.Angelo went to the seminary early but also was drafted into the military for a brief period. After ordination as a priest he seemed to rise rapidly as he was singled out for diplomatic assignments to Bulgaria, Turkey and France.Cahill points out that some of the friends Angelo made along the way helped him develop the progressive streak which inspired him to convene Vatican II. The list of these friends includes the historian Bernard Berenson and the composer Igor Stravinsky.Angelo was elected pope because the cardinals wanted a compromise candidate who would not last too long and one who would bridge the gap between all levels of society. At that time Angelo was the Patriarch of Venice. The other candidate was Cardinal Gregory Agagianian, Patriarch of the Armenian Uniates. Agagianian was backed by the conservatives. Angelo eventually won after several rounds of voting.The crowning achievement of his papacy is obviously Vatican II. The most interesting part of the book is the account of the battle before and during the council by the conservative forces led by Ottaviano and their progressive opponents.The legacy of Vatican II was later preserved by Paul VI, a staunch friend of and successor to John XXIII.Cahill is definitely a liberal who ends the book expressing some doubt about the contributions of John Paul II but holding out considerable hope for the future of the Roman Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"The first fifty or so pages of this biography gives the reader a great summation of the history of the papacy, and, as usual, Cahill pulls no punches. The biography of Angelo Roncalli, however, was just as satisfying as the the summary. I liked this book so much I have sent copies to family members and friends. I'm probably a bit biased as I read and enjoy Cahill's writing and frank use of language. The size of the book makes it easy to read and re-read."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"In the \\"Notes and Sources\\" at the end of his book, Mr. Cahill begins by saying, \\"This book is a biographical essay and not in any sense a definitive biography...\\" He ought to have said, \\"Two-thirds of this book is a biographical essay, the other third is an editorial rant against the Papacy and mainstream Roman Catholicism.\\"Following the example of \\"Good Pope John\\", I'll save the ad hominem attacks I'd like to direct towards Mr. Cahill for another forum, which is more than he does for those Catholics he disagrees with. I found it ironic that he repeatedly praises John XXIII for his consistent ability to forgive those who wronged or offended him during his career, but Mr. Cahill can't seem to bring himself to do the same for those churchmen, living and dead, with whom he disagrees. And Heaven forbid if you are Polish! Mr. Cahill seems to have a special antipathy for John Paul II and, I quote, his \\"...idiosyncratic Polish Catholicism...\\" His comparison of Pope St. Pius X with Richard Nixon is also noteworthy, if not indicative of his idyllic, 1960s Weltanschaung.Yet, despite his consistent, non-shrouded distaste for anything short of \\"Kumbaya\\" Christianity, the pages dealing specifically with John XXIII's days as a member of the Vatican diplomatic corps are interesting and well written. That alone led me to award this book two stars, rather than a single star."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Traditional Roman Catholics are apt to find Cahill's book unsettling. Not only does he devote too much space to accounts of numerous scandals in the church's past, but he also seems to believe that a conservative pope will almost always be bad for the church.In spite of these shortcomings I still recommend POPE JOHN XXIII - especially because of the description of the pope's early life and career. I will look forward to reading a really definitive biography of this inspiring person when it finally becomes available."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"This little book packs a punch; I enjoyed reading it. It sandwiches the life of an interesting and important man between a general discussion of the papacy which preceded and followed him. The author writes with efficiency and a point. After a two-day session with this book, I left with a greater understanding of John XXIII, and I am more sure that I like and respect him now. And it was a joy to see how a liberal who was also a dedicated and holy Catholic made his way among some of his more conservative colleagues. Indeed, Cahill wears his heart on his sleeve; he has little sympathy for many of the more conservative elements of the Church. But his love of the Church is clearly on display here. Many reviewers here have taken Cahill to task for his polemics and one-sidedness. No doubt he is polemical, but it did not bother me. I've been reading enough thunderbolts from the right over the past few years that a little counterpunch is good for the soul I think. This bantamweight book is not afraid to take swings at some heavyweights, and many of them land true."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Liberals: good. Conservatives:bad. John XXIII: a saint.Sadly, that's pretty much a synopsis of this book."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Admittedly I was hesitant to buy this book.

The author is rude, crude and writes in an overly antagonistic tone. He spends little space talking about Bl. Pope John, but rather finds it necessary to rip to pieces the Papacy past and present.I found this work painful to read, not because of any truth contained therein, but because of the sheer magnitude of immaturity Cahill's literary posture exudes. What was most irritating was the treatment of H.H. Pius IX, and following, Cahill's criticism of Karol Wojtyla as priest and bishop, and then as Pope. His childish criticism of the latter's work, 'Love and Responsibility' (which I recommend to all as it is a tremendous achievement) is the best demonstration of this author's thoughtlessness, ignorance and unbridled prejudice.The author claims to be Catholic -- but this is obviously deception. Thomas Cahill is no son of the Church, and writes with every anti-Catholic bias. Those who think favorably of this book can only be understood to share in the same depravity, and possible fate."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Let me say at the outset I enjoyed this book. I am also not Catholic. But this book is not about John XXIII. It's about Thomas Cahill writing a 200-page history of the Catholic Church and saying why he doesn't like Pope John Paul II. It's a similar trick used by John Cornwall in his book Hitler's Pope. Thomas Cahill is a wonderful writer, and he condenses and popularizes history better than anyone going. But let's be honest; this can be summed up in the comment Cahill relates from a Jesuit that the Catholic Church has been set back some 200 years by John Paul's pontificate. That admission comes in the final chapter, and it speaks volumes about how the life of a godly man has been used, painted in broad and vague brushstrokes, simply to promulgate someone's \\"enlightened view\\" of how others should worship."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"At first it may seem odd that this biography of John XXIII, with a limited number of pages, devotes 1/4 of them to the popes who came before John XXIII-- centuries before him.But the purpose is to show how unusual John was-- and how rare a loving, generous, apolitical (though necessarily wily) and good-hearted pope like him really has been. The overwhelming picture is of how the anti-modern, inbred, conspiratorial atmosphere in the Vatican seems bound to turn almost any pope against the rest of the world and to close his heart and mind to ordinary peoples' lives-- not that many of them needed much help closing them.If there is a saving grace to the system, it is that sometimes it recognizes that it needs men like John for certain tasks, and so at least has the sense not to destroy them. Thus John escaped the oppressions of the paranoid era of Pius X, and emerged from World War II (unlike the then-pope, Pius XII) with a reputation for goodness and anti-Nazism which enabled him to negotiate with a Charles deGaulle determined to oust Pius' pro-Vichy bishops. Yet it still seems remarkable that such a man was able to be elected pope after the \\"moral pygmy\\" Pius, and that in his short reign-- he was chosen with the expectation he would not live long-- he managed to do so many things to bring the church forward by centuries. Even as John Paul II has turned the church back to a more authoritarian era, he must grudgingly acknowledge that his moral stature in the Communist world would not have existed without John's overtures to that world, which helped thaw the Cold War."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Admittedly when I first saw this book, I was a little apprehensive. I had been looking for a more detailed, in-depth biography of John XXIII and my initial impressions weren't all that bolstered either when I quickly thumbed through and saw that the first 70-odd pages of it's 240 total were devoted to an encapsulated history of the papacy before John XXIII.However, once I sat down and started to read this little book, I couldn't put it down. The \`papal introduction' section prior to concentrating on Angelo Roncalli's life is pretty much essential, background knowledge for the reader to fully understand John XXIII's momentous impact on the papacy and Catholic church as a whole. I would have enjoyed more details regarding Angelo Roncalli the man himself, but the introduction gains more value once you realise that it forms part and parcel why John XXIII saw the imperative need for Vatican II - which is and will ever be his enduring legacy.From reading the epilogues, it is fairly obvious that Thomas Cahill does not approve of the conservative retrograde of the papacy under John Paul II. After reading this book, one is indeed left wondering if John XXIII's brief reign as pontiff was something along the lines of Catholicism's answer to the Prague Spring of 1968 - a brief window of fresh air in an otherwise rigid absolutist system, and whether the church will ever see that window opened again. Paul VI tried to put a screen on that window and it seems to have finally shut tight again after the untimely death of Pope John Paul I in 1978.Putting aside all content and topic opinions for the moment, it is obvious taht this book was lovingly and thoughtfully produced. It would have been nice to see some pictures included, but the pages with their rough, torn edges and the beautiful portrait of John XXIII enclosed unobstructed by the dustcover... a lot of caring workmanship went into designing this book."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"The concise history of the papacy prior to John XXIII isn't Cahill's attempt to defame the institution, but rather to place Angelo Roncalli in his proper historical context--as a stunning exception. If one puts aside his/her bias and seriously examines the history of the popes--whether one is liberal or conservative--he/she will find that most of the men who have held the office have been generally lacking in spirituality and rather obsessed with worldly power. This isn't anti-Catholic or ideological on Cahill's part, it's simply history. John XXIII stands in such stark contrast to the fairly sordid history of the papacy, that he represents an amazing change from the norm and Cahill deals nicely with this. A pretty good biography with some priceless personal stories and a thesis on John's role in the Cuban Missile Crisis which does not get enough press. Cahill is a solid author and this is a good book."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"This book does not come close to Cahill's other books (How the Irish saved civilization, Gift of the Jews, Desire of the Everlasting Hills). Cahill presents a leftist's view of the Catholic Church. Anything &quot;progressive&quot; is good, the traditional church is bad. John Paul II sets the church back. Seems that Cahill goes for the permissive church, the welfare state. I was deeply disappointed."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"With what appears to be very limited material to work with, Cahill is able to create an insightful description of one of the most significant and underappreciated figures of the 20th century, Pope John XXIII.Cahill does a remarkable job of laying the foundation for possibly the most influential papacy of the last millennium. The narrative concisely demonstrates how the people in which John encountered and the times in which he lived were central to developing the pope that not even he knew he would become.I was particularly fascinated by the incredible joy and cleverness he brought to his papacy and how those skills served him well as the architect of the Vatican II council. The most moving passages in the book juxtapose the culmination of the first session of the council with John's failing health and eventual passing.While I understand that the Penguin Lives biographies are not intended to be the definitive works of the historical subjects they feature and instead are intended to provide a canvas for some of our more talented writers to explore these figures, I was still left wanting by this biography. 70 pages are dedicated to the history of the papacy and another 20 are dedicated to the popes that follow John, to include a particulary critical view of John Paul II. In the end, this short biography of John, is even shorter.Despite my reservations, I still highly recommend Cahill's work as an insightful and entertaining study of a truly wonderful human being."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"Before reading this book, I admired Cahill for his \\"Hinges of History\\" series. While he often shocked me with his obsession with detailed sexual rituals or practices, he seemed to weave a good pattern of history and narrative, making the books an enjoyable (and presumably beneficial) read.However, about half way through this work, I began to doubt the accuracy of anything I had ever read by Cahill. His history of the papacy is anachronistic, ripped from its context, and overly biased (which is putting it nicely, a better description might be propaganda).In Cahill's opinion, there have been about 5 good popes, but none can compare to John XXIII. He goes to great lengths to point out the evils and flaws in even the best popes. When he comes to Paul XXIII, however, even his flaws are praised. When another pope acts in a way that offends Cahill's sense of what a pope ought to be, he is evil, misguided or vindictive. When John XXIII fails, he is just showing us his brokenness and reminding us that he is just a human.He applies this method when speaking of other clergy. When a conservative makes an appearance in the narrative, he is always evil, conniving, angry, divisive, etc (you can almost hear the music change in your head). I cannot call to mind one conservative opinion or decision Cahill praises in the book. However, anyone leaning to the left (Liberation Theologians, Liberal Theologians, Feminist thinkers, etc) comes on the scene, they are forward thinking, working in the true spirit of the Church, thoughtful, following Jesus, etc. Even when \\"liberal\\" characters do something duplicitous (e.g. when John goes on for hours so as to lull the conservative bishops before announcing his controversial council) they are praised as wise.If John XXIII was such a great man (and hear me clearly on this, I think he was, I too wish more Christians were like him) why does Cahill need to paint all other popes with such a dark brush? I can only wonder if this book is more a diatribe against the conservatives in the Church than a biography of John XXIII. In all honesty, I think John XXIII deserves better (and, if Cahill is right about him, would never have written or read a book like this which so demonizes everyone he disagreed with).Finally, Cahill often refers to 'hunches' he has or tells stories he admits are 'unverifiable.' That is not history, that's editorial.It will take a lot for me to pick up another Cahill book."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"My husband and I read this book together...we enjoyed every moment of this book, some times crying, some times a bit of laughter, most of the time we felt we were blessed by Thomas Cahill's talent of putting pen to paper and walking us through a great read."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I have read numerous books by Thomas Cahill, and I have found him to be sound in the intentions of illustrating to the reader not just the factual information, but too, the historical perspective. He does not hesitate to let the reader know what side of the fence he is on.I like Cahill, and his leading the reader through the historical background showing us the huge act of courage Pope John XX 111 demonstrated. With the knowledge of the historical, Cahill transitions the reader into what not only took place in 1962, but also give us a greater perspective on today's Vatican attempt to dismantle all he had accomplished."},{"Title":"Pope John XXIII","review":"I have great admiration for Pope JohnXXIII, and also for the author.

With exception on John Paul I, whom I suggest would have taken our church to John XXIII's dream, John Paul II and Benedict XVI seem(ed) to want to take away the the accomplishments advanced by the lay people and give total power back to the clergy. I'll cut to the chase rather than bore you with my opinionated opinion; This book was a long time coming and though it smacks todays leaders from priests, monsignors, bishops, cardinals to our last two popes (and to an extent Paul VI), it tells things like they are. I'm a convert, my wife is a cradle Catholic and we both agree with Cahill's message. I hope others will step up to the plate and tell it like it is. Sixty Minutes should do an expose."},{"Title":"Code of ethics,","review":"This 1938 book has all the inspiring ideas that helped business leaders become better people during the Great Depression. And like so many of these books today, the author was an inspiration and knew how 'to tell it like it is'. And like too many influential spokespersons in our time, he was eventually corrupted, got greedy, manipulated his followers, and eventually went to prison. This book is from his hayday, before it all fell part. It still inspires, but knowledge of future events is a cautionary tale."},{"Title":"American Reformers, 1815-1860.","review":"With American Reformers, Walters has composed a fine synthesis of secondary literature on the varied antebellum reform movements. In doing so, he argues that the reform impulse emerges out of evangelical Protestantism but by the Civil War takes a more secular turn more involved in legislating social controls than converting the hearts of individuals. As he develops this argument he addresses the different forms that this reform impulse took and organizes the book thematically. He discusses in successive chapters utopian movements and secular communitarians, abolition, the women's movement and the peace movement, temperance, health reform and spiritualism, working man's reform, and institutional reform, into which he groups mental hospitals, prisons and schools.Walters demonstrates the secularization of reform in the realm of communitarian societies. Thus, the early nineteenth century utopian settlements that often emerged out of pietistic impulses gave way to more secular experiments in social engineering such as Owenism, or as in the case of Oneida, how a once religious community endured only as a commercial venture. Similarly he shows institutions such as asylums wove their religious inspiration with the science of the times but like prisons and almshouses became holding pens for outcasts rather than places for healing and reform.Walters also situates the emergence of reform in the particular circumstances of antebellum America. He argues that the emergence of the middle class created made it possible for people to devote time to reform, and that technological advances in printing made it possible for people to actually make a living as an \\"agitator.\\" He also argues that reform helped shape the identity of the emerging middle class. This point come through particularly clearly in his chapter on working man's reform.Walters' synthesis suffers from its grand scope and short length. In it he sacrifices a certain amount of detail and analysis for space and clarity. The section on utopian movements, for example, traces the personalities of the major reformers and a brief outline of the community that followed without in-depth analysis. Throughout the book quotations from primary sources would have been helpful in giving a feel for the particular movement under discussion. The lack of primary source material allows Walters to sacrifice documentation, and the reader sometimes wishes for some assistance in discerning the origin or fuller development of a particular point. To his credit, Walters provides a good bibliographical essay at the end, but the lack of documentation sometimes proves frustrating and thus interrupts the otherwise smooth flow in the text. Nonetheless, American Reformers is a very readable and useful synthesis of the secondary sources on antebellum reform. As such, it is a helpful and welcome addition to the field."},{"Title":"American Reformers, 1815-1860.","review":"Some of the other reviewers have been awfully hard on Ron Walters for \\"skimming over\\" the info in this book. We're talking about a book that covers 45 years and hundreds or thousands of people (if you count all the utopians) in a little over 200 pages. I really liked this book as an introduction to the period and the people. It has led to my reading additional books about things like Brook Farm and the relationships between antebellum feminists and abolitionists. If you want fine detail and scrutany, look for something that is less scattershot, maybe \\"American Reformers: July 16, 1854.\\"In my mind, this is an introductory text, albeit a fine one. Walters is very accessable, he tries to include necessary historical perspective and whatever cultural information he deems to be valuable to the story he's telling in each chapter. And while each chapter is a story of a different movement or people, he also demonstrates those things these groups have in common. I won't spoil it for you, but at the least of it, they were all idealists who thought to affect the world around them."},{"Title":"American Reformers, 1815-1860.","review":"American Reformers is a wonderful resource book. Walters has done a beautiful job blending information with anecdotes. A great book for anyone interested in reform movements of the 19th Century, and their infuence on contemporary society."},{"Title":"American Reformers, 1815-1860.","review":"While American Reformers gives a fair overview of significant individuals and their movements in U.S. history, the book glosses over much material. Walters has accumulated much data, but it comes across as if he's heading a p.r. campaign for reformers instead of digging deep into his area. Much of Walter's writing is very light here and elsewhere (especially in his monthly columns he writes under the name of &quot;Guido Veloce&quot; for the Johns Hopkins Magazine) and at times it appears frivilous."},{"Title":"The Levellers and the English revolution (Spokesman University paperback)","review":"We here in the US like to think of the American Revolution as something that could only have happened here and that it was the first manifestation of American Exceptionalism. Of course this is nonsense. What is striking is how the American Revolution was in so many ways a reprise of the English Civil Wars of the 1640s. The republican Levellers and anti-Federalists are obvious matches as are the Whigish Grandees and Federalists. The remote and arbitrary English Parliament of the mid 18th Century represents Charles I and the Long Parliament of the 1640s.Technically, this book was in manuscript form when the author, N. H. Brailsford, died in 1958. Brailsford's manuscript was substantially complete but lacked an introduction and conclusion. Christopher Hill so respected what Brailsford had produced that he essentially gathered Brailsford's notes, with little editing, into a first and last chapter. These are not smooth reading but everything in between is well written and obviously the work of someone who had deep affection for his topic.The Levellers lost to Cromwell and the Puritan Grandees after 1650 and they were written out history after the Restoration of 1660 but they seem to have gone to ground in America. Roger Williams was a Leveller and an Anabaptist and the founder of Rhode Island, the first bastion of individual liberty in America. While the Puritan Grandees controlled Boston and the New England sea coast, Leveller-like sentiments prevailed in Rhode Island and in the hinterlands and cropped up again and again during the ratification debates of 1788-89. Samuel Adams between 1760 and 1776 begs to be compared to John Lilburne between 1640 and 1650. The Bill of Rights seems to be nothing more than a highly refined restatement of the several \\"Agreements of the People of England\\" that issued from illegal Leveller presses after 1645. Thomas Jefferson begs to be compared to William Walwyn. Abigail Adams and Mercy Otis Warren beg to be compared to Elizabeth Lilburne. George Washington seems to be a fusion of the best of the Grandee Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Rainsborough, a Leveller colonel in the New Model Army with substantial connections to Massachusetts. Populist English republicanism crops up everywhere during the American Revolution and can be clearly seen in the writings and actions of Samuel Adams, Elbridge Gerry, George Mason, Richard Lee and Patrick Henry; as they are described by Pauline Maier in \\"Ratification.\\". The native republicanism that brought the yeoman farmers and militia men of Massachusetts and New Hampshire to Lexington Green, Concord Bridge and Bunker Hill in 1775 must have come from somewhere and it has Leveller and New Model Army written all over it. They were all of the Leveller type.The Leveller color is sea green, its symbol is a sprig of rosemary. To my eye the Bunker Hill flag would not have looked out of place in any New Model Army regiment and the three colors typically used for the field on early Patriot flags in 1775, red, blue and green, were the same colors used by the New Model Army after 1645.Massachusetts after 1630 was the model for Cromwell's Commonwealth but Brailsford reminds us that the statist Puritans and the libertarian and Leveller Anabaptists, Quakers and religious independents of all kinds, both in Massachusetts and in England, always thought they had more in common with each other than they did with the statist Lutherans, Presbyterians, Anglicans and Catholics. This is clearly reflected in the experience of Harvard College. In 1660 their graduates were hanging Quakers, in 1692 they were burning witches but by 1800 they were graduating Unitarians and abolitionists.Brailsford also observes that there are similarities between the Leveller influenced New Model Army of 1645 to 1649 and the Red Army of 1918 to 1921. That leads to the suggestion that the difference between a democratic republican and a \\"Red\\" may turn only on the question of property rights. Brailsford also observes that the Levellers were opposed to the execution of Charles I and stridently opposed to Cromwell's subjugation of Ireland but, when forced to pick between supporting Cromwell and the Puritan Rump Parliament or Prince Charles and the threat of invasion from Scotland in 1650, the Levellers immediately became strong and unconditional supporters of Cromwell; this even though Cromwell and the Puritan Rump Parliament had put John Lilburne on trial for his life on charges of treason only a year earlier.How Lilburne, appearing pro se, won an acquittal from a high court of Oyer and Terminer in 1649 (the same kind of special court that conducted the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts in 1692) is one of the high points of Anglo-American legal history but it is virtually unknown in the US. In essence, he won his acquittal from a sympathetic jury on arguments based on due process, fundamental fairness and the idea that the jury, acting as the representatives of the people in individual cases, could nullify bad laws by returning a verdict of \\"not guilty\\" even if the evidence showed beyond doubt that the defendant had violated the particular provisions of the law in question. That is the practical, day to day meaning of the idea that people being governed, not the institutions of government, are sovereign. Here, it must be noted that this same argument was consciously and successfully made to individual juries in New England and the old Northwest in the context of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and many juries did, on a case by case basis, nullify the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.The Levellers were simply amazing and they came within a duce of establishing the first secular, democratic republic based on the idea of the sovereignty of the people, not the institutions of government, in England in 1649. The English Revolutions of the 1640s have pride of place among the American Revolution, the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution. They should be much better known. I find it distressing that I was born in Masssachusetts, graduated from college, went to law school and lived to be 60 years old without ever hearing the names of John Lilburne, Elizabeth Lilburne, William Walwyn, Richard Overton and Thomas Rainsborough.The fundamental question posed by the Levellers remains unanswered: Which is sovereign; the people being governed or the institutions of government? The Levellers said the people but it seems that in the end the institutions always win.American history desperately needs a total re-write. The first chapter of the re-write should begin in England on April 18, 1638, the day John Lilburn was flogged through the streets of London after being tried and sentenced by the Star Chamber and for publishing seditious pamphlets. Free speech and freedom of the press is a Leveller idea."},{"Title":"The Joy of Soy: Vegetarian Cartoons","review":"I liked this book a lot.

Basic recipes such as \\"Pesto Sauce\\" and \\"Black Bean Chili\\" are comfortable to new and old vegetarians, making the lifestyle change easier and less alienating.

THEY ARE ALL EASY TO FOLLOW AND PRETTY EASY TO PREPARE.. I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"Oh, Carol Gelles, how I love thee, let me count the ways. Lets see, it adds up to about 1,000. That's right: I may love every recipe in this book, and I've cooked many of them. I purchased this book when I first moved out of my house, gasp, 15 years ago!!!! My cooking experience then was limited to boiling water for pasta and occasionally steaming vegetables. I now am a rather (if I do say so myself!) accomplished cook who can now whip up delicious recipes in the blink of an eye. It's hard to say what my favorite part of this cookbook is. To start, it's organized well. The beginning explains what a well stocked pantry should have in it. Cuz you can't cook anything if you aint got the right groceries on hand, ya know? This will save you countless trips to the grocery store. It then continues with cooking tables, such as how long you need to boil black beans, or your quinoa, or whatever. Because, again, youre not going to be able to cook if your basic starters aint done right. She then goes on to help with basic meal planning. For example, p.22 has elegant recipes to impress the boss, all with their corresponding page numbers. Here she suggests Creamy Tomato and Leek Soup (p. 99), Mushroom Stroganoff main course (p. 173) and Buttermilk Mocha Cake for desert (p. 512), among other suggestions--uh, I see a promotion in the works!!!! She also has meal suggestions for Eastern European cuisine (hard to make vegetarian), and Carib-Spanish-Afro cuisine, et al so if you are hankering for a meal that will fit a certain criteria you don't have to cruise all over the cookbook.It then is organized Appetizers, Soup, Entree's, etc etc, again, for easy meal planning. Once you get more familiar with it's set up you should be able to pick an ingredient that you want to use and find a recipe with it. For example, I noticed I have a lot of carrots in the fridge and not much of anything else. So I go to carrots in the index and find basic information about carrot (if you've never cooked with it before), and you also will find an Ethiopian dish made with carrot, ginger baked root vegetables, carrot cake, etc and you take a homely ingredient and made it into a gourmet meal. Your friends will be impressed. You can find recipes like this for just about any vegetable, grain, or beans you see. Perfect if you have been trying to make use of a new veggie at the farmer's market or trying to incorporate a new grain in your diet from the bulk bins at the natural food store.Last, with Carol's anecdotal writing style you'll be able to visualize how to make the dish, and feel as if you are cooking right along with her. The recipes a easy to follow, and have always come out well. And BTW: The Vegetable Lasagna recipe cannot be beat, I dare you to find one better. Get the book for this recipe alone. All of the recipes have vegan suggestions, and suggestions for swapping out one ingredient in a recipe for another. This always created a platform for me to start my culinary journey. Instead of recipes set in stone I began to understand that she was putting together flavors and textures. No, Carol's not reinventing the wheel, nor will probably never be an expert on vegan cooking. Experienced cooks may even find the recipes trite. However, if you think of this cookbook as the springboard to your vegetarian adventures you are in the right place. Just dive right in. See ya in the pool!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"Has a ridiculous amount of recipes starting with sauces and ending with desserts.

Usually, I try recipes selectively from cookbooks that contain a range of meat and vegetarian options. Good cookbooks will have good recipes, regardless of the orientation.

The Julia Child award assured me that this would be something special, as did all the glowing reviews here. I don't get it!

Now I find it helps me to eat healthier and make food that even my picky child will enjoy!The recipes are easy to follow, and use ingredients that you are likely to have on hand, or can be found easily. Even though I am not a vegetarian, this book has been an invaluable resource to me. There are a lot of great things to make on days when the pantry's running low - like lentil shepard's pie, barley stuffed peppers, or any of the great pasta or noodle dishes. The recipe for gado-gado got me to try tofu (and enjoy it!)and I make sesame asparagus and spicy green beans with shallots all the time.What's really great about this book is that there are so many recipes that even those of us who aren't vegetarians can enjoy. There are great recipes for snacks, side dishes, breads, breakfasts, soups, salads, appetizers, drinks, and desserts. There is a wide variety of recipes for all different tastes, and all sorts of different ethnic specialties. The book is very easy to follow.

I think she was a little worried that he wouldn't eat well because he married a vegetarian. Our first year of marriage I used only this cookbook and a few recipes my mom had given me. I can't tell you how exciting it was to sit down, read through a section of the book, write a grocery list for the items I would need, write out a dinner menu for the whole week and then call my friends to tell them what I was fixing on each night and ask them what sounded good to them so they could join us for dinner. I did this for several months until my evenings were filled with other activities. (Eating was definitely an activity when it came to using this book.) I have enjoyed every recipe I have used from this book. And they're so easy!! Here are a few of my recommendations (I don't have page numbers in front of me): The Barbecue Red Beans, Corn and Rice; Manicotti; Fajitas; Falafel; Hummus; Black Bean Hummus; and so many more. My only problem with some of the recipes is that I'm not a big salt eater and so I changed a few of the measurements on some recipes. And also, because she uses a lot of cheese (which is my favorite food) I gained a lot of weight that year.

The only difficulty I found was that the index is hard to use, but since everything I have made is good, it's worth the search."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This cookbook is a good staple cookbook, like _Joy_ or _Better Homes and Gardens_ are for omnivores. It has good, simple recipes for all the vegetarian classics, as well as some innovative and delicious variations and ideas. It belongs in all omnivore and vegetarian kitchens. I was rather surprised by the quality of the recipes, as I found the quantity-focused title off-putting, but I have used this book almost exclusively since recieving it as a gift four years ago. It is not tony gourmet (simpler than _The Vegetarian Epicure_) nor lowfat (thank goodness!) but yields excellent meals with great variety. The reviewer who found it a &quot;diappointment&quot; was clearly thinking of another book...this one doesn't have pictures, just great recipes for good meals."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes contains recipe selections to suit most vegetarian diets. After searching years for a vegetarian version of the Greek classic, Moussaka, I found a delicious version in this cookbook. Kudos to the author."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"When I first became vegetarian, I used this book quite a bit. The recipes are easy, use familiar ingredients, and blend well with meats and seafood for households that hold both vegetarians and meat-eaters. The many recipes are categorized by food (ex: soup, main course, breads) and by &quot;level&quot; of vegetarianism. (ex: lacto- ovo- vegan-) It was a useful and favorite book for me!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This book has repeatedly inspired me to try out those incredients that previously had seemed strange and undesirable to me. In fact, Carol Gelles has inspired me to cook real meals instead of fast and generally unhealthy fare. I found it to be particularly appealing that most of Gelles' recipes do not rely on Tofu or related products as they are not to my taste. I have yet to find the one recipe that does not taste good.Having been a vegetarian for about 20 years, I have acquired roughly 150 vegetarian cookbooks over the course of years. Every day, I go through several of them to find anywhere between one and four recipes to make that day.May 2008 - I penned the above review in 1999. Here I am, nine years later, and I feel like I need to amend my review - not because my opinion has changed, but because I feel even stronger about it:While there are some great cookbooks in my collection, there are only a few that really stand out - and only one that sits at the top of my collection - this one. Carol Gelles' book was among the first ones I ever purchased and by now, I have tested the majority of recipes in this book - not just a handful. When all else fails and when I can't, for the life of me, find a decent-sounding recipe in one of my other books - I know that Gelles' collection of recipes will never disappoint me. It is, by all means, my Golden Parachute.The recipes in this book are varied, easy to make, quick to put together, and appealing to a wide variety of eaters. Recipes are based on items that are staples in most households or easy to procure. The results are, almost without fail, excellent - in taste, texture, and visual appeal (I apply some personal touches to presentation, though).My wife, who is vegetarian by proxy of living with me, loves just about anything I make out of this book and I have yet to have a guest over for dinner who doesn't enjoy a meal made from one of Gelles' recipes. My wife is, indeed, a very picky eater and is oftentimes rather hesitant when I decide to try recipes from other books. She has never displayed any concern when I open up this book, though.I actually cooked up Gelles' recipe for Chili and entered into a small Vegetarian Chili Contest - and emerged the clear winner. Needless to say, many tast-testers walked away from the contest and straight into a bookstore to purchase this book.If there was only one cookbook I could take to a deserted (yet well supplied with food items) island, this is it. This, and no other.I cannot praise this book enough and it seems that I am not alone in my assessment. This book will enrich your culinary experience..."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This cookbook is like an all-purpose type, like a Betty Crocker or Fannie Farmer cookbook, only without the meat, poultry, and fish chapters, and that suits me perfectly. I am a simple cook, I don't make fussy gourmet dishes and even though I'm sure there are such recipes in this book there are also plenty for my style of cooking. Someone gave this cookbook to me years ago and it quickly became my go-to cookbook. My only issue, and it's me really, is with reading it. I find it difficult to find things in the index and I need reading glasses plus magnifier to see the recipes. But I have poor vision. Now I am using an iPad and rediscovering the joy of easy reading. Saving up my pennies and very much looking forward to buying the ebook version of this indispensable cookbook."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I am very satisfied with this book. The recipes are simple, and they are good. I am not a vegetarian, but love vegetables, grains and beans. These recipes help me find my way to cooking delicious side dishes and main courses with all the ingredients I love. I am now eating vegetarian main courses several times a week simply because they are delicious and make me feel good. You can't go wrong with this cookbook if that's what you're after."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This is one of my favorite cookbooks and I use it over and over. It's a cookbook that I go to for a wide variety of recipes. It has basics like broth, cakes, crackers, soups, and more complex things like tortilini, gnocchi, strudels. Really good index. Its a great \\"reference\\" cookbook. I think it's a must for any cookbook library. The peanut sauce is awesome, and so is the tortilla pie (polenta crust). Easy to understand recipes, easy to find ingredients."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"Great book. Has all kinds of recipes for any kind of vegetable. Not very complicated and plenty of ideas to use that do not take too much time to prepare. Simple dishes that can be family or made for guests.This is a basic book for anyone who is interested in cooking vegetarian and would make a good wedding present."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I have to disagree with the \\"con\\" review. The book is named 1,000 vegetarian recipes NOT 1,000 Vegan recipes. She does include some vegan recipes and even offers substitutions if on how to make it vegan. I am a really picky eater add that with 2 vegetarian preschoolers and a meat eating husband if this book has something for all of us then I'm sure everyone can find some good food ideas in this wonderful book. It's definetly my favorite veggie cook book!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I am simply someone with high blood pressure who was looking for a source of ideas for eating healthier. This book is terrific for that purpose.Like rice and beans but not the 1200mg sodium in the packaged mixes ? Try Creole Red Beans and Rice, p.142. Can't face eating steamed broccoli one more time ? Try sauteed broccoli and garlic, p.242. I use (sodium-free) chicken broth rather than veg broth most of the time. There's a fine Caesar salad without anchovies. Time after time I ask the question - what can I do with avocado, asparagus, broccoli,... and the book always has a good answer."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I found this cookbook about two years ago, shortly after I became a vegetarian. I have quite a few vegetarian cookbooks now, but this one is still my all-time favorite. Great variety of recipes, most of them quick and easy, though she also has many more elaborate dishes too. I can't say enough good things about this cookbook!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This is the best cookbook I've ever owned. Even if you're not a veg, it has recipes that can be side dishes, main dishes, have meat added to them -- flavor is always good, they offer variations on every recipe and have each recipe marked if it's vegan, uses eggs, uses milk, etc. I hope they get it in stock... I'd love to give it as gifts. Includes everything from desserts to drinks, to full meal plans. And easy directions that equal great flavor!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I use this book whenever I am looking for something new to make for dinner or if I want to a recipe for basic items. A lot of vegetarian cookbooks tend to focus on area. What this book reminds me of is the Joy of Cooking, except it's all vegetarian."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I was really excited about this book, especially after reading such great reviews. I have made a number of recipes, and most of them have been so bland- we've had to add a lot of spices just to make them have any flavor. Some have been good- but I am disappointed."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"Sometimes I read reviews where the book was only given one star and I think to myself, could it really have been that bad! Well, I bought this book because I am a vegetarian, have been one since about the age of five, so it isn't like I don't know what I'm talking about. I was so excited when I brought it home. Wow! 1000 recipes! I looked in the index and the names of the dishes really did inspire me to believe they would be exquisite. They are the most bland tasting dishes I have EVER eaten in my life. Spices do exist (and I don't mean salt), anyone can throw a can of beans on some rice and call it black beans and rice. I highly recommend Molly Katzen, Moosewood, Laurel's Kitchen. Don't waste your money on this book. I couldn't even eat the meals after about 3 bites. What a waste."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I was stunned to find the inclusion of many cheeses containing animal rennet, like Jarlesberg and Roquefort. The entree section is loaded with unsatisfying and downright boring conconctions. I got the feeling that a non-vegetarian author was dinking around in a test kitchen trying to scrounge up 1000 recipes. Most of the book contains recipies one might find in any cookbook. It's not difficult to find vegetarian salads, side dishes and desserts. I bought it because it had won awards, but quite frankly, I can't imagine how this was accomplished. If you ask me, this book has a slim and unimpressive collection of recipes that are useful, and the rest is pure filler. If you really cook, don't waste your money on this book."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"In buying this book i hoped to have a real old-fashioned, fresh vegetarian meal, but I was deserted. No one tries a cookbook and hates it, it seems, but this sure left me standing by a broken tollbooth with money in my hand. I wish the pictures would have shown the taste of these foods and not the aesthetic qualities of its preparation. Real food, thats all I want."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"Recieved item before expected...It is just what I wanted. I hope to do business again.Thanks"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"Despite honors from Julia Childs and James Beard this book is lacking imagination and any commitment to vegetarian cooking. Everything tastes better with cheese (eggs and butter). Try making something delicious without it! Her comments on tofu and tempeh revealed that this author has little or no exposure to soy products and their preparation. Her vegan recipes were frighteningly colorless reenforcing the notion that vegetarian cooking is bland, flavorless and strange. Why not put a little cornmeal on that tempeh before frying it, Carroll? Her adaptations of standard college veggie cuisine like hummus and baba ganouji were flat and lacked any real effort to make them her own. All in all this author wracked her brain to come up with 1001 recipes and it shows!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I have used this cookbook religiously for years and I have yet to find a bad recipe. The Tuscan Torta di Funghi e Patate (which we have shortened to just \\"fungi pie\\") is amazing. We are also big fans of the Sour Cream Pancakes which my son begs us to make every weekend. The recipes are very user friendly and you don't have to be a gourmet chef to get delectable results. We are not vegetarians but think we could be after experiencing the variety in this book. From the pastas to the pastries, this book has much to offer."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"The best thing about this book is that most recipes call for ingredients that you're likely to have in the house, or if you don't happen to have, can find at the local supermarket. And for this reason, it is the cook book I use the most. The next best thing about this book is that most of the recipes are excellent. While some are only average, all you have to do is to pencil in adjustments to measurements next to the recipe ingredient list to make it more to your taste (which is true of all cookbooks and recipes). Another nice feature to many of the recipes is the ingredient substitution possibility that is included at the end of the recipe. This is the book I give as Christmas gifts to newly formed vegetarians, or friends that like to cook for vegetarians but don't understand what we eat."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This is a cookbook that I ended up purchasing because my mother already had a copy and made some very good dishes from it. So, I had to get a copy and I wasn't disappointed!Unless you are someone who has to have meat with every meal or hates vegetables, you will enjoy this cookbook. I really don't think it's for vegetarians only. Many of the recipes would compliment a main dish meat very well and others make fabulous meatless-entrees. I have made the \\"Baked Ziti\\" and it bakes up deliciously with a crust of cheese on top! I've also tried the \\"Eggplant Sauteed with Tomatoes, Capers and Garlic\\" and it was wonderful! So far I haven't made a recipe that disappointed.The book contains over 500 pages of recipes from a variety of cuisines (Italian, French, Chinese, Indian, etc). There are no photos, but that didn't really bother me. I purchased it because I wanted to eat more veggies and cook more healthfully, and the book has served that purpose. Also, the recipes are straight-forward to prepare. Under each recipe title are small symbols that denote which type of \\"vegetarian\\" the recipe would be appropriate for (Lacto-Ovo, Lacto, Ovo, Vegan). At the end of most recipes are ideas for variations to provide more options.Overall, I've been very pleased with this book. (And I think it shows because apparently I've crinkled the pages a bit from using the book in my kitchen!) I would recommend it to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I am pleasantly suprised by the wonderful recipes in this book. I have a collection of cookbooks and find with all of them that they have maybe a few which are good - THIS BOOK IS THE EXCEPTION - the recipes are easy, interesting and delicious.

Basic, interesting, well-written and comprehensive, every vegetarian, from the novice to the gourmet, should have this book on the shelf. Also a great gift."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I have bought a lot of other veggie cookbooks, most of which are sitting on my shelf collecting dust, but this one has got to be the BEST one I have ever used. My best friend, a chef, bought it for me one year for my birthday, and I have used it ever since. Every recipe has received rave reviews from my family and friends, and the bonus is that all of the recipes are so easy to follow. I've found with other veggie cookbooks, the recipes can get long and tedious, often involving hard to find ingredients. This cookbook has been a breath of fresh air for me as I expand my culinary horizons."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"YUMMY! That is the first word that comes to mind when I think of 1000 Vegetarian Recipes. I am neither a vegetarian nor an accomplished cook, and I bought it simply to try a new type of (healthier) cuisine. I have found all of the recipes to be well-constructed and easy to follow. The dishes came out perfect and tasted yummy. I have used several recipes for party appetizers, and several guests asked for the recipe. All-in-all a wonderful cookbook and one I look through often. I am looking forward to buying Carol Gelles's next cookbook."},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"This book has become a regular staple in my kitchen. It has gotten me to add new recipes to my daily repertoire. Everything has been delicious! I love the way she introduces the recipes with a personal reference or thought. I feel like a friend is in the kitchen with me. The wide ranges of ethnicities of food is also refreshing. I that the recipes are labeled according to the type of veggie one is, i.e., V for vegan. I would have preferred more vegan recipes, but I know that most people eat dairy so, I just make a couple of substitutions and YUMMY!"},{"Title":"1,000 Vegetarian Recipes","review":"I bought this book recently and am very please with it.

Of these, two (The Didache, and the Episle of Barnabas) were seriously considered by some of the Church Fathers to be on a par with the New Testament. In fact, The Didache may well have been written BEFORE some of the Canonical New Testament. In the &quot;Fragments&quot; we see probably the earliest testimony concerning the Apostolic origins of the Synoptic Gospels.No scholar or student of the Early Church should be without many volumes of the Ancient Christian Writers series. Of this series, this is one of the most important titles."},{"Title":"The Didache: The Epistle of Barnabus, the Epistles and the Martyrdom of St. Polycarp, the Fragments of Papias, the Epistle to Diogn (Ancient Christian Writers)","review":"This handsome volume six of the Ancient Christian Writers series is one of the half dozen \\"must have\\" volumes (along with #1 - Clement and Ignatius, #55 - Ireneaus, #56 - Justin Martyr, and a few others). I have about two dozen of these great books. This particular volume was one of the ones edited by the legendary Patristic scholar Johannes Quasten (the translator, James Kliest) and contains \\"The Didache,\\" or The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, \\"The Epistle of Barnabas,\\" \\"The Epistles and Martyrdom of St. Polycarp,\\" \\"The Fragments of Papias\\" and the \\"Epistle to Diognetus.\\" Each work is prefaced by scholarly expository material. The translations are modern and annotated, and the endnotes provide a wealth of detailed study information.\\"The Didache\\" (first to third century, AD) is a document discovered in the 19th century that solved many mysteries. A number of ancient Christian documents that appeared to have a common source appear to have that source in the Didache which probably has elements that were composed as early as the first century. This work purports to contain apostolic teachings for Christian living and worship procedures and includes specific instructions on baptism and the celebration of the Lord's Supper.\\"Barnabas\\" (2nd century, AD) is an ancient Christian letter by an unknown yet probably authoritative author. It was held in very high regard by early Christianity and is an exhortation to persistence in the Christian way. It contains specific admonitions against \\"Judaizing,\\" the major error of the writer's day and contrasts the Christian understanding of religious history with that of Judaism. This is polemical literature and must be read in that light.The letters (one fragment and a second, fuller epistle) of Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna to the Philippians (about AD 135) is also an important early Christian document. Polycarp is believed to have been a disciple of St. John who lived to an old age before his martyrdom in the middle of the second century. This letter of his is a warm, fatherly letter to fellow Christians (similar to the spirit of Ignatius of Antioch) who were probably struggling with the doctrines of Marcion. Polycarp relies heavily on the writings of Paul and Peter as he exhorts his readers.\\"The Martyrdom of Polycarp\\" is a mid-second century writing that purports to tell the story of how the beloved Polycarp died. The tension between the Christians and Jews of the day is described and there are mythic elements to the manner in which the fire consumes the holy man. With this writing, the cult of the martyrs begins in earnest as Christians begin to rely more on the memories of those who had died for the cause.The \\"Fragments of Papias\\" (bishop of Hierapolis, disciple of John, friend of Polycarp) are taken from the writings of Irenaeus (late 2nd century) and Eusebius' \\"History of the Church\\" (early 4th century), and date to the middle of the 2nd century. Papias is highly esteemed as having experienced apostolic teaching. He is important for observing the importance of the \\"rule of faith\\" received authoritatively, in addition to sacred writings. His themes would be carried on by Irenaeus and others in succeeding generations.Finally, the epistle of \\"Mathetes\\" (Greek for \\"Disciple\\") to \\"Diognetus\\" is Greek Christian apologetic material that attempts to convince a friendly pagan (\\"Diognetus\\") of the truth of the Christian way. This intelligent, moving letter probably dates from the 2nd century and refers to the growth of the Churches in spite of the martyrdoms that God is behind the young Christian movement.These are necessary source documents for students of Christian history and doctrine and, in my opinion, can't be found in a more accessible yet scholarly English translation."},{"Title":"The Didache: The Epistle of Barnabus, the Epistles and the Martyrdom of St. Polycarp, the Fragments of Papias, the Epistle to Diogn (Ancient Christian Writers)","review":"I own many books from the \\"Ancient Christian Writers\\" series. I cannot think of a better edition of the Early Church Fathers out there. There may be cheaper collections, but these translations and notes are solid academically and theologically.This specific volume, the Didache, is one of two volumes that come off my shelf most regularly. The Didache is essential reading for the Christian. For what little my opinion is worth, I believe that this little work is perhaps the most important early extra-biblical text there is.This short work was written as a sort of pamphlet (or tract to use the modern jargon) designed to evangelize pagans. It begins with a bold statement. To paraphrase: \\"There are two ways, one of life and one of death.\\" It then goes on to address the moral teachings of the Church.After this opening section on Christian morality, there is a section on Christian worship, specifically regarding the Eucharistic celebration.This text is VERY early, probably written around 90AD. As a believer, what is remarkable for me is the consistency with which the truth has been preached by the Church for 2000 years. Under the section \\"the way of life\\" we find the following instruction: \\"Do not kill a fetus by abortion.\\" It would not be overstating the case to say that all John Paul II did with his pontificate is reiterate, in new and beautiful ways, the constant teaching of the Church, which has not changed drastically in 2000 years. Certainly the Didache, while a short easy read in pamphlet form, speaks volumes about Christian morality and the \\"culture of life\\" the successors of Peter would have us build.This is a monumental (and short!) work that should be in the library of every serious Christian. It is impossible to see how one can advocate new and novel Christian \\"morality\\" in light of texts like the Didache, which so clearly point out the differences between Christian and Pagan thought, ethics, and morality."},{"Title":"The Didache: The Epistle of Barnabus, the Epistles and the Martyrdom of St. Polycarp, the Fragments of Papias, the Epistle to Diogn (Ancient Christian Writers)","review":"If you are Christian (especially Catholic) and are forever challenged by Fundamentalists, this book is one of many great resources. Reformers, in particular, try to discredit these documents but that is not new. The translation was tough for me and I did not find it an easy read.

I picked up this little book hoping to get more useful ideas for natural cleaning products but was very disappointed to find that almost all of the recipes use SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) -- not my idea of safe and natural. Also, calling the book &quot;Herbal Homekeeping&quot; is really a misnomer since only a couple of the recipes call for herbal infusions; the rest use essential oils and while there's nothing wrong with that, it will surely be disappointing to those who purchased the book hoping to find housecleaning recipes using herbs.Apart from the author's reliance on the chemical SLS, my biggest problem with the book is the section on recipes for cats, dogs, and horses. While properly diluted essential oils -- with some important exceptions -- are fine to use on dogs, essential oils should *not* be used to treat cats, since cats do not effectively metabolize essential oils (use herbs or hydrosols instead). However, the recipes presented here aren't safe for use on dogs either. The first problem is the dilution. Depending on the essential oils used, a 2% to 7% dilution works well for most dogs, but Sandy Maine's Flea Free Oil calls for a 60%-70% dilution! As if that wasn't bad enough, one of the EOs in the recipe is white cedar, a.k.a. thuja. White cedar (not to be confused with atlas cedarwood) is not used in aromatherapy and for good reason: it's high thujone levels act as a dangerous neurotoxin. Tiny amounts of thuja have traditionally been used externally to burn off warts -- this is definitely not an essential oil you want to rub on your animal's coat and skin!"},{"Title":"Herbal Homekeeping: Simple Recipes for a Naturally Clean Abode","review":"Granted sodium lauryl sulfate, in concentration, can cause skin irritation. But, the recipes dilute SLS with other ingrediants or expect the user to be diluting it with water (e.i., in the laundry or when doing dishes). The current 'rage' that SLS causes cancer is also unfounded. The true facts are out there for anyone that does their 'homework' and finds out the facts for themselves. Seeing the use of SLS in the book and reading other reviews of the book, prompted us to doing our own checking, resulting in a true understanding of SLS. Nonetheless, no cleaner (chemical or 'green') should be left were children or pets could come in contact with it. While cow or goat milk soap is gentle and cleansing to the skin, it can still sting the eyes just like commercial soaps and one wouldn't recommend anyone ingest. These recipes are in fact for 'cleaners' and should be stored as such.Essential oils come from herbs. Whether the herbs are enfleuraged, steam distilled, expressed, ect., to make the essential oil, they still come from herbs. One just has to consult the dictionary for this. Thus, to call these 'herbal' recipes is not misleading. The benefit is that these essential oils leave the house, clothes, ect. with a harmless aroma that is soft, natural, and pleasant. And, they are a pleasing alternative to chemical smells while cleaning. We have many people interested in our cleaning supplies because of the aroma and the fact that they are effective.The recipes in this book offer a wonderful alternative to products that are truly all 'chemical' in make up. It also provides the industrious 'beginner' with a place to start and adapt recipes to suit themselves. This is how we used the book and as one 'tool' in learning to make our own cleaners, it has been extremely helpful. An example of adapting to suit ones self is that if a person does not want to use SLS the castile soap can be used, whether in solid or liquid form, in its place. But, if one isn't even sure where to begin for making their own cleaning supplies, one has to start someplace and this book provides it."},{"Title":"Herbal Homekeeping: Simple Recipes for a Naturally Clean Abode","review":"This is a tiny book, with only a couple of good ideas for fragrance combinations and an idea for a dish soap cake in what looks like something you'd make a baked apple in that I liked. Not worth the price of the book.I also was not happy to see that many of the recipes featured sodium laurel sulfate, which is a common allergen (it is in most shampoos, for instance). It is in fact in so many things that people often don't know that it is the culprit when their skin itches.There are better books out there: Clean House, Clean Planet; and Better Basics for the Home, if you are interested in nontoxic cleaning, and neither of them call for Sodium Laurel Sulfate for any of their recipes."},{"Title":"Herbal Homekeeping: Simple Recipes for a Naturally Clean Abode","review":"I just tried the toilet bowl cleaning recipe and it was wonderful.

This substance is a well-known allergen and one that no member of my family can tolerate. We must diligently read labels on everything from shampoo and toothpaste to headache remedies to avoid contact with this ubiquitous irritant. I was surprised and disappointed to see it listed as an ingredient on page after page.I found this book at the library, and I was very glad that I had not purchased it myself.A waste of money as far as the recipes go, although the illustrating photos are nice and the author's comments about attempting telepathy as a means of insect repellent are amusing."},{"Title":"Herbal Homekeeping: Simple Recipes for a Naturally Clean Abode","review":"The main ingredient in this book is &quot;sodium lauryl sulfate&quot; - NOT AN HERB. But a toxic chemical that if conbusted causes a toxic gas. Is this a GREEEN cleaning solution or just the same old thing.

We use our best judgement to pick and choose from the included recipes and sometimes just make a small batch to test them out.There is value in this book, but it is not of everyone.CFH"},{"Title":"Herbal Homekeeping: Simple Recipes for a Naturally Clean Abode","review":"This book is junk! As the other reviews state, she uses Sodium Laurl Sulfate in almost every recipe. People who want to make their own cleaners are trying to get away from chemicals like that.

They were the pieces which &quot;Anne&quot; loved. These were pieces that the girls in Lucy Montgomery's audience were very familiar. Many of these pieces have been lost from recognition and therefore the allusions are no longer understood.

In the genre, you couldn't ask for a better read, especially if you're fascinated by complex personalities and what makes people tick. Having read it years ago, I still remember the vivid characters. Volatile, unpredictable people (including a honey of a villain) are trapped in an enclosed environment, packed with intense emotions. The ending packs a wollop. A good, page-turning entertainment."},{"Title":"An Indecent Obsession","review":"This is her best book by far! I read it 15 years ago and have always wanted to do so again.

I found it at my girlfriends house and when I went home I found my mothers copy and sat there and read it to the end in one sitting. A great book and a well told story and I loved it but don't ask me why as I just don't know! It was made into a half decent movie not long ago as well."},{"Title":"An Indecent Obsession","review":"To begin with it takes a bit to get into, but once the characters are defined the story begins to make sense and you begin to feel what it must be like to be 'Sis'. The ending is a shock and what is least expected of Sis. This is a bit like The Thorn Birds, in that is contains forbidden love."},{"Title":"An Indecent Obsession","review":"I found this book a fairly engaging and quick read, but my overall reaction is not nearly as positive as the previous reviewers. It seems to me that Colleen McCullough had some interesting ideas about love and duty, and the relationship between them, and wanted to explore those ideas in this book. The characters seem kind of secondary; like puppets used to make the author's more abstract points, not really flesh-and-blood people. She's also a little heavy-handed with her themes; saying things along the lines of \\"and then she pulled down her nurse's veil, thus reasserting her duty over love,\\" as if the reader couldn't figure that out. I have to admit, though, that the book kept my interest until the end, so take my criticism with a grain of salt. At the end of the day, I thought it was good, but just could have been much better."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"Once again I had to find a book to read for a BOTM selection in one of the online book groups I participate in on Goodreads You'll love this one...!! A book club & more. The November BOTM was if we could not or did not want to read the two selected books we could read any other book that met the criteria for \\"Books to Movies\\". I originally had another book planned but seeing as though I just read Bambi yesterday there wasn't enough time for me to read my original choice of Tsotsi by Athol Fugard. However I do plan on working that on into my December reading plans.Anyways, I decided to pick a book that I'm pretty sure I had rad to me by my Dad as a kid but it was one that I couldn't remember. That's not to say I was unfamiliar with the beloved little fawn but lately I've been getting rather nostalgic about my childhood and the books I read or should have read. I think it's because of the holidays but in any case I decided to pick the one book that was the bases of one of my favourite Disney movies as a kid. Bambi.Since I've always had a soft spot for Bambi and his forest friends I was hoping I'd be in for a comical, light hearted read. Boy was I wrong. Then again I probably should have looked closer at the original publication date, and read that the book wasn't originally published in English. Usually I do my homework on my books but, obviously I was lazy so it was really surprising to find that the book wasn't at all as light, fluffy and carefree as I'd hoped. In fact Bambi was prone to being quite a spoiled little fawn with a bit of a streak where he placed himself above his animal friends.While I did still find the book enjoyable, a lot of what I thought would be in the book just wasn't. Often, Bambi would just walk off in the middle of the other characters talking to him and I couldn't help but wish that he was more like the Bambi in the animated film classic. Unfortunately he wasn't and this was a major let down for me.However, I do understand why he wasn't as loveable and carefree as we see him in the movies and that is because it was written almost 100 years ago and the books people enjoyed regardless of their age were much different back then. The writing is superb though and I fell in love with the authors story it was just the characterizations I had trouble with.Still, I liked the book. I thought it was great for me to be able to read the original story and I did get swept up in that nostalgic feeling while I read it so I believe this will be one of the books added to the \\"Read to Spawn\\" list I've created if I ever have kids and I can't wait to read the sequel to this beloved children's classic so look out for my review!Overall it was a good story, I think kids now may have a little difficulty with the harshness of Bambi's life but then again the book like the movie can be used as a good example as life and death for kids as a lesson. I also think that this is a good book for anyone to read regardless of their age because Bambi has been a movie icon for decades. Plus, this would be a great read aloud book for families with kids and/or teachers. While my rating may seem a little low I do believe that this book is an essential must have a on any young readers bookshelf."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I just got this book today and read the entire thing. It was very gripping both mentally and emotionally. Bambi was an alright book. I do not know if I will be reading it again, but it was a one of a kind read. After spending most of my life exposed to the Disney version of Bambi with the unconditionally loving mother and reserved loving father of Bambi, it was hard to read this book and have a semi-loving mother and a very closed-out father. Granted, this is without a doubt a more philosophical reading than a more of an enjoyment reading, it was very dark with few bright parts in the beginning.So in the sense of recommendation, it really all depends on what you as a reader are looking for. If you are looking for an old-style philosophy reading of truth and dark reality, I highly recommend this book.If you are looking for a joyous reading of what lead to one of the worlds most beloved deer characters and to read a joyous story of a fawn and his loving parents and forest adventures, I would not so much recommend this. For those of you looking for that, I recommend earlier prints of Bambi with \\"Disney\\" copyrighted on them.So overall as a book, it was very well done. Was very revealing of life while at the same time keeping it away from a history book feel of reading on philosophy.Like I said above, recommendation all depends on what you are looking for in this book."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I bought this book as a prelude to my revisiting the restored Disney film of \\"Bambi.\\" Like other readers I did enjoy reading the book though it is somewhat sad. As you know, if you've seen the original Disney film, it is about life and living and things in between and subsequently dying alone--as we all must.I collect children's stories and often try to analyze them from the perspective of Joseph Campbell's \\"The Hero's Journey,\\" as well as Jung's archetypes as described by Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz. I look for what is called mythic structure in the stories for children as well as for adults.In this story, the various animals, both human and otherwise, depict the mythic archetypes--trickster, shadow, threshold guard, and so on, generally according to their orientation as living creatures. The story serves me well in that regard.Though the book is considered a classic, I was not at ease over the way Bambi is learning the semantics of some terms: Being a newborn he must learn about danger, the meaning of danger and certain actions that do not depict danger. In one such scenario he sees his first butterfly, and exclaims \\"Look, look, Mother!\\" \\"There's a flower flying.\\" Well, okay, he doesn't realize that it's a butterfly, not a flower, but we are not given a clue as to how he learned the meaning of the term FLYING. He just seems to pluck that term out of thin air--no pun intended. There are many such examples that IMO weaken the story. In that regard I think the writer needed some editorial assistance from the publisher. I'm looking forward to seeing how the Disney film deals with such factors."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"My son really enjoyed this story. He was entertained since it had differences from the one \\"Bambi\\" story everyone is familiar with."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I read bambi for the first time about 2 years ago. I was 27 at the time, and i don't feel that you need to be a child to enjoy the book. It is a book that has a great story with lots of lovable characters. It shows life in the forest in a different way then what most people might think of it. How animals aren't stupid they just think and feel in a different way then people do and they aren't to be treated badly. For all the wonderful things in the book it can also be heartbreaking at times. It really moved me. It was one of those books that really makes you think after you read it. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"The original \\"Bambi\\" story is definitely so much better than the Disney cartoon, and yet, I felt it was such a sad story. As Bambi grows from childhood, there are so many dangers and tragedies he must overcome. A story of life, love, and ultimately, solitude, Bambi learns the lessons of nature. The happy moments are overwhelmed by the tragedies he must endure, including avoiding the \\"all-powerful\\" He or Man.Man definitely is the enemy, villain, and evil of the book. He relentlessly hunts down the animals of the forest and shoots them mercilessly. Even when one of the deer, Gobo, is taken in by Man, he is seen by the other animals as a pawn and slave -- \\"a poor thing.\\"Felix Salten's coming of age book is wonderfully written. The book follows the seasons and the cycle of life of the animals of the forest in poetic prose, including a passage on how leaves feel before they fall away from the branches to herald the coming winter.Ultimately, however, I was very saddened by Salten's story. Bambi and the other animals of the forest continually strive to survive, with many of them failing in the attempt. Bambi, in his quest to endure, finally shuns all those who were once so important to him. Although I loved the book, Disney's happy ending may actually be more satisfying."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I liked this book alot, in fact it's one of my favorites. ...

There is no Disney-like nobility in deer displaced by urban sprawl. And the illustration of a dead hunter in the snow is simply gratutitious violence."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"To all who are confused by sleek marketing: THIS IS NOT THE \\"REAL\\" BAMBI!!!The real \\"Bambi\\" is written by Felix Salten, period. And, it wasn't meant as a book for children. It is a philosophical tale about attaining knowledge, wisdom and the enlightenment, if you will. It is an allegory of human life, suffering and the ultimate quest for the TRUTH.That you can only infer from the original text by Salten, which today seems to be available only on vintage editions from the 20-s. TO give you an idea, the edition being reviewed is 192 pages long, and the 1929 edition of the Salten's text is 293 pages long (same size print). This is how much has been cut out of Salten's text, where IMO every word is thoroughly meaningful and irreplaceable.The continuous efforts to dumb down this book really makes me wonder. The sugar-coated Disney version of the story started the trend. The \\"adaptions\\", while claiming to return to authenticity, reduce the scope of the questions raised in the story to growing up and learning, and to the environmentalist \\\\ anti-hunting issues.No, it is much more than that. Do not settle for less, get the original. Borrow it from your local library if you must. And, read it to your kids -- they can handle its wisdom."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I first read Bambi 30 years ago and was lucky enough to find a 1929 copy that I will hold dear to my heart forever. The author takes you deep into the forest where you become one of the animals. You can feel the cold and smell the fear among them when the two-legged animal called &quot;Man&quot; arrives. It allows readers to immerse themselves in the world, seeing it from an animal's point of view.It's a great book to share with kids and a valuable learning experience about the ways of nature. At times it is cruel and very true to life. It teaches respect for our elders, and love of family. We stand back and watch Bambi grow stronger until he has a sense of wisdom that only experience can bring. This is truly a book to share with your kids. It is so much more than a Disney cartoon."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"The only reason I read Bambi by Felix Salten was because I thought the Disney movie was kind of &quot;cute.&quot;THE BOOK IS SOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER.This isn't exactly what you would call a children's book. Salten has written what some would almost call a satire about survival in the woods and the dangers of manpower. This book (along with Salten's other book, Fifteen Rabbits) has been the only book that has moved me to tears. This is a must-read for ANYONE. You won't be able to put it down. But, beware, there are some pretty moving and powerful scenes in this story, so have some kleenexes ready! (In the end, EVERY major character, including Faline, his father, etc., is killed except for Bambi and his two young children.)P.S.--If you liked this book, be sure to go out and read Salten's other book about forest life, except this time from a rabbit's point of view: Fifteen Rabbits. You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"Salten's 1929 children's story bears little resemblance to the famous animated version; no saccharine tale, this little masterpiece presents the story of the value of Life in the forest. In his Foreward to the original novel, British author John Galsworthy praises two elements of BAMBI: the realistic depiction of the challenges facing deer and other woodland creatures, as well as the light-hearted style of dialogue and witty comments on human nature. Translated into English, this literary gem has delighted readers for three generations, truly having earned its classic status.Born into a large family of deer, Bambi is not yet congnizant that he is the son of a prince. More observant and thougtful than the other fawns, young Bambi learns many harsh lessons about survival against Nature, other animals, and most of all Man--described as the ubiquitous, merciless predator with the pale face, HE. After winning his beloved Faline, Bambi matures over the seasons; but an essential part of his education is provided by his solitary mentor, the old stag. Can Bambi learn enough from him (and other species) to save his family from hated humankind, or will he study merely for his own self-preservation?Beneath the author's charming tale in which animals act and sound much like the humans they fear, there remains a serious underlying theme: man' wanton destruction of the forest for sport or amusement. Hinting at our moral obligation Salten subtly shames us--and our faithful pets--for blatant disregard or disrespect of nature. Disney's version is fine, but until you have read the original, you don't really Know Bambi. A story of personal growth and a gentle study in compassion, for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"This is not the nauseatingly cute and precious Disney version. This is the REAL Bambi, the version where a terrible creature called MAN is the enemy, and where the cute and cuddly forest creatures die, and die horribly because of said MAN.Like Black Beauty, Bambi is a plea for the rights of animals. The message was not lost on me as a young girl, nor is it lost on me now. The senselessness of hunting (my personal point of view) is described in terms an older child can understand--and remember. But a word to parents. Bambi's beloved, gentle, wonderful mother is shot and dies. That's enough to traumatize a young child right there (I didn't do so well with it either, and I was around 8 or 9). There is a vicious, graphically described forest fire. There is the death of the noble, revered (both by Bambi, the forest creatures, and the reader) Great Stag. In the end, Bambi comes into great stagdom himself, and we look to him to continue to try to save the forest and everybody in it.This is a book, however innocent it seems, that can literally change a life. It did mine, and I know it did others whom I knew and have met since. My lifelong horror of hunting definitely came from this book, as did my reluctance to \\"cull\\" the deer that run wild in suburban Pennsylvania, eating one's roses. I don't want them to do it, and I see the logical reason for a \\"cull,\\" but I cannot abide the thought.I think every older child should read this version of Bambi as part of one's coming of age. It's a masterpiece of its kind."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"This is an excllent book. It describes every detail. When you read this you will actually think that you are really there where the event is happening. My daughter who is 12 loved this book so much that she has already read it 4 times. It's about a young deer who grows up to be a handsome, strong prince. He faces many hard and sad times, and you may even cry a couple of times but it is a wonderful book! Your children will love this. If you like reading about animals you should love this story!"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"The book is head and shoulders above the overly cute Disney cartoon. It is not, however, just a children's book. Like the Grimm fairy tales, Bambi is a story with a message in social behavior and consequences of one's actions. From the book trivia side, it's quite interesting to learn that Whittaker Chambers, former member of the Communist Party of the USA and star witness at Alger Hiss' trial and author of &quot;Witness,&quot; translated Salten's book from the German in the 1920s, while Chambers was still an active CPUSA member. Makes one wonder what kind of message Chambers thought Salten had written...

I still am, but it's very different from the book and it seems like 15 minutes after you read the book. I could see EVERYTHING that was described in the text of the book. It really has an effect on emotions. Some things are lighthearted, some things are truly heart breaking, there's even a few laughs. Everything is described in much detail. I felt like, at one point, that I was Bambi running for the first time in the meadow, drinking in the warm air. I could hear the dogs barking, the hoofbeats, and the gunshots. I HIGHLY recommend it to nature lovers and fans of the film. Now I just need to read Bambi's Children!"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"Felix Salten's Bambi: A Life in the Woods is a masterpiece and an original. I agree with much of what others have written below about this book. I have this to add: Read the book to read about the character of Gobo. Also, I'm not sure it's an anti-hunting book. What does the last chapter mean? The book does not end with a fire as in the Disney version, but ends with something found on the ground. When you begin to ask yourself how this got there, you begin to see, it may not be what you first thought. To read Bambi: A Life in the Woods and then to read the rest of Felix Salten's writings is the greatest pleasure. The story of this forest continues in other books by Salten including Bambi's Children: The Story of a Forest Family, Perri, Fifteen Rabbits and A Forest World (my favorite). Other books by Felix Salten not to be missed are Good Comrades, Renni the Rescuer, Jibby the Cat, Florian the Emperor's Stallion, The Hound of Florence, and Samson and Delilah. Find them if you can.

It is lyrical in its descriptions of both the forest and the animal personalities that abound there. You will no doubt find people you know mirrored through these accounts. I was very much touched by chapter 8 - only mature adults will truly appreciate it! The story is honest and thought-provoking. I recommend it to teenagers and adults. I don't really know that it is good for children to read until they are fairly advanced as it introduces death plainly and touchingly."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"This is a very different book than the Disney movie.I realise at the time that the Disney animated movie caused something of a kerfuffle, since Bambi's mom is shot off-screen. In the book, things only start there. The novel, while well-written, is much more violent than one might expect, and is not especially appropriate for many children under 10.I do not recommend that people run out and buy this novel if their children thought Bambi, Farina, and Thumper were cute, the therapy bills will be astronomical."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I was very young the first time i read this book.

Whatever Your age, i promise You will love this story."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"The story is a little sad, but it is very interesting. There are a lot of animals in it, and anyone who likes animals would enjoy reading this book. It takes place in a forest and a meadow. The author uses lots of exotic names of animals such as sedgehens and yellow birds. The main enemy is man and He comes into the story a bit too much. The story is very detailed and does have lots of hard words, but it's worth reading.

Awful."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"Most people are familiar with the story of Bambi the deer from the Walt Disney animated film of 1942. Likely not as many people are aware of the fact that the movie is based on the book Bambi: A Life in the Woods by Austrian author Felix Salten, originally published in Austria in 1923. The standard English translation by Whittaker Chambers was published in North America by Simon and Schuster in 1928. It traces the life of Bambi, a male roe deer, from his birth through childhood, the loss of his mother, the finding of a mate, the lessons he learns from his father, and his experiences with the dangers posed by human hunters in the forest.Bambi is born in a thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over the course of the summer, his mother teaches him about the various inhabitants of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also a dangerous place. Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. While they are playing, they encounter the princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young. As Bambi grows older, his mother begins to leave him alone. While searching for her one day, Bambi has his first encounter with \\"He\\"--the animals' term for man. During the winter, hunters enter the forest, killing many animals including Bambi's mother. Gobo also disappears and is presumed dead. The novel then skips ahead a year to the third summer when Bambi is now sporting his second set of antlers. After Bambi battles and defeats first Karus then Ronno, he and Faline express their love for one another. However, as Bambi continues to age, he begins spending most of his time alone. When Bambi is later shot by a hunter, the old Prince rescues him.The two remain together until Bambi learns that there is \\"Another\\" over all creatures, including \\"Him.\\" The stag tells him that he has always loved him and calls him \\"my son\\" before leaving to die. In the end, Bambi meets with twin fawns. He thinks to himself that the girl fawn reminds him of Faline, and that the male was promising. Later, Salten wrote a sequel, Bambi's Children, that follows the lives of Bambi's twin offspring, Geno and Gurri. Disney's Bambi is less raw than the book. The novel, originally written for an adult audience and considered to be one of the first environmental novels, was thought too \\"grim\\" and \\"somber\\" for the young audience Disney was targeting, and was work required to adapt the story, severely downplaying the naturalistic elements. Some might object to what they see as the \\"anti-man\\" and \\"animal rights\\" theme of the book, but if one takes it as it was originally intended, simply a fantasy look at the kind of lives that animals experience in the forest, it is an interesting story. A few of the killing scenes might be a bit too much for small or sensitive children, but we did it as a family read aloud and everyone enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"Most of my generation, when they think of Bambi, think of the sentimental Disney movie. But the original book was a serious work. Its one-of-a-kind conception and spectacular writing have earned it classic status as the story of a young deer growing to adulthood in his woodland home. Salten's writing is compelling, and scenes from the story will stay in the mind long after reading, to be often recalled and savored. This Bambi lives a grim and dangerous life, his world filled with blood and fear -- and most of his troubles emanate from the dreaded Man.Bambi's response to his pitiless world is to emulate his distant father, exiling himself from the company of others -- even Faline, his mate. In abandoning these relationships, he chooses a solitary life in which he accepts loneliness (his own and Faline's) as the price of his safety.There is a clear sense that Bambi's coming-of-age is defined by no longer needing to rely on others. His relationship with his father begins when the old stag rebukes him for calling his mother: \\"Your mother has no time for you. Can't you stay by yourself?\\" Later in life, his father befriends him and teaches him to move through the forest so that he is never seen. The relationship ends when his father leaves him to die alone. Bambi then passes on the heritage of solitude by rebuking two fawns for crying after their mother.In contrast to this message of isolationism, the Bible teaches that a solitary existence falls short of God's plan (Genesis 2:18). Rather than affirming interdependence as a sign of weakness, Scripture teaches that people are meant to live in community (Ecclesiastes 4:12; 1 Corinthians 12:12; and Hebrews 10:24-25). Rather than becoming stronger when we withdraw from others, being alone actually makes us more vulnerable to attack.The romantic appeal of Bambi's self-chosen exile has an especial attraction in our individualistic culture. Adults will need to use discernment about when a child is ready for this book. The reader ought to be mature enough to critically engage Salten's perspective without being drawn into his isolationist impulse. Since the message is embedded in a masterfully written story, parents should be cautious about introducing it too early, but at the right time it ought to provide excellent material for discussion."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I purchased this book for my 8 year old who needed it for a school project. The vocabulary used in this book is a bit difficult. I also found it to be quite different than the Disney movie and other written versions of the story. The author, Felix Salten, uses elaborate descriptions and you will feel as if you are actually in the woods with the deer! I recommend this book, but please be aware that it is not \\"sugar coated\\" like the movie!"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"People think of Bambi as being a book for young children. It is actually a strong political statement. It is very interesting for adults as well. You may or may not agree with the political statement.Carl Platt"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"The book tells the story of the deer Bambi growing up. It starts with his being born and growing up to be the great prince of the forest in the end. Bambi has friends like Faline, Gobo, Aunt Emma, all the Moms, friend hare, the birds, the fox, and the stag. There is also Man, who is dangerous.The best part about Bambi is when Bambi says to the fawns \\"don't you know how to stay by your selves?\\" This shows Bambi is all grown up now. Bambi now knows how to be careful of danger. I also like the part when bambi and Faline play chase.The lesson is to not be foolish, like Gobo, and to look after yourself. The end.

I read Bambi when I was about 10, and it made a great impact upon my outlook on life as a child. It is so poetic and simple but it cuts deep, and it's a hard book to forget. Now that I'm in college, I made my boyfriend read it, and he said it was one of the best children's lit. books he's ever read! It is extremely effective in all aspects. Don't forget to read Bambi's Children by the same author!!"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"My wife and I recently read this book to our young children. Neither of us had ever read it as children. Our children loved hearing the story of the \\"real\\" Bambi and were sad on the nights we were unable to read to them from it. Bambi was written not just for children and when you understand the author was a Jew who fled Nazi persecution in early 20th Century Europe, it gives you a better understanding of, and appreciation for, the underlying tones. It should also be noted that this book was banned by the Nazis because the author's ancestry. So you may enjoy reading a \\"banned\\" book, both for you and/or your child. Our children loved the story. Although some of the material is a little violent for very small children, our children were able to deal with it okay. The story contains much more than just childrens themes, such as growing up and becoming independent. It also has the theme of equality, and not ever thinking of oneself as inferior to others just because they might have more power than you or your group. I am very grateful that my wife and I were able to read this to our children and share the experience with them. I was also grateful to learn about the author and what he went through in his lifetime. It is a book that you should most definitely consider sharing with your child/children."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I love this work. This of course the the story that was made into the now classic animated Disney film. This not not like the Disney film at all. Now I am rather fond of the film and can remember my mother taking it to it shortly after the war (WWII) and of course have since taken my children and grandchildren to see the same. This book/story though, is far superior in my opinion. Actually, read as an adult, it is quite profound, dealing with quite a number of issues. Relationships between parent and child, child and peers and nature and man. I do not feel you can classify this work as an antihunting story. It more or less puts and keeps man in his place in the big picture of things, for better or for worse. Like another reviewer, I was particularly fascinated with Bambi's friend who became a \\"pet of man.\\" There is a lesson here as to following ones nature. I am not sure I completely understand the message, but know it is there. Yes, this work does deal with death and dying and yes there is sad parts. I personally don't feel children should be sheltered from such things completely as they all will eventually have to face the same feelings and dilemmas. I hate to use the word \\"classic\\" as it is quite often over used, but know of no other way to describe this one. I do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"This book is simply undescribable...When I first read it, I was expecting it to be similar to the movie. Big mistake! What I found was a wonderful look into the world of deer, and what they just may be thinking about us. There are some truly startling scenes, and quotes that may inspire you. I, personally was inspired by the following..\\"Faline interrupted, '...Our mother says he's one of those people who don't want anything to do with the world.''Maybe he's only afraid,' Gobo said.\\"\\"'You poor Thing'\\"The pure and raw emotion that Salten can create astounds me.

Why buy this version by Janet Schulman when you can have the original written by Felix Salten himself? Is Salten's version out of copyright? Is someone else trying to make money off of it?"},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"The language is simple, yet poetic. The themes are joyful, sad, at times cruel, yet always with an understandable purpose essential to the deer's survival in the woods. Salten literally takes you into the mind of a deer and views the whole woodland world through their sometimes naive, curious, but cautious, and always learning eyes. Each chapter of this book contains so many wonderful surprises and delights that to name any of them here would surely be spoilers. Suffice to say, this is NOT Disney's Bambi, (not that there's anything wrong with that), but there is so much more here than what you experienced with that lovely film. I recommend this book to anyone, no matter what their age, for there is something here to delight even the most cynical."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"Do not let yourself by misled into thinking that this is nothing more than a children's book.

The imagery and perspective is amazing. It goes so much deeper than the Disney movie. I wouldn't recommend it for young children (it would probably be over their heads) but it is not long either. Everyone that has grown up watching this movie should read this book."},{"Title":"Bambi A Life in the Woods","review":"I note, with other reviewers, that I read the original, 293-page text by Salten. I have not read this abridged version, and generally despise abridged versions. The original should be read, not this tripe. So this review is of the original.I don't deny that this book is well written, although I hardly think it should go in the 'classic' category: the writer has nowhere near the talent of the true 'great' authors.My problem is that, as a children's book, the book is disturbingly ideological. And I don't mean the 'antihunting' bit: it goes far beyond that. There are two philosophical themes which drive the novel:1. Man is a Plague on Nature. Nature, in its integrity, is a happy, Edenic paradise where no violence or mishaps occur and it is perpetually springtime. (Granted, one winter things get a little nasty when the animals start starving, but this is an incidental and brief occurrence.) The only shadow that falls over Nature is Man, the unnamed despicable 'He'. Not only the hunters (incidentally, the most repulsive part of the novel is the hunter 'invasion', where one gets the impression of hundreds of hunters waging an all-out assault on the woods, with machine guns, killing indiscriminately. I don't know any hunters who hunt like that, or would even find it fun. It's an utterly preposterous caricature of hunting), man in general is evil. Even when man tries to LOVE the animals (taking in a wounded deer, feeding it and fondling it and nursing it back to health, this is judged as evil, since it lowers teh animals' guard and makes it vulnerable to the perpetual evil of man. The second to last chapter of the book finds Bambi gloating over the corpse of a dead man, rejoicing that man, too, is mortal, and can be killed. One gets the impression that the sequel will have an animal 'counter-attack' against Man.2. Nature Finds Its Fulfillment in Loneliness, not Society. While the book opens in a happy, woodsy society of family, friends and distant relatives, it gradually winnows all of this. Many are killed off, denounced as traitors, gored and maimed as competition for mates, or simply abandoned in dismay. Bambi's 'mentor' is an old stag who has abandoned society and become a hermit in the woods, distrusting everyone. His father has abandoned him, which is claimed to be normal. Bambi abandons his mate and his own children. The last chapter of the book finds him happening upon his former mate and fleeing in disgust, and then happening upon two children crying for their absent mother - he tells them to stop whining and grow up. Get used to it. The implication is that only babies whine for society, for family; becoming mature means abandoning the company of others. Now, this may in fact be 'true' for the deer species, but it's hardly a lesson I want my kids learning.I read my children classic books all the time. This was the only book I had to spend an entire day having a 'talk' about afterwards, to address some of the ideological concerns raised above. Who would have thunk the most ideologically dangerous book for my children would have been Bambi?Now, readers may have different feelings about these themes. Some may agree with the 'man as plague on nature' philosophy. Others may agree that children need to be taught that abandonment of one's family is part of life. But for my own children, I want to push the opposite lessons. Yes, man may choose to destroy nature, but he also has an opportunity, and in fact an obligation, to nurture and assist nature towards its own perfection. Yes, some level of independence is a part of growing up, but mankind reaches his fulfillment primarily through fellowship with family and society, not through isolation and loneliness. So, yes, read it, and have your kids read it, but only when they're ready for these very difficult themes, and be sure to talk about it afterwards."},{"Title":"The Wooden Shepherdess ( The Human Predicament II)","review":"I have all of his books and have read them all several times.

Only she happens to have a friend who became president of the United States and her business became handling his affairs and advising his administration. Moreover, she had to perform her duties through one of the most embattled elections in presidential history and through the first attack on American shores since Pearl Harbor - and do it all while still maintaining a working relationship with her husband and son!A master of communication, Karen Hughes weaves an exciting tale of her life from journalism student to trusted aide of the most powerful man in the world. The first chapter of \\"Ten Minutes From Normal\\" (a phrase which Hughes plucked from a train conductor on a long train ride during the campaign) summarizes her tug-of-war with career and family and why she left what many would consider a dream job in order to move back to Texas with her family and live a normal life. The first chapter quickly flashes back to the roots of the author's childhood, replete with a number of stories that helped shape her early life. We then learn of Hughes's developing interest in journalism, her crossover from television news to chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, and eventually, her first meeting with George W. Bush.Hughes goes into great detail in recounting her first meeting with the man who would one day be president. Her affection and loyalty for Bush is evident to even the most disinterested reader, reinforcing the pain of her decision to leave the president in the midst of war for the best interests of her family.\\"Ten Minutes From Normal\\" lacks the knock-down, drag-\`em out partisan bickering and commentary typical of most books put out by today's political figures. What it does give the reader is something far better (and a more lasting contribution to the literary world) - a complete, behind-the-scenes look at American politics. Hughes lets the reader into her world, a world where politics is real, decisions cost lives, and war is real.

A thankless job, no doubt. Only a Polly Anna would expect anything but dogma from this writer, who is proud of her work as the Spin-mistress of the Bush team (listen to her NPR interview of March 31, 2004). With so many Republicans fearing for the Republic and embarrassed by the lunatic fringe (Bill O'Rielly, Anne Coulter, Denis Miller, etc.), apparently there is no one outside the White House capable to do the job. Or maybe there is no one outside the White House willing to do the job.Gosh, wouldn't be great if someone published a book that actually tried to find the middle ground? Yes, Virginia, it would, but US politics is like Little League, where the parents threaten to beat the kids if they don't win the game, a fight could break out at the refreshment stand, and the Umpire hopes his tires are not slashed so he can make a quick escape after the game.

If success at any expense leaves one putting family, friends, faith low on the priority list, this book is real treat.Karen Hughes tells us of her plight with becoming significant advisor to the President and the sacrifices of her son and husband and normal life to aid in the countries business. Guilt is a tough taskmaster and she reveals her wrestling with its demands and justifications until she comes to the conclusion to rethink her life's priorities.It's comparable to riding on the back of a tiger--- both alternatives are unattractive: get off vs. stay on for the wild ride. She shares some of her earnest tradeoffs with the developing priorities in this talented journalist, Christian, mom and wife, friend.In all this we get not only a great background view of this history making lady but also of the company she keeps: all the significant newsmakers of our day.This reader also was extremely impressed and thankful for her several clear and wonderful confessions of Christ as her savior.The book is extremely well written and is just delightful and insightful reading, and her sense of humor and humility pervades: Chiding herself throughout for not having much of the gift of vocal music, she will be a great singer in heaven!Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"If you have a conservative bone in your body and would like to find renewed faith in those at the top of our government, please read this book.

It is an honest, feel-good account of her life and service to this country and the President of the United States during her years with George W.

Ms. Hughes, although frank, stays way, way up on the high ground throughout her personal story. Perhaps too much so... but that is her nature I suspect, and if it suits her then nobody should mind.

Really, if you hate Hughes/Bush, fine, but if you review a book, review the book."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Civilized people can disagree about George Bush, but only his most grudging detractors can deny, especially in the wake of the last election, that the man knows how to sell an agenda. Be it tax cuts, education reform, the war on terrorism, or privatizing social security, the president has evidenced an acute awareness of the power of words to sell his agenda, an ironic intuition from someone so vilified for the verbal gaffes that pepper his speeches. Perhaps overcompensation for his oracular shortcomings led him to cultivate sharp, articulate people like Karen Hughes.Hughes has had few rivals for George Bush's ear from the moment she joined the staff of his campaign for governor in 1994, following stints as a journalist and Texas Republican party operative. The affinity between the two is easy to see, as Hughes'accounts of some amusing but trenchant exchanges bear witness. \\"George W. laughed at my exuberance,\\" Hughes recounts in the early days of the first gubernatorial campaign. \\"'You love everything,' he told me once. 'You love spring, you love fall, you love summer, you love winter, you love the beach, you love the small towns, you love the mountains..'\\" Coming from an action oriented optimist of the first order, this was high praise indeed. And, as it turned out, a shrewd evaluation of someone who soon turned positive thinking into electoral victories.Hughes was born an army brat, and recounts her early years with fondness, giving credit to her parents' mixture of affection and discipline for the value system that drives her own ambition. After some peripatetic years which saw the family through stints in Europe, the US and Central America, the Parfitts settled in Texas, and Karen began to fuse an innate passion forwords with a growing interest in conservative ideology.Her love for language suffuses these memoirs, and seems as genuine as her affection for her erstwhile boss. It's clear that her ability to frame a message with words chosen for economy and eloquence played a crucial role in driving public opinion toward George W., removing the stigma of lightweight attached to his name and draping him with the mantle of neo-conservative visionary. The man we now know as W, number 43, comes to us courtesy of Karen Hughes and Co.The author herself comes across as a likeable if somewhat exhausting type, energized by conflict and driven by a constant need to set the record straight. She has an acute sense of the rightness and superiority of the policies she and her boss are prescribing for the nation, and she presents them in this book with the same winning assurance that brought her such triumph on the campaign trail. She has faith in few things--God, country, family, and the power of words, not necessarily in that order. She telegraphs the feeling that, with your heart and your words in the right place, there's no mountain that can't be moved.One has to feel a little for her husband, though her treatment of him here is filled with respectful admiration. A single father and practicing attorney when he met Karen Parfitt, Jerry Hughes already had a failed marriage behind him and a daughter to raise when he met the driven young campaign worker. He probably had no idea exactly what he was in for when they married in the mid 80s, and the success of their union is due in no small part, and by Karen Hughes own admission, to Mr. Hughes' ability to subsume his own needs and interests to that of his spouse.All this fusion of the political and the personal makes for a great story, and Karen Hughes tells it well, and with characteristic focus and clarity. The irony, then, is that it's her main message, and the theme of her autobiography overall, that's the hardest to buy. According to her well known story herfamily's life,particularly that of her teenage son, suffered immeasurable upheaval by the move to DC to join Bush's administration in 2001. All through the early days of legislative acitivism and the horrors of 9/11, she maintains, her family suffered in silence because of her need to discharge her duty to the President and the nation. At some point, the conflict became untenable, and she made the only choice that a wife and mother with conservative values could possibly make. She gave it up, pulled up stakes, and moved home to Texas for the sake of her son.But wait a minute. Hughes herself was an army brat, who managed to deal with the separations and disruptions that result from following a parents' career. To her credit she never once evinces bitterness about these experiences, and even embraces them as stimulating and formative. Why shouldn't she expect the same thing from her own son? After all, she wasn't moving the family to take a promotion to product manager for Colgate in Cleveland. She was working for the President of the United States, and was offering her child a once in a lifetime experience to live and learn at the highest level of American society. Couldn't he deal with e-mailing his friends in Texas while he attended a posh private school in an exciting city and watched his mother make history? Even after all Karen Hughes' tortured explications for her decision, this reader still came away skeptical that this was the whole story.But regardless of one's read on her motivations, Karen Hughes' story is a timely and resonant one in modern American life. She emerges as a post-feminist archetype, rejecting any kind of self-definition through victimhood. Now that her son is a big boy of 18, it remains to be seen what inevitable, meaniningful role she'll carve out for herself next from the sharp rocks of American political life."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Reading the book and then hearing her mud slinging shows the hypocritical nature of this book and the Bush employee that she is."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Okay, I voted for Bush in 2000. I thought this book would give me insight into his administration. Instead, I get a book full of fluff and stories about cheeseburgers! Don't waste yer money on this."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I am a Bush backer, but this book is fluff. This is ten minutes of a waste of time. Here's the premise:1. Karen admires George2. George gets to White House3. George becomes our best president (based on hughes criteria mind you, rather objective analysis)4. Karen leaves George because husband is jealous5. 9/11 happens.6. George and Karen talk on 9/12, Karen advises George on what kind of cheese to have on cheeseburger.7. Karen goes back to White House to save the dayThere, you just read the book."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"What a complete suck up! This is pure trash looking for another suck up to buy it. No insight here, just a boring broad with an ax to grind about liberal Americans. Talk about hate mongering...this fool takes the cake. If this is the best and the brightest of the Bush Administration, our Country is in very sad shape...but then, who didn't know that already without reading this paper waste. This crap isn't even worth burning. Recylcle the paper already!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Whoa. Karen Hughes has her own meaning of Normal and she comes off as a happy, well-adjusted woman. Good for her. I liked her honesty in telling her story and feel the writing isn't bad. It's not good--but it's not bad. One expects more from such a self-proclaimed successful former journalist and contributing speech writer for a god.In terms of a good read? Don't waste your time. This book has a single dimension: Unfailing praise for &quot;her boss,&quot; George W. Bush. She's like a groupie--or like Courtney Cox when she got pulled on stage during a Bruce Springsteen concert--thrust into the limelight and wondering how it all happened to her.It is among the most boring and self-aggrandizing memoirs I've ever read. Glad I only borrowed it from a friend. My apologies to the author. I wanted to like it."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"More evidence of the disaster of the GW Bush presidency. Karen Hughes is not a really good writer and not really very forthcoming. She is a good shill for dead politcal slogans. More evidence that Texas is an evil place, Texas is more of a threat to America than Bin Laden. GW Bush has failed in every aspect of business and diplomacy. You wouldn't know this from reading Hughes' hagiography. I will never voted again for someone from the south or who has a southern accent. They all seem fake. They all seem like con men. I start thinking who is getting ripped off."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book! It is like having an inside look into the life of our president and some of the people who work closely with him. It is easy reading and very interesting. It is also very inspiring.Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This is my fifth attempt to articulate why I loved this book. I have so much in common with this woman in terms of values, concerns, priorities, etc. I sometimes forget that these people are just regular folks, too. Her sincerity was refreshing, her boldness inspiring, and her commitment remarkable. It was so fun to get a behind the scenes look at the Bush campaign and Presidency. Lastly, I thought she was more than kind in her view of the press.With regard to the various single star reviews, you seem a bit confused. I'm hear to help. Let's follow the thread together...IF you like your bossTHEN you have nice things to say about him/herELSE you have ugly things to say about him/her"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"After sixty years of heavy reading, I don't often find a book that engages and inspires me as much as this one did. The book is forthright (which you would expect), informative and entertaining. It helps to explain how Karen became the role model toward whom I can point my granddaughters. We're proud to call her a Texan.P.S. I had to laugh at her disdain for make-up---a disdain shared by my granddaughters and me. I hope she has discovered Lauren Hutton's &quot;good stuff&quot; which is effective, understated, comfortable, and long lasting."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"While being no fan of Hughes, I was concerned when she left the White House. When an administration official says they're leaving to 'spend more time with their families.' is usually code for, 'I'm leaving because of unreconcilable differences'Now we find out that she left the White House to write a book about 'spending time with her family', (which in reality is just cheerleading pap for the bush administration)And she accuses Richard Clarke of political aggrandizement and profiteering?"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen writes this book with such honesty and love. I am not a fan of President Bush but this book was worth buying. Karen Huges is up front and frank about her job and her boss. She enjoyed her work in Texas and Washington but takes her family back to Texas to be a wife and mom. This is one wonderful lady."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Liberals... so transparent, so desperate! LOL!Writing reviews for a book that's not even available until tomorrow!You're clearly ticked off because Clarke's book has been so thoroughly debunked and discredited that it won't hit the best-seller list.And Condi's about to eat his lunch for him. Clean his clock. Fix his maladjusted wagon.Oh, I love it! It must be painful to be a Bush-hater these days - defeated on every front, losing at every draw, failing in every feint.Heck, even that pathetic anti-war effort you tried to pull together turned out to be more about supporting Palestine than protesting the war. LOL!Go, Karen! Hope you sell a billion copies! I'll buy one!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Just reading the two reviews by liberal writers made me buy the book. My advice to these nasty people: keep it up! You will help Karen Hughes sell lots of books."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Unlike the other reviews I've seen on this book so far, I will admit I haven't read it yet. I would appreciate a review from someone who actually read the book and not just some review-flaming liberal who feels conservatism of any kind should be squashed before anyone even has a chance to hear it. If you are just some hate-filled liberal, please don't bother posting your hate here. If you actually read the book and have an objective opinion, by all means."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This is so warm and witty, I wish I had written it. I also wish I had read it. I can not tell a lie, I have only read about 1/4 of this book while standing at Barnes and Noble. But that quarter was enough to make me fall in love with Karen and her book.I also saw her on TV recently and she is just as charming in person as she is in the book. I have been to Normal, IL, and could just see the trainman saying: &quot;Ten minutes to Normal&quot;.Her intimacy with the president and her closeness to power is probably more genuine than any similar person, and come to think of it, even Condy Rice and Madeline Allbright lack what I will call her &quot;Luminosity&quot;. For some reason, I compare Karen to the 19th Centruy writer E.D.E.N. Southworth in her writing style?I will be back when I have truly read the other 3/4 of the book."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Surely Dr. Laura must be having a fit, what with Ms. Hughes abandoning her teenagers, causing them to become latchkey kids, just so she can selfishly re-enter the rat race. It's not all about YOU, Ms. Hughes, your role is as a mother to your children. Further, when you stepped down as advisor to the president a year ago to return to your family, it's clear now that you spent all that time writing a book! A book! And now, a year later, the book finished, you're returning to the White House!As Dr. Laura says, children (especially teenagers) are in need of parental guidance, and a stay-at-home mom whose focus is on THEM, not professional aspirations."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"When Karen Hughes resigned her White House post, the stated reason was to &quot;return to Texas and spend more time with her family.&quot; Her only child at home was a teenage boy, and we all know how much they love spending hours and hours of quality time with Mom. So it's hard to imagine how this ruse could have fooled anyone, except perhaps John Candy and Eugene Levy, starring as Yash and Stan Shmenge, who quit touring to &quot;spend more time with the family, yah,&quot; in the mockumentary, &quot;The Last Polka.&quot;Hughes has been making $50,000 a speech, and has been consulting regularly from Texas with the RNC. For many years, she says she's served as Dubya's touchstone on what &quot;everyday people&quot; think, do, and want. What's &quot;everyday&quot; about making more for one speech than most folks do in a year? I'd say she's several years from &quot;normal&quot;: her job hasn't been outsourced.Oh, those tousled blonde Republican Everymoms! It's just so inspiring!P.S. Amazon.com has shipped a number of books to me before the official pub date. Whether this is actually allowed by the publishing companies, I don't know. But the books have arrived."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Most political books have an axe to grind, a story to tell, but Karen Hughes provides an insightful and thoughtful inside glimpse into the life of a campaign consultant, friend, wife, and mom. It is a refreshing read by someone who at long last has not been changed by Washington, but by sheer force of her will and good Christian spirit may have done a little to change Washington.This book is not a dry political memoir, nor is it a kiss and tell biography, nor is it a payback opportunity, nor is it a slap-myself-on-the-back memoir. Instead, its a thoughtful, honest chronicle of a hard-working woman's ascent to the top of the political spectrum and how she never abandoned what was important to her.You will find a new and fresh look at President Bush and the way he thinks, operates, and the personal causes that beat at his heart. Even if you're on the opposite side of the political divide, you'll enjoy the behind-the-scenes look at the men and women who give their lives, often unappreciated and misunderstood, to serve their country. Many of them are devoting their time and energy out of a sense of duty to the land they love.What you will find in this book that few other White House tales will share is the common, everday occurences in a political campaign. Such as the logistics of travel as well as personal things, like arranging for a son's schooling or the impact of moving your family. This was really neat.Most of all, the Bush team presented by Karen Hughes comes across as loving, compassionate, and genuinely interested in the welfare of the American people. Not the partisan, emotionless, attack dogs they have been characterized as by the media.This book was a pleasure to read and I encourage anyone interested in a mom's perspective of a campaign to read Ten Minutes From Normal. Its amazing how far we've come, that a busy housewife can become the President's most trusted and frank adviser."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen Hughes is a brilliant communicator and master of the anecdote and the parable. For those who have heard Karen Hughes before, this book will not have much of anything new. But I walk away from this book with the same sense I had walking away from her last speech. Be afraid. Be very afraid. This woman is brilliant, a master manipulator, and a fanatic. Her stories truly are masterful, often appearing as though they address an issue, and for the vast majority of Americans who do not stop to think and consider the logic, the manipulation and irrelevance of her story to her point is lost. As a woman, a parent, and a person who cares about having a habitable world, I can only thank God that Bush Jr. is not as smart as Karen Hughes."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book really hits home, Karen has a keen ability to take the reader to the heart of the President as no one I have seen before. This book is more than memorys, its a insitefull look at a journey of a insider, I can't recommend this book more,, its great.."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"but was not surprised by customer reviews including such comments as, &quot;Anyone who criticizes this book clearly hasn't read it and just plain hate Republicans and/or George Bush.&quot; I have not read the book and it is logical that I should not criticize it. I *have*, however, read some of the customer reviews and &quot;defensive&quot; would be the word I would use. This repeated theme among Bush supporters of &quot;if you criticize him it is because you hate him, nothing else&quot; is getting to be disturbing. Surely even Bush supporters do not think he is beyond criticism? If not, I suggest you spend some time studying history and you may find that the leaders associated with this kind of mindless support are *not* the ones you'd most like to emulate.By the way, I gave three stars because it wouldn't let me post without doing it - figure an average score shouldn't mess up the consensus of ratings for the book."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book far exceeded my expectations. I loved the insight to the political process and George Bush's thoughts. A must read for this fall!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Self-aggrandizing drivel. Save your money."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"so I'll chime in again. Again, haven't read the book, don't intend to waste the time, have read the customer reviews. Comments such as &quot;If you are just some hate-filled liberal, please don't bother posting your hate here,&quot; are *dead on*, with one caveat (if you are pro-Bush you will likely ignore said caveat): that goes for mindless, cheerleading conservative praise from those who *also* haven't read the book, and never will. Let's have reviews that are fair and balanced (no, no - not the Fox news version - the *real* thing).Again 3 stars so as not to disrupt whatever consensus is building."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Mythology about the scion of old money from New England who pretends to be a good ole boy from Texas. She has obviously read her Herr Goebbels. The only way to cut through the illusions spun by this work of propaganda is to hold it in one hand with a collection of the writings of Joseph Goebbels in the other, and compare the two, since her book is so obviously informed by the great master of illusion weaving. It was Goebbels who said:&quot;Admit nothing, deny everthing, make counter accusations.&quot;Sounds like the Bush administration has absorbed that philosophy to a T."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Bush's Dominatrix Hughes is a consumate liar and expert at intellectual abuse and manipulation. The ONLY reason anyone should read this book is to \\"know thine enemies\\"!The very idea that my tax dollars pay her salary let alone some moron publisher thought he/she could cash in on the ignorance of the average American is infuriating beyond belief. They KILLED TREES for this bimbo?This dumbed down treatise on her nauseating reveling in her personal arrogance and hubris is a perfect example of why this nation has become so detested around the world."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I started to read this book, but then after about twenty pages I quit because I realized that here was a lady who went &quot;home&quot; to be with her family, supposedly. While in actuality she went home to write this book. She obviously was putting us on when she said she wanted to be near her family. Once she got the book finished she went back to Washington under the guise of &quot;being needed&quot;. Come on now, she must think we're all stupid. Apparently all she wanted was a little time off to make some money on her own, instead of being on the government dole."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This is a ridiculously self-indulgent memoir, not worth the paper it's written on. The fat lady has sung, loud and clear.Don't bother!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Atlanta, Georgia- Karen Hughes who served under President George W. Bush in the White House heard the words we are \\"ten minutes form normal\\" on a trip. She made a note that would be an excellent title to a book and she wrote one with that title.This book is more than politics but the struggle of the modern woman to juggle career, family, and faith in her daily life.Ten Minutes from Normal by Karen Hughes takes you from her days growing up to the inner sanctum of the halls of power. All the while, Hughes keeps grounded and serves as a sounding board to the nation's chief executive.She left her post as Counselor to the President after 18 months to move back to Texas and realign her values with her lifestyle."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that is concerned with a work/life balance. Karen Hughes was at that pinnacle of here career working for the President of the United States and she did what many would see as the unthinkable...Most of us are concerned that we are not spending enough time with our family, with our faith, with ourselves, with work and we are in constant catch up mode to try to fit it all in but what can we do?While Mrs. Hughes is not a politician and is decidedly conservative this book deals with how life and work can go hand in hand. She talks in frank detail about how consuming her job was and what lead her to be in that position. What would you do in her position? She walks you through the \\"behind the scenes\\" of the Bush White House and examines that impact of a job within the White House has on the family regardless of the administration."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book is sinking like a stone on bestseller lists as people come to learn that's it's little more than a salivating lapdog's sycophantic apologia for a failed president. It's normal to look at George Bush and see a liar, a flip flopper, a man who treats war as though it were a video game and is in way over his head in the oval office. What's abnormal is for a reputedly intelligent woman to remain loyal to such a man. Hughes and Condi should join a therapy group!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"As a female conservative, I feel that I should support other strong female conservatives in the public eye. But I have one thing to say to Karen Hughes:SHAME ON YOU.Not only is this book a poorly-disguised toadying hymn to a president that I'm not sure that even I will support again, it obfuscates any solid facts with meaningless rhetoric. It is also some of the worst writing I have ever read.Not to mention the fact that no matter where you stand on the abortion issue, to equate pro-rights activists with terrorists is perhaps the dirtiest trick that this increasingly dubious administration has pulled to date. I personally do not believe in abortion: but after this book and Ms. Hughes recent quotes, I no longer believe in Bush."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"What a waste of paper. Do not waste your time on this book, unless you want to learn deep facts like what kind of cheese Ms. hughes recommended that George bush put on his cheeseburger on 9/12/2001. good lord, is this what our country has come to? As a life-long Republican, I am appalled."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book is a delightfully syrupy love letter to the \\"real man\\" Karen Hughes always wanted to be. She graciously shows us the George W. Bush that the liberal media just won't let us see.He's very compassionate (\\"If my dog Barney was a real person, I'd give him a helluva big tax cut!\\") He's intellectually curious (\\"Do you know where they put my coloring book?\\") He's unfailingly polite (\\"Would you please ask the Vice President if I could run the country for a little while?\\")\\"Ten Minutes From Normal\\" is also chock full of insider name dropping (\\"As Condi Rice said to me. . .\\" or \\"As I once told Pervez Musharef. . .\\" or \\"As Konrad Adenauer once whispered in my ear . . .\\"). Oddly, many of the names would almost certainly be mysterious to the current resident of the Oval Office.Karen Hughes' stark candor about the object of her affection begs the question: Where is the righteous indignation from White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan about opportunistic White House insiders who write books about their former boss?The author, who constantly reminds us of what a devoted mother she is, sets the worst possible example for her children by fabricating lies for a living. Karen Hughes is such a talented weaver of contemporary myth that she makes Edith Hamilton look like a slacker."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I was so thrilled when my mother-in-law purchased this book for me this weekend! Unfortunately, this book was not only a disappointing read but has led me to rethink my admiration for Hughes. I understand that life in D.C. changes even the best of people but I was shocked by Hughes' confession that she spent $40,000 on a Prada hangbag.I found myself crying for Hughes' son at several points during the book. While I'm sure that Karen felt she was answering to a higher cause when she went to work for the President in D.C., as a mother myself I cannot personally understand how a woman could leave her 13-year-old alone for weeks at a time! It did seem like she learned her lesson when he burnt down the kitchen and half of the garage trying to reheat cold pizza though.One thing I did like about this book was that Hughes shared her personal beauty secrets with her readers. I've been admiring her highlights ever since she got them and I already bought a bottle of Sun-In - I only hope that I can acheive such great results. The bacon grease facial thing worked really well.Overall, I walked away with a few good skin care tips and little else. Save your money and donate it to your church or some other good cause!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I read this book straight through as soon as I bought it, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is an honest, feel-good account of her life and service to this country and the President of the United States during her years with George W. Bush's Gubernatorial and Presidential administrations.Other positive reviews have covered the content of her book so nicely I find little else I might add.If a reader is looking for barbs and insider gossip, don't expect to find much - if any - in this book. Ms. Hughes, although frank, stays way, way up on the high ground throughout her personal story. Perhaps too much so... but that is her nature I suspect, and if it suits her then nobody should mind. It is slightly tortuous in its grammatical correctness and makes one long for a simpler writing style, but this is faint criticism when there is so much to enjoy about her storytelling.Well worth buying!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"A poorly written paean to our Worst President Ever. A cheap suck-up piece.The one thing I learned from this book is that the woman responsible for the &quot;John Kerry looks kinda French&quot; smears that circulated early in the campaign was herself born in Paris.She looks kinda...Soviet...to me."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I am troubled that someone would sell a book, trading on their service as a government insider with access to our nation's most valuable intelligence."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book is just too shallow for me. I was hoping for some revelation into the inner workings of George Bush, and got fluff instead. At least she had sense enough to get out of Washington before this inept and totlly corrupt administration took hold."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"It has been centuries since a work like this has surfaced. Ms. Hughes both possesses and demonstrates the Ingegno displayed in two different forms in the Decameron. Her wit and devotion to the President allow her through spectacle and action to employ a &quot;successful means of achieving an end used by all types of characters in the Novellas.&quot; Even a cursory glance at the book's cover reveals the depth and nature of our esteemed author.One cannot assess the character of Ms. Hughes without being reminded of Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders. James Sutherland says in his introduction to the book, &quot;Above all, Moll has the toughness, the resilience, the ability for mere survival that usually go with indomitable energy and great physical stamina. She would always be the one to crawl out unhurt from the debris of a bombed building....Simply as a human animal, Moll is an impressive specimen.&quot; So too is Karen Hughes. And unlike the fictional Flanders, Karen is the real thing. She so adroitly demonstrates this quality, when, on September 12, 2001, she advises the President to add cheese to the hamburger he has instructed his staff to procure for him. What a Hughesian moment and indeed appropriate time to find hope in a cloud of despair. Flanders shared her wit and charms on a one on one basis with those she encountered; conversely, Hughes has done much the same not just to Bush but to an entire nation."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I read a review that said whether or not you are a Bush person would decide if you like this book or not. Well, I am a huge supporter of the president and I have to say, this book falls short. I found it hard to swallow how highly this woman thinks of herself. I do think she was a good communications advisor to the president and I guess that is why I was expecting more. For the money, you are much better off with David Frum's The Right Man. If you can pick this up at the library, it might be worth your time, but if you are spending money, I recommend looking in another direction."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I spent about an hour with this book at my local Borders. Its all fluff with no clear insight into the thinking and decision making processes of George W. Bush. Perhaps I was expecting too much, and no such processes exist in this man."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"...I think I'll save my money and wait until she sells the Ten Minutes from Normal book rights to the WB as a sitcom."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Hey Karen and George, you volunteering your sons and daughters for duty in Fallujah? Wow, I mean Karen Hughes is such a patriot -- she thinks everyone should fight for her cause except her own family. But what else do you expect from someone's who supposed to be more loyal than the family dog?After reading the book, my question would be how could such a smart woman worship such an ignorant, sheltered, phony that stumbled into being President. Is this the best our country can do, a pampered son of a former President who had a track record of failure in every other past venture? Or how about a corporate crook who sold his shares ahead of a bad earnings report and then failed to file with the SEC? Or how about a drunken driver who very easily could have killed your loved one?In any case, you'll get some clear insight into the mind of a Stepford wife, a blind devotee and true believer in the equivalent of a village idiot."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I just wasted a few bucks on this book, and do I regret it.

To equate pro-choice with 911 terrorist is beyond the pale. Let's hope she goes from Ten Minutes From Normal to a Way Way Deep into oblivion and we don't have to ever hear another word of drivel from this shill's mouth ever again."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"If this book had ONE thing of substance in it, I'd be happy to report. Having known Hughes in a former life, I can testify that she is a master of spin (I think she even believes it herself sometimes). She can write in circles for pages and pages, and this she has done well. But this book has NOTHING of substance in it except perhaps to let the public know that Karen really REALLY likes geo bush and owes him a lot. If this book is her payback, he should be concerned."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen Hughes is an advisor and personal friend of the President. This book presents a postive view of the president and the White House policies and processes. Duh.But that is not primarily what this book is about. This book is presents a relatively &quot;normal&quot; professional working mom who finds herself in an important role in the innermost circles of the Presidential Power. She describes what that experience is like, and most importantly the conflict between that appeal to the intensity and importance of that power and her role as a mother and spouse.The book provides some limited insight (almost certainly the negative filtered away) of decision processes of the President, gives some insights into how Political PR (should) work, and confirmation that a number of the President's close advisor's draw heavily upon their Christian faith.The book gives some insights into the current President. He is has tremendous discipline, he apparently is always on time or early...for those of you who interact with executives who run businesses and/or organizations know how rare this is--as the imporance of issues that CEO's deal with often mean subordinates learn to wait. He is either &quot;simple-minded&quot; lacking in-depth understanding or cuts immediately to the core of the issue, depending on your view. He does tend to see decisions as right and wrong (it's not just Karl Rove pandering to the hard-core right).But again, those insights are sidebars to main theme of the book--a mom wrestlhing with the consuming requirements of very intense work environment versus desire to invest in one's family.The book is am enjoyable read and a thought provoking book for those of us with consuming worklife and a family. On the other hand, if you're the kind of person who would write a review trashing a book that you haven't read because you don't like the politics should probably skip this one-you won't be able to get past the politics to engage with the book."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"You know, I voted for Bush in 2000. I supported Iraq. I read this book. It's looking more and more like I made three mistakes, three more than Hughes says Bush has made.

All the above"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"It's really a shame that Ms. Hughes did not offer more insight into &quot;her boss&quot; and the inner workings of her political world. Instead, the book is primarily p.r. spin. While that was her job when working for Bush...one would think she would take a more in depth look once she left the White House.

She makes him out to be superman, cary grant, and god all in one.Save your money."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I think somewhere back in the misty recesses of history there have been a few times when Republicans and Democrats somehow laid aside their nasty animosities and worked together for some valuable compromises. I think on some very rare occasions, Reps and Dems have worked together because they knew they had to. I even think there have been a few cases in which there was deep, abiding respect between particular members of opposing parties. I'm tempted to think maybe that sentiment has died for good when I read many of these reviews. Could they be more rude and mean-spirited? Maybe, but not a whole lot. Kids, Bush was wrong on some issues and right on others, just like the rest of us human creatures...just like every Democrat who has ever served. Ease up a little."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Check your closets, she writes, so you will see the marvels of globalization, all because of her boss, Bush, whom she sees through rose-colored glasses for sure. I wonder if she knows our homes are now full of stuff made in China, which has caused the loss of millions of jobs, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, that China holds much of the american debt, perhaps that trillion dollars for a war which has not been paid for yet. This is a book of admiration for an emperor without clothes. It is scary that people like her actually work and have a say in White House affairs. And oh, Karen, read American history or Noam Chomsky instead of the bible for a few days and you'll soon realize what a cruel and uncivilized country America was and still is. This is a lady who holds her bible close to her heart, but heartily endorses war by anticipation, killing thousand without giving them a fighting chance. Wow, way to go Karen, just stay home and take care of your diamond ring and please no more over-the-top books, because you won't be able to find friends to even write good reviews."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Remember the over-achiever in school who asked a lot of dumb questions but thought she was so profound? Well she is here. What's scary is that she is working for the Pres. advising him on what to say and do so he can appeal to the rest of us. Issues don't matter and cricism is baseless. The President and his annointed adviser are on the side of right by dint of their pure hearts, God knows. This is scary stuff. Is the President so insecure that he needs a cheerleader like this at his side? Would he have stopped reading My Pet Goat if Karen had only gone with him on that trip to Fla. It's not what you know that gets you to the top; vapid and selfrightous spin does."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Engaging overall, although a little slow at the start (as are most &quot;normal&quot; lives). The details of the 2000 campaign vividly describe its uncertainty and exhaustion. The trauma of Sept. 11 was painfully re-created with an inside look. The liberals will hate this book (one star or less) because they want dubya to look bad and he doesn't. The feminists will hate it because an intelligent woman chose to care about her family more than her career. The real question is, &quot;Why would any &quot;normal&quot; person want to give up their life like that to work in Washington, anyway?&quot; Thanks, Karen, for an accurate view of a &quot;normal&quot; supermom."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Aside from Laura Bush, I think Karen Hughes knows more about President Bush than just about anyone. This book is an honest and close look at George Bush from inside the circle. Everyone should read this book before the 2004 election. It just might help decide for whom to vote. I predict this book will swing a significant number of votes to George Bush. And, as Martha would say, &quot;That's a good thing.&quot; Good job, Karen!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"As you might expect from a former communications director, Karen Hughes' book \\"Ten minutes from Normal\\" is all spin. She writes with total conviction, but her observations are often at odds with the observations of other administration officials who have written books. For example, Hughes says that George Bush \\"asked questions that went right to the heart of the matter\\" and had a \\"laserlike ability to distill an issue to it's core.\\" In contrast, Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill (as told to Ron Suskind) said he was clueless and disinterested.Hughes' choices of what to include and what to omit from the book are sometimes curious. There are only a couple of lines that obliquely hint about how her conservative mother influenced her future political leanings. She describes a pineapple dish she served at a dinner party 15 years earlier and names scores of people she's met in her career but most of us have never heard of (who cares who was in her exercise and Bible-study groups). At the same time, she mentions nothing about what most readers would consider important issues that might have been discussed by top administration officials before September 11, 2001, such as terrorism and Al-Qaeda. You'd think Condi would have mentioned it many times during her briefings at the mandatory morning Senior Staff meetings. She also doesn't say much about the 2000 election considering how unique it was in the history of the country. She mentions the process of recounting the votes (which she calls \\"re-creating\\") but says nothing about the thousands of black voters who were unfairly purged from the rolls by Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris.There are no new revelations in the book that might be of interest to a follower of politics. Hughes says she has no knowledge of who was responsible for the smear campaign against John McCain in the South Carolina primary, or who exposed Valerie Plame, the CIA undercover agent. She does confirm that Condoleeza Rice talked to Bush after the first plane struck the twin towers but doesn't mention if the discussion involved Osama bin Laden or \\"My Pet Goat.\\" She does concede that Bush needs two days to prepare for a major speech whereas Clinton would make changes right up to the minute he gave the speech.Hughes admits she can't sing but doesn't seem to realize she also has no sense of humor. This is clear from several instances in which Hughes says people didn't &quot;get her jokes,&quot; such as \\"message ADD.\\" When she characterizes Bush's selection in the 2000 election as \\"a resounding 49 percent victory,\\" you're not sure she meant it as a joke or whether she's somehow serious. Even her son Robert has this figured out in his diary inserts (the only honest and genuine parts of the book). One unintentionally amusing piece of the book is the juxtaposition of the eight and ninth pictures that show Hughes wearing the same blouse and pant suit in photos taken a year apart. Fashion aside, it's surprising how someone who is so detail oriented and careful in the selection of words didn't notice the similarities in the two pictures.Hughes grouses because Democrats characterized Bush as inarticulate and inexperienced during the 2000 election. Then she describes how hard her staff worked to characterize Al Gore as a flip-flopper who would do anything to win the election. Later, she says the Bush administration staffs were \\"remarkably collegial\\" (obviously Rumsfeld and Powell didn't get the word). She's angry because the terrorists aren't \\"constrained by the facts\\" and because they \\"hate everyone who doesn't think like them.\\" Karen, please ... look in a mirror.This book reaffirms the old adage, \\"don't pay any attention to what politicians say, watch what they do.\\" You'll get more satisfaction from reading &quot;My Pet Goat&quot; than &quot;Ten Minutes from Normal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Wow! What an excellent book. Shows how Hughes helped create the political and intellectual powerhouse that is George W. Bush. The scenes from his college days, especially the bukkake event at Skull &amp; Bones, is just delightful!!"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"What absolute useless drivel, why anyone would waste time writing this book is beyond me. There is nothing at ALL worthwhile or interesting anywhere to be found in the book.If you want to know about the weather or the scenery on any day you might be interested.If you want to know all the pinch me monuments she had you might be interested.If you want to know how her teenage son was always hunger you might be interested.If you want to know how supportive her husband, family, friends, the dog, the mouse in the garage were, you might be interested.A complete waste of time. I had to give it one star because that's as low as the rating go or it would be negative.To think this women was counsel to the president is truly scary! If she is representative of others giving counsel to the president, is it any wonder that the administration's message is so incoherent and confused.The only good thing about this book is that when you put it down you won't pick it up again."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Mrs. Hughes has written a master piece that will fill your heart with joy and remind you that everyone in Washington, whether Republicans or Democrats, are human. She is charming, funny, witty, straight foreward, and honest. Her book is an inspiration for any person, a women who has worked in the ''halls of power'' and whos story will make you love her. Shes very honest and has written a political book that is one of a kind, in that it bashes NO ONE. For someone as myself who reads a lot of these political books it is a wonderful change. Whether you support President Bush or not, this is a book that everyone should read in order to paint a clearer picture instead of the one that has fogged America's view with Democrat's bashing and name calling. The book was a real treat and I never wanted it to end. Great job Karen."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Working mothers can identify with the balancing act of family and job, but Mrs. Hughes's balancing act was much more than most of us will ever face. This book is not only about being an advisor to the President of the U.S., it's her story of growing up in a military family, her observations and learning experiences of various postings and what she took from them. Her insights into the world of politics is fascinating to me.And, incidentally, a review of Mrs. Hughes's book by the New York Times News Service was way off base. I don't think the reviewer bothered reading the book as some of the criticisms were of events not even mentioned in the book.I highly recommend &quot;Ten Minutes from Normal.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book is nothing more than window dressing for the worst and most dangerous President in the history of this country -- to revive the phony &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; theme just in time for the 2004 campaign. Incidentally, sales of this book will also put lots of money into the pockets of the author, even though she and her cronies in the Administration are always ready to claim that any author critical of George Bush is motivated only by profit. Save your money -- or better still, contribute it to organizations that support veterans and their families, who are getting the shaft from this government."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen Hughes is a role model for a lot of women trying to balance career and family. She is a genuinely good person, and this book just exudes pleasantness. I would recommend it highly for women. I think she had women in mind when writing it. She was speaking to them.So, as a man, it was not my favorite book, but it had some very admirable points. I think it gives a great insider perspective and insight into some moments of recent importance in American history, including the 2000 campaign, the Florida recounts, and September 11, 2001.I like Karen Hughes, but I found some of her more autobiographical passages from growing up to be somewhat boring. I could have done without those, personally. Some people will definitely enjoy them, however.I do give her points for her candid discussion of her faith. It takes courage as a national public figure to go on record like that.While this book didn't quite win me over, the world definitely needs more people like Karen Hughes."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen Hughes has been alongside George W.

Yes, she loves the President. Yes, the President is her friend. BUT, it is still a great book about a woman who found herself in amazing circumstances. She shares much info about her faith, the faith of those around her, and how priorities are important. I learned a lot about why things happened like they did. I learned a lot about the personal side of political issues. I learned that everyone in the White House is also a normal person in an amazing circumstance. I learned that I am thankful to have a president and his staff who have strong beliefs and opinions and make decisions based on those things. It's a blessing to have a president and staff who have a strong belief system that they stand true to. It's an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen is a smart, articulate, honest, self-described &quot;normal&quot; American who has done some extraordinary things. Not since George Washington has anybody walk away from power so willingly. She personifies the best of America and the best of her party. The book is an insightful look at a crazy process and I am glad she came back to help this President through it again."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"The book is written by a woman named Karen Hughes.So who is that man on the cover?"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"This book defines hagiography. Karen Hughes can find no fault with George W. Bush. In her world, he's always right, never makes mistakes, never even has doubts. If you want to keep your mind inside a cozy cocoon and bask in the warm light of the halo Karen Hughes projects over Bush's head, then this is the book for you. Karen Hughes has been a speech writer and communications director for Bush during both his governorship and his presidency and she clearly loves her boss. But her business is spin, not communicating a fair or balanced picture.If, on the other hand, you want the facts about how the war on terror has been conducted during the last four administrations, you are better off reading Richard Clarke's &quot;Against All Enemies.&quot; Clarke worked in anti-terrorism for Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II. Clarke was National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructur Protection, and Counterterrorism under Clinton and Bush. He directed the Whitehouse's tactical response on 9/11. His book, and his sworn testimony before the 9/11 commission paint a rather different picture of Bush than Karen Hughes. Clarke (who incidentally is a registered Republican and the only Whitehouse official to actually take responsibility for and apologize for his failures leading up to 9/11) finds fault with all four presidents regarding their response to terrorism, but he finds the most fault with George W. Bush. From the preface: &quot;George W. Bush, who failed to act prior to September 11 of the threat from an al Qaeda despite repeated warnings and then harvested a political windfall for taking obvious yet insufficient steps after the attacks; and who launched an unnecessary and costly war in Iraq that strengthened the fundamentalist, radical Islamic terrorist movement worldwide.&quot;The main difference between an historian and a spinner is that the historian will provide context and a complete picture, while the spinner will cherry-pick the facts and images that support her case while ignoring everything inconvenient. So, dear reader, do you want all the pertinent facts, in context, from Bush's top antiterror advisor, or do you want warm fuzzy images from a skillful spinner? You decide..."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"When it is a blog. Apparently only the left, when they find themselves in a deep hole, keep digging. As one reviewer noted earlier this is supposed to be a place for book reviews, not a place for leftist whackos to vent their spleen and spew their vitriol. So blinded by hate and choking on their own ideology they now find themselves falling further behind the power curve and so now attack the messenger. WHY??

Only those books used to be about teen stars like Scott Baio and Willie Ames...and they were a lot more subtle and insightful.Karen Hughes thinks God chose Bush to win the 2000 election and &quot;come to a royal position for such a time as this.&quot;Karen Hughes thinks George Bush is so intelligent that his tongue can't keep up with his brain, thus all his speaking gaffes and inability to give a speech without looking down at his notes every third word.Karen thinks the Harvard/Yale educated, Maine raised son and grandson of prominent Washington DC insiders has a &quot;disdain for East Coast elitism&quot;.Karen must think we are as dumb as poor George's tongue."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I am sure that Ms. Hughes considers herself a Christian woman. She did return to Texas to be with her family and works with youth members of her church. The book leaves me with more questions than answers.What kind of mother leaves her son at Neverland while she trots off to campaign for Arnold Schwarzennegger? Who would allow a youth group to spend time together in a hot tub? What does Laura Bush think of her husband's relationship with Hughes?I will not let my children read her book. Parts of this book are offensive and objectionable."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I will dispense with my typical, reasoned review style for this book. Whether you should buy and read this book is actually a fairly simple question. Ask yourself this:o) Do you approve of Bush? If so, you will greatly enjoy this loving, insider look at him and his campaigns.o) Do you hate Bush? If so, this book will enrage you, and it's soft-focus view of the President will drive you wild.o) Are you undecided about Bush? If so, decide if the insider look will be enjoyable to you, or if the fact that that this book is too admiring of Bush will drive you wild.Hughes makes no secret of the fact that Bush is Her Guy; whether he is Your Guy will ultimately determine if this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"No one should let this book escape perusal, especially at this reasonable price! You've heard that Karl Rove is \\"Bush's brain?\\" Well, Ms. Hughes is \\"Bush's brain on drugs (with a side of bacon)!\\"To read her describe Dubya's mind as \\"laser-like\\" leaves no doubt in my own mind that when she worked for Reagan, she was a conduit for Dubya on the \\"Star Wars - Strategic Defense Initiative\\" project. I don't remember if that was his pre-cocaine or post-cocaine years, but it all makes so much sense now.I'm happy that after a lifetime of one political success after another, she took time off from her busy schedule for a sabbatical to bake brownies for her young, hungry son. I wonder if perchance, she has a recipe for a cake with a file in it?Now that she's back on the team with her traveling road-show thumping America's generosity and love for the rest of the world, I suppose her son will go hungry, but at least America will be safe from those naughty terrorists!

Not the fluff that I expected, by a long shot. Clearly not a &quot;lightweight&quot;, Karen Hughes' own personal background is unique and impressive. This book is a surprisingly good read, fast-paced and highly interesting. Hughes offers insight into GWB's personality and thought processes that make it clear that his rise to the presidency is not a bizarre accident.

I guess I'll have to look for good transgender/Christianity true-life stories elsewhere.Hmmm.

Karen, thank you so much for writing this book. The average person has no idea of the sacrifice of those who serve our country, and you painted a vivid picture for us. Let us not take you for granted. As a Christian, I loved the first chapters and seeing how God wired you the way He did--to be a woman for such a time as this. I applaud your courage, your dedication to your country and president, and your incredible boldness to speak the truth in love, no matter what the consequences. I hope many people will read your book before the next presidential election in order to see the depth of character of our beloved president, George W. Bush. What an incredible leader he is for our country and how wrongly judged he is so frequently by the press and the liberals. He is an exemplary leader, I belive one of the greatest presidents of all time. I haven't been able to put down your book. It is absolutely compelling.

Like many hyper-successful women, Hughes had to make huge sacrifices, and can seem aloof, but her issues (except for the disposable income) are also our issues. My other choice for work and family juggling is &quot;I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,&quot; by Bruce Stockler, a bracingly honest Dad's-eye meditation on work, career, marriage and kids."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"is ultimately how Karen Hughes describes her life, declaring that it wasn't her ultimate destination anyway.Rushing against fleeing traffic from Washington to an evacuated White House in order to make a statement of reassurance to our hysterical and dumbfounded country that the government was still functioning, she met met with a surreal scene of White House lawns covered with men in black brandishing weapons.She portrays an eerie tale as she steps into an empty WH and is led downward through a maze of tunnels and hallways, impenetrable doors slamming closed behind her, before finally entering the secret bunker where dramatic action was already being coordinated by the vice president, national security adviser and others in response to the largest, most viscous attack ever on American soil.The most negative and pessimistic comment this unusually upbeat and positive woman made was on September 12th, when the White House was under serious threat of attack, and President Bush declared that he (along with the senior staff, of which she was one) was NOT leaving. Under the stress he abandoned his salad diet and sent a mess steward scurrying to bring him a quick hamburger. Karen added with a sinking heart that he &quot;might as well add the cheese.&quot;Highly intriguing are the up-close and truly personal looks at both President Bush and some of the &quot;inner circle&quot; principals (Andy Card, Condi Rice, Karl Rove, Colin Powell and others) of an administration that is turning out to be one of the most critical in America's young history.Before this book becomes a page-turner, beginning chapters swing humorously through her life-shaping experiences of childhood as an &quot;army brat&quot; who sometimes changes countries but clearly has a foundation that doesn't shift. An early adult career in news reporting further weaves into the fabric of her being the tools necessary for her crucial role in WH communications.As a woman who really knows who she is, and that work is &quot;what you do and not who you are&quot; she refused to play the games of the Washington scene or be sucked under in its negative political landscape. She didn't vie for the usual power grabs or even the highly coveted and now famous &quot;Stephanopoulos&quot; office space. She kept her identity intact and in no way elevated herself simply because she had the listening and attentive ear of the leader of the most powerful nation on earth. she uses her unusual platform to exhort and encourage individual every day Americans to understand their personal worth in the &quot;larger scheme of things.&quot;Included in some powerful pages of this book are inadvertent lessons in how to discern &quot;the truth&quot; while being barraged by the darker subtext of biased newspaper headlines, and avoid the pitfalls of edited television clips taken out of context. Only a person like Ms. Hughes who has been a media player herself, could report so effectively &quot;to the media&quot; with honesty, yet not void of some clever Republican strategy.As counselor to the president she was one of the few individuals of high integrity in constant contact with him, except of course, for that brief moment crystallized in history when communication was cut off from Air Force One.It's a comfort to know that the current president of th United States of America selects and surrounds himself with wise counselors and is in no danger of falling into the pit of those who don't embrace the blessing outlined in Psalm 1:1.There's only one word to describe the potential effect this book could have on its readers: life-changing."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I highly recommend this book.The negative reviews here are obviously from thosewho have a different political position than the author.How sad some can't look past partisan politics to enjoya book.

Maybe they read the book jacket at the local book store (You know who you are.) It is obvious, since comments were not based on the book's content.I very much enjoyed the stories about her early life, and the history of her parents and grandparents. Though of humble roots, they fostered a desire to strive and succeed. It is a truly American success story.Mrs Hughes knows who she is and what she believes in, and she is willing and eager to further her beliefs, whether they be political or religious. There is no hidden agenda here.There are those who criticize her because of her successes. I ask Why? She got where she is because she is smart, she had goals, and because she worked hard to reach her goals. If you haven't, take note; you can be there too, if you are willing to make the effort.The book is not written with the skill of a Peggy Noonan, nonetheless, I read it from beginning to end without stopping because I wanted to find out who this person is, what she has done, and why.I am glad we have people of this caliber - along with Mary Matalin, Condi Rice etal - at work in the White House today."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"An inspiring read that gives one an idea what it is like to be in the White House and next to power. The difference is Ms Hughes gives it a much more personal flavor with humorous stories and her personal philosophy. It should be a must read for &quot; Bush Bashers&quot; as at least they can get a first hand understanding of the character of the President rather than base their judgement on spin and often times data that lacks supportive facts. I closed the last page and thought that it was an unsual woman who could balance family, faith, friendship and still survive and be at the top of the players in the jungles of Washington. Additionally, some lagniappe is her faith that weaves through the book and gave me food for thought and the realization that we have some people of excellent character in the White House. It is an easy fun and informative read."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen Hughes book is similar to the writings of any anti-feminist; anti-woman. She gladly takes her backstand to all males- as conservative women do. Her description of GW Bush as having a &quot;laser-like mind&quot; is laughable and only confirms my suspicion regarding her lack of average intelligence.Anyone who can look at George W. Bush and not see a moron-is a moron herself.Hughes insults not only herself but all women who enjoy an above-average level of intelligence. Dont bother reading it unless you too, have such low self-esteem that you wish to degrade yourself and all women."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"Karen Hughes delivers a walloping new book that places her in the fine company of Leni Riefenstahl. George Bush loves America, but hates Americans. Karen supplants Karl Rove as the real propaganda mastermind in the Bush Administration. After orchestrating the smear campaign against Richard Clarke, she's equating pro-choice supporters with terrorists.Well Karen, as a New Yorker who lived through 9/11 I have just one question. Karen, why does George love the Saudis so much?"},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I sat next to Karen Hughes at a breakfast during the time she was working on this book, and gave her an old Lauren Bacall autobiography I had just finished, insisting that she not trouble herself with returning it to me. She did, of course. I liked her at the time, and her book only reinforces the impression. She is a very forthright and intense person, yet in a very winningly feminine way. She is also a deeply religious person, and not shy about letting you know it from time to time, but to my mind she strikes just the right balance.She deals with several topics of wide interest here. She began as a reporter and migrated to politics, as the communications chief for George W. Bush, so the interface between government and the press is a constant theme. The whole book is also a study in women in politics, not only because of Hughes herself but because Condoleeza Rice is her good friend and probably appears more often than anyone outside Hughes's family or Bush himself. (I am thinking of the ways in which Rice and Hughes actually influence our nation's governance throughout this story, and also the issue, for Hughes, of balancing family life with an all-consuming job-not just a women's issue of course.) The style and personality of the president is another overriding theme.There are two other themes that are important but not so continual: the 2000 presidential campaign and the events after 9/11.I mention all of this because I think the cover might narrow one's expectations: \\"Karen Hughes, Counselor to the President, Wife and Mother. The Woman who left the White House to put family first, and moved back home to Texas.\\" Yes, the family is key, but there is so much more. I might add that her government ranking was equivalent to that of a three-star general.

It is a very badly written hagiography with a lot of fluff thrown in."},{"Title":"Ten Minutes from Normal","review":"I read the entire book out of curiousity. Karen Hughes has a refreshing personality as she appears on television and her book is interesting and genuine. I admire many women who have and are now serving in the government. Karen Hughes is unlike any of them - her confidence in her ability and wisdom is honestly portrayed in this book.The first part is her own biography. The second part which explains the presidential campaign and her subsequent job in the administration is very frank and readable. The last chapter is rather lengthy as she gives her opinions on the state of the union as managed by the Republican administration of which she is so fond.A very confident woman, Karen Hughes simply forges ahead and does her job with great gusto. Her greatest accomplishment, in my opinion, is marrying her husband who has allowed her to do exactly as she pleases and who takes care of the children better than she, apparently. What a man!I gave this book 4 stars because reading it left me almost breathless! As a mother of 4 children, a small business owner, and a woman of faith myself, (as she describes her faith thruout this book) I could never imagine anyone, man or woman, accomplishing all she writes within such a whirlwind. I thought I had high energy and was indispensable! She got little sleep,worked seven days a week, almost non stop with cell phone in her hand, leaves the impression that the president cannot possibly live more than an hour or so without her advice and wisdom, makes attempts to cook. exercise, and love her children on rare occasions; flies anywhere at a moment's notice, runs a large staff at the white house, fires off orders after making quick decisions, remembers her husband occasionally, never argues with anyone because she will win anyway, and is indispensable to everyone. Now that is a superwoman! All that and she remains likeable! I like her too!I congratulate this busy creative and talented woman for leaving the white house and those long long hours of input. It had to be a tough decision. I also think it is wise that she continue to monitor the progress of the administration and that this president continues to value her advice.Regardless of your political affiliation, go ahead and read this insightful book concerning the past few years in American history according to one woman's &quot;view from the top. &quot;"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.And no, I do not believe there was any such child."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"The book seems comes from a library. It is not as good as described in the ad. I am wondering how a library book will be on sale."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"One of the most heartwarming and beautiful books one can imagine, about the major logical questions in the universe. A unique look on reality told from the perspective of a little girl and her relationship with God. The book is extremely well written and easy to read. At the same time it conveys a startling take on some of the most provocative questions the human race has been grappling with over the centuries."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"All I can say to anyone reading this is: please read this book. Whatever you believe about God, religion, love, and the human condition will be radically altered for the better after you meet Fynn and Anna. It's not the usual so-called inspiration, but a real eye (and soul) opener. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"The title wonderfully chosen, the voice and the mood of the author is happy and yet suprised. Beautifully written book, Amazing child, the way Fynn wrote it was like he was still under shock because of the way Anna sees the world, God was friends with Anna, they communicated everyday.Fynn learned so much from Anna. The whole book was a lesson to me and I guess to all other readers, this book teaches about kids that we cannot ignore their intelligence though Anna's intelligence was scary as it always scared the hell out of Fynn. Anna is just a kid that knows God so much, one could'nt argue with her because she knews her story, she fitted into society like a glove. No questions asked that is why Fynn kept her, she was a community builder at her age, changed peoples way of thinking, she was interested in learning new things as well, the fact that she would say 'write it down big' was amazing as you can tell that she was an interesting kid that wanted to learn things that she did not know. Kids do change peoples lives everyday that is why it is always advisable that we spend sometime with them, they are as fun as Anna was. I totally agree with Fynn that she is laughing with God now. this book I will read it over and over again and I will pass it on to my kids."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"First and foremost, I am an atheist. To my absolute core.I was given my copy of this book when I was 17 (I'm 31 at the time of this writing). I have given away countless copies and I buy it whenever I find it, just to share it with another person.I knew Anna dies. It said so in the beginning. But when she died, the means, the way, the reality of it was too much for me. I vaguely recall screaming &quot;Noooo!&quot; and hurling the book across the room. It was days before I picked it up and finished the last few pages.I felt like I'd lost Anna.But I didn't because she stayed with me. Or rather, her wonderment, her curiosity, her fearlessness.To me this was not a particularly religious story. Odd thing to say. I take this book to mean that you should explore, and question, the world around you. Do not accept the answers you are given. Name things for yourself. Anna chose Mister God. I choose Nature. You choose what best suits you."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"The book recounts the friendship formed between the author and narrator Fynn (who is in his late teens or early 20s in the narrative) and a foundling named Anna in London's East End, in the 1930s. Anna, reminiscent of a character from Dickens, is a little girl who lives on the streets until she is taken in by the narrator. She has a unique perspective on life, a mystical spirituality, and a boundless curiosity that she shares with the author and the reader on every page. She occasionally (at least once per chapter) lets loose with a metaphor or pronouncement that is as deep as they come, but it is hard to imagine a real five-year old spouting these profundities with such regularity. Was she a real kid or just a figment of the author's imagination? I have no idea, but I do know that her death in the final chapter (this isn't a spoiler---Fynn tells us about her death in the first few pages) felt real enough.I loved the characters of Fynn and Anna, yet I have mixed feelings about the book itself. It was given to me as a gift by a good friend, who in turn had it recommended to him. Both recommendations came with the suggestion that the book had substantially shifted their perspectives. Yet in reading the book, I could never shake my suspicion that the author was just using sentimental tricks to make the book seem profounder than it really was. (It felt like the same kind of emotional manipulation that I associate with the movie Forrest Gump.) Put it this way: if the wise-sounding comments had come from an adult, rather than from a small homeless child, would they still have seemed as deep?Luckily, the book is an easy read and is readily available in almost every thrift store in the country, so you can read it for yourself and see what you think."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"...people is mostly on the outside and angels is mostly on the inside.&quot; With simple, compelling wisdom such as this, Anna inspires exciting, fulfilling and down-to-earth spiritual and religious discoveries for both Fynn and the reader. One can't help but fall completely in love with this 6-year-old angel who seems to have so strong a grasp on the true essentials of &quot;Mister God.&quot; Fynn's entire life is irrevocably changed by this captivating little philosopher who seems to have a simple, satisfying answer to every question. Whether you are christian, agnostic or atheist, Anna has something special to teach you about embracing beliefs and bringing them vibrantly to life. Never once preaching, the novel is an endless series or discoveries which will have you laughing, crying and smiling at every step you take. The illustrations by Papas beautifully capture the warmth of the book and are a treasure unto themselves. My fiance read this book to me, and I plan to read it to each of my children. Everyone needs a little angel like Anna in their life"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"The first time I read this book, I could NOT believe that it could possibly be a true story. The concepts which little Anna proposes and then PROVES are too complicated for any mere child... right? But then, I realized that it doesn't really matter to me whether or not this story ACTUALLY happened; the truths it contains are what have changed my views of God, pain, sin, and true joy forever. This book not only provides answers to some of life's questions; it also provides the questions."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"In much the same lyrical quality of Saint-Exupery's 'The Little Prince', 'Mister God' allows us to 'get small', as Anna would say, and see the world as a still wonderful place. I first discovered this book almost 25 years ago, and have given as gifts countless copies whenever I can find it. The copy on my shelf today is from the 19th printing in 1985. I cannot think of anyone -- young, old, sinner, cynic, saint -- who would not enjoy the wit, wisdom and other-worldliness of spritely Anna and her exuberant joust with -- and quest for -- the truest reality. Anna's relationship with Old Woody is a pattern for adult-child relationships not easily surpassed. Fynn proves coming of age often means not leaving childhood behind, but hauling it with you into adulthood. If you've not yet discovered a pair of companion books -- 'Anna's Book', and 'Anna, Mister God, and the Black Knight', both also by Fynn -- seek them out and latch onto them if you can find them. If joy has a name, it is Anna."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"My goodness! I have thought about this book so often since first reading it in 6th grade 24 years ago. It just popped in my head a moment ago, and I rushed to the computer to look it up. HERE it is! I remember distinctly reading it practically all the way through in one sitting. This book was indeed one of the initial (with many to follow)spiritual steps on my ladder to getting to know God. In fact, I just told my 12-year-old daughter that I will soon be buying it for her to read and always have as a keepsake. I'm ecstatic!Carrie Lynn JonesAuthor ofIt All Began... When Jesus Gave Me Sneakers"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel of a little girl's understanding of Mister God, partially because of how it delved into personal spiritual development and fellowship, and largely because it tried to approach quandaries about faith with a scalpel and wizened simplicity. Sometimes it succeeded; other times it failed. Regardless of the misses, the entire book is a wonderful eye-opener that will inspire you to take your own inventories, conduct your own experiments, and perhaps check your insides and outsides for Mister God daily.A friend recommended the book to me when I needed guidance on how to approach prayer; believe me, it helped tremendously."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Anna and Fynn have a relationship that most of us can only dream of. Its a companionship that is in some ways demanding but intellectually rewarding. Exlporing the world through the eyes of a child can be exlporing it both in a religious and moral sense but also to some extent in a logical and somewhat scientific manner. I found it hard to believe that Anna is only a child. If only all of us had found a Fynn then I suppose the fiery desire to analyze and synthesize would never end and I guess thats what a real education is about."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Mister God , this is Anna is a story to be read.

If you start page ONE, you will not stop...and soon you'll be brewing the best coffee or tea, as companion to the inspiring dialogs among a liitle beautiful blessed girl, that will shake our the very foundations of our soul.

Anna, a little street orphan in old Cockney England, finds God everywhere, even in an old ruffian named Fynn, and is not afraid to say out loud why we grown-ups struggle so much doing so. No wonder God told us to come to him as a little child!!!

I cried, laughed, thought, and wondered along with Anna and Fynn from the very first page to the very last. This book is pure joy and wonder, just like Anna.

Whats that the answer to?"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"A charming introduction to thinking outside the orthodox boundaries of Western science and religion. Several reviews I've seen for this book appear to have been written by people who had bitter reactions due to strong personal biases in these matters. This would seem to speak rather more deeply about the inhibitions of the reviewers than of the subject.If you are not firmly attached to any dogmatic approaches to thinking and being, if you can walk through a romantic summer evening without needing to reassure yourself by explaining the astrophysics of star light to whoever is within earshot, you will probably find this little book entirely worthwhile."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"From the outset, let me just say that this book thoroughly captivated me when I read it. I was hooked and I basically fell in love with Anna, as I suspect many other readers have done. However, did you read the introduction? I believe the Intro is written by the publishing editor. Fynn, the storyteller, comes to her shyly, I believe a number of years after the events allegedly occurred. I don't think he ever gives his last name. He pretty much disappears from the scene after that. I can't help but wonder. Is the editor being completely honest? Why wasn't Fynn more up front about his personal information? Was it just a timid desire to remain anonymous or was he passing fiction off as non-fiction? Part of me really hopes this was a true story---that there really was an Anna and she truly knew God. When I read what happened to her in the end, another part of me wishes that no precious child would undergo suffering or die in that manner. Whatever the case, the book reminds me that Jesus did say that anyone who enters the kingdom of God must have the simple, unquestioning faith of a child."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This is one of those books that will cause you to laugh, cry, and maybe even scream out loud.

And by the way, I am not man from singapore, but rather, a GIRL from Singapore. I am not saying that i did not enjoy the book.. in fact, I loved it. However, being a born critic, I just picked out the faults in the book. My apologies for that. In reality, I was amazed at the intelligence of Anna and this book will always be a favourite from mine. Proving some of her theories wrong was like proving Einstein wrong for me. Looking back at my own review now, i feel a little foolish. But I had to express my views somewhere and i thought this would be the best place to do it. I express my sincere apologies to all that I might have angered with my review.

I appreciate it."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"ok... for all those who have read this book and have been immersed in its theories, there are a few things that i'd like to point out... you know there was a theory about how we cannot see mister god because he wants everything and doesn't reflect anything back. the evidence given to support this theory was a yellow flower and how we can see this flower coz' it wants everything except yellow and hence reflects yellow back. however, isn't it true that if something absorbs all colours, it is black? so is the black hole or the universe mister god? Another theory was the one about shadows being faster than light and the experiment mentioned to support this was the shadow of earth being cast on an imaginary wall squillions of miles away. here too there has been a mistake i'm afraid. the shadow of earth will only be formed on the imaginary wall after the light has travelled over the squillions of miles and hits the wall. hence, once again it has been proved that the shadow forms only after the light has hit the wall. so light is still faster that the shadow. i have been wanting to tell these to someone for a long while but i have absolutely no idea how to get hold of vernon sproxton or fynn and hence i had to do this. my e-mail address is vanathi@justicemail.com and you can e-mail me about this matter anytime you want. thank you."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This book was interesting.

I did read the entire book but found it real struggle to hang in there."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This is a formula book, aimed at people who are already convinced of the existence of their god. It's as realistic as one of the medieval Lives of the Saints, and as subtle as anything from Stalinist Russia, where heroic peasants worked heroically for the common heroic good.Here a little girl uses the socratic method to &quot;enlighten&quot; her guardian in the ways of god. The character of the little girl will be unrecognizable to anyone who's ever encountered a real child for more than five seconds. This would be acceptable if it were not for the fact that the philosophy is threadbear. Only an uncritical acceptance of second-hand ideas coupled to a second-rate god would make this an interesting work.The writing itself is workmanlike enough, though this doesn't preclude the inevitable tedium that comes from the subject matter itself.In other words, it's a false piece of writing, just as hagiography was false and heroic socialistic heroism was false. Spare yourself this juvenile meandering. If you really want to know something about the way god has evolved in the west, take a look at Karen Armstrong's book A History of God. Far more interesting and insightful, and much more capably written as well."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This story was written in 1944, and published in 1975by William Collins Publishers in London.

He lives with his motherand other orphans that he has taken in. Although he is saidto have a kind and maternal mother, and young girls in thehouse, the little girl sleeps with him, which would be consideredabnormal for a man and a non family member to sleep with a child. If thelittle girl needed comforting then she would be in the mom's room or in the other children's room.The 19 year old man also takes her out at night to visit the street andhomeless people.I don't see this as a harmless little book about God. I see itas story of child abuse. The little girl lived until the ageof seven, and died of a fall. It's tragic and questionable.It is not inspirational writing about God. If you are lookingfor inspirational writing then read the lives of the saints."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"When I was a child, my mother had two copies of this book in a very scant library. I don't know how she came to it, and she doesn't remember ever reading it, so I can only guess that it was meant for me. I read this book more than any other in my childhood and credit it with a hope-giving belief in genius and the power to see the world and people in it as theological curiosities. I return to it even now pursuing my PhD and absorbed with questions of epistemology, belief, and the spectacular possibility of turning the ordinary into profound knowledge. I keep buying it and giving it away. Fynn, whoever you are, thank you for sharing such big ideas from the lips of such a small child."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"We are all raised in an age of skepticism where God becomes a concept that is rarely evoked without some apologetic embarrassment. Similarly, many evangelical treatments of God and matters of faith put agnostic audiences on the immediate defensive. This book talks about God in a spirit of shared awe and wonder, addressing our curiosity about God without questioning our morals or our wisdom. It does not seek to convince or persuade; Anna just knew something that she wanted to share because it excited and enchanted her so much. I think this is a beautiful book that must be preserved, for it speaks to all of us whatever our spiritual inclinations."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I first read this book in my late teens at a time when I was questioning the idea of organized religion. This came on the heels of some unpleasant observations of those who purport to lead a life in the church. I was disturbed by the judgemental attitudes of what I saw as &quot;the church&quot;. It seemed that little of what I saw had anything to do with God and spirituality. Then I met Anna, and I knew that I was not alone. In the past 20 years, I have read this book countless times and have given it as a gift many more. It is especially important to me as a mathematician and scientist as it has clearly enabled me to see God in those things that are often used as arguments against the existence of a deity. For those who are struggling to reconcile a desire for a spiritual life with the often disappointing idea of what &quot;the church&quot; has become, this is a must read. Be prepared to rejoice and to grieve."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Generally interesting, occasionally tedious, sappy, or scarcely credible.

One time I just stepped into a little Catholic bookstore nearby a church in Szczecin (Poland) and picked up the book from a shelf. After reading three first pages, I was amazed and totally determined to buy the book at any cost. What did move me so?There are many things. First of all, some of Anna's quotes were amazingly similar to words, that have been said by great mystics and theologues (from St. John Of The Cross to Karl Rahner or Wilfrid Stinissen). At first I didn't know that it is a true story, but when I realized that(from the foreword),it stunned me. This book really keeps a secret inside. But there's more about it. What moved me so much was that this little, joyful, long-haired Anna eventually died in an accident at the age of eight. This is a shadow of eternity, that falls on all the brightness of the story. There is hope in the ending of &quot;Mister God...&quot; But there is also a call for us all. A call from Beyond, that advises us all not to waste any more time. Advises us to give love to all the people, to the entire creation, and, what's most important, to God Himself, because the true Love for all flows from the love for God..."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This is an excellent story, written from the heart. I laugh and cry each time that I read it. (I have read it a couple of times) I am not as good as Anna with the math, but I try to bear with her. (The book covers some thoughts on Anna's experiences of numbers etc.) The joy and excitement that she brought to her community always amazes me! The book forces me to do some introspection as well, that I at least try to live a life of integrity and that the basic things in life is also important."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This is an amazing book! I first read it in Jr, High, and recently picked it up again. I couldn't put it down. It is written as if it were a story being told aloud, and though it is a very easy read, the themes it encompasses will haunt you for days. The idea of being &quot;take away&quot; mirror images, reasons Mister God is invisible, the light spectrum...This book isn't about just religion, or childhood innocense or philosophy...It is them all wrapped together in a delicious bundle. I highly recomend it for anyone."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I will be honest. I didn't get a lot of it,, but it was a very deep and touching book. The end was very sad. But it was a good book."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This book is phenomenal. Fynn describes his relationship with a little girl who has so much insight about \\"Mister God\\". This is the book that really sparked my relationship with God and helped me understand a little more about what I believe. Anna's thoughts are truly inspiring."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"It was suggested by a English friend. It is very sweet reading. I was able to get very easy from your company!"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I loved this book. Anna is a 4 yr old child homeless in London and taken in by the narrator of the book Fynn. She has an amazing way of answering life's problems with the simplicity of Mr. God.In her child like way everything has a easy and direct answer in Mr. God. It was inspirational."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I'm an agnostic-- which would be fine with Anna's Mister God. So would being an atheist. I think that may be why this book annoys some adherents of the more dogmatic religions.There is much here to consider-- and pleasantly-- about God, physics, the nature of existence and the nature of our own minds.Having taught children and been one, I don't find Anna implausible. Most of the questions that she tackles are questions that many small children *do* think about. I can remember doing so myself, and have seen children doing so. Few do it as well as Anna. But it's hard to doubt the existence of remarkable children if you've spent much time around children.That said, Anna is also strained through the memories of 40 years by the time the book is written. In a sense the dead become our memories of them.For those questioning the existence of Fynn, he was Sydney George Hopkins. He died in 1999."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I read this book as a child and after all these years, I still love it as an adult. Anna is a wonderful character with more wisdom than I can ever hope to have."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"About the book:A NOTE: I have a copy from the 1970's which does not have this inside flap. Something to know in case you search for the book in the used bookstore.The book allows us to meet Anna, a precocious child of four years. She has run away from home and makes a life with Fynn and his mum. During her short life, Anna develops a refined way of looking at almost everything around her and manages to teach twenty year old Fynn a thing or two about life. From the moment Anna refused to tell anyone where her parents lived to the moment of her death, Anna manages to control her environment and those around her with a gentle hand and charming ways.Anna treats Fynn and others around him with her special philosophy of church, God, sex, and numbers. The reader is taken along for this wonderful ride.My Take:This is a short book I want everyone to read, though there are some who will find it too simple to enjoy. I loved Anna and her many ideas. One of my favorites is when Anna realized she knew the answer to a squillion (the biggest number Anna could think of) questions. Just when Fynn thinks he is going to set her right, she proves she is already right: How much is 4 take away 1? How much is 2 plus 1? How much is 5 take away 2? By now you must have figured out we could go on all day with this line of reasoning. Indeed, Anna taught Fynn that it is the questions that are truly important. Even beyond that, it is the circumstance of the question that is important. Saying yes to the offer of a drink of water may be drastically different depending on if you are three days into the desert or just newly arrived at the restaurant.There are some who say this child could not have just come to live with this family, It did happen in the 1930's and having little children run the streets was not unheard of. There are some who may say no child could ever do or think what Anna did but I am here to tell you, I personally know of at least one. And don't forget Mozart wrote music at this same age and played his sister's violin without being taught at this same age or younger. It is all possible.The book is written in a straightforward, charming manner that had me taken in from the start. I recommend it to anyone who likes a short, charming story with insights into how some children might think. \\"Write it down big\\" as Anna would say - this is a good book!I highly recommend this little treasure!"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"My book arrived so quickly, and it arrived in great shape. This is my grown daughter's favorite book, and I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Occasionally I buy copies of Mr God, This is Anna for people I think may understand and benefit from reading this beautiful, true story which is all about truth from a child's perspective. Back in 1986, while reading the book for the third time, I discovered that Anna's secret was complete, unconditional, blind trust. I asked myself why I couldn't trust and this resulted in a profound spiritual experience. Christians would call it \\"Being Born Again\\", Buddhists, \\"Enlightenment\\" and others \\"Awakening\\". Whatever; Anna, Fynn and Mr God (who is life) saved my life, or rather gave me life, \\"Life in all it's fullness\\".(Want to know more? Read Eckhart Tolle's \\"A New Earth\\" and discover it for yourself)."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"A wonderful read. A story that will inspire the reader. I have been recommending this book to amost everyone I know. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This has been my favourite books ever since I read it. It bought in a different perspective to my thinking about God in it's own simple and sweet way. Most of my friends would buy this book just to see why this one is my favourite. I even bought a copy to read it for my children later on. I think the beauty of this book lies in the fact that it brings down most complicated things to very simple and clear concepts.Have fun reading it."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Since 1979 I have bought over 20 copies of this book for friends, family and other people whom I felt could benefit from Anna's Wisdom. Strange you say? What can you say about a child who is a philosopher, a pragmatist, an artist, a mathematician all before the age of eight? With Laugher and Joy with the &quot;simplicity&quot; (because it is deceivingly simple)of a child, you learn about life on Anna's Terms. Bring a hanky, cuddle your child, and be open to the wisdom that this child has to bring. Fynn, the author feels that &quot;Anna's message stands on it's own.&quot; I know this because I wrote to him back in 1983 and this was his response through Bellatine Books. His book is important, his love for Anna is found there. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"A wonderful book about a child and the people who had the opportunity to be around her and with her. How did Fynn bear it when she became a real angel?"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Like Saint Expurys Little Prince Anna has the ability to answer the big questions in life in a simple and very true way. But the diference is that she really lived. When I read the book, I just went underlining many phrases (like that light consits of all the differnt colors and say a red flower takes the colors but the one it doesn\`t like,red,is rejected. And that is why god is invisable, he loves all the colors!). Anna has a strong bond to &quot;Mr. God&quot;,and likes talking about him; especially with Fynn. Fynn treats Anna an adult/a friend(most of the adults talk to children so stupid!). And that\`sa major basic for a good relationship/conversation. this and Fynns two following books about Anna are the books I like most,because they are honest, strong,humorous and heavenly. You end this book and you just feel so good."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I recall reading this book as a child of 10 and liking it, although even then it seemed marvellous to me that a 5-year old girl could spout philosophy and even seem knowledgeable in mathematics, etc. But since the book is advertized as fact, I did not think to pursue that line of thought.Almost 20 years later, I've hunted down and read excerpts of the book, and I am beginning to be convinced that this book is a work of fiction, and that Anna is the author's creation and may in fact never have existed. Instead, the author used her as a vehicle to market or deliver his beliefs and philosophy on life. Unfortunately, the book has been written so long ago that I cannot, at present, find out whether this suspicion is true, i.e. whether anyone bothered to look into this matter. Therefore, I may not have a definite answer to this.However, the style of the book seems to confirm this. The religious cliche of the innocence of children who are therefore more in touch with God than adults is the very basis for the book. Anna's outstanding intelligence is further 'proof' that she was in some way extraordinary, and in touch with the laws of the universe (i.e. with a higher power). The fact that she spends all her time thinking about God when most 5-year olds never have an instinctive leaning towards religion, particularly for any type of religion (which is why so many religions exist). And so on..."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Okay, for those who read the review from the man from Singapore - HELLO?!?! I firmly disagree with him. I loved this book. I came across it from a reading list for my high school, and it sounded cute. Well, thank (Mister) God for reading lists! This book was great. Anna's theories, principals, and ideas are wonderful. She has gotten farther than most &quot;successful&quot; human beings in her research, all before the age of 8, let alone even the legal age of 21. Even if some of them were a little off the wall, or even straight out untrue, they were basic ideas which the general population wouldn't even have thought of. So, Mr. Singapore, put your money where your mouth is."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"I give Mr God This is Anna away as gifts and to give people inspiration. I cannot say enough about this book. Every time I read it I find this little girl to be amazing, insightful and profound. The author really captured her essence and her religious nature. Anna distrusted organized religion and thought going to church AFTER you learned about God and what he expected was all for posh (showing off new dresses and socializing) BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTOOD MR GOD, you would NOT need to go to church for more \\"schooling on how to be good\\". You would have learned how to act like Mr. God would and not need more church schooling. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!And, although I am not a mathematics type person, Anna's comparison of math to GOD, nature and all things is astounding in such a young child. It was totally captivating to read her assessments and comparisons and EVERY TIME you read the book, you find something you overlooked.This is MY FAVORITE BOOK above ALL OTHERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Mister God would entirely approve of this charming little book by someone with the wit and wisdom to express the most profound ideas in the simplest English we can all understand and appreciate."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This is a truly inspirational book.

All who I know have read this book love it."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"If you are in search of a book that talks about God in the most comprehensive sense then this is the book. The book takes us through the thoughts, sights and perceptions of a child that reveals more than just God but ourselves."},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"This has always been one of my favorite books and my research has led me to believe she was true. There are 2 versions (America and England) printed with 2 different introductions so if you read both introductions you would get the full insight (unfortunately they didn't put both intros in either book) and the publisher tells how he finally met Fynn and that the story was indeed true. He saw her pictures and writings himself and got to know Fynn quite well. Now that Fynn has passed away the info regarding his true identity was released. Anna made such an impact on him that he couldn't deal with it or write about it for years and the only books he every wrote were 3 about Anna (\\"Mister God This is Anna\\" and \\"Anna, Mister God, and the Black Knight\\" and \\"Anna's Book\\") and I can tell you all 3 are wonderful!My 2 sons (ages 7 and 10) whom I homeschool have been listening to me read the book (I've screened out a bit of the content when reading to them) and they are in TOTAL AWE and keep saying \\"I never want this book to end!\\" We even went so far as to buy the books mentioned in the book that were Anna's favorites and are reading them too for our homeschool (you'll have to read the book to find out what they are). My youngest son in particular is very much like Anna with the ideas he comes up with. My oldest son keeps saying that he thinks his brother is somehow related to Anna. Here is just one example of what he said one day:\\"Mom, I can't understand why everyone doesnt' know that God made everything. I know He made everything. You wanna know how I know? Because He made the ingredients!\\" (My 7 year old son wants to be a scientist someday and even though we haven't studied much about the basic elements, he knows that God made the basics that help make up everything else.) This is just one of the hundreds of things he has come up with that I'm writing down and keeping.So I have proof that children can come up with very profound things. I've kept a close log of everything both of my sons have said and plan on writing a book someday just regarding their profound thoughts (at the request of a friend's sister who is a teacher and has heard some of these things and has told me that's what I need to do - we even have the title of the book already picked out). At any rate, I believe Anna was very true. Her story would not have been told if it wasn't for meeting Fynn and I believe they helped each other - fed off of each other in learning about the world around them. He was a master teacher to lead her the way he did.Once in your life you need to read this book and it's sequels. You won't be sorry. More info on the true author is now available online if you search. His real name was Sydney Hopkins and you can find pictures of him as well as information on his fantastic personal story. Many who knew him said he was so caring, innocent, kind, and ever bit exactly like he comes across in the book. He was so honest and transparent (according to those who knew him) that I personally believe he wrote a very accurate and true account of Anna in these books. One of the first things I'm going to do in heaven is look for Anna and Fynn. I'd like to hang out with them for eternity!Tracy Parish, CPRWTrendSettingResumes.com"},{"Title":"Mister God, This is Anna","review":"Wonderful story about a little girl and her insights in the big picture - and subsequent recall home at an early age. Despite her tender age and all the seemingly injustice that she had to endure so far in life, she is a positive personality - she knows God as he really is.

The author gives balanced, lucid accounts of each theology and rich descriptions of the institutional and historical situation of each thinker. By viewing each intellectual as situated in a particular context and generation and then tracing the way the context and period shape, in each case, the way immediate foundational questions are raised and responded to, Martinez invites readers--not to become anybody's disciples--but to undertake the analogous task of foundational reflection in their own settings. Whatever the starting points of this inquiry are (postwar Germany, postcolonial Latin America, postmodern America), the author shows how each theologian moves ineluctably into questions about the meaning and reality of the mystery of God that seem to lure him on and gather up all his interests and desires. An important study for educated Catholics and others interested in serious contemporary theology, it reminds us that the true study of all \\"theology\\" is what it is we mean when we say \\"God.\\""},{"Title":"Autogenic Methods","review":"This is THE classic manual on Autogenic Training and approach.

The insights into the very different attitude to life and mind set of their growing circle of friends and neighbours is educational in itself, I wish I had read it before we bought our property in Normandy, we would have understood more about what was happening, laughed a lot more and would have probably been a lot less stressed!This is an enjoyable read for anyone and not just for people who are buying or thinking about buying property in France, it is a book for anyone who can enjoy reading about some of life's characters in a story about a couple actually getting up and doing something that most others only dream about.I laughed out loud at some parts and felt their sorrow at others in a book that explains, with insight and humour, a lot of things about France and the French that I, for one, have never quite grasped before, putting all this into a story that held me from page one.By the time you finish you feel that you know George & Donella West and that you would instantly recognize any one of the characters described in the book. You are able to sense their changing attitudes to the local people and, in turn the locals attitude to them as the story progresses.

The result is an honest and at times brutal appraisal of the works of thinkers of the bygone era. Radhakrishnan's consummate ease with the subject comes out in no uncertain terms. The book left me spell bound and answered questions which have been plaguing me for some time now. The book with its well laid out chapters is full of clarity and is scholarly.To start off, His evaluation of the Vedas is clinical - \\"The religion of Vedas certainly more joyous, but it was a lower form of religion where thought never penetrated beneath the husk of things.\\" \\"Men's relations with the gods were mechanical, a question of give and take, profit and loss.\\"He completely adores the Upanishads and comes out as one on home turf when dealing with them. He never misses an opportunity to praise them profusely. It is worth quoting the famous Deussen lines on Upanishads here - \\"but one thing we may assert with confidence - whatever new and unwonted paths the philosophy of the future may strike out, this principle will remain permanently unshaken, and from it no deviation can possibly take place.\\" You can see him getting despondent in the last section of the chapter titled 'Philosophy of the Upanishads'. To quote him from there \\"But the true was overwhelmed by the false\\".Jaina logic and its strong ethical system stand out. To me the following definitely sounded logical and in a way explains the pluralistic realism of Jains - \\"If we consider the effect such as a gold necklace to be a mere substance, it is the same as the gold of which it is made; but if we look at the necklace as a modification, it is new, and did not exist in the mere substance of gold.\\"His dissection of Buddha's silence on the state of the absolute is profound. He is copious in his praise of Buddha. To quote him - \\"No voice like Buddha's ever thundered into our ears the majesty of the good\\".Watch out for the chapter on Materialism. \\"Intelligence is the modification of the four elements, and it is destroyed when elements from which it arises are dissolved\\". As simple as that??The Bhagavad Gita is treated in an elaborate fashion. It is seen as the culmination of the Upanishadic thought with greater emphasis on the religious side. Gita's majesty and its \`truth being spoken as it is seen' style get mentioned. Stand out line for me: \\"Its author does not suspect it is possible for him to err.\\"You can sense a sneaking admiration for Sankara's sharp intellect and this sort of runs across the book.Quite refreshingly, he doesn't try to syncretize heterogeneous beliefs. He quotes his contemporaries and predecessors such as Deussen, Muller, Bloomfield, Oldenberg, Jacobi, hegel, Kant, William Jones, Rhys Davids, Bradley, Garbe, Aurobindo, Tilak heavily. He also quotes from the Christian literature liberally to lay stress on the universality of some of the messages.At times, one could sense the exegesis getting stretched to the point of becoming incognisable with its source. To his credit though he never gets carried away and never ever presents a romantic version of history. But he seems to have completely bought the idea of Aryan invasion though till date fiery battles are being waged on this subject. When it comes to dates, he tends to give conservative estimates.All said, the book, a classic in its own right, takes you on a whirlwind tour of Indian Philosophy, so very rich and profound.Undoubtedly it is the chapter on the Upanishads which kind of stands head and shoulders above the rest. Not surprising, given the author feeling aligned to them. I will leave you with some of the top-of-the-draw-stuff from this chapter, which I guess will be ringing in my ears for years to come:\\"The infinite is not beyond the finite but in the finite\\"\\"We cannot easily conceive this one reality which is concealed by the many objects. We are too worldly, too experienced, and too serious about ourselves for that realization. We live on the surface, cling to forms, and worship appearance\\"\\"Brahman is infinite not in the sense that it excludes the finite, but in the sense that it is ground of all finites.\\"The aim of the Upanishadic thinkers was not science or philosophy, but right living\\"\\"The seers of Upanishads try to lead us to this central reality which is infinite existence (sat), absolute truth (chit), and pure delight (Ananda). The prayer of every human heart is 'Lead me from the unreal to the real, lead me darkness to light, and lead me from death to immortality'\\"\\"The mirror is not shattered simply because nothing is seen in it\\"\\"The existence of the world does not take away from the perfection of the absolute. In a beautiful image it is said: That is full and this is full. From that full rises this full. Taking away this full from that, what remains is yet full.\\"\\"The different elements are in unstable harmony: Two birds, akin and friends, cling to the self-same tree. One of them eats the sweet berry, but the other gazes upon him without eating. In the same tree-the world tree-man dwells along with God. With troubles overwhelmed, he faints and grieves at his helplessness.

From Freud's theory of the Uncanny and Mourning/Melancholia, to Feminist theories and reader response approaches (such as that of Norman Holland's), the gothic as a literary outsider has come a long way from its inception as a marginal form of literature to become one of the most studied and complex form of writing. Halberstam's book is one of the latest critical offerings of reading the Gothic, and it is indeed a timely arrival of an otherwise over-determined reading of this particular genre from the various theoretical approaches (interesting as they may be). Halberstam's approach, grounded in history and racism, renews the gothic's early preoccupation with otherness and the fear of it, but which emphasizes the societal fear of the alien/foreign other, and not so much the struggle between the public and private selves (the beloved of psychoanalytical theory). Her most interesting chapter is the reading of Stoker's \`Dracula' as an anti-semitic propoganda text; indeed, I have appropriated some of her ideas in my view on postcolonial gothic, for I find that her theoretical stance has much to offer in this new and under-emphasized aspect of gothic literature. Halberstam's careful and brilliant intertwining of psychoanalysis, race-relations theory (history) and literary deconstruction is also critically executed in clear, precise language. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to have a fresh outlook on gothic literature."},{"Title":"Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters","review":"Judith Halberstam's \\"Skin Shows: Gothic Horror and the Technology of Monsters\\" (1995) makes two major points about Gothic horror: first about texts, that \\"[t]he production of fear in a literary text . . . emanates from a vertiginous excess of meaning\\" (2) and, second about film, that skin is the boundary which is challenged, brutalized, and sutured together in new configurations--which destroys any simple psychoanalytic reading one might make of the horror film. The book is good, but it relies far too heavily on \\"clever\\" postmodernisms. Here's an example: \\"Hannibal the Cannibal and Buffalo Bill are Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as much as they are Dracula and Frankenstein. Jekyll, of course, produces Hyde from within his own psyche and he cannibalizes him when the pressure is on. Hyde is an incredibly close relative to Buffalo Bill--he too is 'hide-bound,' trapped in his skin, hidden by his hide and hiding from the law\\" (173). The problem is that if everything flows into everything else (if we're only clever enough to find a verbal connection) then what exactly am I supposed to learn from the book? Too often, in my humble opinion, postmodernism is simply an excuse for pedantic writing which is all surface and no depth--while denying that anyone has a right to challenge the surface and lack of depth."},{"Title":"Chinese Regional Cooking","review":"I've been very pleased with this book after purchasing it on impulse at a local bookstore.The recipes are organized geographically, with a chapter devoted to each regional cuisine.

They've gathered the best from nearly a hundred different translators, 1540-1992. There's naughty, nice, imitations, inspirations and a ton o' wit packed in the pages. It will certainly give you an idea of whose translations you would like to read in greater depth. Several more famous poems are given in multiple translations (indexed, handily, in the back).On the other hand, the book also works as something you just dip into. The editors went out of their way to find obscure as well as well-known translations and it pays off. Some of the reprintings from rare manuscripts are delightful, like this one from THE MOST ELEGANT AND WITTY EPIGRAMS OF SIR IOHN HARRINGTON, KNIGHT (1618):&quot;That he is hoarse, yet still to prate doth please,Proves he can neither speak, nor hold his peace.&quot;Or you can dwell in the excellent modern translations of Peter Whigham, Dudley Fitts, Dorothea Wender, J.P. Sullivan, Olive Pitt-Kethly, Philip Murray, Ezra Pound etc.I'm on a serious Pengiun Poets in Translation series binge. I've gathered all the ones I know of in a Listmania List, if you didn't already find this page from it. This is not my favorite of the books, but it's still probably the best way to meet Martial, the legendary Roman epigrammatist. What this particular edition does well is allow you see how Martial was translated by and continues to influence English poets in a chronological order. Hence, one learns a great deal about English poetry by reading the book, as well as Martial."},{"Title":"Martial in English (Poets in Translation, Penguin)","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable.

It creates a bridge between two scientific communities, information technology researchers, on one side and specialists in medicine and biomedical engineering, on the other side, filling a gap that originates in the lack of communication between the two parties. The book brings to the reader contributions by researchers who have been active in the field in the past few years. The list of authors comprises 35 researchers affiliated to outstanding research and academic institutions that cover a very wide geographic area. The monograph addresses a large range of readers, including fuzzy - engineering community, researchers in medicine and biomedical engineering, teachers, doctoral students. Each chapter is provided with an extended list of references, and most of contributed papers contain comprehensive explanation of terminology. At the end of the book, a very rich index of terms is given. A very good idea is having a section that introduces the contributors to the reader, so the papers can be placed in the larger context of their scientific work. We state that the monograph is a major contribution to the dissemination of knowledge in the scientific community; no doubt that we face an editorial event. The book may be regarded as a good acquisition for the reader involved in the approached scientific domains.Florin Grigoras, PhD, research engineer,Institute for Theoretical Informatics, Romanian Academy, Iasi Branch, Romania"},{"Title":"Sinfully Sexy","review":"Chloe Sinclair is the manager of KTEX TV in El Paso, Texas.

This is Chloe's story and she has finally met her match when she tangles with corporate raider Sterling Prescot. They literally run into each other on the first meeting and the sparks fly. She dosen't know who he is and he has no idea who she is. Their worlds are about to collide again in a professional manner, and sweet, simple, and sensible Chloe takes a backseat to sexy, minx Chloe.Sterling has come to El Paso for one reason and one reason only. Take over KTEX T.V. and get back home with his brother Ben before the ink drys on the sales agreement. Well, so much for best laid plans. Before he knows it he has been crashed into by a sexy little lady who wants him to kiss her just because. She has no idea who he is and that's a turn on for him. This should not be a problem except for the fact that she ran out on him when the kiss was just starting to get interesting, and she has now shown up in a meeting regarding the struggling station. Before he knows it, his plans have changed from buying the station to helping the station. That's not all he is about to star as \\"the catch\\" for a reality T.V. show and he wants Chloe to be one of \\"the roses\\". Why is this important you ask? Well, because Chloe is turning out to have an amazing affect on him, and he wants to win her for himself. Now he just needs to prove to Chloe that he's there for the long haul.This was a great story. Ms. Lee's take on today's rage of reality T.V. is great. Old friends make a return and the chemistry between Chloe and Sterling is great. It's worth it in the end when they finally get together.

This is a read that I highly recommend.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Sinfully Sexy","review":"This is the second book I have read in the series and by this author. I previously read \\"Suddenly Sexy\\" and I think I have pegged the problem with this author. There is a lot of story in one book, except it is not all handled in a manner that there is a satisfying conclusion to all the drama.In this story alone there were elements of Chloe having trouble with self-esteem due to her dead grandmother, having issues with men due to her father leaving her, having issues with sex due to her first time being with a douchebag who didn't even call her back. Then Sterling had issues with lying about his identity, his awful sister, his brother drama, being a savvy businessman, being the bachelor, among other things.I just feel that if you are going to introduce so much into the story, you should handle all that in a satisfying way. Chloe's issues with her grandmother weren't dealt with at all. The fact that she was raised being told she was lucky that she was\\"plain\\" and how she always applied that to herself, was pretty much ignored.Chloe's issues with her father were resolved in one conversation. I mean this is a woman who let her father move in after his heart attack when the man left her as a baby. His excuse that he thought she'd be better off with her grandmother after her mother died. Seriously? That counts as an appropriate resolution?Sterling just gave his sister a hug after she almost cost him his relationship with Chloe.The chemistry between Sterling and Chloe was great. I read their story simply because of the excerpt in suddenly sexy about their encounter in the bathroom. They had good chemistry but I didn't feel as if it was developed and nurtured enough to call it love by the time they decided they were in love with each other.I think the characters were definitely interesting but the attention paid to the various elements of the plot introduced was not good enough. I think either the book needed to be longer or there needed to be less issues to manage.So overall a 3.

But she's also shys away from situations that are beyond her control. Like what Jesse did for Kate,I loved that Sterling helped her to see that she's more than sensible,plain-looking,shy Chloe. But even more,I loved that Chloe helped Sterling to see that there's more to life than work and taking what you want. He learned to view the world in a different light thanks to her.

These books are nice and steamy, and will keep you warm on a cold winters night."},{"Title":"Sinfully Sexy","review":"Sinfully Sexy starts out with a bang, and continues to intrigue thru the next few chapters. You can't fully appreciate how wildly out of character the first chapter is for Chloe until you read the next chapter, when Chloe gets ready for work. Lee also keeps you guessing about the identity of the hero until you're a few plot events in. So, needless to say, Sinfully Sexy has a lot to live up to.For the most part, this novel delivers on its promise, although I enjoyed the character development of the hero, and his transition from uber-rich American aristocrat to normal hometwon boy, more than I enjoyed the love story between him and Chloe. Chloe is likeable enough, but I didn't think Lee gave her as much depth as she did to Kate, or Julia in the next book, even though all the elements of a unique character were there.There is also a lot of build up towards book 3, Simply Sexy, that may have taken away from book 2. However, having read Simply Sexy prior to writing this review, I think the plot development of the storyline for Simply Sexy that was included in this book was a crucial build-up, so that Simply Sexy could start without any backstory whatsoever. I can't say I approve of authors using bookspace to get you to anticipate their next novel - rather than concentrating on the story at hand - but it was effective in Lee's case this time.I wouldn't recommend reading Sinfully Sexy on its own, but you'll enjoy it if you've read Suddenly Sexy first, and plan to read Simply Sexy next."},{"Title":"Sinfully Sexy","review":"Had borrowed the other two (2) books in the series to read and had to have the third book.

The other book wasLooking for Laceyand it was really not a recommendable book, except for the side romance going on between the heroine's high school daughter and her classmate - that was literally the only thing that made the book worth reading.\\"SEXY\\" SERIES:SINFULLY SEXY is Book 2 in Lee's \\"Sexy\\" Trilogy - it's preceded by Kate's story inSuddenly Sexyand followed by Julia and Ben's story inSimply Sexy. The three heroines are all coworkers at KTEX TV and have been friends since childhood.SUMMARY (from back cover):Plain-Jane Chloe Sinclair has never been bad ... until she stumbles - literally - into the arms of a gorgeous stranger. To make matters worse, her world is rocked completely off its axis the morning after when the sensual dreamboat turns out to be the man brought in to save the TV station where she works.Sterling Prescott is hard-driven, sexy as hell, and determined to take over the struggling KTEX TV. But all bets are off when the shameless wildcat who disappeared on him last night walks back into his life - acting like a squeaky-clean librarian. Life gets truly complicated, however, when Sterling decides to win more than the station - and to show her that being sexy isn't a sin.CONS:In SINFULLY SEXY, there were a lot of things that were a mess - the story and plot were not \\"tight\\"; there were a lot of contrivances that were created solely for the author's character machinations; the whole last-minute-dating-show-that-will-miraculously-save-the-station-and-oh-what-a-surprise-there-are-some-twists-that-make-certain-characters-have-to-be-contestants was ... yeah, not much appreciated by this reader; the secondary kind-of-romance between Julia and Ben that sets us up for book 3 in the trilogy was annoying, felt very forced, and definitely did not make me inclined to read their story; Chloe's father was blah and the emotional scene and discussion at the end was far too corny and neatly-timed for me; ... and I could go one.PROS:*However*, Chloe was (for the most part - if one ignores some random weird spots here and there) a good heroine and Sterling was (also for the most part - if one ignores his too sudden realization of love and quick turnaround) a good hero. There were some great scenes between them that were very amusing, very enjoyable, and *very* chemically-charged and Sterling sometimes does or says things that will have you sighing out loud. The interactions between him and his brother Ben were also nice additions.NOTE:Also, when I had first read the summary of this book, I thought that Chloe and Sterling basically have a one-night stand with one another and then are surprised to find out the next day that the stranger they slept with from last night is someone they're going to have to work with. Although that's where things are heading, they *do not* sleep with each other at the beginning of the book and when they finally do it is absolutely perfect and at the right time in their relationship and in the book/story.RATING DECISION:So basically it comes down to whether or not the good parts of the book outweigh the bad parts enough to warrant a 4-star rating instead of a 3.5-star one ... and after writing this review and being able to sum it all up for myself, I'm afraid to say that I'm going to have to go with 3.5 stars.BOTTOM LINE:The pros of this book make it definitely worth checking out from the library (which is what I did), but I would hold off on buying it - I know some people have really liked this book, so it could be me, but for me it just doesn't warrant a spot on my keeper and/or reread shelves."},{"Title":"Sinfully Sexy","review":"Don't get me wrong I love Linda Francis Lee's The Devil in the Junior League, it was just wonderful.Sinfully Sexy is an earlier book than The Devil in the Junior League, so I thought I would give it a try but it was just not that good for me at all. I just started skimming it since it was getting on my nerves. I read it all very quickly.The premise is that Chloe is a station manager at KTEX in El Paso and the station is going under. Enter a large conglomerate headed by Sterling Preston who is going to take the station over and sell it off.However, Sterling and Chloe meet at a function in a heavily sexy portrayal in a woman's bathroom and then the next day Sterling shows up at the station. Chloe is mortified that the bathroom assignation, with a man she did not know at the time, turns out to be Sterling.The rest is just too shmaltzy and silly for me. Sterling decides to save the station by doing a show like the Bachelor that plays on tv now, except this show is called The Catch and Twelve Texas Roses.

Ever the smart and sensible good girl, Chloe Sinclair is tired of being alone, and yearns for the chance to be a siren for just one night. At a banquet, she literally runs into a stranger, and while be is mending her scraped knee, she makes a pass at him. As they are locked in a passionate kiss, they are interrupted, and she flees from embarrassment.Sterling Prescott, CEO of Prescott Media has just fired Trey Tanner because his #1 corporate raider has gotten soft and wants to rescue a station owned by debutante, Julia Boudreaux. When he arrives at KTEX, Julia assumes he is Trey, and to Chloe's horror, he is the stranger from her out of norm encounter. When Chloe makes disparaging remarks about the elusive Sterling Prescott, Sterling decides to remain mum about his identity. Suddenly, he has decided that rather than buy them out, he wants to help make the station a success.Chloe's newest brainchild, a reality show (similar to the Bachelor) called \\"The Catch,\\" is their ticket to success. When Sterling signs on to be the catch (still masquerading as Trey), he does so only if Chloe agrees to be a \\"rose.\\" Adding to the complications is Sterling's brother Ben, who he has hired to do security for the live in roses at Julia's mansion. Ben has a growing attraction to Julia, as he bunks in the guest house.As Sterling's feelings for Chloe deepen, he has an agonizing choice to make - should he be honest and reveal his true identity and risk losing her? The wonderful thing about this Cinderella story is that both the prince and the princess learn something important from each other. Through Sterling, Chloe found her inner beauty she had been denying; through Chloe, Sterling learns that there is more to life than acquiring possessions and power if you have no one to share it with.Lee manages to make a great sequel that is almost equal in charm and sizzle to her first installment.

Martin Luther King is presented as a real man with insecurities, self-doubts, college plagarizing and womanizing. But he is also shown as the key individual in the incredible progress (I know it doesn't feel like it--but read the book and its picture of the country in the fifties!) we have made in the area of race relations.MLK is portrayed as a man who rose above his everydayness to achieve insights into the areas of race, poverty and oppression which would move a nation. Blessed in his enemies--the egregious Bull Connor, the banty rooster George Wallace (in his first incarnation) and the despicable J. Edgar Hoover--gave the nation a contrast in possibilities. Despite the reluctance of the Kennedys, the backbiting of his own lieutenants and the inconstancy of the national media, MLK made a difference. To read about his speech at the Linclon Memorial still gives me shivers.This is a fair, honest portrait of a man who made a difference."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"In a short space, Marshall Frady has written an informative, inspiring and thoughtful biography of Martin Luther King Jr., of the nature of his achievement, of his America, and of his vision. The book does not engage in hero-worship or myth-making but rather presents Dr. King as a tortured.conflicted, and lonely individual. Frady writes at the close of his introduction (p.10) (itself a wonderful summation of the book and of Dr. King's achievement): \\"And what the full-bodied reality of King should finally tell us, beyond all the awe and celebration of him, is how mysteriously mixed, in what torturously complicated frms, our moral heroes -- our prophets --actually come to us.\\"A theme of this book is how Dr. King's moral vision and achievement emerged from moral conflict. Dr King spent most of his career walking a difficult path between extremes. At the beginning of his career, he was criticized by the more conservative black establishment which preferred to use the courts rather than demonstrations as a means to promote racial equality. Indeed, Frady tells us, the Mongomery bus boycott of 1955, which catapaulted Dr. King into national prominence, did not end the segregation of the city's bus system -- a court decision did.Towards the end of his career, black leaders such as Malcolm X and Stokely Charmichael pressured Dr. King to abandon his philosophy of nonviolence. He did not do so. But Frady shows us how Dr. King and Malcolm X near the end of their lives each learned something from the other.King's most difficult moral struggle was with himself. Frady gives us a convincing picture of how Dr. King, whose appeal rested upon an ability to convey moral and religous principle, struggled (unsuccessfully) with sexuality. A myriad of affairs followed him and his mission from beginning to end. Frady has insightful things to say about the relationship between Dr. King's tortured, complex personal life and his public mission.Frady also describes how near the end of his career with segregation on the decline in the South, Dr. King tried to expand his mission by opposing the war in Vietnam and by his \\"poor peoples campaign\\" which Dr. King saw as an attack on the materialism, impersonality, and greed that he found pervaded American life. In so expanding his mission, Dr. King alienated many of his followers. His lasting achievement does not rest upon these later activities, according to Frady, but rather upon the idealism and moral committment with which he was able to infuse American life during a few short years.Frady gives us an eloquent discussion of Dr. King's \\"I have a dream\\" speech in Washington D.C. Later in his career, Dr King set forth his vision for America by speaking in terms of a \\"Beloved Community\\", a phrase adopted from the early 20th Century American philosopher, Josiah Royce. Dr King said (p. 183) \\"When I talk about power and the need for power, I'm talking in terms of the need for power to bring about ... the creation of the Beloved Community.\\" Our nation is still trying to recover something of Dr. King's idealism and of the best of his vision.This book encourages us to think about and to formulate for ourselves the vision of America as a \\"Beloved Community\\" by reflecting on the life and achievement of a complex man."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Since his death in 1968, a plethora of books about Martin Luther King, Jr. has inundated the shelves of bookstores. Every angle about his life and work has been explored, critiqued and analyzed. Is there room for one more as we continue the quest for making King's dream for equality a reality? Penquin Lives says yes as it presents a brief biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. as seen through the eyes of a white southern reporter during the era, Marshall Frady.Mr. Frady was one of those reporters assigned to interpret and bring some sense of clarity to the public about the rising civil rights movement and its major leader, King. As a young reporter, he carried out his mission and now as an older statesman of the press he gives us another view about King, his work and his impact on the national scene.Martin Luther King, Jr. focuses on the success, failures and conflicts of a leader caught in a movement that swept him up into the pinacles of history. We see another dimension of King who is vain, unorganized, guilt ridden and a womanizer. His lieutenants are egotistical, mystical, self-serving and dedicated to the cause of freedom. King's genius in keepint these varied personalities in check for a greater cause is a testament to his genius.Frady really doesn't tell the reader anything new about King that hasn't been said before. He merely encapsulates previous information into a format that is readily accessible to those who want to get a brief history of King and the movement but can't endure reading works of countless pages of information. In this Frady excels and does a fine job of being brief but doesn't offer the reader in better insights about the man.I would recommend this book to those who want to get a brief snapshot of King from the perspective of a white southerner. Otherwise I would encourage readers to explore other books that give a more in depth look at the complex life and work of Martin Luther King, Jr."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Simply put, this is the finest of the Penguin Lives series. It gives Dr. King in simple sentences, does not ignore the complexities of his life, and does not indulge in the myth making of previous biographers. You get the man, with his failures, successes, obsessions and ironies, all in one tight package. Wonderful read."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Marshall Frady's book is an invaluable addition to the historical, sociological, and psychological understanding of this country's race relations. In particular, he does not limit the story to what happened decades earlier, but relates the historical events to more recent history. Thankfully, the book treats Dr. King as a human being with faults (e.g., his insecurities, self-doubts, womanizing), and not as a saint (as sometimes portrayed in MLK day celebrations) or as a commodity (as marketed by his family). The value of discussing Dr. King honestly is that his vision for society is not limited to the saints, but can be more practically considered by us regular folks with our shortcomings."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Marshall Frady's little biography of MLK Jr is a beautiful reminder of how lonely a prophet can be in his own land. King's trials and travails so fully recalled, his victories so few and yet so important, the tale of a man driven further and further towards his own vision of what is true and right, and thus driven further and further from the madding crowd. King lives in this profile in all his dignity, all his courage, but also all the agony that being nothing more than human brought to him.And it brought me back to that wonderful moment in our own history when it was possible to truly believe there might be an end to poverty, as the nation's leading moral prophet and its President joined in this assumption, and for a brief golden shining moment, we imagined it was really going to happen.Frady lets us live the difficult, frightening, lonesome historical progression to that moment, all the while realizing how many defeats there were, and how likely it was that King would have been forgotten, despised, a man of but a brief historical moment he may have outlived had he not been assassinated in 1968.One could not ask for a finer brief depiction of what it was like to be caught up in history beyond one's control, beyond one's intention, but history nevertheless grasped by a questing mind and a brave soul."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"In the introduction \\"Martin Luther King Jr.: A Life,\\" Marshall Frady argues that Americans have sought \\"to remember King by forgetting him,\\" suggesting that the civil rights leader was never a mere painted icon and that current and future generations actually do him a disservice by remembering him that way. In this trim biography of barely 200 pages, the author presents the full measure of King as a man, his quick intelligence, burning ambition and oratorical genius, alongside his more human, vulnerable dimensions, his frequent self-doubt, his contentious relationship with his father, his often plagiaristic academic affairs, his licentious personal life. The reader gets a sense of both his greatness and his humanity; what made him so special and what made him so ordinary. All of this is delivered beautifully by Frady, with exquisitely constructed prose, capturing the raw emotion of the civil rights era, the vibrancy of the people and the movement, the oppressive, heavy sticky heat of the long, violent summers of the 1960s.Frady delivers a riveting narrative, beginning with King's relatively privileged, cosseted youth in Atlanta to his emergence, almost accidentally and with great foreboding, as the leader of the bus boycott in Montgomery at the improbably tender age of 26. The author chronicles King's career from the unexpected success of Montgomery to the disappointment of Albany, Georgia to his redemption -- indeed \\"apotheosis\\" according to Frady -- in Birmingham and then the March on Washington in 1963 to the lows and highs of St. Augustine and Selma, and finally the frustrations of his lofty aims in Chicago, against the growing war in Vietnam and the revolutionary, pan-racial Poor People's Campaign.Several themes run throughout this marvelous work of biographical synthesis. First, King was, for over a decade, haunted by his bte noire, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who viewed him as, at best, a fraud and, at worst, an active agent of communist subversion. Frady maintains that King's priapic thirst was insatiable, regularly bedding multiple women in a single night, including the evening before his assassination in Memphis in April 1968. These assignations were regularly taped by the FBI, complete with King's allegedly ribald intercourse outbursts, which Hoover and his cronies shared with Washington leaders in a vain hope to crush the civil rights leader's credibility and cripple his movement. According to Frady, threatened exposure weighed especially heavily on King in Oslo when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1963. Furthermore, Hoover believed that King was under the direct influence of Moscow via his close relationship with Stanley Levison, a known communist and longtime King confidante, although no such ties to Marxist operatives have ever been verified.A second theme is the central importance of an antagonist in King's many campaigns for racial desegregation and equality. Without race-baiting Neanderthals like Bull Connor or George Wallace, King's efforts often petered out, ending in sham negotiated settlements. Nothing hurt the civil rights movement more than superficially congenial whites in power, like Laurie Pritchett in Albany and Richard Daley in Chicago, men who refrained from using force against demonstrators and who were willing to meet in civil discourse, quickly striking bargains that they never intended to fulfill. Tragically, it was the dogs and water cannons and billy clubs -- all caught on nightly national television -- that propelled the civil rights movement forward in the King years.Finally, there is the overarching presence of the flesh-and-blood King, short and podgy and chain smoking behind closed doors, living in constant fear of arrest and death, never truly believing in his own abilities or destiny, often swept along by events not entirely of his own making or choosing, without any real plan. By the time of his assassination, Frady argues, King was a spent force, on a steep decline in influence and respectability, out of touch with many black Americans increasingly drawn to the strident nationalism and Black Power movement of Stokely Carmichael and other firebrands, alienating his traditional white liberal base over his early and vigorous opposition to the Vietnam War and splintering his own loose coalition of acolytes in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) over his quixotic Poor People's Campaign, which was scheduled to kick off just after his fateful trip to Memphis. Indeed, Frady argues that had not King been assassinated in 1968 (like his hero and spiritual idol, Gandhi, in 1948), he likely would have receded to the margins of American history, remembered as a pivotal player in the early civil rights movement, but not the transcendent hero with a national holiday in his honor that he is today.For those looking for a crisp, sharp, illuminating biography of King, this is the book. Frady writes with rich, florid prose and his vocabulary may be a bit difficult for some (as a few reviewers have commented acidly below), but that's even more reason to make this the one book you read on King."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Marshall Frady has produced an insightful summary of the life and work of Martin Luther King Jr. for the Penguin Lives series of short biographies. Working within the limitations of the series, Frady's synopsis breaks no new ground - King's life, campaigns, struggles and death are covered in just over 200 pages. But the object here is less to broaden or shape understanding than to evoke the spirit of the man and his times.The key events of King's life are well known; here the story unfolds in a progression grounded in Biblical narrative. An explicit conceit of this work is a view of King as a latter-day prophet, an American Moses destined to point the way to the Promised Land, but not to reach it. The book's four major sections reflect this theme.The first, titled \\"Out of Egypt\\", recalls King's childhood and education; his assumption of pastorly duties in Montgomery; and the first dramatic act of his civil rights career as an (initially reluctant) organizer of the 1955 bus boycott campaign. The second, \\"The Wilderness Time\\", recounts the aimlessness that settled over King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference following the Montgomery victory. Although it was an NAACP-led court victory and not the boycott campaign which finally won the day, Montgomery had vaulted him to national prominence and de facto leadership of the civil rights movement. A potential follow-up act wouldn't present itself until 1961; even then, King's foray into Albany, Georgia in support of the Albany Movement to end segregation in that remote locale produced no substantive gains.In the meantime King had attracted the malevolent attentions of the reigning FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, whose grotesque character Frady evokes in a remarkable thumbnail sketch. \\"By the Fifties\\", Frady writes, Hoover \\"had become for much of the country... a kind of totem figure of law and uprightness.\\" Yet his brand of law included domestic surveillance in the service of political blackmail. Impelled by racism and anticommunist paranoia, Hoover initiated a bugging and wiretap campaign against King.Hoover's wiretaps revealed little in the way of communist plots, but they did evidence the serial adultery that seems to have begun in this period. Amazingly, King's dalliances never became public knowledge during his lifetime, even though Hoover deliberately made taped materials available to members of the press. Contrast this restraint with today's media behavior: as Frady acknowledges, \\"King could very likely never have survived now as the figure he was then.\\"The conflict between flesh and spirit was a constant theme in King's life. On the one hand, here was a man who eschewed public ostentation and sought to emulate Mahatma Gandhi; on the other, a womanizer and, it would appear, a plagiarist. But King's expression of the spiritual took other, powerful forms. He was frequently jailed in the course of his work for the movement and was no stranger to physical assault. By the fatal day in Memphis, King had already been punched, kicked, and stabbed by racist antagonists; all of which assaults he suffered with amazing forbearance. On one remarkable occasion of being repeatedly punched in the face, and the assailant having been wrestled to the ground by his entourage, King urged them: \\"Don't hurt him, we have to pray for him.\\" As Frady suggests, the product of this frisson was a monumental oratorical power in communicating the message of nonviolence - a power that for America came to its fullest and most significant expression on the Washington Mall with the ringing proclamation: \\"I have a dream today!\\"Section three, \\"Apotheosis\\", narrates the battle to integrate Birmingham, the symbolic pinnacle of the March on Washington, and the watershed of American conscience at Selma - culminating in the crowning achievement of King's life and struggle: the Voting Rights Act of 1964.In Albany the movement had been \\"deprived... of those convulsive clashes that would have dramatized for the rest of the country the underlying barbarity of its segregationist order.\\" In Birmingham the police were more obliging. After a slow start, King and his followers decided to mobilize schoolchildren in a bid to overwhelm the jail system and force a resolution. The controversial strategy worked; images of young people in their Sunday best pummeled by fire hoses sickened the nation. Under pressure from all sides, the municipal authorities were forced to concede.And then came that speech in Washington. Time and distance can threaten to make a clich&eacute; of most anything, but Frady's retelling feels fresh in its evocation: \\"It had suddenly become a pentecostal moment. A huge shiver of exhilaration moved through the expanses of the throng...\\"At Selma, the \\"underlying barbarity\\" was revealed for all to see, courtesy of the state police and national television. The spectacle of violence against innocent citizenry spurred the White House to action. Addressing the nation to announce the Voting Rights Act, (in a moment to make one feel keen regret at a legacy tarnished by Vietnam) President Johnson intoned: \\"... and we _shall_ overcome!\\"In the book's final section, \\"The Far Country\\", we have the rest of the story - the Nobel Peace Prize, the Movement post-Selma, and the sudden end in Memphis. If King found himself \\"in the wilderness\\" after Albany, perhaps he was even more so after Selma. The movement's key objectives achieved, King set his sights on perhaps a more impossible dream: the reorganization of American life on egalitarian, socialist, grounds. Given the sweeping ambitions of the frustrated Chicago Movement and the grandiosity of the Poor People's Campaign, there is something poignant in the fact that what brought King to Memphis in April 1968 was no vast plan of social reorganization but mobilization in support of striking garbage workers.If Frady's book is at times slightly overwritten (\\"the rhetoric of the human spirit immensely and elaborately gathering itself for slow and terrific struggle\\" [p. 35] feels like a blind stab at the Faulkneresque), it is also an effective, and at times even powerful, homage to one of our greatest Americans."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Dr martin Luther King Jr is a hero of mine and i have always respected and read any and every book on him. he is truly one of the most important figures to ever grace this Earth and the United States in Particular. this book goes into his life and also his views and how he battled the ever changing climate and how he dealt with racism and his feelings on a whole on a wide range of subjects. this book deals with all things that made him up and his orgainazation and people he had close to him. very well written and insightful and i can never get enough of reading about him and the movement and his times."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"Martin Luther King, Jr. was one of those Americans like Ben Franklin, George Washington, Abe Lincoln, and FDR, who, to me, were far too perfect to be interesting. When we learn about these people in grade school, we are taught about how awesome and nice they were to the point they become rather dull. When I got older and I started to read more about these people, I discovered their true greatness. King was probably the greatest American never to hold public office, yet, had had an effect on this country similar to that of Franklin Roosevelt or John Marshall. Unfortunately, like many great leaders of our past, King's legacy now clouds the image of who the man was. When I read King's Autobiography, I felt I had come to a greater understanding of him as a person and his perspective on himself. Reading Marshall Frady's Martin Luther King: A Life has given me more of a clear image of who the man was and times that he lived. Frady's King is a man who, like all men, is flawed human being. Here he is presented as Oliver Cromwell once said 'with warts in all'. But even the 'sins' of Martin Luther King are very minor when compared to other American icons, and King clearly paid for them more then he should have in his war with J. Eager Hoover. The United States of America today is a very different place then it has been because King was a major player in his era.For me, the highlight of this book is the struggle between King and Hoover. One of things America has learned since the sixties and seventies have become more history then memory for an entire generation of people, was the war between the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement and Director of the FBI.J. Edger Hoover was a legend in the United States in the area of crime fighting. In 1924, Hoover was appointed Director of the Bureau of Investigation, which was the predecessor of the FBI, and he was instrumental in founding the FBI in 1935. He would still be the Director when he died in 1972. Hoover is credited with building the FBI into a large and efficient crime-fighting agency and with instituting a number of modern innovations to police technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories. Hoover's efforts had put a huge dent into organized crime operations during his tenure. If he had stuck to actual criminals, his legacy would be untouchable as some of his legendary G-Men were. However, convinced through very little evidence-and much more racism and paranoia-that Civil Rights organizations were communist plots against the government and he would have to stop them. He would go out of his way to wage an irrational campaign against them.\\"While King still had no inkling of it, there had in fact commenced what was to become a prolonged shadow war between him and Hoover. Though it would take place mostly out of the public eye, the two of them were to be looked into an elemental conflict as figures reflecting--more, virtually embodying--two poles of the American character: that ethic lasting Plymouth's starch-collared society of probity, discipline, righteousness as a matter of a ruthless cleanliness of behavior, this rectitudinousness in schizophrenic tension with an unrulier urge lasting from the frontier, a restlessness with authority and convention, a readiness for adventure in exploring the farther, windy moral opens of life. Since assuming power as director of the FBI in 1924, Hoover had not appreciably changed his notion of what should be the character of the nation--sedate, sober, orderly, and properly segregated, like his FBI--and he had ever since applied all the energies of the institution he had created to keeping it that way, to preserve the plainer America of his nostalgias against alien contamination and the subversions of more diverse cultural weathers. By the fifties, he had become for much of the country--this stubby, pluggish, stern little pug-bull of a man with a cauliflower pallor and flat, blunt face--a kind of totem figure of law and uprightness. In the process, he had consolidated the FBI into perhaps Washington's greatest private preserve of official power ever, his intelligence files holding even many in the halls of government in fear.\\" p.81-2The book also discuss the famous March on Washington in 1963. It discusses the event, the organizers, its purpose, and even some of the people who did not want it to proceed, including President Kennedy. Kennedy sometimes gets criticized for this but that is with hindsight being twenty/twenty. It is a great testament to those marched that day that not one act of violence occurred. Had there been a riot, it might have been a huge set-back for the movement. Fortunately the march was completely peaceful.\\"The mass pilgrimage into Washington had been entrepreneured by movement patriarch A. Philip Randolph, in concert with other leaders like King, and despite his crankiness about the SCLC's ascendancy after Birmingham, Roy Wilkins, to demonstrate the expanse and spirit of the movement with a colossal rally to appeal to Congress for passage of the public accommodations bill presented by Kennedy. The president himself, however, was more than a little edgy about it all, trying to dissuade the march's organizers with warnings, in a conversation with them beforehand, that thousands of demonstrators converging into the capital could be seen by Congress as an attempt at mob intimidation, resulting in their all losing the legislation he'd introduced, many on the Hill already looking for a pretext anyway to avoid supporting it. King offered the observation he had put to Birmingham's ministers: 'Frankly, I have never engaged in any direct-action movement which did not seem ill-timed. Some people thought Birmingham ill-timed.' To which the president rejoined, with a small smile, 'Including the Attorney General.'\\" p.121-2There is a focus on King and his main competitor of ideas in the African-American community, Malcolm X. Frady discusses how King and Malcolm came from two very different walks of life.\\"They were, King and Malcolm, really projections of two entirely different cultures. King's was a ministry congenial to his mostly churchly, respectably middle-class black constituency, eager to join in a coalition of purpose with the nation's white liberal establishment. But Malcolm was a prophet of another America, having arisen out of a childhood of cold miser that could not have been more unlike King's snugly privileged upbringing, and the vicious and gaudy hustler society of the black underclass in those mammoth ghettos of the North's 'great cities of destruction,' in E. Franklin Frazer's phrase. Such inner exiles lived without any sense of connection to the rest of the country, bereft of that sense of their individual worth without which 'they cannot live,' as James Baldwin wrote during the time, and 'they will do anything whatever to regain it. That is why the most dangerous creation of any society is that man who has nothing to lose.'\\" p.129As time went on a new battles emerged, King would go on and face new challenges as younger and more militant generation were rejecting his message of love for a Black Nationalist ideology that he was completely repulsed by.\\"Yet King was to cast himself against all this anyway. He may have arrived with Birmingham and Selma at his apotheosis as the Mosaic figure leading his people out of the old Egypt of their bondage in the South, but with this grander aspiration 'to confront the power structure massively' on a national scale, he was entering full into his tragic arch.\\"p.169There is also discussion of his last uncompleted mission in which he was going to challenge the great economic forces of our nation, a mission that he would be slain before he could truly begin.\\"Thus, in the summer of 1967, King announced what would be the most expansively radical adventure of his life: a national movement called the Poor People's Campaign. It would mobilize into one wide popular front not only blacks but all the country's disregarded and outcast--poor whites, Hispanics, Native Americans--in a great Gandhian crusade that would challenge the nation's entire custodial complex, not just its corporate citadels but its central institutions of government, to free the destitute of America from their generational ghettos of hopelessness.\\" p.194I highly recommend this work it is a great and fascinating look into one of the greatest leaders of any age.

In furies of rage Martin Luther King Sr. would often horribly beat his wife and children. Martin Luther King Jr. was so troubled by his father's beatings that he attempted killing himself three times.At age fifteen, after graduating very early from highschool, the rather unmotivated King attended Morehouse College. After graduating from Morehouse, King went on to attend Cruzed Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania,where he was to become a preacher like his father. It was here that King seemingly grew up; he studied hard, became class president, and graduated as valdictorian. When King proposed to Coretta Scott in the early 1950s he was already engaged to a few other former girlfriends from back home. They married in 1953, spending their honeymoon night in the basement of a funeral parlor because the nearest hotels and motels were segregated.In 1954 the newlyweds moved to Montgomery Alabama where the young King became the highly respected preacher at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.King's life would shortly change when he was asked to lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott that lasted over a year.Eventually he joined the NAACP and began the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King was arrested several times for his non-violent actions. During one of these incidents he composed his famous &quot;Letter From a Birmingham Jail.&quot; He befriended the Kennedy brothers (somewhat) in their effort to help the movement. On August 28, 1963 King recited his, &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.

Here is the final paragraph I read, before giving up in frustration: \\"As an accomodation of those two approaches, he took with huge enthusiasm to Hegel's idea of dialecticism: the continuous process in human understanding and history of a prevailing thesis inevitably invoking a contrary antithesis, the two then forming a synthesis that becomes the new thesis to be countered by its antithesis, an interplay endlessly progressing.\\" I'll find another book to help me learn about the historic figure."},{"Title":"Martin Luther King, Jr.","review":"This book begins with a sentence fragment arguing that the age of white racism and Southern apartheid seems like ancient history.

Yuppies buy most of the books, and this one is a perfect ego-stroke to yuppies. It lets you say you know something about MLK, without having your basic worldview challenged by a truthful presentation of his real meaning. Imagine Dr. King living to challenge our economic and political elites over several more decades. If you're smug and dumb enough to believe this wouldn't have mattered, you'll be happy to have Frady's tropes.The book is a serious miseducation."},{"Title":"Living Spanish, Revised (cass/book): The Complete Living Language Course (Living Language Basic-Intermediate)","review":"I bought this 6-disk package about 3 months ago and have been using it regularly in my 60 miles of commuting every day. I have been studying Spanish for about year; previously using tapes and books. The discs in All-Audio Spanish are well-organized, the speakers have different, clear voices and the discs are much easier to use than cassettes; primarily because you can go back quickly to a specific location to repeat a &quot; chapter.&quot; The package also comes with a 4x5&quot; pamphlet of 58 pages that lists the terms and words used in each chapter but gives none of the dialog, no guides to pronunciation, very little grammar information and is printed in tiny letters on poor quality brownish paper that is hard to read from.There is no way this course meets the &quot;all-audio&quot; claim. Most of the time you already have to know what the words are before you can understand the Spanish-speakers. That means you have to have the single page of the documentation open and try to figure out through trial and error what word they are saying. In the car this is impossible even though I am familiar with a fair number of basic words.Since the discs are excellent and well-recorded, however, I'd say they are worth the $30.00+ I paid for the package. It is flawed though because it is simply not set up for pure audio learning and I would recommend it only for intermediate students or those trying to polish up what they already knew sometime in the past."},{"Title":"Living Spanish, Revised (cass/book): The Complete Living Language Course (Living Language Basic-Intermediate)","review":"Having read the previous reviews of this CD set, I wonder if I'm the only one who has enjoyed it. What excited me most about All-Audio Spanish was when I had listened to all 6 CDs and restarted Disk 1. I had felt a bit frustrated as the CDs progressed, feeling, as some other reviewers apparently have, that it was really fast. But when I started CD 1 again, and was able to speak along fairly well for the first few lessons (there are 35 total), I was really excited. I just completed a 17-hour drive, listening to the CDs the whole way, which was enough time to listen to all CDs twice. While I'm not nearly fluent, I'm amazed at how much of the conversation in the CDs I can actually understand. Particular features I like about the set:The book: since it's all-audio, the book isn't much; it basically lists the words used in the CDs (listed by lesson), along with their translations. There's also a section on the grammar rules discussed on the CDs. The reason I like the book is because it's concise, and makes referencing from the CDs easy. It's not necessary to reference the book while listening, but I have found it helpful to review the words of a lesson in the evening when I'm not driving.The organization: Each lesson is divided into lettered sections (i.e., Lesson 1a), from A to H. Each sub-lesson has it's own focus, such as new vocabulary words (A), or Hispanic cultural information (G).Depth of language coverage: As the lessons progress, the narrator always teaches new vocabulary, but goes through all modes of language use, such as past tense, future tense, subjunctive, etc., making each lesson valuable. Other language books I've read separate subjects out without integrating necessary information, so if you're not interested in learning about riding trains, for example, you can just skip the section. But in this set, a lot of what you learn in each section applies to all parts of the language.Difficulty format: What I mean by this is that the difficulty level goes up dramatically in the first 5 lessons (CD 1), and then stays there. Although you continue to learn new things, and there is necessarily some building on earlier lessons, the difficulty level stays about the same. Having said that, it's also wide open for continual learning. Since I'm not worried about completely understanding each lesson before tackling the next, it leaves me something else to learn when I come back to this lesson again. This also helps me retain the information that I do learn.Things that bugged me about All-Audio Spanish:Packaging: The CD holder in the box is not convenient for changing CDs when driving. The plastic is too stiff, too tight, and doesn't have a slit to make it easier to pull out the CD, making it necessary to touch front and back of the CD to pull it out (something I hate to do).Overlooked words: This is minor, because you pick it up as you go through the lessons, but it bugged me. First, at the beginning, when the linguists are demonstrating how to pronounce the alphabet, they skip the letter &quot;K&quot;. Also, as they're going through the numbers, they skip 11 and 12.I highly recommend this CD set. I think that if you put any effort into it, you will reap huge benefits."},{"Title":"Living Spanish, Revised (cass/book): The Complete Living Language Course (Living Language Basic-Intermediate)","review":"I had two years of high school Spanish, and another year in college. When my husband and I started traveling, I wanted to relearn some of my Spanish. Even with the background I had, this audio was much too fast. I have persisted with listening daily, but have not had the progress I would have wanted because relatively difficult and unusable sentences are repeated quickly, then I won't hear them again until I get back to that section of the day in several days(I'm listening on the way to work, so don't back tape up). Some sentences are not translated, and individual words have to be figured out by elimination of the words you already know.

While the earlier book by Saxon does discuss a precursor to Monopoly, it says nothing about Parker Brothers' underhanded dealings. Nor does it tell the story of how the game fell into the hands of &quot;inventor&quot; Charles Darrow.

It contains nothing however about the transformation of that game through the monopoly folklore to the Darrow/Parker Bros Atlantic City copy. Nor does it contain anything about the cover- up which has served so well to monopolise Monopoly for so many years.The book is a product of Dr Anspach's detective work which was validated by the American Courts and is to be commended in stark contrast to the corporate sanctioned Orbanes book.

Required reading for anyone who ever read The Monopoly Book or The Monopoly Companion."},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Monopoly (R) Swindle","review":"I met Ralph Anspach at the 2009 American Library Association Midwinter Meeting in Denver. I was looking for books to publish, and he had this curious self-published book titled \\"Monopolygate\\" (The new title for this ISBN, apparently). Anspach explained that he was the inventor of the game Anti-Monopoly, and that his company was sued for trademark infringement by Parker Brothers and that he eventually won the suit. I had recalled from my youth this particular news item, and had seen the first edition of Anti-Monopoly in a local toy store while all this was going down, so I was excited to find a piece of what was for me, a piece of my childhood come to life.It seemed like this could be a good topic for our Game Day imprint, and so Anspach gave me a free review copy to read.Now, I am pretty biased against self-published books, as they are usually poorly written, but as is my nature, I read the first few pages. This was one of those times where a few pages turned into a couple of chapters and then into a long night of not being able to put the book down. There are some typographical errors that stand out, but Anspach has a way of telling a great story about what is essentially a long, drawn-out legal fight against the odds. It's full of people and their opinions, and even the dreaded Parker Brothers-General Mills juggernaut legal team is full of interesting personalities. The twists in this case keep on coming, and considering that all of Anspach's amateur detective work was done in the age before the Internet, it is an amazing piece of real-life amateur sleuthing.Other reviews have commented on the book's look at how Anspach, a small-business owner, goes to court to defend himself in a nearly impossible-to-win lawsuit and pulls off a counter-offensive against the biggest trademark holder in the game business. Other reviews also laud the book's investigation into the secret history and the incredible cover-up of the game Monopoly. Anspach is deliciously good at telling his side of the story.But for me, as the publisher of the imprint Game Day which publishes game books and books about games, I was equally impressed by Anspach's story of how an economics professor with no experience in the back-biting world of the game industry (or in business in general) managed to launch a world-class game on a shoestring. For any game-industry entrepreneur or game designer, I strongly recommend this book as a slap of reality in the face. Anspach made every mistake possible, and without much capital at all, and yet through his own tenacity and determination, not only succeeded, but held back the worst onslaught possible from the biggest player in the business, all the way to the Supreme Court.There is also an intriguing story that Anspach only hints at. In the beginning of the book, we find that he and his family escaped the Nazi Holocaust and that he joined the U.S. Army during World War II and helped decode German messages. He would later illicitly join the freedom fighters in the Israeli War of Independence.I would have given this book five stars were it not for the persistent typographical errors. But if you can live with stray quotation marks and erroneous paragraph breaks every now and again, then consider this a great story. Yes, Anspach does seem a little biased, and he does promote his own game in the back of the book, but the book is as much an autobiography of how he invented his game as much as it is an expose of the Monopoly monopoly; if anyone has earned the right to promote his own inventions in his own autobiography, Anspach certainly has, and frankly, the end-of-the book promotion does not deter from the story one bit.This book is for game designers, entrepreneurs, readers of business exposes, Monopoly game lovers and haters, game collectors, economists, lawyers and politicians, and anyone who has ever rooted for the underdog. This is a great business expose told from an individual who stood in the midst of it all."},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Monopoly (R) Swindle","review":"albert c. veldhuis - november 11, 1998 Serious, still easy to read book about a sad story!

Ralph Anspach has a gift for telling a story in a way that puts you right in the middle of the action. You get to read about how an Economics Professor invented a board game and all the trials he went through to get it to market. Then you read how Parker Brothers could not stand this harmless little game and did everything they could to ban it from being sold. In self-defense, Ralph Anspach looked into the real history of the game, meeting the people and visiting the places where monopoly was invented years before it's claimed &quot;invention&quot; by Charles Darrow in 1935. The invention fraud pales in comparison to the cover-up that Parker Brothers carried out in order to line their pockets and monopolize the board game industry - and you, the consumer, got to pay for it in higher prices and inferior products. As the battle rages on we find Kenneth Starr in his pre-Lewinski days and some of America's biggest companies gang-up to rid the world of Anti-Monopoly once-and-for-all. How did this immigrant professor become such a threat to big business capitalism? The answers are masterfully revealed in this book that will keep you smiling and reading all through the night. Scandal, money-hungry, bloodthirsty business, a monopoly detective and more...it's all here."},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Monopoly (R) Swindle","review":"This is an entertaining book, and interesting to read about the whole Monopoly inventor scandal and the ramifications of it, but beyond that, the book is extremely biased and full of opinions. One chapter in particular sets up a supposed meeting between the fake inventor and a Parker Bros. executive, in the eyes of how the author thought it probably happened. Admittedly, the author presents it as his opinion only, but personally I prefer to read facts, and think the book would have been better without that possibly false story.The entire book is (obviously) very biased. If you want to read an objective book about all of this, this probably isn't the one for you. Furthermore, the author's knowledge of antitrust law (particularly toward the end of the book when talking about Hasbro) is not very good. This is the a David v. Goliath story, and the author never lets you forget it. At times, his obsession with establishing who the real inventors of Monopoly are is a bit creepy.The end of the book includes a pitch for his new board game and computer games, which completely diminished the book, at least in my opinion. It's a book, not an advertisement!"},{"Title":"The Billion Dollar Monopoly (R) Swindle","review":"It's interesting how Anspach presents all this information on Monopoly's origins as groundbreaking investigation when I read most of it in Sid Sackson's A Gamut of Games (published in 1969) and in Phil Orbane's The Monopoly Book (authorized by Parker Brothers, no less). Anspach must have been really out of touch not to have known all of this - which doesn't surprise me at all."},{"Title":"The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace","review":"Cheryl Rubenburg provides a detailed yet gripping description of the plight of the Palestinians. For those of us who are not scholars of the history or politics of the Middle East, it is quite a significant challenge to provide an accurate and very detailed account of the facts and circumstances regarding this pivotal conflict without creating tedious reading. Cheryl Rubenberg accomplishes this task with a sense of mastery. The scholarship behind the book does not get in the way of enticing one to read on. I found this book to be extremely informative and very deeply disturbing - I could not put it down. Each chapter is supported by numerous citations from highly reputable sources for those wishing to pursue their scholarship. This is a very timely and deeply moving book that all Americans should read, so that we may better find our way forward in re-shaping our foreign policy."},{"Title":"The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace","review":"Cheryl A. Rubenberg gives readers an accurate picture of the conflict in her 450 page paperback packed with information. The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace is a book of great research and logic. She points out the truth that \\"perceptions of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict are so deeply imbued with biases and stereotypes-typically unrecognized as such-that we often do not grasp the fundamental issues.\\" Simply put, if you get this book you will grasp the fundamental issues.Her central focus is the so called Oslo \\"peace process\\" but she covers the whole of the conflict from the beginning to the present with powerful examples that go under-reported to unreported here in America and includes in her endnotes other startling facts that never get exposed in mainstream discussions. Her thesis is brutally honest: Israel never intended to withdraw from the Occupied Territories based on UN Security Council Resolution 242 and Israel never intended on permitting a genuinely independent Palestinian state.Facts that pro-Israeli and some pro-Palestinian writers leave out she doesn't shy away from. Readers will learn things that might shock them if they have relied on the dishonest sources and media presentations that dominate public perceptions. With the book you will get the full picture. You will learn not only what Israel has been up to but also how the Palestinian Authority, with its corruption and repression, \\"has contributed significantly to the deterioration of Palestinian society.\\"It is important for Americans to learn the horrific examples of Zionist cruelty. This book is really well written and gives a good sampling of events PLUS the endnotes contain even more cases of barbarism that may just open the eyes of some willing to act like a human being and not a robotic apologist for the \\"Jewish State.\\"The examples of what one can find in her endnotes are really shocking and she exposes attempts to suppress it. Read about Irgun's savagery in details you may never have heard before, this is what Deir Yassin was: \\"... on April 9. 1948, Menachem Begin's Irgun massacred 254 people-mostly old men, women, and children-then mutilated, raped, disemboweled, and paraded their corpses through the streets of Jerusalem.\\" (from endnote 51) She notes that this was not an isolated incident.And she points out that Begin bragged about this \\"triumph\\" when he wrote about it in his book published in 1951 but he removed reference to it in a revised edition of his book in 1977.For those who thought it was only the Palestinians who fled and were refused entry back into Israel that lost property and land without reparations, this book is a wake up call. In the first 8 years, the Jewish State took away a staggering 50% of all the land owned by Palestinians remaining in Israel. The shocking fact is some 39,000 Palestinians who never left were robbed anyway! \\"Israel seized property an land from some 39,000 Palestinians who escaped expulsion and remained in Israel. It was never retuned, and these individuals never received compensation although they are citizens of Israel.\\" (from endnote 67)If you want to know what you are talking about when it comes to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, this is the book for you. Rubenberg spells it out clearly, buy The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace today."},{"Title":"The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace","review":"Contrary to the vague and ambiguous accusations leveled by other reviewers who have supposedly read the book, the content of this book is completely even-handed in its criticisms of everybody who is harming ordinary Palestinians. One could even do a Rawlsian-style thought experiment - as Jill Malter advocates - and come away with this conclusion.In some chapters Rubenberg provides ample statistics regarding the daily property destruction, colonization, and targeting of Palestinian civilians (by Israeli military and settlers alike) occurring in the Occupied Territories. Then in other chapters, she issues devastating critiques of the thuggish corruption and nepotism of the Palestinian Authority. Her balanced criticism of all parties leaves no doubt that her work is not \\"anti-jewish\\" or \\"anti-israeli,\\" but rather pro-Palestinian -- excoriating any practice or party that inhibits the Palestinian people's basic human rights as provided by international human rights and humanitarian laws.Rubenberg does an outstanding job at filling in the gaps in knowledge that the media creates through their reporting patterns (it may be understandable that suicide bombings garner countless hours of coverage while the uprooting of Palestinian citrus trees or the sealing of Palestinian homes garner none, but it is unfortunate nontheless). As such, it is a treasure.It is certainly telling that those who criticize the book cannot cite anything specificically wrong in its analysis, and instead just whine about the what they perceive as the implicit messages of the book."},{"Title":"The Palestinians: In Search of a Just Peace","review":"Rubenberg tells us she wants justice. Well that's nice. I want justice. For everyone. I want human rights, including rights to life, liberty, and property. For everyone. As near as I can tell, Rubenberg does not.If you are reading this review and are not so sure that I am being fair in making such statements, I challenge you to pretend that you do not know whether you are a Christian, Jew, Muslim, or Pagan. That you do not know whether you are a soldier or a civilian. That you do not know what nationality you are. Pretend that you'll find out only after you decide what fairness and justice are. Then decide what is fair and just. If you do that and still read Rubenberg's book, I think you'll quickly see how far Rubenberg is from advocating justice.Without justice, there are no rights. Without truth, there is no justice. And, having read her book, it seems to me that Rubenberg can't stand truth. She starts by making misleading statements about demography and land ownership. She skips the entire history of Arab attacks on Jews and replaces it with absurd fabrications about Zionism's purpose, intentions, and history. At all times, she appears to oppose both justice and human rights and seems ready to fight to the last Arab to hurt Israel.Rubenberg doesn't like Arafat either, blaming him for agreeing to negotiate with Israel about the disputed territories. And, of course, she does not like the United States, a nation that to her is under the thumb of the infamous Zionist Lobby and is therefore unwilling to oppose any Israeli policies. It makes me wonder why she bothered accepting her position at Florida International University in the first place.I found it embarrassing that a fellow human being could be so dishonest and nasty.Still, I have to admit that I did read the book, and all her notes. She says that perhaps the best account of the history of Jerusalem is the one by Karen Armstrong. I had just read it!Avoid both books."},{"Title":"Galliard: 6 Sonatas for Trombone and Piano Volume I","review":"This version (Marx) of Galliard's Six Sonatas for Trombone was a very hard to find edition.

I love it! A must for all pirate lovers!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book does a great job of separating the fact and the fiction of the history of pirates. It may be somewhat depressing to read at times such as the horrible revelation that for the most part pirates didn't have parrots nor were they particularly merciful to the crews they captured over the course of a raid.For all of their faults Pirates were somewhat unique for a culture in the 16th, 17th and 18th century in so far as there was a genuine opportunity for advancement but the sorrowful truth is that most pirates far from getting rich exited this life at the end of a rope.Overall-An excellent resource for serious historians or for people who are just curious about the subject."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"In the first Chapter of this book the author David Cordingly lists some movie adaptations of Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island.\\"Here's the last one:\\". . . in 1990 Charlton Heston played Silver and his son played a somewhat older than usual Jim Hawkins.\\"In actuality Christian Bale (16 years old at the time) played Jim Hawkinsand the movie was DIRECTED by Charlton Heston's son Fraser Clarke Heston (who was 35 years old in 1990).This was a strange error for the author to make but probably doesn't reflect on his expertise regarding actual historical pirates. Robert Louis Stevenson doesn't mention the age of his fictional hero Jim Hawkins in \\"Treasure Island\\" although there's been speculation that he was perhaps 14 or 15 years old.Although Christian Bale was older than the other young actors who had played Hawkins previously, he gave a believable portrayal of the boy."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"It's an excellent book about pirates and their history.

The book focuses on the pirates of the Caribbean, but does reference pirates in the South China Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the coast of Africa.This book is a good resource regarding pirate legends and reality. Cordingly discusses a number of the main pirates including Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and more. I found the facts interesting and the information on the legends and myths equally engaging.My only issue with the book was that it got a bit repetitive. The hanging of Captain Kidd is discussed in a couple of chapters, as one example. Cordingly does provide a great glossary regarding the old nautical terms.

For all those who want to know what was \\"real\\" and what \\"romance\\", here's your book.Mr. Cordingly has performed a deep research on the subject and presents it in a very readable and interesting form. He has taken diaries, contemporary newspaper articles, personal letters and memoirs as a solid backdrop.His study is centered mainly in the Caribbean theater, the East coast of North America and the Indian Ocean. He also gives glimpses of the Chinese pirates leaded by Ms. Cheng.Every main issue is described: weaponry, tactics, vessels, flags, everyday life, treasures, pets and battles.In its pages you'll find the life and deeds of famous characters as Henry Morgan, \\"Blackbeard\\", Captain Kidd, L'Ollonais, Calico Jack and many others not so well known.A whole chapter is dedicated to women pirates including the adventures and misadventures of Mary Read and Anne Bonny.Finally \\"romance\\" is addressed taking into account mainly movies on the subject.As a bonus the book includes six maps of the different scenarios of pirate's campaigns; a glossary of sea terms; an extensive bibliography and several appendixes on relevant matters.So brace yourselves and come aboard!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly's &quot;Under the Black Flag, The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates&quot; constitutes the best researhed book on pirate history I have ever read. The information provided about the lives of this notorious anti-heroes, the reality of the life among them and the world of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is amazingly accurate, and backed up with an extensive bibliography and footnotes. For those interested in pirate history throughout the ages, and specially the Golden Age of Piracy, this book constitutes a fundamental tool for understanding the pirate reality. When uncovering how the real people like Edward Teach and Calico Jack were, this book has no equal. Cordingly separates the myths from the real individuals behind them, proving that the reality is much more interesting than the romance, when uncovered. At the same time, the author discusses how the myths surrounding Blackbeard, the Women Pirates or Kidd's treasure, were formed and have survived through the years, becoming important elements of popular culture. Cordingly establishes why in our hearts, pirates were not sadistic villans, but rather &quot;...romantic outlaws living far from civilization on some distant sunny shore,&quot; something most of us would dream to be."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Probably one of the best overall books on the subject of piracy, myth and reality, that I have read. Cordingly covers the history, the movies, the books, the truths and the untruths. He covers the pirate havens, common practices, origins, the big names and little names. Not just a dry narrative, but a fun read.If you were to buy one book on the topic of piracy, this should be it (Angus Konstam's History of Pirates would be next in line). It is a must for any budding pirate historian. P-)"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I liked this one. It is more of an overview of the the history of piracy and of the period than the in depth study for which I hoped, but it is presented in no nonsense manner with many references to resources should you wish to go farther into any of the myriad of topics the David Cordingly inroduces.His writing style is in the more popular vein (for an historian) and he supplies many anecdotes and popular myths about pirates in general and some specific characters as well. In places he seems to draw heavily on &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most Notorious Pirates&quot; by Defoe or Johnson (which ever you prefer). For people not willing to wade through Defoe's (or Johnson's) style - it is a good synopsis of those chapters, even if the common conseptions of the time have been removed.He over states his point that Hollywood, Stevenson and others have romantisized the pirate life and proceeds to give the reader a quick dose of reality. However, I think for people approaching this book with the idea it is history, it is an overdose. There are too many regressions and comparisons to popular novels and movies. While the title implies such comparisons - they are rather obvious ones.My main critique of this book is similar to others I have seen here. It was to much and too little. If you want an introduction to the history of piracy and some of the better known pirates - then this book is perfect. If you want an in depth study of the lives or even of the marauding of specific pirates sprinkled with eye witness accounts and embroidered in the telling - read Johnson (or Defoe) instead.But the book holds many gems of information that may not be found in other histories and analysies. I just wish that some topics had been better developed. It is almost as if the book is a preparation for other books that will go further in depth on various aspects. I found the information gleaned from the archeological excavations of ships fascinating and wanted more. Perhaps there will be more forthcoming -especially now that they are working on Kidd's ship? I would recommend this book though as an introduction to those who wish to get a good tast of what life was like in that time."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I liked David Cordingly's \\"Under the Black Flag: the Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates.\\" The sea terms glossary was useful: I didn't know that \\"pink\\" and \\"snow\\" were types of sailing ships. I like my books to have a bibliography, a table of contents, a list of illustrations, and be indexed so that I can find citations rapidly-Cordingly also put in four appendixes, documents supporting his thesis.Pirates have been around since before recorded history. Pirates prey on society-they cannot exist without prey. Pirates are still active today-especially in the Far East. Cordingly mentions them (publication date is 1995)-my personal experience is that pirates are still a problem for security professionals.\\"Under the Black Flag\\" explores both fact and fiction. The romantic image is examined through books, plays, and movies. Captain Hook from \\"Peter Pan\\" and Long John Silver from \\"Treasure Island\\" are said to be the two most famous pirates.The historical pirates included the Chinese pirate queen Cheng Shih, Molly Read, Anne Bonny, Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and Sir Frances Drake-to name the most notorious and famous. Some, such as Drake, became national heroes and were made legitimate. Others, such as Captain Kidd, were railroaded. The Blackbeards earned every bit of notoriety.How did the pirates live-and die? My \\"day job\\" is working as a supply technician for the Nevada Army National Guard, and while on active duty I was an Army intelligence analyst-so details on how the pirate ships were kept in good repair and provisioned were right up my alley. Most pirate loot was hardware, food, sail cloth, and other such items that kept their ship afloat and their crews alive (if not healthy). As with pirates and terrorists and other criminals today, pirates survived because there was no concerted effort to eradicate them, because corrupt public officials and governments nurtured them, and because it wasn't really worthwhile for the large commercial corporations to pull the plug. \\"Under the Black Flag\\" does record instances where piracy suppression operations occurred, and Cordingly expresses surprise at how rapidly the pirate menace abated. No mystery to me-pirates live a precarious existence. Any number of things can go wrong. Pirates are never a match for a real navy-because navies do not have to subsist off of plunder. Cordingly records that in 1720 there were perhaps 2000 active pirates (a guess-pirates didn't submit to a credible and official census). Total pirate ships was low, with an average of 80 pirates per crew-so there were about two dozen pirate ships. The year 1720 was a peak of pirate activity. When the Royal Navy dispatched a dozen or so warships specifically for pirate suppression, issued amnesty to those who would give up piracy, closed pirate havens, organized merchant convoys, placed bounties on captured pirates, cracked down on corrupt government officials who supported piracy, and cleaned up the privateer system, the pirate menace all but vanished within a few short years.Pirates were cruel and savage-they were \\"macho men\\" in many ways. Life in the Royal Navy was rough-but I was surprised to learn that life as a merchant seaman was worse. I didn't know it could get worse! For example, \\"Under the Black Flag\\" reports that the white crews of slave ships suffered the same rate of fatalities as their black human cargo. Merchant crews have always been small due to the desire to maximize profits by having low overheard-a pirate crew may have been 80 men, the same size merchant ship would have had perhaps a dozen in the crew. Wooden sailing ships are labor-intensive. In port, as with today's over-the-road trucker, the ships would be loaded and unloaded by dock hands. At sea, the small crew would be doing everything. If something went wrong (pirate attack, bad weather, accidents), the small crew would be overwhelmed. John Harrison's chronometer and lunar distance tables were developed in the middle of the 18th Century (page 82 & 83): until then, seamen could never be sure where they were in the east-west direction (longitude)-errors of 600 miles or more were common for poor navigators. Latitude calculations were usually within 5 or 10 miles-the view from the crows nest of those tall ships would be able to spot land at that distance, so navigators would pick a line of latitude and sail along that line. Or, they'd follow the coast. These navigational shortcomings played into the hands of the pirates, who had only to wait along \`shipping routes' for fat merchant ships. Eventually, naval vessels began aggressively patrolling these routes, making life more difficult. Pirate ships had to be self-sufficient. Ports and shipyards were often closed to them. Pirate ships were basically modified merchant vessels-few pirate ships were purpose-built or started life as a warship. Ordinary merchant seaman life was so terrible that many turned pirate. Many were also drafted when their merchant ship fell victim to pirates-or so it was claimed at pirate trials. Deserters from the Royal Navy and escaped slaves became pirates. Due to lack of a national government and the need for leadership performance, pirate captains ruled at the whim of their crews.I liked this book. It was informative and entertaining."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"The biggest thing that made me nervous about this book beforehand was that the author, David Cordingly, was the former director of the National Maritime Museum, and those types can be long-winded. However, this book clocked in at only 224 pages (excluding the Appendices), so it didn't go long enough to drag.Obviously you're interested in the genre of pirates if you're looking at this book, and I personally think it is a gem. It covers all of the areas that you want to hear about: the drinking, the debauchery, the plundering and all of the other gruesome and glorious aspects of life at sea. However, instead of just perpetuating myths, this one actually goes about proving and disproving them.One of the highlights for me was reading all of the personal accounts of pirate attacks, trials and such, still in its original language. Cordingly actually quotes these people as they wrote it at the time, for example \\"We being attacked by ye pyrattes and therefore fell under duress\\" instead of the author translating that to \\"we were attacked by pirates and got scared\\", it really helped the feel of the book.If you're not a pirate scholar but are interested in the subject and would like to learn a few tidbits to impress your friends, I don't think you'd find a better means of doing so than \\"Under the Black Flag\\"."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"My favorite part of the book was the afterword, which quickly summarized the book's main theme - the difference between the reality of pirate life and the romantic mythology created by books, plays and movies. There are many other interesting topices covered. For example, the difference between buccaneers(outlaw freelancers) and privateers (government sanctioned pirates whose method was to attack and rob the merchant ships of rival countries).But I did find this book to be a rather dull read. Partially this was due to Cordingly's dry writing style. But perhaps more so because of poor organization and editing. Cordingly divides the book into chapters based on various aspects of piracy. But it is not chronological. This causes the many dates written about to muddle into a confused mess rather than provide a clear historical context. Also Cordingly tends to jump from story to story. This prevents the book from having any narrative flow and caused me to lose interest after awhile. By the end I found myself \\"speed reading\\" just to get through.Plenty of good information by a knowledgeable expert. But there must be a better written historical account of pirates to read."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"If any period of history needs some major debunking, it's the life of pirates and piracy. This book does the job and more. The romance and swashbuckling portrayed in the comic book fashion of movies and television gets the wind taken out of its sails by Cordingly. He sets the record straight with smooth, exciting, and descriptive writing. You are there among all the cruelty, horror, and greed as well as the splendor of sudden wealth, freedom and democracy of life aboard a pirate ship. Enchanted by some pages, I could feel the salt spray and the wind to my back, and imagine myself on board ship pulling into some exotic and strange new port. A few more pages on, and I could feel my teeth loosening from scurvy, and the sudden need to take a hot shower. Read this book in a comfortable easy chair, with your favorite hot or cold drink at hand and the room a perfect temperature for the season. And appreciate how lucky you really are!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is a well researched &amp; factual account of the lives &amp; times of pirates. The historical facts throughout, are nicely compared to the popular illusions we all draw when considering pirates in particular, or in general. A romantic life, this was not! Extremely few lived to enjoy the product of their nefarious activities on the high seas. In fact very few avoided coming to a sticky end on the gibbet, or on the deck of their ship. It's clear that the crime of piracy in the late 17th. early 18th. century, rarely paid. The book abounds with details of the principle characters that are both interesting &amp; surprising. Perhaps the difference between two of the most well remembered &amp; recognised pirates, Blackbeard &amp; Captain Kidd, is a good example of the contrasts that are so neatly drawn in this book. Whilst Teach (Blackbeard) went about his business in true pirate fashion; cruelly, ruthlessly, fighting to the death &amp; with no decency or honour. Captain Kidd, was proven guilty of only one murder (he killed one of his own crew in a fit of temper, by hitting him over the head with a heavy wooden bucket) &amp; maintained until his final moments that his conviction for piracy was just a pure misunderstanding. This book is lightweight enough for anyone to enjoy &amp; detailed enough for those wishing to study the subject in some depth."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"It is difficult to find intelligent, well written, historically accurate accounts on such broad (yet obscure) topics as piracy on the high seas. It is even more difficult to find ones whose style doesn't dull the compelling nature of the institution. Cordingly however, is able to put forth to his readers a refined historical account, that is long on both drama and accuracy. This book fills a gap, on the study of pirates, that existed between the overly scholarly and the overly sensational, giving both the history buff and the mildly curious a window into an otherwise difficult subject to research and report on. But unlike most historical works, there is no loss of romance, proof that history doesn't need the added flare of a coffee table publication if the humanity of the subject is stressed over the plain, dry facts. The lives of these sea-roving vagabonds are enough to lure the reader further into Cordingly's pages, but his style is enough to keep you loving it. ! I recommend this book wholeheartedly, especially to those who have never read any such account on the true history of piracy."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I really loved this book. It not only turned me on to the true lives of pirates, but it's given me renewed faith in the idea that history books don't have to be boring and pompous.Every chapter was great, and I am now a gazillion times smarter than I used to be on this topic. When I went to the National Geographic's Pirate exhibit on the artifacts from the ship &quot;Wydah&quot;, I was able to appreciate it much more.This book really changed my reading habits, and I am thankful I found it."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is a pretty thorough book on pirates and piracy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The risks of either being a pirate or serving as a sailor on a merchantman are discussed, as well as the types of ships that pirates normally sailed in. Accounts are also given of the most famous and most successful pirates. I've read many books on piracy, and this is one of the best. It's very well-written with some excellent illustrations. If you're interested in piracy in this time period, buy this book."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"History blends seamlessly with storytelling in this book by an expert on pirates. Separate fact from fiction with this interesting volume."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"If you're looking to learn more on what real pirates were (most likely you were inspired by the POTC films), then this book is a great place to start. Cordingly very clearly and precisely seperates the truth from the romanticized fiction we all grew to ponder. It's quite an adventerous book that can be as exciting as a fictional film. It is well researched, too. I would suggest that children not read this nor any history book on piracy, however, because real piracy has a very violent and graphic image. They are not these Johnny Depp heroes that we see on the screen, they are far from it. None the less, this is a great book to start your own research on a great age of maritime history."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I really loved this book! It was so detailed and gave exclusive accounts of pirates stealing from pirates and of how they had trials, and were executed, marooned, tortured, fought in battle, and anything you could think of. Cordingly explained things so easily and in great detail that he kept you reading and wanting to know more. It was non stop action and of course some romance, but most importantly Cordingly told the facts, and not made up stories."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Pirates! Everyone loves pirates, or the romanticizing image of them presented in fiction and films. Cordingly sets out to separate the facts from fiction in this book about the reality of pirates. He starts strong talking about fictional works from Dafoe, Stevenson, and Barrie then hashes on some film versions. The beginning of \\"Under a Black Flag\\" is promising but thereafter, it really begins to fall apart.What's great about this book is, for a casual beginner student of pirate history, there's a mountain of facts and data regarding a great variety of pirates, not just the top names. Keep in mind that's just what it is, straight facts based on his research, a bit like high school history textbooks - this happened on this date, this happened here,... Etc. It gets pretty dry but there's a lot of info. Cordingly covers everything from ships, weaponry, women, trials, punishments, assaults, and areas of the map that was infested with piracy. However, the undoing of this book is that there is SO MUCH data and unfortunately a complete absence of organization of that data. There's no real cataloging or separation of topics whether it be event, people, location, or time based. Cordingly jumps back and forth through the piracy age that you really have no idea of which sea rovers were alive when or if they overlapped other well known buccaneers/privateers without creating your own timeline.Like many other books covering this topic, you'd think Cordingly would have given the likes of Blackbeard, Kidd, Calico Jack, Henry Avery, Drake, and Morgan their own chapters in which the relevant facts are presented. He does so with a few of the above mentioned but he doesn't give the entire history of those ones within that chapter. Instead, it's spread out almost haphazardly and the author ends up continuously repeating himself. There also could have been a division of locales covering the Carribean, African coast/Indian Ocean, and China Sea piracy.It's a real shame because based on the information factor, this book would get 5 stars, but the repetitiveness, choppy sentences, and lack of organization hamper the book so much it drops it down to only 2 stars. I still recommend the book, but be prepared to take notes and make your own timeline as you are going through it. The Appendixes are good, the locale maps are splendid, seafaring terminology helps out, but where are the pictures of the great variety of pirate flags at? So much potential but organization is the downfall of this otherwise high information text."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Ee done a fine job on this ere book, Mr. Cordingly.Okay, I won't do the entire review in costume, but having just watched the incomparable Johnny Depp in Pirates Of The Caribbean, I'm definitely in a piratical frame of mind. Arrrrrr.This is a superb piece of research, and while it can be a little dry and academic in places, for those of us who have a pirate thing going on, David has done us proud with this powerhouse of information.As other shipmates have mentioned, he also includes Mary Read and Ann(e) Bonny, who were part of Calico Jack Rackham's crew - with Bonny being his common law wife.Any of you who have seen the Depp classic, will remember that when you see the Black Pearl's Jolly Roger flag unfurled, it is the unmistakable skull and crossed swords of Calico Jack. When I put my company Five Ships Ltd together (www.fiveships.com) some years ago, we adopted Rackham's flag as our company logo. Arrrrrrrr.... Rex Quondam Rexque Futurus - King That Was, King That Will Be.One of the few omissions from David's book is the fact that the pirate skull and crossed bones/swords is actually the Ancient Egyptian sign of Osiris Risen, with all of its rebirth/resurrection imagery. For the very same reasons, it was the battle flag of the Knights Templar, and when the Templar fleet escaped from La Rochelle as the Pope and the French King moved against the Templars in 1307, they flew the skull and bones as an act of defiance.Still, this is a superb book, if a trifle conventional, and an absolutely essential purchase for those of us who love the smell of burning merchantmen in the morning... Smells like victory..."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is a book I want to keep in my library so I can return to find those fantastic characters of the glorious age of sail. Reading Under the Black Flag is like opening Davey Jones locker, the characters leap out at you, pirates, brigands, cutthroats and prostitutes but also heroes like pirate hunters who chase them down. Names like Captain Morgan, Francis Drake, Blackbeard are famous and popular among movie goers for their daring do. But the author takes history on his side to show the true nature of pirates and the bravery of such pirate hunters like Lieutenant Maynard whose crewman killed Blackbeard, Captain Ogle who outsmarted Roberts and Captain Barnet who captured Calico Jack and his female conspirators Read and Bonny. To hear of this base rabble hung on the gallows put a smile on my face as the Sea was once again safe to sail in freedom. I would love to see a movie which glorified the deeds set forth by these heroes who swept the Seas clear of pirates."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"When I first bought this book via amazon, I was not sure weither or not the book would be any good. Out of all the books about pirates, I decided to buy this one not only because of the reviews and the title, but also because the cover art is pleasing to look at. (not very wise I know).When I received the book, I started reading through the first chapter and was not too impressed. However, when I got to the second chapter, it was so exciting and thrilling that I could not put it down!I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the truth about pirates. Very very exciting!!!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly sets the record straight on who the real pirates were, i.e. nothing like the Pirates of the Caribbean Disney franchise. I learned they were despised, dangerous, and very often drunk. Details from every day pirate life, as well as historical adaptations are embellished in narrative style. The introduction was particularly good, giving small examples of actual pirate life and explaining how the pirates became romanticized through poems and novels, with much of our current conception coming from Stevenson's Treasure Island. I would've liked more info on Blackbeard, as well as more description of pirates in the Mediterranean and Pacific. However, despite some details lacking, this book was a great overview of several hundred years of piracy in the Atlantic and Caribbean waters of the Americas."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"An immensely readable, short but excellent introduction to pirates, addressing both the myths and realities which surround them. The writing is mainly gauged toward dispelling myths about 17th and 18th century pirates, but gives a good overall review. Great for anyone even just casually interested, with a helpful glossary of sailing terms in the back."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Having read quite a few books about pirates and piracy over the years, I have to say this one is a real page turner. Once I started, I had a really hard time putting this one down. Needless to say, I blazed right through it. Easily one of the most interesting and captivating books I've ever read. This book even introduced pirates I had never heard of before! I highly recommend it to anyone who craves action, adventure, and excitement."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"The book is very informative, but it reads a bit like a textbook in a few areas. The text wanders and can be hard to understand, but is full of precise historical examples of what it discusses. Definitely worth reading, but not something that you will read in one sitting unless you are more determined than I am."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Under the Black Flag is a must read for real pirate fanatics! This book clears up the outrageous myths and gets to the real lifestyles of the pirates we have heard about since we were kids."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"An interesting, highly entertaining, and very readable history of pirates and privateers that separates fact from fiction. It provides fascinating and generally unknown information about the most notorious pirates in history, including famous names such as Drake, Blackbeard, and Kidd. It shows how piracy evolved in the Caribbean and the circumstances allowing pirates to operate virtually unopposed to become one of the most powerful, successful, and feared forces on the high seas at their peak, and how the authorities eventually brought the golden age of piracy to an end by the early 18th century. The author also explains why the public's perception of pirates changed over time from that of \\"ruthless criminals\\" and \\"scourges of mankind\\" during the pirate era to that of romantic, swashbuckling figures often portrayed in the media today."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book is a great read for anyone interested in pirates. The book does an outstanding job of comparing the reality of pirate life against Hollywood movies."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book was a good read for me. It did what it claimed by differentiating fact from fiction. It provided good insight in to the true life and demise of piracy."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"The history of pirates is something I knew about in only the most cursory and superficial way possible - basically through movies and other entertainment. So nearly every single page of this book provided something I never knew before. Some of it is speculative, but that seems to be the nature of the beast. Overall I found it absolutely fascinating and fun to read. Better still, I found that fact is sometimes even more entertaining than fiction."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Not only is Cordingly's book a great read, it is cited as a major source in virtually everything seriously written about pirates since it was published. This is probably the most valuable history since Defoe penned \\"A General History of the Pyrates\\" in 1724 (using the pen name Captain Johnson)."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"For centuries, people have been drawn to stories of adventure on the high seas and peg-legged pirates in search of buried treasure. In his comprehensive pirate book (focused mainly on 18th century piracy in the Americas and the Caribbean), Cordingly covers everything from women pirates to pirate ships and weapons. Not for the faint of heart, this text exposes some of the hard truths behind piracy: consequences for captives, punishmens for arrested pirates, the hardships of life at sea.This book's revelations may surprise you; Cordingly frequently analyzes the books, movies, and plays that helped shape our romantic ideas of piracy. These portions are probably the most interesting sections of the book because at some point in every chapter the reader is nearly drown in a tsunami of facts and dates, making it periodically read more like a text book. While some may be rivited by endless discussion of ship types and repetitive trial transcripts, I appreciated the research, but found it to become rather repetitive.Still, I learned a lot while reading this book and would recommend it to the avid pirate fan. However, if you are looking for an exciting tale of piracy and are not overly hung up on getting every detail historically accurate, you may be better off picking up a copy of \\"Treasure Island\\" or \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" instead - you will find that sometimes the romance is even more entertaining than the reality."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book really surprised me. There are many fascinating facts about pirates that I never would have imagined. First the physical appearance of pirates that we have learned from the movies and TV is not altogether inaccurate. Pirates actually did dress very simalar to the pirates of cinema. They indeed often kept parrots as they made good pets on ships and could be used to bribe officials. Yes many of them had wooden legs too. It seems that when a limb became damaged and required amputation there were usually no doctors available, however there were carpenters. Every ship had a carpenter to care for the ship and they usually were responsible for removing infected limbs and sometimes creating prosthetics.Not all pirates cruised around in massive warships either (although some like blackbeard did). Very often they used small sloops since they were fast and easy to maintain compared to huge lumbering ships. Something else I had not expected was how infrequently pirates engaged other ships in battle. Usually when a merchant ship encountered a pirate ship they would immediately surrender. There are several surprising reasons for this. One is that merchant ships usually had a crew of around 10 or so. During battle it would take 4 to 6 men to operate one cannon as well as a couple of men to man the ship. A pirate ship on the other hand may have a hundred or so men. They could easily operate numerous weapons and all the pirates were armed to the teeth with guns and cutlasses. Most merchant ships simply didnt have even a remote chance of defeating a pirate ship. Very often if a merchant ship did try to fend off the pirates or escape the pirates, the pirates would be enraged. When they finally caught the merchants they would make examples of them and subject them to all sorts of cruelties. As their reputation for this behavior spread, merchants became even less inclined to engage pirates in battle.The pirates also seemed to try to frighten them by using fierce looking flags. Not all pirates used the skull and crossbones. An image of a bloody skeleton holding an hourglass also instilled fear into merchants. It was a not so sublte way of saying, you have a short time to surrender or die. Perhaps one of the greatest weapons was fear.There are too many other interesting pirate facts to mention. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Errol Flynn, Pirates of the Caribbean and Treasure Island and numerous other cultural sources have given us a popular and romantic version of the life of a pirate. But what were they really like? Did pirates really make people walk the plank? What about hidden treasures and X marking the spot?Under the Black Flag takes an in-depth look at the great age of piracy, focusing mostly on the Caribbean, Eastern United States, the African coastline and Madagascar (Mediteranean corsairs are only briefly touched upon). Major (or rather infamous) pirates such as Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Bonnet, Roberts and minor ones of note are discussed in-depth as examples as to how piracy really was using source material contrasted with the common stereotypes. The book is extremely fascinating and honest, and a book anyone should read who is fascinated by pirates."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Most people think of pirates as romantic anti-heroes. I sure do, having been fascinated by pirates since I was a little girl. In the nonfiction book UNDER THE BLACK FLAG, author David Cordingly debunks the pirate myth to tell us what real 17th and 18th century pirates were like: uneducated, drunken seamen who were very young and very violent.Writing in a clear, easy-to-read style, Cordingly explores pirate life (mostly within the Caribbean), from historical raids to shipwrecks, pirate loot, and executions. There's even a chapter about female pirates.I found this entire book fascinating, and read it as quickly as I would read a fiction novel. Moreover, I often stopped to read aloud certain passages to family members, just because the passages were so interesting and full of historical significance. For instance, I had no idea that pirates sacked Panama or that an earthquake completely destroyed Port Royal in Jamaica, a big-time pirate hang-out. The most popular passages, however, were the descriptions of exceptionally nasty (yet curiously inventive) means of torture carried out by sadistic pirate captains on their poor victims. You have to read it to believe it!Anyway, UNDER THE BLACK FLAG is quite an eye-opening experience. It's history and adventure and fascinating biographies all rolled into one. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"For anyone that's interested in the lifestyles of pirates, this is your book. This book is both a good read and informative. Almost everything you want to know is compiled here. I'm currently writing a novel about pirates, and this book is a wonderful reference.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly did a splendid job of painting a true picture of a pirate's life. David covers the full spectrum from myths and legends, to detailed accounts of the daily lives of these swashbucklers.

Great book for any beginner as well as an avid reader of pirate history."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"18 clams at Barnes and Noble, 3 smackers here. Enough said. Of course, that is not enough said. An okay book that tries to be both academic and interesting; it passes marginally. The problem is that the book is not well organized, at least not from a reader's perspective. Also, it has a few dull periods, which is surprising for the material. The stuff on Mrs. Cheng is also a snooze-fest. For less than $10 (incl S&H) it will not disappoint, but do not expect too much from the book."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"It is amazing that someone with as little interest in pirates (or, at least, in what interests other people about pirates) as Cordingly has could ever become such an expert on them. Instead of the skull and cross-bones, this book should just have one of the plain blue covers that are on the booklets that students use for written exams. It's not that I would prefer an inaccurate account of piracy. The facts about pirate life are actually just as romantic and exciting as the fiction. The problem is in the way Cordingly presents them. He should open the book with, &quot;I can even make PIRATES boring! Watch this:&quot; If only Cordingly had found someone with a pulse to collaborate in the writing of this book. Someone like me or anyone else who finds pirates interesting enough to have purchased UNDER THE BLACK FLAG. The side of a cereal box is written with more energy than this book."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I've read many a book on the history of piracy and really I have to say that this is the worst. Granted it's meant to give the reader a glance at the world of pirates, but when one asks for a glance, one really wants more than a split second to see what's going on. Cordingly, with his reputation of being one of the foremost experts on the field, gives off this aura of knowledge. With only one year of studying previous to my reading of this book, I knew almost every detail set on the pages...and much much more. Really, I was hoping that having the benefit of years of discoveries would enhance his fact basin far beyond that of, say, A. Hyatt Verrill's, who wrote an excellent account in 1923.Cordingly's book is not merely short in page count (not immdiately a bad thing), but shorter still because he uses a lot of filler in his pages. The end result being that he doesn't even mention vital information about even the most famous ventures of the most famous pirates. Seeing that, what do you think he did for the lesser named folk? Barely a word for many....not a word for most. Francis L'Ollanois, one of the most infamous buccaneers to ever sail, has about two pages dedicated to him..well, that speak briefly on him. The word dedicated can never be used in reference to this book. It's just a compilation of Cordingly's passing thoughts on the vague subject of pirates. In it, you will find useless information like what movies had been made on the topic, the stars of these movies, and the love that many people hold for the image of the pirate. I cannot think of anything more throw-out-the-window than \\"Men and women who were attacked by pirates found it a terrifying and deeply shocking experience.\\" Yes, wouldn't you be scared if your ship was boarded by a horde of criminals who's only law is the law of their captain? Do you really need to be told that? It's not something I'd trade for the details of Morgan's raid on Panama. Who am I to judge, though? If you'd rather hear that it's scary being raided by pirates than what the pirates actually did, I recommend this book. Otherwise, \\"The Real Story of the Pirate\\" by A. Hyatt Verrill is readily available."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is a really great book and one of my all-time favorites--unless you're looking for artwork. If it's illustrations you want, try Pirates: Predators of the Sea. If you read this and love it and want another great read, try If a Pirate I Must Be by Richard Saunders. It's terrific, though also no illustrations."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Under the Black Flag is a history of Pirates during the era when they entered the popular imagination. For Europe and America this is from 1650 or so until government action essentially eliminated them in the mid 18th Century. Additionally, the book outlines activities of some of the more successful Asian pirates; not often see in a \\"Western\\" work. While historians normally pursue \\"truth\\", the sometimes unpleasant reality is that History is basically perception. The enduring image of pirates in the public: Long John Silver/\\"Aargh matey\\" etc, etc, is also a part of their history, and the author takes this seriously in his work. The notables are here Edward \\"Blackbeard\\" Teach, Captain Morgan, Captain Kidd, Annie Bonney, and Mary Read. But there are also some lesser known (and much more successful paradoxically) characters including some excellent coverage of piratical operations in and around China. The book is not just a collection of bios, but has chapters concerning the social and economic realities of going \\"a pyrating\\". Unlike some earlier works on piracy that have a revisionist axe to grind, this author confronts \\"issues\\" straight on without fanfare: Homosexuality? In an era where \\"sodomy\\" was a death sentence there is no evidence of greater homosexual activity than in the population at large. Prototypical feminist pirates? There were some female sailors and pirates sure, but their careers were frankly not overly successful-no better or worse than many others. Captain Kidd's buried treasure? Well pirates were after ANYTHING they could get, molasses, timber, slaves, supplies. X marks the spot is pure legend generated by legions of authors and films. For anyone interested in this subject, \\"Under the Black Flag\\" is a great resource. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Tis a most excellent resource for tales of buccaneers and adventures.

It's filled with some interesting facts about some of the most famous pirates, as well as some of the lesser known buccaneers. The book is divided into different chapters that tell a different story about the life of pirates. For example, one chapter is dedicated to female pirates while another chapter is dedicated to pirate hangings and executions.Some of the chapters of this book are written very well, and move along smoothly. I think that others feel disjointed, like the one on pirate films and pirate ships. The chapter starts talking about ships, but then it goes into a discussion of what pirate films have been made. I thought that was one of the major flaws of the book.I would have liked more information about life on pirate ships, such as pirate superstitions and pirate songs that they would sing during voyages.

At least that is until you were caught by the authorities, such as they were. The adventurous life as depicted by fiction was almost the way it was - a little more sanitized and glorified, with pure motives ascribed to them. They were in fact the first democracy with leaders elected and deposed by popular vote on board each ship. They were also hard livers - drinking and carousing to great excess with rape and fighting sports to be savoured on the long voyages between continents and conquests!

There are pictures of old posters and court orders, and great little journal entries and descriptions from primary sources. It is very funny at times and does not hold back on the gore and guts and sex. It is an easy read, with modern English. It explains things from the past you might not otherwise understand.

Mr Cordingly captures the wild nature of pirates, fact and sea-foam splashed fiction like few others have. I found this book, and I have read many of pirates, to be one of the very best and most entertaining to boot. I wish the book had been twice as long as I found it compelling and hard to put down.

In Under the Black Flag (1996), David Cordingly looks at the reality of the golden age of piracy.Cordingly covers most everything there is to know about pirates. Famous pirate captains, life among the pirates, tactics, treasure, ships, trials and executions, and the reasons for the end of the golden age of Caribbean piracy are all included. The focus is undeniably on the Caribbean, but he does touch upon the pirates of Barbary Coast and the China Sea.Under the Black Flag has some very interesting research. Some of my favorite parts included the estimated pirate populations at various times, the typical pirate haul, the efforts to stop piracy, and the extensive detail about pirate trials. All of this comes together to give the reader a realistic portrayal of piracy grounded in facts and numbers, entertainingly told. Cordingly also spends some time addressing just how the reality of piracy was transformed into the romance known today, including specific pieces of fiction, such as Treasure Island, The Pirates of Penzance, and other stories less well known today. Under the Black Flag predates the pirate resurgence lead by the Disney Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise, so that is not covered.My main reservation about Under the Black Flag is that there's no overarching narrative. Each chapter focuses on a particular part of the history of piracy and covers it well, but there's no single thread that really ties it together. Part of that is the subject matter, since the book is covering such a broad range of information, instead of being a biography or a war history or something with a more obvious story. This may be a minor point to some, but for me it's something that really brings a history to life, so I bring it up for those with a similar preference. That said, I still enjoyed the book and recommend it.If you're looking for real history about pirates and are curious about how the modern myths started, Cordingly's Under the Black Flag is an excellent book, and I recommend it to any with an interest in piracy or the Age of Sail."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Well researched and very readable. Full of great stories and larger than life personalities, as well as common drudgery that was the life of a pirate. More pirate information than you can shake a stick at."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is the perfect book for an introduction to the real history of pirates. Cordingly understands that the reader approaches this book with only pop culture's impression of piracy and he acknowledges those and compares them to the reality. Did pirates really make people walk the plank? Sort of. Were there women pirates? Yes. Read this and its influence on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies is clear."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Great book!Wonderfully written and well explained. This book puts to rest all the fiction and tales told of pirates. Easy to read, and chapters vary from Henry Morgan, to women pirates and shipwrecks.Hopefully the author decides to write a pirate book on all the famous pirates like Blackbeard, Drake and more on Morgan.The author should have made better use of maps in the book but the chapters are smooth reads.I recommend to anybody who wants to know more about these mysterious mariners known as pirates"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"&quot;Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates&quot; is mis-titled; it should be &quot;Romance versus Reality&quot;. David Cordingly's book doesn't stray from its mission for one page. It goes into the modern versions (i.e. movies, novels) of the pirate mythologies, looking for the actual or inspiring accounts in the past and then dispells at every turn the romantic notions that made these characters Characters. It's the same as seeing how the magician performs the illusion, you lose the magic. Of course, I could simply be jaded by the fact that Mr. Cordingly is described by his own book to be the most knowledgable person about pirates on the planet. C'mon, Dave, even Mel Gibson doesn't walk around wearing a tee-shirt that says &quot;I look better than you&quot;."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly's all-inclusive history of piracy covers the phenomenon from the earliest days of sail until today, and gives us an overview not only of the famous pirates of the Caribbean but of corsairs in the Mediterranean and the vast fleets of pirates in the South China Sea.By default, Cordingly does spend most of his time along the western shores of the Atlantic, and he is indefatigable in tracking and tracing the histories of some of the best-known pirates such as Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. He also spends time reviewing the great pirate books and films (the more recent Johnny Depp vehicles post-date this book).Cordingly, a curator of paintings at the British National Maritime Museum, has studied this subject exhaustively and is excellent in his reportage of details.However, UNDER THE BLACK FLAG lacks color. The reader is invited to observe piracy at a distance through a spyglass but never finds himself on the heaving deck of a pirate schooner under sail with a whiff of grapeshot in his nostrils. The tang of the salt-sea air is missing. This is a competent, very well written but fairly straightforward treatise. Still, as any sailor will tell you, the romance and spirit of the sea is the true siren, and Cordingly's book, though well done, never captures that spirit."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Under the Black Flag by David Cordingly is a \\"must have\\" book for any pirate enthusiast. While it is meant to clear up the misconceptions of what pirates and their lives were like, it does not read like the scholarly work that it is. It strikes the perfect balance between being informative and entertaining.I could not more strongly recommend this book, what a great read!

After completing the book it's easy to recognize the cues used in the Disney movies. Port Royal was an actual place. I recommend this book if you are at all curious about piratical history. I didn't know piratical was an actual word until reading this book."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"As a child pirates fascinated me, but as a college student studying history I found that serious forays into the historical truth of piracy were few and far between. My boyhood fascination and adult inquisitive nature both found outlets in Under The Black Flag. The book is written with the general population in mind but has enough for historians to gain further insights into the lives of pirates.The book deals primarily with the pirates found in the Caribbean and North America, but gives brief accounts of pirate activity in the rest of the world as well. It profiles such figures as Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Anne Bonney, Black Bart, and Calico Jack among others. The book even has a section on famous fictional pirates, reminding us of literary classics such as Long John Silver and Captain Hook.If you have ever wanted to learn more about Pirates, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Whenever historical figures such as pirates are so common in popular culture, I often wonder how accurate the representation is. This book engagingly answers these questions. Not surprisingly, there is some truth to the modern image of a pirate. For example, they often dressed with scarfs, lots of guns, and even kept parrots as pets. On the other hand, they were largely brutal criminals, not jovial, romantic figures usually portrayed in stories.With such a fragmentary history, the big challenge is to present a coherent picture of pirate history. Cordingly doesn't always pull this off. I found the book disorganized in places, and some of the chapters have fairly loose threads holding the material together. A lot of the excursions into analyzing popular culture are not particularly insightful, and interfere with the strength of the book, telling the story of pirates.Overall, a fun and interesting read on a criminal class that is well recognized, if not well known."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book is a great one! Covers many areas of Pirates, from accounts of several women pirates (and thought there were only two!) to dispelling common myths about the lot. Interesting read and fabulous reference. Turned my mild interest in pirates into an obsession and lucrative pasttime. (I am writing a biographical screenplay currently.) Includes references to other great books on the topic. Great for those just looking for a fun read, or for those interested in learning more and expanding their knowledge. A must for anyone who likes this genre!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book is so jammed with information that I had to reread some sections to keep all the names straight. The author does not have a very entertaining style, but his depth of knowledge makes up for any shortcomings. If you are serious pirate fan, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"What a fantastic way to learn about Pirates! The writer is able to give the reader a clear picture of life on a ship during the 17th and 18th century. I'm still looking for a book on this subject that's as good!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"UNDER THE BLACK FLAG is the perfect read for anyone who, as a kid, dressed up as a one-eyed pirate and went around waving a cardboard cutlass saying, &quot;Aaargh, speak up bilge rat; where be the treasure?&quot; Or anyone who enters company staff meetings with, &quot;Ahoy tharr, scurvy dogs, shark meat ya'll be.&quot; Or, &quot;Are ya feeling lucky, punk?&quot; (Well, perhaps that last is from a more recent era.)Since he's writing for Western audiences, Author David Cordingly focuses on the pirates, buccaneers, and corsairs of European background, who infested the waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans and the Caribbean during the 17th and 18th centuries. The book's twelve chapters reveal everything you've ever wanted to know about swashbuckling pirates and piracy: the ships, pirate flags, buried treasure, recruitment, plunderings, pirate violence, famous captains (e.g. Kidd, Blackbeard, Morgan, Rackam, Vane, Roberts), women pirates, pirates' women, pirate life on land and sea, marooning, walking the plank, pirate islands and haunts, pirates in the media (books, stage plays, films), pirate trials and executions, wooden legs and, yes, parrots.Upon finishing UNDER THE BLACK FLAG, I tried to think of a reason not to award five stars, and couldn't. The volume is extensively researched, well organized, written with the popular audience in mind, eminently instructive, and not without humor. Sixteen pages of photographs complement the text. If you're interested in the topic, I can't recommend it too highly. Aaargh!By the way, what does &quot;shiver me timbers&quot; mean, anyway?"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I bought this book because it was reported that it was Mike Leach's favorite book on pirates. Coach Leach runs the Texas Tech Red Raider football program, and was featured in an article in a New York magazine last year.I found this book not only to be informative, but fun to read. I wish my old college books we were required to read were as interesting.Cordingly does a good job blending history with storytelling.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly is an expert on maritime history, having been on the staff of the Museum of Maritime History in England. Prior to reading this book, I had been unaware that pirate ships were democratic! Yep, pirates voted for their captains and where to sail, what ships to plunder, and what ports to drop anchor at. Nope, pirates were not at all like the movie and TV pirates we have all been exposed to. In fact, most Pirates of the Caribbean didn't torture, maim, and kill; they were pretty nice guys and GALS except that they robbed ships! Bartholomew Roberts, for instance, captured the most ships and he drank nothing more toxic than tea. And the infamous \\"Black Bart\\" was religious, allowing his men to hold services and pray aboard his ships. Often the pirates' prey didn't care about being plundered because the owners of the ships had insured their cargos. If you're interested in finding out more facts about pirates read any of the books David Cordingly has written and edited. There are many more out there for adults and children. A children's novel about piracy that I recommend is K.J. McWilliams' The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Historians (of which I'm one) are forever telling each other that they need to write more books that will appeal to general audiences. The trouble is, a lot more of us talk about it than actually sit down and *do* it. David Cordingly did do it, and the result is a model of what history written for non-specialists should be.This is far and away the best introduction to the history of piracy ever produced. Cordingly writes clearly and smoothly, and covers an astonishing amount of historical ground very economically. The book hits the highlights of major historical disagreements about pirates without ever getting bogged down in them, and tells its tales of death and mayhem without losing sight of the fact that the victims are usually innocent people in the wrong place at the wrong time.This book is well worth the time of anyone interested in the history of ships and seafaring. Patrick O'Brian fans, here's something to pass the time until Aubrey and Maturin get underway again!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"For me, this book never quite jelled.The author does provide interesting tidbits regarding the history of pirating and pirates during the period of roughly 1600 to the mid-1700's. All of the popularly known pirates, privateers and buccaneers (they are not one and the same) are mentioned: Kidd, Blackbeard, English, Drake, etc. Life on a typical pirate ship is explored as well as some of the more famous pirate attacks, their treatment of captives and the efforts to suppress their activities. The author does go outside the bounds of pure history by discussing how pirates have been depicted in literature and film.However, the presentation is somewhat disjointed and the author digresses often during this book. The editing could also have been sharper; a few times the author reintroduces topics or persons previously covered as if they are being mentioned for the first time.As a consequence, it does not read like a story or even a particularly well organized study. It is rather more a survey that does inform but leaves the reader feeling that the gripping tale of piracy remains to be told in a more well written manner."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Throughout history, pirates have been the scourge of the seas. Attacking helpless ships laden with cargo while flying the infamous skull & crossbones flag is imbedded in our consciusness as cowboys with their distinctive hats riding freely on the prairie. \\"Under the Black Flag: The Romance & the Reality of Life among the Pirates\\" bridges the gap between myth & reality by describing the lives & experiences of these most despiseful but fascinating of men. David Cordingly, author of several works on maritime history, narrates in clear & simple prose the workings of a subculture which terrorized nations in a short period of time & passed on into legend. Many of the important subjects related to piracy are touched on: why some men ( & a few women ) turned to piracy; their times & the social conditions they lived in; how pirate ships looked & functioned; how pirates fought; what they wore; where they rested & refitted; how they acquired & spent their loot; how they treated victims; how they were punished by the authorities; how society saw them; how they created a system of democracy in a time of marked class divisions; & how their time ended; etc.Tales of the famous & infamous abound in this book. The daring & succesful Henry Morgan, who sacked prominent Spanish cities in the Caribbean & became the most successful buccaneer of all time. The theatrical & monstrous Blackbeard, who lighted incendiary objects hung from below his hat to give him a fiendish look in battle. The diabolic L'Ollonais, who cut the heart out of live victims & ate it in front of horrified prisoners & crewmen. The famous Captain Kidd, with the legends of hidden treasure & a highly publicised trial which uncovered the backdoor politics of the time. Calico Jack & his consorts Anne Bonny & Mary Read provide perhaps the strangest & most distinctive tale in these bloodstained annals. Pirates from the Orient are briefly touched on, like the unique Mrs. Cheng, who commanded thousands of pirates & dominated the China seas for a short period during the early 19th-Century. The author quotes from famous works like Exquemelin's \\"The Buccaneer's of America\\", Daniel Defoe's \\"A General History of Pyrates\\", & the logbooks of sea captains, official records, & eyewitness accounts.One gets the feeling of superficiality in the book, a sense that the work could have been more comprehensive. Further details could have added more depth to the chapters.Informative & well-written, \\"Under the Black Flag\\" is a commendable history on a livelihood of crime that thrived & peaked centuries ago. Read & understand what made these people tick & whose legacy lives on to our time."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"The author does a wonderful job at taking a sweeping glance at the pirates and privateers of the Americas--especially of the Caribbean. The premise of the book seems to be trying to show how the fanciful and romantic view of pirates isn't based in reality. He does seem to try to fit in how this romantic view could &quot;possibly&quot; be true in a very few characters, but it doesn't hold up to pirates in general--they were some terrible and cruel people. Taking in what I said about the premise I can't imagine anyone really believing in the romantic view of the pirates. The only romance in pirates is what we wish for in our hearts--the freedom of mundane routines, traveling the world, exotic locales, etc. The author touches upon this excuse for the romantic image, but not in depth.I have to agree with other reviewers and say that the author does do a lot of repetition. He seems to jump around covering the same individuals and sordid facts. I can understand that this work isn't supposed to be as entertaining as a good ol' high seas adventure novel and I don't romanticize these brutal characters, but they had to be more dynamic than the dry account he paints. Pirates seem much more than just a two dimensional character--they were much more complex. Aside from a very brief mention of the vast numbers of pirates in the South China seas (50,000 in and around 1809!) he makes pirates out to be a limited thing.This book is more of a scholarly work geared for a mass audience. The author has done his homework and presents facts and sources generously throughout. This book is a general overview, and introduction to pirates. This book isn't geared for entertainment, rather for a good solid background of the known facts of the subject. The author does shine through in some accounts as with the killing of Blackbeard, but I felt myself skipping lines and such to just get through it.It is worth a read if you are interested in a general overview of pirates, but if you're looking to quench a thirst for adventure and other such romantic views this book isn't for you. I am giving this book 4 stars because of its vast scope and great documentation."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book gives an overview of the lives of the pirates of the 1700's (mostly). It covers the careers and untimely demises of the most famous (Capt. Kidd, Blackbeard, Calico Jack, and Black Bart Roberts), talks about a number of less famous pirates, and covers some of the semilegal (depending on your nationality) exploits of the privateers (like Capt. Morgan). The book deliberately limits itself to those pirates associated with the Atlantic Ocean/Caribbean Sea, although many of these pirates also operated in the Indian or Pacific Ocean, so there is a wide variety of locales to compliment the wide variety of people.The descriptions of the pirate life and details of their exploits are well written, using a number of primary sources (logbooks, journals, newpaper articles). They give a good feel for the &quot;reality&quot; of life among the pirates. But what of the &quot;romance&quot;? It's here as well, comparing the real pirates of history with our modern romantic view of pirates, based on Erol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks, Captain Hook and Long John Silver, and the Pirates of Penzance.It is an entertaining and informative book, especially for someone (like myself) whose previous exposure to piracy has been through Stephen Spielberg's movies and Sid Meier's computer games. I suspect the serious naval historian may find the text someone cursory, but still useful because of the wealth of references. Anyone interested in a general overview on pirates (and privateers) in this era should find this book an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Despite it's flaws, Cordingly's &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; is worth a read. It is not really intended as a &quot;history&quot; of piracy (as some seem it think), rather it explores the reality behind the popular conception our society has of pirates and piracy itself, the innaccuriacies that have crept into their pop image.Even from the later days of piracy, authors such as Robert Louis Stevenson have presented a slightly romanticized image of pirates. Authors that followed him added until the truth of piracy was partially obscured. Cordingly achieves his goal of decifering the romanticism and it's orgins quite well through the course of the book, explaining the structure of the pirate world, how they operated, what sort of men and prizes they went after, and where many of the misconceptions of Pirates may have come from. The book is filled with many interesting anecdotes and stories about specific pirates and the authors who wrote about them.The main problem I had with this book was simply the fact that it was dry. While it had some sections that were fascinating and kept my attention easily, other parts were boring. It was clearly intended as more of light read, yet at times I felt like I was plowing through a more scholarly piece of work. I had to force myself to get through them at times. What results is an inconsistant read.That said, I would still recomend this book to people interested in pirates. While there are other books that have more on specific pirates and specific events, this book is a fairly decent overview, and its analysis on the development of the pop culture image of pirates is invaluable."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I'm thrilled that Amazon.com has this book; when &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; originally came out, I had to trek to bookstore after bookstore, enduring snide and ill-informed clerks in my search for it. (I'd heard the author interviewed on National Public Radio, and he mentioned the publication date.) I prefer the original cover, with the painting on the cover, but that's a minor point ...&quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; is an excellent read for those interested in pirates and does a great job of both telling the truth about the romantic images we have, and exposing little-known facts that make that era more interesting and at times, almost noble ... well, noble for men who were, realistically, a pretty savage bunch at times.The book is probably a bit too dense for readers not of high school reading level, but for older readers, it's a quick read, a bit stiffly told at times, but too soon over.A good book for the pirate, boating or history buff."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is a very thorough view of the very short history of pirates which spanned the late 1600's through the mid 1700's. It introduces many pirates famous at the time but mostly lost in the pages of history. The author does give you the history of the really famous ones like Kidd and Blackbeard but he also throws in some fictional ones like Captain Hook and Long John Silver. He uses these fictional pirates to show how they, along with Hollywood films, have colored our view of the real pirates .The book covers just about every aspect of pirate life from ships, to treasure, to raids, and ultimately to their undoing. While the book is easily read and interesting, it also is essentially a research book. Clearly David Cordingly has done his research so the book is an excellent reference for anyone who truly wants to understand how these pirates functioned and managed to elude the authorities. Nevertheless some parts of this book leave you wanting more because the author raises the issue but then seems to gloss over it or just give you an over view. For example he covers Storms, Shipwrecks, and Life at Sea but never seems to provide any depth, the same is true for Torture,Violence, and Marooning. In spite of these small criticisms I thought this was an interesting book and recommend it to anyone who would like to have some insight into the real Age of Pirates."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"We generally have a very romantic view of pirates due in large part to the books and films that have proved so popular. Much of what we think we know comes from Long John Silver and Captain Hook (and more recently Jack Sparrow), even though such figures are fictional. But David Cordingly gives an excellent history that examines the popular image, the myths, and the realities of the very real marauders who sowed terror on the seas.The focus is mainly on the pirates associated with the Western world and the Caribbean from about 1650 to 1725, but he offers a good deal of information on others as well. He defines the often poorly understood terms: pirate, buccaneer, corsair, privateer, as well as covering the different ships used and the treasure they sought. He discusses what pirate life was like, where they came from, what attacks were like, and what role women played. He dispels some popular myths as having little basis in the historical record, such as \\"walking the plank\\" and that most pirates were gay, while confirming others like wooden legs, parrots and monkeys, and the way they dressed (art by N. C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle he says are notably good representations). Cordingly even briefly discusses pirates in film and literature. Other than a few short profiles, he does not offer extensive biographies.The history surrounding pirates has been a blank spot in my reading and I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It is not a dry chronological recitation of names and dates, but instead presents the information under various topics, giving an excellent overall understanding. I was a little concerned that it would dispel all the popular images and ruin any enjoyment in the fiction, but instead found it gave me a greater appreciation for the literature. Nonetheless, he points out that piracy was (and still is) violent and bloody: \\"The real world of the pirates was often closer to some of today's horror movies than anything which appeared in contemporary books or plays\\" (pg 128). At a relatively short 244 pages I almost wished it were longer."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Alas, Hollywood does not provide an accurate portrayal of pirates and piracy. The swashbuckling romance portrayed in movies must be heavily discounted, or perhaps even be set aside completely. Reality seems to be far more mundane.In this book, David Cordingly provides a fairly dry, documented history of piracy. He defines the descriptive terms used: corsairs, buccaneers, pirates and privateers and explains the differences between them. Mr Cordingly dismisses any notion that pirates could be considered as ocean-based examples of the mythical Robin Hood.I gleaned a number of interesting facts from this book. Firstly, as the height of Caribbean piracy was in the 17th century, the fully bewigged frock-coated pirate captain portrayed in some fiction (think of Captain Hook) is not as far-fetched as it may seem. The drawing of the fine line between pirates and privateers often depended on the politics of nations. Privateers, acting on behalf of monarchs, could quickly find themselves outside the law if countries at war (such as England and Spain) made peace. I also enjoyed reading about the different ships used and the ship configurations adopted by pirates to arm their ships effectively, and to increase speed and manoeuvrability.The portrayal of pirates in literature is fascinating: the adventurous life and times of Long John Silver and Captain Hook have captivated many a reader, as have the various stories of castaways.There is a world of difference between the practice of piracy and its portrayal in fiction. Piracy is part of maritime history and is still practised today. Pirates are criminals who are often violent and seek to obtain goods which do not belong to them: there is nothing remotely romantic in this.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Pirates from the heyday of piracy, from the 16th to the early 18th century, were driven to it by many forces. Some were poor saps taken prisoner by pirates and forced to join. Some fled the brutality of the English navy or its merchant fleet. Some had been free woodcutters or herdsman in the Caribbean or Central America, only to be driven away by the Spanish or British.And of course, some were just mean, sadistic bastards driven by a lust for treasure and plunder.Drawing from many documentary sources, including memoirs, trial transcript, histories from the period, and fictions with the ring of truth, Cordingly draws together a workmanlike picture of the pirates we know more from dramatic representations than from actual fact. Their tactics, hideouts, habits and organizational structures - yes, they had them, and they were often quite democratic - are all here. An enjoyable beach read."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book was very informative about how pirates actually lived. It starts out with great stories but drags toward the middle and end with statistical information. The statistical information is good because it gives you an idea of just how prevalent piracy was, it just isn't as engaing a read as the stories in the early chapters. The book also talks at length about pirates in the movies and theater. This can become annoying if you are just interested in the facts. However, it gives great insight into the differeces between the romanticism and reality of pirates. The truth is pirate lives were hard. In general they tended not to live past thirty and died horrible deaths(drowning, shot, or hanging). Their typical career lasted around 3 years, hardly something to envy. Overall, a good read."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"\\"Under the Black Flag\\" is a real pirate's treasure.

I rate it at five stars because, well...everyone loves pirates!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Being a conossieur of all things piratical, I picked up this book to feed my obsession. Boy am I glad I did! Mr. Cordingly has created a book that is accessible to the casual pirate fan, and contains enough information to satisfy the scholorly reader. Even though I am nore interested in pre-17th century piracy, the information conatined here on the \\"Golden Age\\" is absorbing and informative. For those looking into research, the bibliography is wonderful as well!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Pirates are so much a part of our myth, legend and Hollywood, we often overlook there were real Pirates, flesh and blood men and women that took the high seas. The life of roaming the 7 seas tended to leave little written record by the Pirates themselves, thus our whole 'idea' of who and what a pirate was has been formed by exaggeration, plays and movies.David Cordingly started from that point and worked to see how much the myth compares to reality. Former head of exhibitions at England's National Maritime Museum, he had access to a writer's delight - records, court documents, eyewitness accounts, national archives - and mined those sources to give a new look at old views. He attempts to explode staunchly held myths and tries to give a new reality to replace them. These new 'truths' are as fascinating and complex as the Yo Ho Ho images of Blackbeard, Captain Kid and Henry Morgan. He also addresses lesser knowns pirates of the heyday of the Skull and Cross bones, and the cross-dressers Mary Read and Anne Bonny, the first womens libers that demanded equal pay for equal work!I high recommend this to writers wishing to write of pirates or just anyone with a thirst to know MORE..."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"First of all you should all know that I am a pirate. I have a gold tooth and I love loot. This is an amazing look at the history of my people. It does an excellent job of explaining anything you want to know about the subject (do you know the difference between a buccaneer and a corsair?). It is consistently entertaining throughout. I hope you will pick up this book even if you are only slightly interested in the subject because my pirate culture is often misunderstood and David Cordingly shows the reality behind many popular misconceptions and effectively bridges the gap between your working stiff life and my slackerly, rip-roaring, booty lovin', torso stabbin' vagrant lifestyle.

A fair amount of documentary and eyewitness evidence survives, so Cordingly is able to tell a largely complete story about these (mostly) men, their way of life, their habits and speech, and their private wars on commerce. He interlaces this social history throughout with the details and personalities which have made a romantic world of this place and time, like Captain Bartholomew Roberts's last fight off the Guinea coast, and Blackbeard's wearing of lit firecrackers in his facial hair. Cordingly even tosses in some history about the world of fictional pirates, in song, book, and film. It's surprising to realize how few pirates there were, and for how short a period they operated. Compared to the constant piracy of Malaysia and South China, this was a small, ragged, and short-lived occupation, yet there are few fictional archetypes more firmly ensconced in the English language. Oh well. Arr."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Well written, easy read on Pirates detailing how they lived, how they formed and details of the different types depending on where they originated such as Corsairs, Buccaneers and of course Pirates. The book gives a global perspective of Pirates along the China Sea, the Barbary Coast and detailed attention on the Caribbean. The author includes a nice glossary for basic nautical terms for the landlubber but it also contains pirate terms or terminology for the period. Cordingly uses reference works from early and accurate pirate histories along with discussion on classical writers such as Daniel Defoe. Until reading this book I had not realized that Robinson Crusoe was based on a real individual marooned on a desert isle for five years. Aside from discussing the more famous Pirates such as Captain Kidd (who had the worst of luck or limited competence), Henry Morgan and Black Beard, the book references a number of lesser known along with those that commit some fantastic feats such as Mrs. Cheng who along with her husband commanded a pirate fleet in the West Indies. And of course, many countries notably England used privateers such as Drake and Hawkins to directly attack their enemies' ships by providing them a percentage of the take in a undeclared war. Fascinating account of how the Pirates recruited or forced men to join there ranks, along with a few infamous female pirates, and used their large numbers, sleek ships, and numerous cannon to attack or intimidate their prey. The authors discuss their hideouts, their careening of ships to clean them for speed and he challenges the Treasure Island theory of pirates burying their treasure or making individuals walk the blank. From this book it is apparent that pirates had a short, indulgent and violent life. The author brings you up to date on literature on pirates that although some contain many accuracies from actual testimonies, he points out the liberties they take with the truth such as buried treasure. In addition, he also reviews the movies that often depict pirates on large galleons not because it was true but because the size provided a Hollywood stage. As the author notes, when countries such as England set their mind and resources to it, they could fairly eradicate the pirate population. The results were often a hanging and the horrid suspension of the body upright and hanging in the harbor. A great read to learn about pirates or a wonderful vacation book to read about the romantic and wild men who were sometimes cruelly violent often ending with an appropriate violent demise of their own."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"&quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; fits neatly into a large gap in &quot;pirate literature&quot; between the books intended for the younger readers and those that are filled with facts, scholarly disertations, and are, in general, dry as dust. David Cordingly makes his book informative, entertaining and best of all...easily readable. He attempts to explain the romance we attach to these men (and women) and does that as well as anyone I have read, using as examples those two famous fictional pirates, Long John Silver and Captain Hook and them comparing them to the reality of what pirates were really like. The myths of buried treasure are dealt with and by listing some actual &quot;pirate plunder&quot; (in one case consisting of a load of cod and some rope)demonstates that, in most cases, there was little to BE buried. Yes there were large treaures taken but for the most part very very rare,and the list of pirates executed at the end of the book shows graphically what their usual fate was....Altogether one of the best, if not the best, introduction to those times available."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I had hoped to find an interesting and thorough book on the history of piracy that is accessible to a layperson with limited knowledge of nautical history, but that doesn't simply repeat inaccurate cliches and stereotypes. I somehow doubt that this one would have even caught my attention had it not been so heavily promoted at various bookstores to cash in on the third \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" movie. I'm disappointed that a book about such a lively subject is so surprisingly lifeless. Cordingly essentially presents a bunch of facts (names, dates, places and figures) without providing much detail or historical context. I realize that much information about pirates is sketchy at best, but simply providing me with the names of a pirate captain and his ship and the dates and places on which island an incident occurred does not make for interesting reading. Cordingly also seems to wander from subject to subject and often repeats himself. This makes me wonder if this book was actually a collection of essays or articles about piracy compiled into one volume. His main points seem to be that pirates are glamorized in fiction but in reality were cruel, sociopathic former Navy or merchant sailors who organized themselves into a democratic society. I appreciate his research and the points that he does make, but overall I found this to be a slow read and not terribly informative or entertaining."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This book is so amazing that our household owns 2 copies.

It lacks a scholarly polish and is more for a novice reader,getting their feet wet on the subject.Mr. David Cordingly has an excellent coffee-table book out there called ,'Pirates-Terror on the High Seas'.This one is much bigger,more colorful for the same length of pages,250 pages each,and even cheaper.I would use this paperback ,'Under the Black Flag',as an addendum reference book.But,it's not weighty enough on the pirate topic to be of much academic helpful insight.Many new readers on the pirate subject gave high marks to this book,curiously enough,for amazon.dot.com. I would advise one to surf around for the Dover classics .It has the best readings about the Golden Age of Sea Piracy ."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is not another fluff book on pirates. (arrgh) The author took his time and researched his facts and organized them for easy access in this text. It is clear that pirates are a lifelong passion for David as his knowledge is extensive and so eloquently dispensed. My copy of this historical text is never far from my reach. As fact filled as it is, it is delightfully readable. I was glad to see this did not end up as dry as a textbook, given the quality of information contained herein. Any novelist looking to write on pirates would be wise to use this as source material first."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"My verdict: over-researched and under-written. It's a cascade of interesting facts, but time and time again the author seems to come to the brink of a good story only to turn away and wander off somewhere else. I wouldn't really mind the overwrought way the book's organized, except that the author doesn't quite pull it off--doesn't demonstrate the necessity for doing it the way he does, to my mind. Instead of telling the whole story of one event at once and then moving on to another, some of the facts about an event crop up in one chapter, other aspects of the same story appear later, then another aspect of it shows up even later than that. The effect is that the writing keeps circling around like a sea-bird with no place to land. There's no real suspense or sense of discovery or narrative power to the recountings of events, and it robs the writing of vividness; few of the places and people really came alive in my mind. The effect on me was that the writing seemed overly academic--or perhaps I should say offhand and dry rather than academic--and it made the book read slowly for me, even though I'm normally a stone sucker for tales of the sea and am well used to reading nonfiction.Even the death of Blackbeard, which is inherently dramatic, is rendered nearly flavorless, but for the dying pirate's dashing last line. And the chapter on Captain Kidd, incredibly, peters out suddenly right before it ends. The author turns to a thorough digression, as if he had completely lost interest in the story just as it was reaching its climax. Later, you learn that the author has reserved the subject of executions for the book's last chapter, and Kidd's is duly covered, finally, but by then I was getting rather grumpy about it. Although this example is the worst one, constant narrative interruptions like it fragment the book.On the other hand, the research is very good, and I learned a great deal. I'm not sorry I read this. I just think I would have liked it a lot better if the writing were more integrated and better paced."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is definitely an Ambitious book, it has been subtitled the romantic and the reality of life among the pirates, the author, David Cordingly has been noted on the back is being the world's 'foremost expert on pirates. He has written several books in the past, and worked in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwhich. Certainly I don't deny he has mined hugely rich resources to write about Pirates and piracy and it is well footnoted - or mostly. But I found myself cringing at some of his conclusions. This put me off some of the better information in here.Cordingly certainly knows his stuff, he talks authoratatively of Drake and Cortez in the same breath as Daniel Defoe and Captain Kidd. His range of knowledge and ability to link in some seemingly unconnected themes - how they survived, punishments, what they ate, how they flourished.However, his conclusion that the gilbert and sullivan play Pirates of Penzance was responsible for generations of people growing up looking on pirates in a romantic way rather than the harsh reality seems an over-reaching conclusion.The book is a good overview, it includes chapters on plundering treausre ports, wooden legs and parrots, Sir Henry Morgan, women pirates, into action, storms, shipwrecks and life at sea. Then there is quite harsh stuff like torture and violence - marooning, cpatin kids, trials, executions and more.After reading this, I am on a bit of a pirate bent, I have Pirate Hunter, the true story of Captain Kidd lined up next. This was a very light and readable book, easy to get into, full of detail and clearly drew of a range of sources. However I had some doubts about some of the information provided (as noted) which is why the rating is a 4 stars. I would not mind reading more of Cordingly's books and will be keeping an eye out for them."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly has presented a popular subject with appropriate sobriety. The book reads like fiction, perhaps mostly due to the colorful nature of pirates themselves, and is fast paced and filled with detail. I learned more than I ever thought existed about piracy and was pleased to have many misconceptions cleared. While it is well researched, it is not perfect - several vaguely referenced assumptions are made that will be clear enough to an attentive reader. This annoyed me enough to knock a star off an otherwise stellar book.I have read several of the source materials that Mr. Cordingly cites and find that he has a skill for taking research and making it cohesive and digestible. One reviewer has commented on repetitive content, but I found that the repetiton was useful for making a point and did not distract me from the text.Overall, a wonderful survey of the pirates, well written and probably the best history of these scalawags to date."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"David Cordingly has written an interesting book on piracy that consists of well researched stories of how pirates really acted, and then compares those stories to the mainstream culture view of piracy. The anecdotes are entertaining, and are well written, so that the book flows along nicely. For people who are looking for a history book, the style of Cordingly's writing is a bit informal and some of his information on pirates doesn't get very in depth (although his extensive list of sources shows that he could be in depth, and gives the reader a chance to research more for his/herself if he/she so desires), but for someone who is looking for information about pirates and a good read, this book is excellent. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is truly the one source for pirate information. Written by the worlds leading authority on the subject this leaves no myth standing and no stone unturned. It is a long book that takes you through a complete history of pirates and what they were really like. Like ships? Its in here. Like plundering? Its in here. Want to know what happened to them? Why some are corsairs and others are buccaneers? Its in here. Even if your interest in pirates is a moderate one, drop the money for this book. You won't put it down, matey."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"This is a work of nonfiction, though at times you cannot tell the difference. COncise, to the point, and supplying important historical data, David Cordingly didn't disappoint.What did is a personal issue with his writing ability - and thus it begins. All of the things are presented. But they are presented like this. There are very short sentences. All facts are shorted as such. Read it, you'll see. It starts to be maddeningly noticeable. I liked this book. Because of the info it offered. It gets a 4. I hated. The writing. Though.4/5 - Bad technique aside, this is one hell of a good account of pirates in the 1500- 1900s."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"A great history of pirates and the culture surrounding them. It holds your interest with just enough subtle humor to keep you involved but not enough to be cheesy. If you love the Pirates movies and want to know the truth you need this book!

If you're looking for a great overview of piracy during the 15-17th centuries (approx.), you'll love this!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Ahoy, reader, the pirates you know today from movies and stories are not too far from the originals, but are wonderful and romanticized caricatures of the buccaneers and corsairs of the 18th century. This we learn from the excellent book Under the Black Flag by David Cordingly, in which the author tells the stories of the lives of real pirates of old. Cordingly goes into great color and detail about the reality of pirates and their history.In the first chapter, entitled Wooden Legs and Parrots, Cordingly describes the actual appearance of buccaneers and corsairs. From the stories of Robert Louis Stevenson we first accepted the image of pirates personified by Long John Silver and Captain Hook. Pirates were linked with, pirate maps, black schooners, tropical islands, and one legged seaman with parrots on their shoulders. Cordingly identifies peg legs, parrots, filth, and harsh captains wearing dashing clothes.Who were these lavishly-dressed, smelly, unkempt, vagabonds of the sea? David Cordingly catergorizes pirates in two ways. Buccaneers were pirates from the Carribean and Corsairs were pirates from the Mediteranean.He also goes into depth about specific people such as, Bartholomew Roberts, Sir Francis Drake, John Hawkins, Henry Morgan, and Captain Kidd.In to battle and back to the sea, this is the life of a pirate; David Cordingly elaborated well on this fact in his book Under the Blak Flag. By reading his book you can tell he is an experienced writer and a more-than-credible authority on pirates. He uses sources and quotes very well in this book, and organizes the main points rather well. His writing style is easy to read and you find yourself being caught up in his stories of pirate history and legend. I found that on some points he strayed a little of subject and drew my attention away from the emediate points. Nonetheless I enjoyed his descriptions of the pirates' appearance, their background, and their history. I would suggest reading David Cordingly's Under the Black Flag for all those who idolize, ador, and dream about pirates."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Much mythologized but little understood, pirates have for centuries been a dangerous fact of life for those living and traveling on the high seas. In &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot;, David Cordingly has written a superb examination of the legends and realities of Pirates and Piracy. He concentrates primarily on pirates of the Western world during The Golden Age of Piracy, which lasted roughly from 1650 to 1725, although there are some notable exceptions made for Chinese and Barbary pirates. Cordingly has included privateers, buccaneers, corsairs , as well as regular old pirates in his study, as they are inherently related. The word &quot;pirate&quot; implies a crime, whereas privateers were licensed by their king to plunder and seize any ship belonging to a &quot;hostile&quot; nation. They were, in effect, legally sanctioned pirates. Buccaneers were pirates who operated in the Caribbean and South America during the 17th century and were descended from French hunters of the region. Corsairs, although addressed only briefly in the book, were pirates of the Mediterranean, most famously the Barbary Coast, who were authorized by their rulers to attack ships from Christian nations.&quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; starts out by examining the mythology of pirates in Western literature and how the perceptions of fictional pirates compared with reality. Then the author moves on to explore the history of real pirates, starting with the quest for Aztec and Inca gold in Central America in the 16th century and moving on to the privateers of the 17th century -most famously Sir Henry Morgan- who plundered Spanish port cities in the Caribbean. There is a chapter on women amongst pirates, featuring the infamous Mary Read and Anne Bonny, who were tried and convicted of piracy in the Caribbean, as well as stories of prominent female pirates in Scandinavia and in China, home to the woman who is sometimes called the greatest pirate of all time, Mrs. Cheng. Cordingly describes the conditions of life at sea for pirates and the significance of the notorious pirate flag. And he analyzes the use of violence, torture and marooning by pirates on their victims. He separates fact from fiction in examining the legends of Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, and buried treasure. And then Cordingly tells us how and why The Golden Age of Piracy came to an abrupt end in the early 18th century, including the legendary battle in which the infamous Blackbeard was defeated.Typical of David Cordingly's writing style, &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; starts out in one place -in this case with pirates in popular culture, fans outward to explore the subject in depth, which eventually leads us back to where we started. This approach is extremely effective in emphasizing relationships between all of the topics that are being addressed and in securing the reader's interest for the course of the book. &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; is an excellent overview of The Golden Age of Piracy, but it isn't exhaustive on all subjects. As always, Mr. Cordingly includes a list of recommended further reading in his acknowledgments, for those who would like to study Piracy in more depth. &quot;Under the Black Flag&quot; is a fascinating, insightful account of the peculiar subculture of piracy and the role it played for centuries in the seafaring life. It's an enjoyable and informative book for the general reader as well as for the maritime enthusiast."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"For a history book club that I am in, we read &quot;Under the Black Flag.&quot; I was looking forward to it because I knew very little about the pirates, except from what I'd seen on TV and in the movies.For correcting my misconceptions, I give the book a 5 star rating. Mr. Cordingly obviously knows his material and also knows the myths that have formed about pirates. He easily renders those myths obsolete with this book while informing the reader about many other events and persons unknown to them.The only problem I have with the book is that it is written in a very disjointed style. The chapters, instead of being chronological or event/person based, cover each of the characterisics and/or myths of the pirates. Therefore, the reader comes across the same story/person/event multiple times. It also, unfortunately, creates a reading environment that is difficult to get deeply involved in, causing the reader to miss some important information.Very informative, but could have been organized better."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Have to agree with Stern's comments about the sloppy nature and confused mission of this book, although my gripe is more with regard to the fundamental flow of this book. This thing runs you back and forth and all over the place, visiting and revisiting subjects and characters to the point where the Cordingly's attention deficit disorder becomes incredibly annoying. Once again, I agree with Stern's review: the book is well worth reading, but only as a compilation of miscellaneous facts about famous names and events. A fun thing to do if you're going to the beach for the weekend, or if you plan to attend your wife's high school reunion and you fear you'll have nothing to talk about."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I agree with the previous pans of this book. Ridiculously repetitive, poorly organized, largely dependent on secondary sources, Under the Black Flag has little to recommend it. Cordingly takes an inherently interesting subject- the reality of the Caribbean pirates- and finds a way to make it boring. Furthermore, the ponderous writing style and endless digressions on the image of the pirate in literature, the stage or screen soon overshadow the few good stories the book contains. There have to be better books out there on pirates."},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Cordingly has written a good introduction to the world of piracy.

And read this book! These are two of the myths about pirates the author dispells.The truth alarming enough! Readers will learn that England encouraged its sailorsto plunder French and Spanish ships and to that end granted pirates letters of marque to legitimize their actions (eventually the government got out of the business of granting letters of marque).The book also reveals that many pirates were indeed barbaric and took no quarter. As England began cracking down on pirates punishment was swift. Many were hanged at Execution Dock along the Thames River.An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"I've never been overly interested in pirates but I heard Cordingly interviewed and was impressed by his grasp of the topic. I figured if I was ever going to read a book on pirates, this likely would be the one to read.I was right! Cordingly has done an incredibly thorough job of reviewing the vast literature on pirates. His book is exhaustive and compelling .... characters such as Captain Kidd and Blackbeard come to life and the reader comes away with a real sense of the myths and realities - often chilling - of where pirates fit in history. If you only ever read one thing about pirates, this is the book!"},{"Title":"Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates","review":"Cordingly has done his homework on the subject of the pirates.

The author seperates fact from fiction that helps paint a clearer picture of those who sailed under the black flag. He dispells a variety of myths that surround some of the most famous pirates including Blackbeard and Captain Kidd. Cordingly takes you back to a vanished age when pirates ruled the seas.

I was disappointed, because I had a keen interest in pirates and was expecting a much more engrossing book. I was relieved when I finally reached the last page."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"A definitive biography of history's greatest creative genius is of course an illusion. Nevertheless, two American writers have in recent years written large scholarly works which strive to achieve that distinction: Robert Gutman and Maynard Solomon. Gutman's book is greatly to be preferred.Solomon's book should be read by any serious Mozartian for his interesting new material on and interpretations of issues such as the Mozart family finances and the complex varieties of late 18th century Freemasonry. But his biography is vitiated by his Freudianism and his relentless demonising of Leopold Mozart. In Gutman's book, by contrast, Leopold emerges as a much more interesting and complex character than Solomon's monster. Some of the best parts of the book are the extracts from Leopold's letters during his trips with the boy prodigy. Leopold was an intelligent, humane, tolerant and well-educated man, with shrewd powers of cultural and social observation. (His description of Naples in the 1760's is priceless.) But Gutman's Leopold is no saint either. Gutman convincingly portrays him as a man who was often socially out of his depth and whose maladroit plotting on his son's behalf did Wolfgang more harm than good. He also accuses Leopold of ultimately cheating his grown son out his boyhood earnings - a charge I felt Gutman did not quite prove.In the early chapters of the book I also found it a bit tiresome how often Gutman felt he had register his disapproval of absolute monarchs. Personally, he prefers democracy. Thank you Mr Gutman, we get the point. For some Americans, it seems, it's always 1776.Gutman's musical judgements do not quite accord with my own. I thought he was far too dismissive of the compositional skill of the young Mozart. But I must admit he did cast the famous Allegri Miserere and Padre Martini stories in very different light. Gutman also tended to damn with faint praise Mozart's great opera seria, La Clemenza di Tito. On the plus side, he showed an all-too-rare understanding of the aesthetic and religious seriousness of Mozart's church music.As someone who has been reading Mozart biographies for over thirty years, I was constantly amazed at some new fact or anecdote Gutman had unearthed. Finally, his description of the young genius's death was almost unbearably moving.If you only buy one Mozart biography (and I suppose there are such people) this should be the one."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"A few tips before buying this book: Read another, shorter biography of Mozart first. And be familiar with Mozart's operas before opening this book, especially Cosi Fan Tutte K.588, The Magic Flute K.620, Don Giovanni K.527, The Abduction from the Seraglio K.384, The Marriage of Figaro K.492 and Idomeneo K.366. And know your musical lingo: should you not know the definitions of terms such as &quot;appoggiatura&quot; or &quot;arpeggio&quot;, you are also going to need convenient access to the works of Daniel Webster.This book is far from an introductory selection. This is more like a textbook. It is very thorough, very dry and, even at well over 700 pages, it reads longer than its page count. Gutman's incessant footnoting (average of about two footnotes per page, each footnote averaging probably three or four sentences in length) make a long book much longer.I came into this book thinking I had a decent a decent vocabulary, but the author left me with the impression I am a slack-jawed buffoon. Gutman has an interesting habit of never using a word when a longer one will suffice. As a quick example: not once were the words &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;pleasant&quot; used. Everything was &quot;felicitous&quot;. To the point of the felicities being felicitous in their felicitousness. Thus, this book is an excellent investment in that it contains much more than its asking price in fifty-cent words. Gutman obviously has a firm grasp of his dictionary, but someone really needs to buy him a thesaurus.However, despite the shortcomings of the actual prose, this book has everything you will ever need to know about Mozart. A precise and detailed analysis of where he was, what he was doing, what was possible for him to do, how he went about it, his genius, his vulgarity and everything in between. Starting with Leopold Mozart and Anna Maria Pertl and finishing with Constanze Mozart and her management of Wolfgang's library, this book covers everything that happened to and around the composer in exhaustive detail. As well as a biography of the man, it explains the what, why and how of everything that happened in late 18th century Europe, providing the backdrop that, much like a Renaissance portrait, provides excellent information explaining the character in the foreground. Gutman doesn't introduce the reader to the places and times of Mozart went, he immerses the reader in them by leaving no important, and often no minor, detail out of his descriptions.This is not a book for reading on a beach in order to learn more about &quot;some famous composer&quot;. This is a scholarly tome for people who want to know and try to understand arguably the greatest musical mind to ever live. Does this book let us understand the nature of genius itself? No. But it lets us be a contemporary and familiar with a genius. And, if you are willing to put in the time necessary to dive into a life as deeply lived as Mozart's, you will be well rewarded by this selection."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"This twelve-year effort by Mr. Robert W. Gutman to create a cultural biography around the core that was Mozart, should meet the needs of those educated in music, or those like myself who are fascinated with this genius of History. This work is massive by any measure and even the Author suggested certain passages could be passed over by less sophisticated students of Mozart's work, and music in general.I read this work over a lengthy period of time as the material is very dense, and the book is more like a collection than a single volume. This is a Biography of Mozart, and also biographies of those who were Family, his peers, and The Monarchs who ruled during his short life. It is a work of History as well. For Mozart the person, throughout the book is always placed within the context of the events surrounding him. Politics would influence where he could play, as would religion, all forms of civil disobedience, and war. In this sense the work has as an element Political Science as well. The Author includes detailed economic facts from the smallest of costs that were included for a concert tour, to the largesse that was or was not handed to Mozart by a variety of Royal Courts. These latter two issues were obsessions with his Father. Mozart Sr. not only micro-managed the lives of his children, but also was constantly vying for the good graces of the wealthy, The Nobility, as well as The Royalty, and dealing with all manner of court intrigue in hopes of his personal advancement.For any who became interested in Mozart after seeing, \\"Amadeus\\", this book, as others do, portrays the composer as at times a colorful individual, but not the debauched character that was seen in the film. His writings at times are colorful in the extreme; his ego and his expressions of his self-importance do not always commend him. However his genius cannot be denied, and while not as raucous as the movie version, Mozart would never be accused of being a bore at gatherings.I am glad that I read this book, and it will certainly serve as a reference source. I would not recommend this as the first book to read on Mozart unless Music is your field of study. To truly appreciate what the Author has created, and to gain all the knowledge the book contains, an individual must have much more than a passing interest in Mozart. Mr. Gutman has created a scholarly work that would seem to set a standard that will be hard to surpass."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"&quot;Mozart: A Cultural Biography&quot; is a wonderfullywritten account of the life of perhaps the greatest composer who everlived. It is rich and detailed, and obviously very well researched. Bytracing all the major influences on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - among them his father Leopold and sister Nannerl; his wife Constanze; Count Hieronymous Colloredo, the Archbishop of Salzburg (his infamous bete noir,) and Austrian Emperor Joseph II - author Robert Gutman presents Mozart in a far different light than the loud, immature and vulgar individual depicted in earlier biographies, and in the film &quot;Amadeus.&quot; Gutman's graceful and eloquent pen instead presents Mozart as always confident in his own limitless abilities. Although late to maturity due to his father's domineering ways, he was completely competent to manage his own affairs once he achieved independence from the court of the Archbishop of Salzburg. (Contrary to the popular belief he died a pauper, Mozart actually had achieved a limited measure of financial security at the time of his death.) Imbued with a strong sense of high morality and a wonderfully self-deprecating sense of humor, he could be at times cheerful, witty, optimistic, and wise beyond his years; at other times, petulant, immature, tactless and crude.As good a biography as this is, &quot;Mozart: A Cultural Biography&quot; is also outstanding history. Adhering to the belief of fellow biographer William Manchester that &quot;there can be no enlightening life which does not include an account of the man's times,&quot; Gutman skillfully interweaves a short course on European political and social history with the events of Mozart's life. Several chapters near the beginning of the book explore the ongoing political and cultural ferment during Mozart's formative years, and how these environmental factors influenced Mozart's musical style. Gutman's commentary on the many musical forms in which Mozart excelled - especially opera - were especially helpful to me in more fully understanding Mozart's life, times and great genius.&quot;Mozart: A Cultural Biography&quot; is written with grace, clarity and obviously great scholarship. Its one drawback is that the author seems to assume in readers a reasonably good knowledge of 18th century European history, and of classical music. Despite this minor shortcoming, &quot;Mozart: A Cultural Biography, &quot; is certainly the best of the three biographies of Mozart I've read. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"Though I'm not much of a Mozart buff, and his music generally does little for me, it's impossible to deny his genius or to escape its fascination. So, after again having watched the entertaining nonsense of the movie Amadeus a while ago, I felt compelled to find out a bit more about the REAL story (I knew the gist of it only from Peter Gay's tiny book). What luck then, to find this beautifully produced, comprehensive tome lying around in the remainders corner of a book store. It was worth every cent of the modest price I paid for it. This is biography as it should be. It covers all details of Mozart's personal life, his family, and the troubled relation with his father; it covers many details of his works besides. It also shows his constant wavering on the brink between the dictates of protocol on the one hand and his sense of superiority through creative genius on the other. This delicate balance defined his dealings with Colloredo in Salzburg, with Joseph II in Vienna, and with the hosts of princes, dukes and bishops who governed the mind-boggling patchwork of states that constituted the Holy Roman Empire at that time. In dealing with these issues, Gutman never loses himself in speculation and is eminently sober. Where information is spread thin because of a lack of correspondence or interrupted work on a diary, he just tells us so and moves on. If you are looking for scurrilous anecdotes of the Amadeus kind, you will look in vain here. Mozart, no matter how convinced of his own qualities, would never have dreamt to bow low with his back turned to the ruler of Salzburg, showing him his behind. You will only find his insolence tucked away in a few defiant sentences in a letter, thickly covered by all the servile formulae that were expected of a courtier who ranked no higher than a footman. Neither will you find sycophantic ravings about Mozart's precocious talent. Though the works he produced at a young age were certainly exceptional, their flaws stand out clearly, and many of them also betray the hand of Leopold, as Gutman patiently points out. In fact, I noticed, the flow of great masterpieces only starts once your two-thirds through the book; before that lie the years of the child prodigy dragged all over Europe by his ambitious father, and those of the young composer struggling to find his voice and an audience. By the way, the description of Mozart's work strongly focuses on the opera's, and the sometimes over-extensive (psycho)analysis of the libretti struck me as the only weak aspect of this book. On the whole, however, this book is far more about the man and his world than about the music.You will also look in vain for uncanny overtones in the visit of the masked messenger who ordered the Requiem, and neither is there the tragic end of the neglected genius dumped in a pauper's grave. Mozart had a standard third class funeral, Gutman tells us, as did most Viennese citizens, and the proceedings surrounding it were quite in keeping with those customary at the time. Nor was the composer a death-ridden derelict in his final year; on the contrary, he was in high spirits, and on the brink of the artistic recognition and ensuing financial success that allowed his widow to spend the many years she survived him in the greatest comfort.So is this a boring book then? By no means! Gutman replaces the sensational but stale caricature with a flesh-and-blood human being, and a very likeable one at that, who almost jumps off the pages. His treatment of Mozart's psychology is highly refined and subtle. He was no divine spirit incarnate, he was a man like you and me, this book tells you.But it tells you lots more. It delves deeply into the complicated politics of 18th century Europe, with all its competing rulers, many of them afflicted with strange personalities. Culture and customs are described in similar detail. The ample footnotes contain thumbnail-biographies, delightful anecdotes and musical details alike and almost form a book in themselves. The 800 pages are densely packed with information, not making for a relaxed bed-time read; this book demands your time and concentration, and deserves both! You will reap rich rewards from your investment."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"This is a superb biography: dense, profound, vast, and multi-faceted. As its subtitle promises, it provides a fascinating cultural framework to the most complete (and myth-shattering) portrait of Mozart's character I've read so far. Without the use of a single cheap device, it put me so close to the events that I felt I was in the houses and theaters witnessing them. The poisoning plot is relegated to where it belongs: a dismissive footnote.I agree with another reviewer about the revelations concerning Leopold. Far from the one-dimensional Mother of All Stage Fathers he's been so often depicted as, at some moments he comes off as admirable, an authentic figure of the Enlightenment. His eventual self-destruction - the pettiness and jealousy that poisoned his relations with Wolfgang and the role he played in estranging Nannerl from her brother - is nothing short of tragic.For my one quibble I'll paraphrase Emperor Joseph's apocrypha: Too few notes, Mr. Gutman. The book has not a single musical quotation, which the author explains in the preface by citing the abundance of scores and recordings available. This made for somewhat choppy reading (along with the too many footnotes, Mr. Gutman). Still, the inducement to go beyond the text led to a few discoveries, both by the Apollo incarnate himself and by some of his contemporaries - all of which added immensely to the enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"The story is superb and told in minute detail. However, I don't like books in which the writer often seems to be more intent on displaying his own scholarship and range of vocabulary than on informing the reader. Unfortunately, this is the case with this book - it reads like a thesis and not like a biography. Admiteddly, it will tell you all you need to know about Mozart but you are likely to need a thesaurus at hand.If you are into Mozart but want something more accessible, I'd recommend Mozart: a Life by Maynard Solomon. Gutman's book is more informative, but far more verbose and inaccessible. Gutman is quite unlike Peter Gay, Hobsbwam, Richard Ellmann in the sense that his text does not share a characteristic of fludity displayed by these writers. To sum up: only buy this book if you are truly interested in the story AND motivated enough to struggle through its 700-odd pages.Well, come to think of it, I've never learned so many new words from a single book..."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"I give the rating above with some misgivings. I've no doubt that Mr Gutman has analyzed every aspect and nuance of Mozart's career and the events that shaped his life. In great detail he shares that information with us, then goes on to give us a graduate level treatise on 18th century music theory and development, a serious discussion of the players and philosophy of the Enlightenment, and a comprehensive romp though the politics of 17th/18th century Europe. I've no doubt that he has accomplished all he set out to do, particularly if his audience is already reasonably fluent in the subjects mentioned. A working familiarity with Mozart's Operas also seems to be expected.I am not that audience. My problem is twofold. First, there is just more about Mozart in this book than I care to know. I just wasn't ready for the depth of the analysis and the often extraneous(to me) subject matter. However, I may have been able to cope with these objections, except that I found the book an excessively daunting read. Amazon's reviewer, Wendy Smith notes in her review that \\"..Gutman's descriptions of Mozart's work are models of music writing for the lay reader: they capture the brilliance and beauty of the great composer's art in easily accessible language\\". Bless her, but as a lay reader, I find she is giving me way too much credit. To refer to his writing as \\"easily accessible\\" is a monstrous stretch as far as I'm concerned. His excessively long compound sentences, volumes of sesquipedalian(long) words, and obscure and often untranslated quotations and phrases did me in.So, if you want to delve into the life and mind of Mozart at great depth, this book is probably the one for you, as attested by the many favorable reviews. However, if your goal is just a reasonably complete look at possibly the greatest musical genius that ever lived, then I would recommend that you look elsewhere. I have."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"This book is a much more pleasing read than Maynard's &quot;Mozart: A Life&quot; - unless you like endless psychological analysis.Gutman describes in detail historical events which influenced the lives of the Mozarts: wars, experiencing freedom in England, interacting with other musicians and philosophers, new outlooks on life and new developments in music.The fine historical detail embellishes the thorough presentation of Mozart's life: for example, knowing his hometown of Salzburg was not part of Austria during his lifetime makes his eventual move to Vienna seem even more dramatic than otherwise.The two reasons I don't give it 5 stars are: 1) it paints a more sanitized picture of Mozart than other sources, and 2) many writers seem to think it enhances their works if they include phrases in foreign languages. Gutman is no exception. For example, Mozart's father's thinking at one point is described as &quot;Aut Ceasar, aut nihil.&quot; This is apparently a somewhat well-known phrase meaning &quot;To Ceasar all or nothing.&quot; but I shouldn't have had to take time out of otherwise enjoyable reading to look it up on the Internet."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"I am 260 pages into this 839 page book and my impression is that this has to be the definitive Mozart biography. It is heavily leaden with pertinent footnotes, asides and culturally important context; what is more important is that Mozart is given the respect due to a grown man, to a blessed genius, to a cultural icon second to no one.When the movie \\"Amadeus\\" came out those many years ago, I watched it and was horrified at how Wolfie was depicted. Worse than a comic book character, he was reduced to a sexually perverse adolescent who just so happened to have music poring through his dim-wit brains. Gutman has burned away all the disappointment and distortion that the admitedly bogus Shaffer play/movie created and what remains is a fantastic story that grips from beginning to end. One of the most impressive bits of trivia, by the way, is just how often Wolfie (and his entire family) was deathly sick and how he lived as long as he did. I simply could not fathom how he survived those many illnesses as a child; perhaps (what we term his immune system) was so demolished as a child that as an adult, facing more sickness, his body simply could not take any more?A really great book that I am savouring every day.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Have finally finished the book. Totally worth the effort to read such a huge book (note: the footnotes although so many are worth reading). This is a book that has the depth that Mozart deserved. What I found outstanding was the richness of knowledge, of the labor of research the author put into arriving at clarity, at dispelling of myths. This later issue for me was the antidote I had always been craving since watching \\"Amadeus\\" for the first time. There have been many silly and inaccurate things said about him; this book just about covers each and every myth. The wisdom we absorb in the process makes Woolfy so much more human. How much more can we love this man who was at the peak of his creative energies, his public success, his power as a husband and father.A word must be said about his father. Although it is tempting to judge Leopold in a harsh way, he was a product in many ways of his times; his character was wracked with insecurities and paranoia. That he took advantage of Mozart and in the end by disinheriting him made him look like a nasty and bitter man, we still have to admit that he encouraged and taught Mozart as best he could. That he could stoop to very low levels (accusing Mozart of being the cause of his mothers death, is but one of many examples) must be seen in contrast to how far Mozart evolved away from those clutching and grasping hands. Sad too is the polluting mindset his sister absorbed from their father. However, we might not have done any better given the tumultuous times they all lived in.His final sickness came out of nowhere and took him very rapidly. With his wife at his side he slipped into a coma and died. We are only left to ponder what sort of music he would have made had he lived, living as he did as Beethoven was emerging out of his own chrysalis. Imagine the clashes of styles and musical agendas as the two would have vied for space. Perhaps Mozart had done all he needed to do? Finally, it should be pointed out that he and Constanze lived in a lot of luxury and although always at a certain level of debt, he always managed it because he kept on writing for lucrative commissions. The world was left with a brilliant addition to it's culture; we would have been so much less without his music. A great book for those who really want to know the real Mozart. A tour de force."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"It's hard rating this book because on the one hand the subject matter is so fascinating and wonderful to read about, but on the other hand, the author's writing style is overworked and, at times, sloppy. I didn't mind the abundance of footnotes, but his language seemed unnecessarily florid. It was however, filled with interesting facts and did not have TOO much conjecture (which I hate in history books, just the facts please!). I've read several other books on Mozart which had mainly focused on his later Vienna years, so I will say that it was enjoyable to find out so much about the whole \\"wunderkind\\" years. So I recommend this book for serious lovers of Mozart, but it may not be the best choice for the casual fan looking for a fun read."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"Until now, my only exposure to Mozart was the acclaimed film, Amadeus. While I do love that movie, this book offers a much more textured, nuanced view of Mozart's life.

Mozart's music is brilliant, and so is this book."},{"Title":"Mozart a Cultural Biography","review":"I have greatly enjoyed this book, but I think it should be said that it does not make a good introduction to or first look at Mozart or his music. I have studied Mozart most of my life, and have a great familiarity with much of his life and most of his works, but if you do not you will quickly become lost. A good solid understanding of classical music is also essential. The book was not written for the uninitiated!My other qualm is that the author has striven to give us every detail about Mozart's earlier years, but does not for his last years. It seemed just when things were really getting interesting, when we are reaching the time of Mozart's greatest works and triumphs, Mr. Gutman suddenly rushes to the end. I would definetely liked to have seen a better balance between the beginning and the end of Mozart's life.All in all, this is a very rewarding work.

This book follows the crews' adventures through the building of their reed boat in Iraq, their journey into the Persian Gulf, and onward to Pakistan and Africa.What a wonderful and personal glimpse we get of the nations of Iraq, Oman, Bahrain, Pakistan and Djibouti. Often, we hear of these places and associate only the evils of terrorism and war with them, but through this book, we can see the warmth and genuineness of the peoples of these countries.Sailing under the flag of the United Nations, the Tigris Expedition not only wanted to prove scientific facts about ancient man and the ability to sail the high seas on boats made of reeds, but Heyerdahl and company wanted to demonstrate the ability of people of many nations to live and work together in peace. After five months at sea, they easily proved this.If you have a love of adventure, a love of the sea, a love of history and the past and the future, this book is for you. If you want to know more about the early peoples of our world, this book is for you. If you want to see that people in the Middle East are people just like those not in the Middle East, this book is for you. Heyerdahl is a master storyteller and a master of adventure. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Tigris Expedition: In Search of Our Beginnings","review":"It isn't a novel. It is a straight forward - almost dear diary like - account of a planned and executed scientific project. Given who was planning it, Heyerdahl, and who was funding it (Nat Geo) what could go wrong? Ha!You know, if only everybody had read this book BEFORE Iraq became a household word. Nothing of what is going on there now would be a surprise.That aside, the glimpse of the past you are treated to, by proxy, is simply mind bending. If you think you have a good grasp on ancient history, be ready to gasp. So many insights and surprises - and suspense. Wow.I bought several copies as I can't think of a better source of entertainment to give as a gift than reality on the edge."},{"Title":"The Tigris Expedition: In Search of Our Beginnings","review":"This was the last of the Great Expeditions in reed ships that author historian and practical research archaeologist Thor Heyerdahl made on the ocean and it reads well very much like a journal at times and others like a novel, it has it's own style. Very likeable and it will grace my research shelves in my bookcase for years. It tells how Thor and his 10 multi-national companions built and sailed again together in a reed ship - a ma-gur- from the days of Middle Eastern antiquity from the birthplace of man- to the places he spreed across multiple generations. It is the last of the sea explorer series that started with Kon-Tiki, and then through Ra I and Ra II- all reed ships that the author and his international crew built in the old way and sailed in the old way to modern versions of ancient ports in their quest to prove sea routes of ancient man. A very good read and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Tigris Expedition: In Search of Our Beginnings","review":"It's a pity, but Thor Heyerdahl's name is little remembered anymore. He was a Norwegian ethnographer who was not afraid to take on the conventional wisdom of his time, and propose bold theories on the movements of peoples in prehistoric times.Ancient Sumerian writings spoke of merchant ships traveling between Mesopotamia and the lands of Dilmun and Melahhu, which historians suggested were Bahrain and the Indus River civilization. But, the same historians also suggested that the simple reed boats of Ancient Mesopotamia would have quickly disintegrated in the seawater, making such voyages simple or even impossible. Thor Heyerdahl took up the challenge, built a reed ship similar to what the ancients would have had, sailed it to Bahrain, Pakistan, and even on to the coast of Africa. At the end of his voyage, he proved that it was easily within the abilities of the Mesopotamians to have made such voyages, and that their reed ships could have continued for voyage after voyage.Overall, I found this to be a very interesting read. The author does a great job of telling the story of his journey, and what they found, and presents some of his theories in a very interesting and believable manner. It's too bad that Mr. Heyedahl is gone now; I wish that he had had the time to write even more wonderful books!"},{"Title":"He's Been Faithful (Sheet Music) (0 08689 37178 3)","review":"This book has totally turned my life around as far as my involvement in the music ministry of our church.

We are asking all of our choir members to read and discuss this book."},{"Title":"He's Been Faithful (Sheet Music) (0 08689 37178 3)","review":"This book is part of a multi-media project in that it contains a music CD bearing the same title. After reading the book, the music is even more meaningful because it covers the background of the person who wrote the lyrics. Carol Cymbala, a pastor's wife who leads the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, describes the challenges she faced and how they were overcome through faith in God. The focus of her book is not her as hero, but on God as deliverer. In fact, the lyrics to the title song, emphasize that theme, that in spite of the wavering of the individual, &quot;He's been faithful.&quot; It's a song and book of gratitude to God for his faithfulness. She gives the history of the early days of the congregation. She talks about how God added to the church. This is a testimony that is encouraging to other Christians in that it shows how God worked in one context, New York City, and causes one to realize what He did for others, He is willing to do for them. There are various individual stories contained in this work, i.e., different members of the choir have their testimonies featured throughout the book."},{"Title":"He's Been Faithful (Sheet Music) (0 08689 37178 3)","review":"This book was written by Carol Cymbala, wife of Jim Cymbala, pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle. Carol directs the well-known Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir. This choir itself is an amazing testimony to God's love the faithfulness.In this book, Carol Cymbala gives examples from her life that show God's faithfulness. It is very inspiring.Carol was/is very shy and with the Lord's help, but overcame that and was able to fulfill God's purposes for her life. A few of the stories were also told by Jim in Fresh Wind Fresh Fire, but it's interesting hearing it from another person.Carol makes herself vulnerable and talks about her own failings and disappointments. Her honesty is refreshing and makes it easier to identify with her.In this book, you will about what happens when the people of God fully surrender their lives to Jesus.A 6-song audio CD is included inside the back cover of the new books - the title song &quot;He's Been Faithful&quot; really brings this book to life.Read this book soon - it will most likely change you view of how God might be working in your life!Please check out my reviews of other Christian books and music."},{"Title":"He's Been Faithful (Sheet Music) (0 08689 37178 3)","review":"I read this book in one sitting.

It is hard to imagine how a girl that's raised in the Northwest, and was so shy that she could not even speak up school, could become a Pastor's wife in New York, and lead a choir of several hundred people. The choir won Grammy awards. I found it even more amazing, when I read that as Carol began this adventure, she didn't even now how to read music! She includes stories of individuals who's lives were changed during all of this.

Whereas I had always wanted to direct a choir, Carol had no idea she ever would, nor even wanted to. It just goes to show what a person can do if they allow God to guide them. Two things I say about my own life as a result of reading this book: Keep right with God and PRAY, PRAY, PRAY. The praying isn't nearly as effective, in fact not effective at all, if there is a known and continuous sin in your life.A GREAT BOOK."},{"Title":"The Winter Barn (Pictureback(R))","review":"Winter Barn has quietly become the backbone of my 2 year old son's little library. With no distracting character names, the young reader (or young one being read to) gets to meet a farmer and his barn full of animals during a gentle winter snowstorm. The text flows in and out of rhymes, creating a sense of comfort which is confirmed by the pleasant illustrations. This book is a wonderful change up from many of the other &quot;louder&quot; books that are out there. Don't let the reading level of 4 -8 years old prevent you from reading Winter Barn to your toddler. My family has found it to be a very rewarding experience."},{"Title":"The Winter Barn (Pictureback(R))","review":"The content (writing and art work) were great, but way too expensive for the cheap paper binding.

Its parodies of news stories and newspaper columns are always good for a laugh, but sometimes can get savage in the style of Jonathan Swift in his &quot;Modest Proposal&quot; period. Good cases in point are JonBenet Ramsey's letter from Heaven and the op-ed piece, &quot;It's Not a Crack House, It's a Crack Home.&quot; But if those are not to your taste, you can always read about Bill Gates patenting ones and zeroes, or researchers' conclusion that babies are &quot;incredibly stupid,&quot; or inimitable advice columns such as &quot;Ask a Faulknerian Idiot Man-Child.&quot; I take personal umbrage that a few favorites of mine from theonion.com didn't make it into this book, such as Jesse Helms and Tristan Tzara joining to fight the National Endowment for the Arts, or Wal-Mart opening a store in Winesburg, Ohio. But that's the way the ball bounces, and all I can do is repeat the headline quote from former President Reagan (as it appeared in The Onion, of course!)."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"The audiotape of &quot;The Onion's Finest News Reporting&quot; is mostly on the money, making me laugh out loud several times during the course of its one cassette. The laughs came from the short news items, however, NOT the long parodies of newspaper editorials which are inserted after every five or six news items. The editorials are endless and dull, and confuse the fact that an observation about something might be funny but having to experience it might not be; for example, the IDEA of someone delivering a ten-minute self-important editorial about something so NOT a part of our daily lives as robots might generate a chuckle, but to actually have to listen to such an editorial (as we do here) is agony. An editor worth his salt would have seen that stuff like that wasn't working and performed some needed cutting. But, as long as you don't have to pay too much cash for this, the audio is worth your time for the short news pieces, which are mostly hilarious."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"&quot;The Onion&quot; says everything you were ever afraid to say out loud. But be warned--several times I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. This book *will* hurt you."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"This is a greatr book, provided you haven't read and memorized all their articles already. Regardless, it truly is the world's greatest coffee table book. now I just need that coffee table."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"If you're familiar with The Onion, you know what sort of mind-blowing, biting humor is in this book, and you know whether you like it or don't like it. If you're among the many who were given a copy of &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot; last holiday season, you have a pretty good idea of the absurdist social/cultural satire you can find in this book, and you might be interested in reading their take on more contemporary events. If you're looking for something that will make you laugh your head off, this book *might* be it.I say &quot;might be&quot; because this book is not for the easily offended--there's course language and graphic sexual content that some may find objectionable. If that's not you, buy this book and, when you get it, go someplace where you can laugh out loud, because you certainly will, and I mean repeatedly.Don't get me wrong--I'm not criticizing the content of the book. It's just not for the faint of heart, that's all."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"By &quot;good&quot;, I mean absolutely hilarious. And by &quot;clean&quot;, I of course mean not at all clean. Okay, so it's not for the easily offended, but for the rest of us it's a dream come true.

The Onion is one of the funniest things going, and I hope Volume 2 comes out soon!"},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"This book is priceless. Some of the articles aren't quite great, but when they're good, they're hysterical."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"I purchased this on Sunday and have had it at work and we are all cracking up some examples &quot;New York to Install Special 'Infant Only' Dumpsters&quot;, &quot;Chrysler Halts Production of Neckbelts&quot;, &quot;Nation's Educators Alarmed by Poorly Written Teen Suicide Notes&quot;, etc., etc. You will be laughing and crying!"},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"Hysterical and appealing to a wide range of ages, educations, backgrounds. The only criteria is to check your sensitivity at the door re: anything you hold dear or sacred -- it will eventually be mocked. A landmark in humor similar to Monty Python in the 70's but the content will appeal to a much broader audience (you do not, for example, need a particular affection for a British-centric view).You will find it hard to stop reading this but I do recommend you pace yourself. After about a dozen pages the absurdity begins to seem patterned and the punch diminishes. Take it in doses, maybe put it in the bathroom (as long as don't mind people wondering what sends you into hysterics every time you go in there).If you like this you will also enjoy This American Life's CD (I forget the name) or Billy Collins' CD The Best Cigarette."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"This book is a collection of spoof, \\"Harvard Lampoon\\" style, irreverent \\"newspaper articles\\", poking fun at some standards of the newspaper trade. The one way in which their parodies are NOT perfect is that they are actually BETTER written and edited than real newspaper stories; I found only one typo in the entire book. So not only are they hilariously funny, they're also COMPETENT. Of course, they're completely politically incorrect and generally irreverent; if you have any capability of being offended by stories headlined \\"New York To Install Special 'Infants Only' Dumpsters\\" and could not possibly find such a story funny, no matter how well it spoofed the true stories that one sees about infants found abandoned in dumpsters, then you won't want to read this. Or anything else by the Onion."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"I saw all the rave reviews, and bought it. But it just wasn't funny. Maybe it's me, but I can't understand how people enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"My son LOVES the Onion, and this was a great way to see the headlines of previous years twisted as always for hilarity. Finest indeed!"},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"Reading The Onion 'newspaper' as it comes out should be a part of the regular education of anyone who can read English, as it is consistently and outrageously funny. The Onion has issued a series of what are mostly reprints in book form, of which this is one. It's not quite as good the second time around, especially if you remember the stories from when you first read them - but if a friend of yours has never seen them in the original, this is a great gift or coffee table book or whatever to shove their way.The book is technically broken down by chapters, each of which has a lead-in article or editorial by the centenarian 'editor' Zweibel, which for reasons unknown are basically very, very lame attempts at humor, by far the weakest part (and only original part) of the book. Oh well.The rest of the articles are a jumble of stuff, much of it hysterically funny, some of it not so much, depending on your taste. If you like the Onion but only see it once in a while, you should have this book. Maybe leave it in your bathroom or at bedside or something; best read one or two pages at a time, after that the recommended adult dosage may be exceeded."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was funny, not their best but still good."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"I stumbled upon the Onion while in New York where I came upon a bunch of free copies. It was hilarious. This was the first book from the Onion that I got. The articles aren't in chronological order but are instead bits and pieces from many different issues; a \\"best of\\" collection I guess. Anyway, as for \\"The Onion,\\" there's nothing really like it in the world today. It is a satirical newspaper that has humorous headlines such as \\"Richard Simmons Fighting for Life in Estrogen Tent\\" as well as community voices with titles like \\"Those Motherf*cking Robins are on Thin Ice\\" in which an old man tells about how robins have caused him so much trouble (It's funnier if you read the article I guess). Some other funny stories include how Civil War enthusiasts march on Atlanta and emancipate the NFL Falcons team as well as an article entitled \\"Tibet Freedom Fighters Seize Yak. 'Whatever' say Chinese.\\" Like I said, if you appreciate political humor and satire, this is definitely for you. There is some bad language, but if you can handle this, you will be crying by time you are finished because it is so funny."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"This is yet another great example of brilliant and witty writing on the part of the Onion's writers. From GM introducing \\"new, instant-win airbags\\" to Saddam Hussein stepping down because of a sex scandal and a local child destroying an ant colony, the writing is better than ever. The writers' ribald and vulgar sense of humor is sharper than ever, too, as Monica Lewinsky gets subpoenaed to \\"re-blow Clinton on Senate floor.\\" It's tough to pick a favorite Onion book, but this one is right up there. Even the offensive ones are somehow funny. Get it, read it, and laugh again and again. Makes a great coffee table book."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"I discovered The Onion (its website) by accident, one day while searching on the Internet. And I was instantly hooked. The site is incredibly funny, and satirical and points the right amount of fun and directed political commentary at the key issues making the headlines. This is is simply important reading. While it is important to keep abreast of the serious journals and commnetary, its important to remember that satire and comedy are often as illustrative and explanatory than the serious stuff. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"This book was my first exposure to The Onion. I happened upon it on a trip and read it in one evening. I couldn't put it down, and nearly hurt myself laughing so hard. The satire is right on the money, although it may offend some people. (Doesn't good satire always do that?) But you must read this! Also, check out the website,... for more of this material. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"My, my...perhaps I should have pursued my journalism career -- I would love to write for the Onion -- but only the Onion -- because their sarcastic wit is just what the nation needs.This is a very satirical look at news, newspapers, and publishers. The stories cover with, irreverent insensitivity, some subjects sure to anger some, while at the same time, make others laugh until they cry.The story about Mother Teresa going to hell due to a &quot;clerical error&quot;, or the one where Jon Benet Ramsey, tells people not to cry about her brutal death, because she is happy with the angels now, are just a couple examples of what I am talking about.Just about no political/social group escapes the watchful eye of the Onion. The homosexual humor is extremely outrageous. I especially enjoyed how they &quot;covered&quot; a story regarding a homosexual man who saved a family from a fire. Even though the story should have been focusing on the brave rescue, the reporter kept mentioning the man's homosexuality every chance he got, showing a bit extremely, how news gets sensationalized.If you loved Our Dumb Century as much as I did and can handle some very extreme, and at times, sexually explicit humor and can take a joke, you will love this latest compilation from the Onion. It is highly hysterical reading."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"Here's a review that is on the average star. If you don't read the Onion, consider this a five star review. If you do read The Onion it's a three star review. Why? It's just a bunch of rehashes of stories that were funny once, but don't hold up.Also problematic are the editorials. They are amusing but they don't hit the laugh-out loud hilarity of the rest of the articles. The only consistantly funny part of the editorial portion are the &quot;What do you think&quot; which always hits the maddeningly inarticulate and useless statements of the &quot;man on the street&quot; interviews perfectly.So buy it for someone that you know doesn't read The Onion, but if you want to read an Onion book, buy Our Dumb Century."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"For new fans this book is a great read, however for people who tune in to the weekly satire online (or in print), this is simply a rehash of many old highlights.

Besides, you can get the whole thing just be reading the archives on theonion.com web site!"},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"The Onion delivers a new book and not a moment too soon. I hadn't had a good, long, debilitating laugh in a few weeks and this collection of the Onion's finest work cured me in seconds.This collection features the Onion's typical incisive and warped stories (my favorite being the one on Russia's hottest game show, &quot;Who Wants to Eat a Meal?&quot;) and also pieces by some of their finest columnists, including the Love Man himself, Smoove B.So I heartily recommend the book, unless you don't like tearing rib cartilage from laughing too hard."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"More pictures that War and Peace!

More humour than Mein Kampf!If you already have a cupboard full of print-outs from the Onion's web-site (like I do) order this book right now.I bought Our Dumb Century and read it from cover to cover over a period of about 3 weeks. Normally a book that size would take me a couple of hours, but the cramps and tears from laughing too hard slowed me down.Virtually everyone I show ODC to needs to have a copy for themselves.

This is incredibly funny."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"As an avid reader of The Onion, I found this book, a repackaging of old articles from the Onion, nothing special. A much larger, and much better, archive of old articles can be found by going to the website.The only purpose of this book is to provide a quick follow-up on the heels of the highly successful &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot;. However, where &quot;Our Dumb Century&quot; was tremendously thought out and very well executed satire, this slapdash affair of seemingly randomly chosen past articles is best left out of your bookcase. I was lured in by the possibilities of a new book by The Onion. You, however, need not make the same mistake. When satirists become the very same money-hungry media moguls they were put on earth to poke fun at, you can be pretty sure their humor is going to come out pretty stale.This book is good for anybody who does not have access to a computer but enjoys ripping satire. I have no idea who those people would be but, if you are reading this, you are obviously not one of them. I recommend going to a bookstore, picking it off the shelf and paging through it. It won't take long to read the articles you enjoy. However, the chapter introductions by T.

But in case you're thinking about getting this book anyway, look at with the online editions of The Onion first. The humor works better in a fake-newspaper format than a fake-newspaper-clippings format (the way it's presented in this book.) The difference might not be as apparent to people who've been reading the Onion for a while and automatically think in the newspaper paradigm, but if that's not you, then jumping right into this book might not give you the full effect.For peple who do regularly read The Onion, be aware that nothing in this book is original material (i.e. hasn't been culled from previous issues of The Onion.) Still, you can't find all of this in the online archives, and some of the ones you may have never seen before are probably worth looking at. And a few of them are just so side-splittingly gasping-for-air funny that you'll BARF. I am thinking specifically of the editorial &quot;My Efforts Are Largely Unappreciated&quot; -- which is written by a traffic cone! Apparently, it feels that it deserves more recognition in the workplace. This poor, feeble, and brainless (but incredibly earnest) inanimate object's tenuous grasp of human syntax is just plain hilarious.

I said go, you fool! END"},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"The Onion's writers have a rare gift for satire. Their eye for detail allows them to intricately parody not only current events, but the style of newspaper writing itself, particularly the watered-down news of USA Today. Their attention to form gives rise to headlines such as &quot;Hero Firefighter: 'I'm a Hero,'&quot; and &quot;Life Unfair.&quot; The targets of their satire are wide-ranging, and their humor biting enough that the overly-sensitive and childrens' gift-givers may wish to steer clear. But those with a pragmatic sense of political correctness will be treated to laugh-out-loud content. This book serves as a nicely representative chunk of the Onion's recent years of publication, so both the uninitiated and the longtime fans will find something to appreciate.I have been privileged over the past few years to write a handful of headlines for the Onion (careful - they don't accept unsolicited stuff!), and althuogh none of my work is in this volume, I am proud to be associated with the body of work represented here."},{"Title":"The Onion's Finest News Reporting Volume One","review":"There is no better book to have at your side While pinching a loaf than this book.

The Massie Affair was a criminal case around the wife of a Navy officer who accused 5 non-white men of raping her. All 5 were acquitted, at which point some friends and family of Thalia Massie kidnapped and killed one of the accused. The original rape trial and the subsequent murder trial captured the attention of US media at that time. This book examines all the details of both cases, and provides ample text on numerous characters such as locals, lawyers, US Navy officials, journalists from the mainland, and politicians both in Hawaii and in D.C. who tried to get involved. The story told reveals how Hawaiian society worked at multiple levels, with race, money, religion and ethnicity interplaying in complicated ways. The book is also a great study of how race relations affect everything else in a community, such as business relations, law enforcement, cultural codes and media portrayals of local and global events. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"Having lived in Hawai'i in the mid 1980's and returning to live here for the rest of my life I really can identify with this book. Not only do I know exactly where all the places are as events occur but the mentality as well.When I lived in Honolulu in the 1980's, there was a sense of empowerment among anyone 'brown'. As long as Hawai'i sent the money to Washington D.C. politics was left alone. The \\"plantation mentality\\" really disappeared after WWII, and the people who were in charge were the people who lived here. I had no problem with it, it was great at the time, a Governor of Hawaiian heritage, everybody looked like each other at all social strata, and whatever \\"harassment\\" I felt as a person who was of European background was a tiny taste of what these same people saying/doing negative things to me would go through on the mainland.Unfortunately in 2009 I feel it has swung back to the times similar to this book, the Governor here is white, there is a 2 Billion dollar,yes, $2,000,000,000, slush fund that she will not touch. The number of school days in the state is the 2nd lowest in the world, only 163 days. It is a \\"keep them dumb so they won't fight\\" mentality here and the POC (People Of Color) who are benefiting are just Uncle Tom's. I guess Knowledge Is Power really applies here.Hawai'i has over 90 nationalities, and was and should be an example of a good society no matter what you look like. It looks like you can change the dates in the book and some of the same mindset is still flourishing here.This is a great book no matter where you live. Murder, a slutty military officer's wife, big business steering (literally as in a boat sense) local law and enforcement, the power of hysteria in the media, newspaper and in the movie newsreels as well as Lowell Thomas on the radio broadcasting nationally and \\"brown savages\\" scare tactics. Reminds me of Hearst Empire, Citizen Kane and From Here To Eternity mixed in one.Very, very good book to pass along once you get done reading it."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"I've been vaguely aware of the \\"Massie Affair\\" for a couple of years now, but it wasn't until I'd read Alan Brennert's novel \\"Honolulu\\" that I'd decided it was a piece of history I should know more about. In his novel, Brennert weaves elements of the Massie Affair into the narrative and makes Joseph Kahahawai--one of the men falsely accused of rape in that case--a character in his story. After \\"meeting\\" Joseph in that novel, I decided that it was time I delve into the details of this dark piece of Hawaiian history. Brennert referenced David Stannard's \\"Honor Killing\\" and so I picked it up and am I glad I did.Honor Killing tells the story of five men--Joseph Kahahawai, Horace Ida, Ben Ahakuelo, Horace Ida, Henry Chang and David Takai--who are accused and tried of raping Thalia Massie, a white woman and navy wife, even though they could not (as trial evidence later revealed) have committed the crime. When that trial ends in a mistrial, Tommie Massie and his mother-in-law Grace Fortescue and two other navy men kidnap Kahahawai and murder him, a crime for which they are convicted and sentenced to 10 years hard labor. Their convictions, however, were commuted by the governor to one hour served in the comfort of the Governor's office.Yes, this is a non-fiction work, but it isn't some dry, scholastic recitation of events long gone by. It is a fascinating and expertly crafted read that really pulls the reader in to the time and place, and Stannard manages to do something that is not all that easy to do in non-fiction: he takes a story to which one already knows the ending and makes it not only readable, but compelling every step of the way. And he does this with an even hand. He doesn't embellish the facts or sensationalize the events. He keeps the eye of a researcher and historian firmly in place.With meticulous care, Stannard not only builds Hawaii of that time, but he also gives life, depth and--most importantly--context to the social and political situations that existed in 1930s Honolulu. Stannard doesn't just rely on society pages and newspaper accounts or the memoirs of those who prosecuted the falsely accused or those who defended Tommie Massie and Grace Fortescue who killed Kahahawai. He digs deeper, constructing full people, both their faults and foibles for public and private records.In this expert historical study, each person we are introduced to is built from the events and experiences which brought them to the particular place in their lives. Using their own words, the inconsistencies in their own statements, the recollections of others as well as detailed trial transcripts, Stannard creates full people. He doesn't give us cardboard villains or angelic heroes. The Honolulu of the age is painted as it was...a Paradise, that is if your were one of the privileged white haole, and a tough, poor \\"neighborhood\\" if you were of Native Hawaiian or Asian descent.In the end, Stannard delivers not only an important piece of Hawaiian history, but of U.S. history, a history that should be taught in all American schools. It's a study of classism, colonialism, and racism. And Stannard manages all this in a riveting yet scholarly manner. Highly recommended.Originally reviewed for GoodReads"},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"I read this book while working in Hawaii and found it absolutely riveting, not so much because of the true crime story (which was bizarre) but because the author captured Hawaii's \\"society\\" of the early 20th century. I must admit I was ashamed of our military's behavior at that time--and in this case--and equally appalled at the bigotry and arrogance that flourished among the Americans then living in the Islands.

With the underlying accounts of the fascinating criminal trials described in this book, author David Stannard weaves in the historical context preceding and within which they occurred. No punches were pulled in exposing the racist attitudes that permeated and influenced the events described nor were the descriptions of the personalities of the main players, including Clarence Darrow, devoid of anecdotes of ethically questionable conduct.

But, he spent it on the wrong side. Or so it seemed. While Darrow's legal machinations freeing his clients was a travesty, the author built his conclusions on history from the 21st century. By looking backwards, he showed how Hawaii profited from the lessons learned from this famous case. The consequences to the parties was insignificant compared to the growth in perceptions that led to the casting off of the chains of greedy capitalists who ran \\"The Big 5,\\" on the sweat of \\"locals\\" to the respect due all citizens of what became our 50th state. Would this have happened but for Darrow's misplaced brilliance? Probably, but it sure sped things up! Therefore, Darrow's reputation really is untarnished."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"Probably the best thing I can say about this book is that the author has gone to every place possible to get to the bottom of the 'actual' story and presented it without (much) bias or preconceived notions. In 1931 the Territory of Hawaii was still being 'run' by the 'Big Five' families that had overthrown the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 and convinced the US Congress to annex the islands in 1898. The Territory was run by these wealthy families on par with a feudal plantation or their own private colony. They decided who could or could not immigrate to the Islands (since the original Hawaiian had been reduced by disease and alcoholism to under 100,000), and over the years has 'imported' workers for the sugar-cane and pineapple fields (Portuguese, Philippinos, Japanese, Chinese) and then played them off against one another to keep wages low and organized labor out.The Hawaiians that were left had mingled with almost all of the ethnic groups that had immigrated to the Islands and produced a large mixed group that the Whites considered as dissipated and colored. Hawaii had become a 'southern state' in many ways in that the majority of the Whites in power had the same attitude to the other races as Southern Whites. Most of the Naval Officers at Pearl Harbor were southerners with all the bias that their brethren back home had. No White man had every been convicted of rape or molestation of a non-white woman and no White woman had ever been molested by non-white. Not until Thalia Massie.In 1931 Thalia Massie claimed that she had been abducted by 5 Hawaiians and repeatedly raped. First she couldn't identify anyone because as she said it was dark and she never got a look at them. She also claimed they drove an old Ford or Dodge with a torn roof (she could hear it flapping in the breeze). Her injuries were documented at a hospital and except for a split lip and bruise on her face there were no other marks. Her green silk dress had some blood on it (from her lip) but wasn't torn nor did it have any dirt marks. Eventually the Honolulu Police bring her 5 men (2 Hawaiian, 1 Chinese, two Japanese mixed-race) who she doesn't recognize. But later she 'remembers' everything about these men down to their exact clothing and the license plate on their relatively new tan Model A Ford (the same car that she has). What Stannard reports is that Thalia had terrible eyesight (she was practically blind) and had very little night vision.When the 'rape' was reported the prosecution not only did a terrible job of developing a time line for where the \`rapists' where they never established any physical evidence linking the accused to Thalia. The outcome was a hung jury that was not broken down by racial lines. Thalia's mother and all of the Navy and Big Five people believe that it was a miscarriage of justice.*****WARNING*****SPOILERS BELOW*****So Thalia's mother, husband and two navy ratings kidnap one of the accused and shoot him, and are caught while taking the body for \`disposal'. The court case becomes a cause celebre among the Navy and the racist white press. Clarence Darrow takes this as his last case and though he does a good job (he even suborns perjury), the prosecutor does a better job and under immense pressure the jury finds them guilty of manslaughter. Bringing pressure from the Navy, the Big Five and the Department of Interior (under whose control the Islands fall) the defendants have their sentences commuted from ten years hard labor to one hour in the custody of the Sheriff. The long term effect of the two court cases is that working together, all of the non-whites are able to wrest the power and control of the government of Hawaii away from the white minority as soon as WW2 is over.Just a great book with phenomenal sociological undertones that resonate to this day.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"I read this book over a year ago and could still tell you most of the story from start to finish. This is a remarkable story with many twists, tragedies, and incredible characters. If it weren't a true story I'd say it was preposterous fiction.

I recommend this books to any one interested in true crime and the setting of the story."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"After a unfortunate mixup which most probably was my fault it was successful. The vendor, All Kind Of Books, was cooperative and true to his word."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"Honor Killing is an involved account of the 1931 Massie case that shocked Hawai'i and the rest of the U.S. In the Massie case, a white U.S. Navy officer's wife accused five Asian men of raping her in Honolulu in 1931. The case caused a firestorm and led to the murder of one of the accused Asian men. Eventually, famed defense attorney Clarence Darrow became involved in the case.David Stannard of the University of Hawai'i has written a thorough (420-page) account of the case. Honor Killing is good, but it is a bit too long. The book is worth reading, but I cannot rate it any higher than three stars.For a detailed account of the Massie case, it would be difficult to top Honor Killing. Stannard deserves credit for vividly evoking Hawai'i and the United States in 1931. Unsurprisingly, he focuses on race and on the unease that Hawai'i's diverse racial makeup caused in the rest of the U.S. Stannard also does a good job of explaining Hawaiian politics, in particular the role that corporate interests played in dictating the policies of the territorial government. Finally, I enjoyed Stannard's account of the lives of the impoverished Asians and the wealthier Navy personnel in Hawai'i.One point that Stannard makes throughout the book is that the passions and prejudices of America, circa 1931, influenced the progression of the Massie case. I think that it is fair to say that Massie's book unwittingly reflects the passions of our contemporary society. Throughout Honor Killing's 420 pages Stannard invariably portrays Hawai'i as the victim of an imperialistic U.S. Government; there is, no doubt, some truth to this view. But the reader wonders how much of it is the truth and how much results from Stannard's political views.Another irritating aspect of the book is Stannard's tendency to play mind reader; on the basis of no evidence he tells the reader what each character was thinking. It comes as no surprise that the thoughts of those whom Stannard does not like generally reflect selfishness, racism, greed, etc. Stannard did not need to editorialize to make the point that racism and greed influenced the Massie trial and Hawai'i's relationship with the rest of the U.S.; the facts alone establish those points beyond any doubt.The Massie case is both tragic and fascinating in what it reveals about the U.S. during the 1930s. Honor Killing is a decent account of the case. Unfortunately, readers of the book must contend with David Stannard's political biases and shortcomings as a writer."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone into Hawaiian history. Stannard keeps it fast paced, weaving in background,historical fact and insights into all the persons involved.Once you get started you find it hard to put down. Stannard carefully crafts all the main characters and ties them together.He show cases a case that changed the islands of Hawaii forever."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"I really enjoyed this book and I applaud David Stannard for doing the research. Few survivors of the period are still alive; oddly enough, many of the main characters were young in 1931 and so live on today, and reading all the trial testimony carefull and collected the archives of the news accounts, as well as keeping an ear to the ground, has allowed David E. Stannard to expand, in an extraordinary way, our knowledge of this tragic affair beyond any preceding account. You can almost smell the frangipani, hear the ocean roar. As the Massies get drunk at the Officer's Club, you can almost sense the aimless confusion of those living beyond their means.Even the bizarre details ring true, such as when Thalia Massie, recovering from her \\"injuries\\" in a Honolulu hospital ward, asks the nurse to satisfy her curiosity about if Asian women are \\"built sideways.\\"I think Thalia lied. However, Stannard is relentless in besmirching Thalia Massie, and his attack amounts to Hearst-style overkill. He had credibility going in, but there's so much detail about how awful she was that after awhile, two words spring to mind: character assassination. Had Stannard attempted to give us a more balanced, well rounded portrait of Thalia, her infamy might have registered more fully. As it is, I suspect that at least some good traits have been suppressed, because no one, not even Hitler, is as evil as he portrays Thalia Massie.Not only that, but OK, he doesn't believe her rape claim. If you relied on this book, you would think that the crime of rape never actually happened, that each accusation was false, or at least that no men of color had ever raped a white woman, anywhere in the world. Stannard doesn't make blanket statements, exactly; he just shows us that until the Massie case, no Hawai'ians had ever been convicted of raping a white woman, and that afterwards, whatever convictions have been obtained were tainted by the case and thus should be thrown out and all the rapists pardoned. Here, again, I think he goes too far. He all but says that ANY woman who has been raped was not raped, but only lying. Sad."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"Hot, sexy story. I took it to the beach and sorry I wasn't in Hawaii.

It's like 2 books wrapped into 1. On the one hand, it's a true-crime page-turner--with rape, murder, colorful characters, unexpected plot twists, and two nail-biting trials. On the other, it transports you back to a Hawaii you never knew existed. I learned about U.S. swashbuckling in the Pacific, the dispossession of Native Hawaiians, slavery-like sugar plantations, and a seething cauldron of race relations. By the end, I had not only been entertained but inspired. I came to think about Hawaii, civil rights, and even American democracy in new ways. Honor Killing is an exceptionally compelling book."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"David Stannard's \\"Honor Killing: How the Infamous 'Massie Affair' Transformed Hawaii\\" is a powerfully written narrative about an event that has been largely forgotten in both Hawaii and the U.S. Stannard painstakingly recounts the story of Thalia Massie and her alleged rape by four local Hawaiians. Joseph Kahahawai, one of the four accused, was subsequently murdered at the hands of Thalia's vengeful mother and husband after the trial ended in a hung jury. This set the stage for a classic courtroom battle between the renown criminal defense attorney Clarence Darrow and relatively unknown prosecutor John Kelley. Stannard places the Massie Affair within the historical context of the Great Depression and prevalent racial attitudes in both Hawaii and the U.S. Mainland. His poignant conclusion alludes to the tremendous social changes that have made Hawaii into one of the most diverse and accepting States in the U.S. The Massie Affair, like the Sacco-Vanzetti trial and the murder of Emmett Till, were cases whose significance extends far beyond the courtroom or detective novel.Throughout his account, Stannard makes references to the discrimination and lynching of African Americans in the South. The connection seems difficult to make at first, considering that African Americans were legally prohibited from using the same schools and restrooms as whites, forced to sit at the back of the bus, and the constant target of harassment by rich and poor white alike.The Hawaiian and Asian populations may not have experienced this degree of overt discrimination, but they were still seen as a major threat, especially by the white oligarchy that had ruled Hawaii since its annexation in 1898. Sugar planters exploited ethnic tensions between their Japanese, Portuguese, and Chinese laborers to keep wages low and discontent from shifting towards them. As more and more plantation workers settled into crowded shantytowns on the outskirts of Honolulu, they joined disenfranchised native Hawaiians and began to forge a culture that transcended racial barriers. The Massie Affair united these formerly disparate groups against the white oligarchy, who was increasingly seen as the source of their repression.The charges against the three surviving accused rapists were dropped. Thalia's mother and husband, along with two sailors, were convicted by a mixed-race jury, but had their sentences commuted after intense pressure on the local governor. The Massie Affair was soon obscured by the Great Depression, the Lindbergh Kidnapping, and the rise of Hitler. For the people of Hawaii, however, the Massie Affair marked the beginning of a twenty-year long struggle to overturn the dominant white oligarchic elite. Contemporary Hawaii was forged in the courtrooms of the Hale Ali'iolani.Stannard's concise yet incredibly detailed account of the Massie Affair is a must-read for anyone interested in learning about Hawaii beyond Pearl Harbor, beach boys, or luaus. \\"Honor Killing\\" is an invaluable contribution to the story of Race in modern America. It is also a reminder that vigilance, more than ever, is needed to ensure that Justice and the rule of Law are not sacrificed to the fleeting demands of today."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"Neearly everyone in Hawaii knows about the Massie trial. Virtually no one on the continent is aware of the trial and its legacy of racism and white privilege. Although there are several journalistic accounts of the alleged rape of Thalia Massie and the lynching of Joe Kahahawaii, Honor Killing now stands as definitive.Local reader who think they know something about this case will be surprised at the level of detail and nuance that Stannard brings to this well worn tale. A scrupulous and intreprid researcher, Stannard has combed through new sources and re-intepreted old ones, shedding new light on this story locals are already familiar with.Mainland audiences will be surprised by the twists and turns in this case which in 1931 was the crime of the century. (The case enjoyed an unprecedented level of publicity and press which very nearly set the stage for the next \\"crime of the century - the Lindbergh kidnapping.) Admirers of Clarence Darrow, defender of the downtrodden, may be chagrined at Darrow's apparent lack of scruples in taking on these clients who readily admitted their guilt. And most Americans will be surprised to learn that the island paradise of Hawaii came close to being a police state.This book is a page turner, but also reflects a scholarly attention to historical nuance and detail. You may want to read it on the beach, but maybe not a beach in Hawaii."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"Although you'll probably find this book in the \\"True Crime\\" section of many bookstores, \\"Honor Killing\\" is far more than an account of an alleged rape, a murder, and two trials. Instead, Stannard provides a thorough grounding in Hawaiian social history--background without which the significance of this case would be incomprehensible. As Stannard summarizes in the notes, the Massie affair was \\"a pivotal moment in the history of Hawai'i, one that exposed a white supremacist social order both locally and nationwide.\\"The facts of the case are complicated; any summary necessarily reduces things to an entry in a police blotter. In 1931 Thalia Massie, wife of a Navy officer (and--this is oddly important--an impoverished relative of Teddy Roosevelt and of Alexander Graham Bell) claimed that she was raped by a gang of five Hawaiians. Almost immediately, five locals (not all of them were even Hawaiian) were rounded up, in spite of their fairly substantial and tight alibis. Their is little doubt that Massie was lying about her experience that night--whatever may have really happened--but the truth of the case became less important than the outrage of the white aristocrats of the island and their American military backers, who rushed to the defense of this young member of one of the nation's leading families.When the trial of the young men ended in a hung jury, Thalia's husband and her mother, along with two cohorts, conspired to kidnap and murder one of the accused assailants. During the ensuing circus, the remaining four men were locked up in a prison cell to ensure their \\"safety,\\" while the murder suspects were treated as celebrities by the local politicians and military authorities and given accommodations judged proper for their stations. Eventually, Clarence Darrow arrived to defend the \\"honor killing\\"--a performance that sullied his reputation among his usually left-leaning supporters.What's enviable about Stannard's book is his ability to take this case and transmit its page-turning essence while simultaneously describing the social history of the islands, recounting the alarmingly racist reaction by the mainland media (including, but not limited to, the Hearst newspapers), and conveying the importance of this case in transforming Hawaii's political structure. The retelling of the case itself is so effective that I was stunned by the outcome of the second trial--which is not what the reader is led to expect, but which is, ultimately, all the more shocking.One might argue that Stannard overstates the case's importance to the eventual overthrow of the white-dominated oligarchy--certainly there were other factors and events changing the social fabric (and the book touches on some of them). But it can not be in doubt that the Massie affair played a galvanizing role; in the short term, many of the organizers (particularly naval officials) on the \\"wrong\\" side lost their positions and had to leave the island, the ongoing attempt to militarize the islands failed, and the case helped to unite the previously quarrelling Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, and Portuguese communities. In the long term, some of the principals on the \\"correct\\" side of the case went on to play prominent roles in Hawaii's \\"Revolution of 1954\\"; it is not a coincidence that the territorial Senator William Heen was chief counsel for the defense of the five accused men.\\"Honor Killing,\\" then, is something of a marvel: it succeeds as a detective story, a political thriller, and a social history. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"I'm a 53 year old Hawaii-born Japanese American. Although I lived through the \\"Revolution of '54\\" I was too young to remember or care about it. I remember my dad telling me that when the Pulitzer prize winning author James A. Michener tried to buy a house in the exclusive Kahala district, he was denied because his wife was Japanese. And Dad would laugh when he told me that the only way a Japanese could get into the Pacific Club was through the back doorway to the kitchen. He'd always chuckle when he told me that, and I remember wondering what the Pacific Club was and what joke was about. The last of Hawaii's race-based restrictions were finally dissolving when I was a little kid, and I later just thought of them as archaic conventions fading under the benign light of modernity.The neighborhood our family moved into when I was 8 years old was definitely ethnically mixed, and although we never had haole (white) neighbors before, they were all very friendly and gracious, and all the kids played together and hung out at each other's houses. We went on to work and drink beer together, and in some cases marry and have kids together.But Hawaii hadn't always been like that. I studied a bit about our history in college, but I was a music major and more engrossed in the intricacies of Bach's contrapuntal masterworks than I was with something long gone and never to return. I was only distantly familiar with the Massie case, a sensational case about a Navy officers wife who claimed to have been gang raped by a bunch of locals, and the ensuing court proceeding and the murder of one of the locals.I decided to read David E. Stannard's \\"Honor Killing\\" out of a familiarity with him as an academician and socio-political commentator. I wandered around a bit in the History and Sociology aisles looking for the book before being directed to the True Crime section. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of the True Crime section of bookstores -- actually, I don't even like even being seen in the True Crime section. The books in this section always feature lurid pre- and post-mortem photos of unfortunate victims and shocking text detailing the terrible things going on within some psychotic's head. Okay, so I've actually read some True Crime. Thank God for online bookstores.I wondered what kind of book Stannard had written that would land his book in this kind of company. Thumbing through it, I discovered no bloody photos so I figured it was safe to take to the checkout counter. Once safely in the privacy of my own room, the book revealed itself to be a broad yet detailed picture of a pivotal event in Hawaii's history. And it's not ancient history here, it's set in a year only 20 years removed from my own birth chronologically, and still just down the block geographically.The book substitutes the True Crime genre's use of gory images and cheap psychological profiling with attention to detail and painstaking research. Although the Massie case has been the basis for a number of books, Honor Killing is the one where the author has thoroughly researched private and public archives, medical records, personal letters, court transcripts, and police reports. Stannard's scholarship and familiarity with Hawaiian history let him take these vast stacks of information and create a broad yet finely detailed picture of the era, an era when Hawaii was ruled by an arrogant white-supremacist oligarchy of corporate and military interests.The level of detail requires a long book -- the hardcover's text alone is 429 pages, and what may throw some readers is the lack of a straightforward \\"he was thinking this, then he did that\\" kind of narrative. But Stannard's method fits the breadth of the book's focus and its narrative is revealed in a series of carefully illuminated points.And as the book points out, it wasn't the light of modernity that made the old oligarchy fade away, it was the focused and relentless struggle of some brave (and perhaps foolhardy) people. At once enraging and encouraging, vivid and compelling -- it's a great read.Although this book may indeed be True Crime, I do hope that it will be able to move into a better neighborhood. Maybe next door to Michener's \\"Hawaii\\"?"},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"To be honest, I had never ever even heard of the bizarre and extremely unfortunate events that took place in the U.S. territory of Hawaii back in 1931 and 1932. But the truth is that the events depicted in David E. Stannard's \\"Honor Killing\\" would over time affect significant changes in attitudes about race relations, crime and punishment, and employer-worker relations not only on the islands, but throughout the nation as well.\\"Honor Killing\\" tells the strange and sordid tale that came to be known as the \\"Massie Affair\\". Surely it was a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time for 5 young men of Asian and Hawaiian descent who were suddenly accused of perpetrating a gang rape on an \\"innocent\\" young white woman named Thalia Massie. Thalia was the wife of a young naval officer and when news of the alleged crime hit the newspapers all hell broke loose. In those days, Hawaii was a U.S. territory and was largely dominated by the Big Five, five corporations that controlled the lions share of economic activity. And for obvious reasons, there was also an extremely large U.S. military presence in the area. This was the \\"establishment\\" and these men had more than a passing interest in the outcome of the so-called \\"Massie Affair\\". And they would certainly not hesitate to use any means at their disposal to protect their interests. In the year or so that followed, the story would take any number of unexpected twists and turns. When a deadlocked jury failed to convict the five Asians and Hawaiians in the rape trial, members of Thalia's family decided it was time to take matters into their own hands. What would transpire as a result of their actions will likely infuriate and sicken you.Author David Stannard has done a superb job in piecing together this complex and remarkable story. The book is extremely well written and equally well researched. \\"Honor Killing: How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawaii\\" just might be the best book I have read this year.

Even though I knew how it turned out, before I opened the cover for the first time. \`Honor Killing' is so very well written and very well researched, that you really get a feel for time and place and people---many appalling people.Bryan Burrough, coauthor of \`Barbarians at the Gate' and author of \`Public Enemies,' says it best in his back-cover blurb: \\"First-rate history that works as true-crime thriller and as a social and political history. Few books make me genuinely angry, but this one did.\\"Anger is justified at the incredible miscarriage of justice portrayed in this true story. Injustice, both criminal and social. Stannard paints a wrenching picture of the insidious effects of the waning white / military colonialism that beset the Territory of Hawaii during the first half of the twentieth century, and of its impact on real people and cultures.And no people, unfortunately, were more real, too real, than that sorrowful, despicable excuse for a young woman: Thalia Massie. I'm not one to ever applaud suicide, but I could truly wish that hers had come some thirty years sooner. What a waste of a person. And I can't think too much more kindly of her mom.Recommendation: \`A riveting, page-turner' (says the Chicago tribune): For all who enjoy their reading real, up-close and personal.Also recommended, with reference to this same tragedy: \`Rape in Paradise,' by Theon Wright; \`Honolulu' a novel by Alan Brennert; and \`The Massie Affair: American Experience' a PBS Home Video, available from Netflix.George E.

It is based on the true story of the alleged rape of a white woman by a group of young Hawaiian men; the kidnapping of and murder plot against one of them; and the legal entanglements that followed. The story reads like a novel, with characters like Admiral Stirling, the head of the Navy establishment; Raymond \\"Boss\\" Coll, Editor of Honololu's most influential newspaper; and Clarence Darrow , the famed advocate for the defendant in the Scopes monkey trial. Stannard examines the social interaction between the Native Hawaiian population and the white \\"haole\\" business leaders who called the political shots and dominated the economy. Stannard backs up his engaging writing style with thorough research based on contemporary accounts and interviews with people intimately familiar with the case.In many ways, the issues raised in the Massie Case: elitism; paternalism; isolationism and racism... foreshadowed the Hawaiian Statehood and Independence movement a quarter century later. ****Stars Philip W. Henry/ Rialto, CA"},{"Title":"Honor Killing : How the Infamous \\"Massie Affair\\" Transformed Hawai'i","review":"This is a story that deserves to be told and remembered, in the islands and on the mainland. America in the late 20's and early 30s was, as David Stannard points out, very much a racist nation, and its racist values reached out far into the Pacific Ocean. Stannard does a credible job of putting the Massie affair into context, explaining how Hawaii had become a haole-dominated quasi-colonial oligarchy with racial stratification that relegated its original inhabitants to the bottom of the pile. His research into the alleged gang rape of Thalia Massie, the subesquent trials of the five local defendants and of the four accused murderers of one of them, seems to be comprehensive and Stannard's narrative of all of the events making up the \\"Massie Affair\\" makes for compelling reading.There are, however, factual errors and some logical leaps in \\"Honor Killing\\" that cast doubt on Stannard's standards of research. His description of the Arizona towns where HonoluluAdveriser editor Raymond Coll worked before coming to the islands is not accurate. Bisbee is NOT a border town, nor did it flourish briefly at the turn of the century \\"because of the nearby copper mines at Clifton and Morenci.\\" Bisbee and Douglas are located a far distance away from Clifton and Morenci - two counties distant, to be specific, and Bisbee was itself the location of several of the largest and most productive copper mines in the nation, Douglas served as the smelter site for Bisbee's mines and the regional headquarters for the Phelps Dodge Coproration. Sixty thousand Mexicans DID NOT work in Arizona's mines at the time - while Mexican laborers were allowed to work underground in some mining towns, including Clifton and Morenci, most mining camps in Arizona excluded Mexicans from working in the mines, or fromperforming any work other than the most menial of labor. In Bisbee, during the 1920s and 30s, the miners were mostly Cornish \\"Cousin Jacks\\" or Serbs - not immigrated Mexicans as Stannard would have us believe. The author's efforts to compare the socio-politcal-economic structure of early 20th century Arizona with that of Hawaii falls short as well - although each was dominated by white corporate interests and run like private fiefdoms (the 1917 kidnapping and deportation of 1000-plus striking miners at Bisbee is a good example of corporate arrogance and disdain for law in Arizona), the copper mines were not comparable to the Hawaiian plantations - minority laborers didn't vastly outnumber the white ruling class in Arizona as they did in Hawaii. What Stannard does is to unsuccessfully compare rotten apples with rotten oranges - evidence of slipshod research and/or preconceptions creeping into his work.Other evidence of sloppiness involves the author's frequent use of the term \\"Pentagon\\" when referring to the senior officers and bureaucracy of the Navy Department.The Pentagon wasn't constructed until the U.S. entered the Second World War, and unification of the military services under the Department of Defense didn't happen until after WWII.The author makes a weak case when he assigns the Massie Affair great weight in changing Hawaii's political and social structure. True, Hawaii's political complextion began changing in the 1932 election from solid Republican to a more equal mix of Democrat and Republican representation - but that change was reflective of a general shift in local, state and federal government throughout the U.S., as voters expressed their dissatisfaction with Republican leadership during the Great Depression. Other factors, such as the coming of age of American-born children of the immigrant plantation laborers, the weakening of the grip of the Big Five oligarchy during World War II when Hawaii was placed under martial law and the emergence of a large class of college-educated non-white locals (many of whom were veterans) who were conscious of their legitimacy as Americans and eager to enter into the political process, would seem to be of greater importance when explaining how a more racially egalitarian Hawaii came to be.But Stannard seems to be on very solid ground when describing the social conditions in pre-war Hawaii, the racism of the military personnel stationed there and the sensationalism of the local media and the media on the mainland. His descriptions of the events leading up to the trials and of the trials themselves are vivid and carefully constructed. Although the book has its flaws, Stannard does a decent job of telling the story."},{"Title":"The Many Lives of Benjamin Franklin","review":"This was a simple overview of Benjamin Franklin's life and his contributions to the United States. When Ben was born in Boston, his parents knew he was special because he was curious, had a sense of humor, and read a lot. He always tried different ways of doing things such as making paddles to swim faster and holding onto a kite while he swam so it could pull him. Ben was sent to live with his brother, James. James was a printer, so Ben wanted to learn to print also. Ben wrote letters for the newspaper without his brother's permission. When James discovered Ben's dishonesty, Ben decided to move to Philadelphia. Benjamin worked hard at printing until finally he bought his own shop. Benjamin married and had two children. His contributions to Philadelphia are tremendous, such as starting a reading club called Junto, starting the first free library, fire department, hospital and school, and even proved that lightning was electricity. Before Benjamin Franklin died at age 84, he helped free America through signing the Declaration of Independence and writing the Constitution of the United States."},{"Title":"The Many Lives of Benjamin Franklin","review":"How to sum up Benjamin Franklin: he was a statesman, author, printer, diplomat, inventor and probably much else (like humorist and librarian).And Aliki (Brandenburg) does a pretty good job of getting all of these things across to children which is why the previous reviewer and I have given this book 5 stars.The artwork is colorful and frequently in a cartoon-magazine sort of style. Besides the text there are pictures in which various characters have 'balloon' dialog with each other.Amazon doesn't give an age range, but I know that 5 is too young. While we greatly enjoyed Aliki's \\"Johnny Appleseed\\", this book was on a more sophisticated level. It is not so much that the text is complicated, but rather that so many of Franklin's activities don't make sense to a really small child.For example, electricity and diplomacy went right over my children's' heads. An example of text follows so that you can gage the reading level for yourself:\\"He had lots of his own ideas. Even at play, Ben was thinking.He liked to swim, and often tried different ways. Once he made paddles so he could go faster.Another time he was kite flying near a pond and had a brighter idea. He went for a swim holding onto the kite string. Just as he had hoped, the kite pulled him across the pond.\\"Five Stars. Colorful, cartoon-like drawings that most children should respond to. And though it is a good, beginning introduction to Benjamin Franklin's fantastic career, it might be over the heads of many young children.

I read this book just a year after planning my own wedding, I had repeated moments of identification with Schank's experience. I would have loved to have been given this book as a bride-to-be.Schank was a highly successful 30-year-old New York woman when she got engaged. She experienced a year of the tug of Bridezilla-ness despite her best efforts to keep her wedding plans in check. The became obsessed with her wedding colors despite her original plans to allow everyone to dress as they wished. She initially spurned registries and then became irritated with people who didn't believe in them. After laughing at the notion of Save the Date cards, Schank painstakingly hand-tied bows on hundreds of them, and was then crushed when they didn't garner effuse praise from the recipients. At some point, Schank succumbed to the belief in \\"My Day\\" and flew off the handle at vendors who refused alter their standard packages to meet her unique needs.In addition to her first-hand bride experience, Schank possesses research skills and an MFA in non-fiction writing, so she is supremely qualified to reflect on her experience with the modern bridal industry. She muses about the invention of the registry, about the social networking of wedding site The Knot, about the \\"once in a lifetime\\" mantra of the wedding industrial machine (spend the money, this is once in a lifetime), and about traditional Victorian etiquette versus the realities of modern life.Grammy serves as the perfect foil to all of Schank's wedding planning. Over the telephone, Schank has to repeatedly explain to her aged grandmother the wedding plans, the reasons behind traditions, and what she needs from her relatives. Schank's witty prose ties the story together well. One of my favorite passages is about the trickle of wedding gifts that start arriving after the invitations are mailed: \\"Other people called our parents and informed them that they didn't see anything on the registry they liked, and therefore wanted to know what else we might want. This was particularly confusing because the whole point of having a registry in the first place was so that people won't have to call you up and ask you what you want. In theory, everything you want is on the registry. And really, who cared if the gift-giver didn't like anything on the registry? It wasn't going to them ... People want to sent you something that they see as representative of their personality, even if their personality representation isn't necessarily something you want hanging around your house. You therefore must live with a butt-ugly set of ceramic dessert plates or a set of Judaic art depicting a Jewish bridge and groom in renaissance costume, as opposed to the really nice set of crystal highball glasses you spent several weeks hunting for.\\"The combination of personal experience, terrific research and historical perspective, and witty naration makes this memoir a surefire winner."},{"Title":"A More Perfect Union: How I Survived the Happiest Day of My Life","review":"This weddingland memoir takes the modern-day nuptial industry to task with a sense of humor and honesty that is unrelenting. By recounting her own experiences as a bride-to-be, Hana Schank illustrates how the \\"manufactured need\\" pawned by industry magazines, shops and web sites turns perfectly independent and cosmopolitan women (like her) into obsessive denizens of the commercial culture. The author's capacity for self-depreciation not only helps to illustrate wedding excesses and absurdities (she spends weeks tying fancy ribbons for her save-the-date cards), but it makes her a very likable companion for the book's 211 pages. This is a deft and entertaining read, whether you're married, single or somewhere in-between."},{"Title":"A More Perfect Union: How I Survived the Happiest Day of My Life","review":"Hana Schank channels both her inner Martha Stewart and her inner Larry David as she spends a year preparing for her \\"more perfect\\" wedding. As she chronicles her conversations with salespeople, extended family, and on-line confidents, she is honest about her naked reactions to the odd world surrrounding the bride-to-be. Her engaging writing chronicles the annoying, tasteless, and touching encounters that are the landmines on her path to the altar. In the end, she makes sense of these wedding traditions through her experience of the changing tides of family ties. Schank is not too hip to have a real wedding, but her wit, cynicism, and romanticism combine to produce an entertaining and emotional memoir."},{"Title":"A More Perfect Union: How I Survived the Happiest Day of My Life","review":"Schank puts into perspective the terrible difficulty young women face in both trying to be themselves and trying to fit into a world where women comment upon each choice other women make. Women have made great strides in the last decades in becoming equals to men, yet they continue to torture each other with minute details of how things need to be done and how one must behave. Schank makes you laugh until it hurts as she tells the story of her reluctant trip into weddingland. Anyone who is planning a wedding or who knows someone planning a wedding should definitely hurry and get this book."},{"Title":"A More Perfect Union: How I Survived the Happiest Day of My Life","review":"Hana Schank lives up to the promise of the subtitle (\\"How I Survived the Happiest Day of My Life\\") to her marriage memoir A More Perfect Union with humor, history, and a self-aware look at just how this modern, feminist-minded woman got caught up in everything from flower colors to save the date cards. \\"In just a few weeks they had become my new vital statistics,\\" Schank writes about the post-engagement facts of her life as strangers swarm her to find out every detail of her nuptials, her \\"Rosetta stone\\" of a ring blaring to anyone she meets that she is about to get married.Using her own foray onto wedding website The Knot's message boards and reading of wedding magazines as background, Schank proceeds to recount the ways the process getting married changed her, and what she learns about the wedding industry along the way. She's telling the story as both an observer and participant, going back and forth with facts she doles out about the corporate and cultural pressure on brides to how these intimately affected her.Schank talks about the things one isn't usually supposed to mention when it comes to the joy of weddings--namely divorce, baby pressure, the picking and choosing of religious traditions. She acknowledges the clashes she and her husband have over the wedding planning, such as his anger that he's not once asked his opinion about their flower choices.This is not simply a tirade against the wedding industry, or it would not be such a delight to read. Schank and her fianc&eacute; Steven are able to laugh at those around them--and themselves--pretending to shoot at each other with the scanner while adding to their registry, or joking on their way to retrieve her wedding dress:\\"I feel like I should be yelling at some imaginary kids back there or something,\\" I said.Steven turned his head to the back of the van. \\"Stop hitting your brother!\\" he yelled.I laughed. \\"Who wants to watch the Finding Nemo DVD again?\\" I asked the backseat.What becomes crystal clear from page one is how much of their wedding planning is not only inclusive of, but dependent on, their families, from what to wear during the wedding weekend softball game to how Schank's divorced and divisive parents will be able to come together. Reading her final chapter, in which her fiance's brother gets a concussion during the softball game and various mishaps occur, I certainly teared up when Schank's parents join her to walk down the aisle, adding a blissful conclusion to the often-stressful weekend. \\"And right then I realize that this was the moment I planned the entire wedding for. If weddings are about fantasies, then this was mine: I wanted my family back together again, even if it was for a few fleeting seconds. And right then, as I bask in the warmth of my family, it is all worth it. The months of tears and obsession and ribbon and Martha Stewart. It is all worth it.\\"These sentences show that while her marriage is, in large part, about, as the rabbi tells Schank, \\"sovereignty,\\" an us-against-the-world partnership between the bride and groom, in many other ways it is about joining two people, and two (or more) families, about the negotiations and compromises Schank and her relatives and her fianc&eacute; and his relatives all have to make to create this \\"happiest day\\" of her life.Her final chapter, a post-script about the reactions to her book from various sides of the wedding world, is the most illuminating. Schank concludes that even so-called \\"bridezillas\\" don't think they're any more wedding-obsessed than anyone else, and even though she has herself marveled at why anyone could care so passionately about ribbon, she emerges with a sympathetic attitude toward brides of all stripes. When Schank writes about her feminist critics that, \\"It makes it easy for people to tell you you're not being the right kind of girl,\\" she could be writing about any number of female realms, from mothering to sex work to bikini waxes to breast implants, in which women's choices are debated and attacked with viciousness. This isn't a how-to book (or a how-not-to book), but I'd imagine that many prospective brides and grooms will enjoy and learn from Schank's story, or at least have someone to commiserate with.What makes this book special is that it's both a laugh- and cry-out-loud memoir, and an insider's look at the ways wedding hype has descended on Americans, particularly New Yorkers. Schank is smart enough to know when she's being manipulated, but it's her very awareness, sharpened by historical facts long with the very modern reality of one-bride-upsmanship and the quest for perfection in every area, even as she goes through the process of being (sometimes) swept away, that adds depth to A More Perfect Union."},{"Title":"A More Perfect Union: How I Survived the Happiest Day of My Life","review":"Here is the story of a 30 year old NYC writer and how she navigated the terrors of the wedding industry to plan her Big Day. I was really enjoying this book for a time. She put dumb, restrictive expectations and traditions under the microscope and researched where they came from and what they really mean. Fascinating! I was under the impression that she was going to end up telling us about a wedding that didn't use any of the elements that she kept saying she didn't care about or didn't like. And the moral of the story would be that the whole thing didn't have to be so stressful and impersonal as she was making most weddings sound.Nope. In the end she ends up acting just like the women on Knot.com that she had been making fun of just a few chapters earlier. She went crazy nutso over flowers (something she'd said she couldn't care less about), color schemes, apples... It was very disappointing to read about her turning into the bridezilla she had dreaded. Her conclusion was that all of the fighting, crying, stroke-having was worth it because it really was the best, most perfect day EVER! It was just kind of sad that she kept talking about how she didn't care about so many of the things that traditional weddings need to have, but she was supposed to care, so she did care. She even said that her future husband didn't care either, but he didn't have to because he was a guy. Because future husbands obviously have nothing to do with weddings.

Hana Schank will take you step-by-step through all that one goes through when venturing down this path.For the bride and groom, Hana's book will help you think through many of the important decisions that one needs to make in wedding planning (location), as well as to help you to decide which trivial details you may choose to avoid without regret (the city of the postage cancellation on the invitations.)If you will be attending a wedding anytime soon, Hana's book really will help you to appreciate all the excruciating fine-tuned detail that goes into planning a wedding. (Don't complain if there's no cake, there's a dessert bar and there's a reason for that, that's what the bride and groom wanted!)Personally, what I really liked about the book is that it gives some explanation and history about certain wedding traditions to help you put into perspective those ideas which you may want to preserve and those that you may want to drop. Hana also encourages people to be creative at their wedding, even if they are breaking tradition.Best of all, Hana describes all of this with her great sense of dry humor as she describes the various characters and situations she is confronted with while dutifully attending to weddingland antics.Hana is definitely a non-traditionalist. As a reader, I felt sympathetic to Hana while trying to buck convention on various wedding traditions. However, we realize that even the staunchest of people can get caught up in the pressure of the media, and our guests expectations in dictating to us 'how a wedding should be.'

With the issue of a new book coming out this month, June, 2008, I thought I would read this one prior to receiving the new one.In February, 2000, according to Mr. A.D. Harvey the BBC placed this battle among military blunders on their TV program, GREAT MILITARY BLUNDERS. The author thinks it \\"would not be true to label it\\" so, and states that opinion on page 52 of this book. And though I have read this book with enjoyment, I cannot disagree with his point of view, for (in the author's book) as General John Hackett answered when asked when he knew Market-Garden would be a disaster, he answered, 'Before it began'. I'm afraid General Hackett was far wiser than Generals Montgomery, R. E. Urquhart, or even Eisenhower. For after reading several books on Arnhem and Market-Garden it is difficult for me to understand why this ill chosen plan was ever implemented.But since we were itching to jump into the Ruhr, and having many false ideas based on wishful thinking that the Germans were finished, we ignored many danger signs that should have kept us from this folly. And considering the later Battle of the Bulge, it can be quickly seen we still were blindly underestimating the capabilities of the German war machine. One interesting fact that the author brings to surface here, too, is the appearance of the Germans knowing we were coming and were waiting prepared for us. He does try to debunk or defuse that thinking. However, I think the Germans did seem almost too prepared and too far knowing concerning this battle. While on page 63 the author mentions the \\"daily\\" bulletins the German Heeresgruppe B (Army Group B) issued warning of both the allied buildup of troops and a suggested route of their attack. Again, though he states that informer Christian Lindemans did not tip off the Germans, this reader has to wonder.I do agree with the author in the 'main' that too much information of import was overlooked, and too many people who said things not wanting to be heard were either ignored or reassigned, with one officer being sent on leave due to his mental condition. And though I think the world of Ike, where was his thinking considering the German armor that was documented by photo recon, the same armor people said either did not exist or was to badly damaged to be of use. In this one thing especially, as Stepen Ambose later mentioned, Ike was very much mistaken.To sum up, this is a very readable book and if read by someone having read other books on this battle it is a fine book. I would not, however, want this one to be the only book on this subject on my library shelf. As another reviewer states, the book has a fine array of pictures and is laid out in a very professional manner. But two other books are needed to round out this study: A BRIDGE TOO FAR by Ryan and IT NEVER SNOWS IN SEPTEMBER: THE GERMAN VIEW OF MARKET-GARDEN AND THE BATTLE OF ARNHEM, SEPTEMBER, 1944. I have both of these books and will soon add the newer volume from Casement publishing this month: MAGNIFICENT DISASTER: THE FAILURE OF THE MARKET GARDEN, THE ARNHEM OPERATION, SEPTEMBER 1944.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Arnhem","review":"This is a well-written addition to the extensive literature on the battle of Arnhem.

So, this is strictly from memory. What I remember about the book is that from the book I acquired this \\"insightful idea\\" : that as we learn our own culture we become a \\"prisoner\\" of our ONE culture. We become a prisoner because we only know ONE culture. If we only know ONE culture we have \\"no choice\\" but to \\"live and think\\" WITHIN that ONE culture. But, if we know two or three or twenty cultures we can then \\"free\\" outselves from living and thinking and perceiving in ONE way. We will then have choices BETWEEN more than one way of life, we will have choices between more than one way of thinking and we will have choices between more than one way of perceiving the world. The knowledge of more than one culture gives us \\"more freedom\\" of choice. Thus we cease to be \\"a prisoner of culture\\". We become somewhat of an \\"overman\\" because we are \\"free to choose\\" among many cultural possibilities that people with only ONE culture cannot. And, we can become a \\"participant observer\\" among many cultures. We can choose how to live, perceive, and think among many more possibilities which gives us \\"more freedom\\" of action. This \\"insight\\" has freed me to choose \\"the best\\" aspects among many cultures thus enriching my life and giving me more choices about how to live my life. If this book does the same for you, then it has served its purpose. I recommend the book because of the \\"cultural freedom\\" you may acquire from reading it.

The structure of the book is at once so simple, so compact, and so sharply outlined, that it never fails to impress the reader by its analytical rigor and logical coherence. The study of three sharply contrasting cultures--the Zuni Pueblos of New Mexico, the natives of Dobu in Melanesia, and the Indian tribes (mostly the Kwakiutl) of the American Northwest coast--form the core chapters of the book. They are bracketed by three introductory chapters and two concluding essays. The opening part insists on the role of custom in shaping human behavior, the diversity of cultural traits, and the coherence of a culture brought about by a dominating principle. The last two chapters make a plea for cultural relativism and for tolerance towards individuals who do not fit into the dominant social pattern.The diversity of cultures and the coherent pattern that they form are presented as the core message of anthropology. The argument is made stronger by references to other social sciences and by powerful metaphors. According to Benedict, all the possible human behaviors are distributed along a great \\"arc\\" which covers the whole range of possible cultural traits. Each culture then select along this arc a configuration of human possibilities that fits its environment and forms a coherent whole. The analogy here is with language and linguistics: \\"In cultural life as it is in speech, selection [from the inventory of physically available possibilities] is the prime necessity\\"--and capsulated in the famous Digger Indian proverb that serves as epigraph to the book: \\"In the beginning God gave to every people a cup of clay and from this cup they drank their life.\\" Another analogy is with psychology and medical science. The dominant pattern of each culture is compared to the categories used in psychiatry to classify human behavior. Schizophrenia, hysteria, and manic depression are not a bundle of disconnected traits, they form a coherent whole and allows the physician to make an informed diagnosis. Similarly, \\"self-torture here, head-hunting there, prenuptial chastity in one tribe and adolescent licence in another, are not a list of unrelated facts, each of them to be greeted with surprise wherever it is found or wherever it is absent.\\" A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.Each tribal society or primitive culture can thus be understood by its constitutive formula. As the author succinctly states at the beginning of each case presentation, the Zuni are \\"a ceremonious people\\"; the Dobuans are \\"lawless and treacherous\\"; and the Kwakiutl are \\"a people of great possessions\\". Each central chapter develops this fundamental principle stated at the outset, based on observations collected by prominent ethnographers--Franz Boas for the Kwakiutl, Reo Fortune for The Sorcerers of Dobu (and Bronislaw Malinowski for their neighbors of the Trobriand islands), and Ruth Benedict herself, as well as various sources, for the Pueblo Indians. The generalization about a culture's organizing principle emerges from careful observation, which should not be biased by hypothesis, thesis, or theory. There is a fine division of labor between the field worker and the armchair anthropologist. Benedict wants the fieldworker to be \\"faithfully objective\\": \\"He must chronicle all the relevant behavior, taking care not to select according to any challenging hypothesis the facts that will fit a thesis.\\" The anthropologist then rearranges this empirical material along theoretical lines. In a process of inference, he detects patterns and regularities in the observed behaviors and customs. In order to grasp the meaning of a culture as a whole, he first has to immerse himself into a sea of rites and practices, of myths and beliefs. But he also dwells in the realm of high theory, and he draws general lessons from his observations.Another way to express the dominant pattern of a culture is provided by the book's author through the categories of Dyonisian, Apollinian, and paranoid cultures. The Dionysian/Apollonian dichotomy is taken from Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy--and from Oswald Spengler, who substituted Dionysian with Faustian--, while the reference to the paranoid pattern of behavior is borrowed from Freud. The \\"will to superiority\\" which characterizes Kwakiutl culture could be linked back to the same authors. These categories were in the zeitgeist when Patterns of Culture was written, and the reference to literary works or to critical theory gives a cachet of intellectual sophistication to the description of primitive rites and customs.Like the social character of the Pueblos, Patterns of Culture is an Apollonian work, built around symmetries and written in a dispassionate tone. Upon closer examination however, this well-ordered structure shatters, and cracks appear in the edifice. There are contradictions between the bracketing chapters and the substantive part. In fact, Benedict doesn't fulfill the program she sets forth in the opening chapters, and she spends the last chapters dismantling it. The three monographs are self-standing and could well be read in isolation from the other chapters. But when replaced in the book context, they are at variance with the general messages formulated by Benedict. The appeal to tolerance and the celebration of cultural diversity (\\"the equally valid patterns of life\\" mentioned in the closing sentence of the book) are contradicted by the cruel and wicked ways of the Dobuans, or by the belief, shared by all tribal societies, that only their members are fully human while non-members are rejected outside the purview of humanity.There is a sense of jubilation, of perverse sadism even, by which Benedict describes the self-tortures that the Plain Indians inflicted upon themselves in their Dionysian quest for delirious visions. \\"They cut strips from the skin of their arms, they struck off fingers, they swung themselves from tall poles by straps inserted under the muscle of their shoulders. They went without food and water for extreme periods.\\" Similarly, she insists on the wickedness of the Dobuans that manifests itself in all their social institutions: in marriage and conjugal life, in agriculture techniques, in religious ceremonies and magic rites, in economic exchange, in death and burial rituals. \\"All existence is cut-throat competition, and every advantage is gained at the expense of a defeated rival.\\" People are all the more treacherous that \\"in ordinary converse the Dobuan is suave and unctuously polite\\".Apart from the question whether what Benedict describes really was true--and some descriptions seem to be marked by the seal of fiction--, we may note that the three cultures presented in the book were by no means stable and self-sufficient. As the last of the Digger Indians remarks, \\"our cup is broken now\\". The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico were just a shadow of their former selves. They had abandoned their walled cities and troglodyte housings long before the arrival of the white man, and were surviving on strips of desert. One may suspect that their formalistic insistence on rituals and ceremony, counting the number of feathers in their masks, was somehow directed towards the ethnographer, and for the tourists that were to follow in his path. Their culture was on the way to commodification, and would soon transform into empty forms destined for outside consumption. The Pacific Northwest Indians didn't even have this chance: by the time of Benedict's writing, their culture had already disappeared, and was only known through past observations. There was certainly a bent towards self-destruction in the gigantic potlatch and bonfires of the vanities that served as a substitute for war and exchange. Where intellectuals like Marcel Mauss or Georges Bataille, impressed by the descriptions of Franz Boas, saw the logic of a gift economy or the accursed share of culture, we may detect the last sparkles of a civilization consuming itself. As for the wicked sorcerers of Dobu, we know less about their highly dysfunctional culture, but one may detect they learned part of their treacherous ways from the white man, who tried to allure them into indentured labor.The claim that primitive cultures are \\"laboratories\\" in which the problems are set in simpler terms than in complex societies raises the question of what is really being tested in these labs: if even simple experiences on a small scale such as Dobu Island leads to such grotesque failure, then one can be pessimistic about the fate of our complex societies, where problems are compounded by size and scope. But Benedict's point in describing the bizarre developments of behaviors in alien cultures is to emphasize the queerness of our own. She practices the art of extravagant otherness as self-critique. If the Pueblos are formalistic, the Dobuans mean and treacherous, and the Kwakiutl ostentatious to the extreme, don't we all share these proclivities? The whole enterprise of describing these cultures, in three chapters absolutely crammed with detailed material of the most curious sort--Zuni passage rites, Kwakiutl chants, Dobuan residence arrangements--is informed with concerns rather close to home. The author focuses on topics that were of particular salience to contemporary Americans: marriage and divorce (the later being seen as a normal development), adolescence and entry into adulthood (reference is made to the \\"prevalence of the petting party\\" among young Americans), conformism and conspicuous consumption (\\"keeping up with the Joneses\\"). In the end, anthropology is seen as a moral science, and the detour through other cultures as a way to adjust our moral compass to new coordinates. Looking forward, Benedict writes, with a touch of optimism: \\"It is probable that social orders of the future will carry their tolerance and encouragement of individual difference much further than any culture of which we have experience.\\""},{"Title":"Patterns of Culture","review":"Very, very easy to digest.

While this book is considered to be a classic work in anthropology, doesn't mean that it is easy or enjoyable to read.Benedict wrote this book with multiple writing styles that made it seem like the individual chapters were disjointed from one another. In chapters where she was not writing about what she knew like the introduction, she uses a very rigid, academic, jargon filled style that was near impossible to read even for an anthropology student. I had to read the first chapter four times to get anything out of it. Then you have the second chapter which is a contrasts with the style of the first chapter because it becomes more like prose with almost a poetic quality in portions especially when she tells the story about how the cup is broken.There is a lot of really good insight about the way culture was studied in the 1930s, and its also provides readers with a deeper understanding of Benedict herself, but there are some portions of the book that you just have to dig through and carry on."},{"Title":"Patterns of Culture","review":"To put it bluntly, this book is garbage. The language is so dry and the tone of the anthropologist so condescending, it makes one picture Ms. Benedict smoking a pipe in an armchair of a library somewhere.This book should come under fire because Benedict let others do much of the research for her. This is a theme revisited in many of her works (i.e. &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;). She received much flack for it, as well she should.

The National Museum of Antiquities in Cairo is probably the most famous museum in the world. It has an extensive collection. &quot;Lets Go&quot; breaks down every room and serves as a useful guide. Egypt is a amazing destination and on every trip there I have experienced a warm welcome from the people. While bustling Cairo is what most tourists first see don't miss the smaller towns along the Nile in the &quot;Upper Kingdom&quot; between Aswan and Luxor. The sprawling temple of Karnak and the smaller but still impressive temple of Luxor are situated at Luxor, Egypt. The Temple of the Sun at Abu Simbel is a very short plane ride from Aswan, Egypt. At Aswan don't miss the Temple of Isis on Philae and do return some evening for the Sound and Light show. Let's Go will serve as a detailed companion to these and many other wonders. I was amazed at the level of detail and how up to date the book was. I believe Egypt is still a safe destination and found security for tourists to be a top priority. I do recommend a tour with Nile cruise especially for the first timer and even for seasoned travelers. You get a an excellent package including hotels, some meals (full board on Nile cruises), all outside cabin state-rooms, transportation, escorts that save you lots of hassle, wonderful guides that illuminate the past and usually, new friends to share it with.

The bo is nearly universally the first weapon form that practitioners learn yet there aren't a lot of really good books out there teaching people how to use one. Even a great book is no substitute for a competent instructor, of course, yet it can be a great supplement to dojo training. This one is fairly general, hence more broadly useful than some style-specific works, and pretty well done. Despite the fact that the layout is logical and the writing is quite good it is, unfortunately, a 30-year-old work with dark, grainy pictures that are a bit challenging to read. Contents include history of the bo staff, profiles of kobudo masters, types of bo staffs, bo basics (holding the staff, warm-up exercise, fighting positions), kihon (basics), striking, thrusting, blocking, combinations, applications, and basic bo kata.

I found a lot of inspiration looking at these designs, and the photography is mostly great.BUT, you really don't need to buy this particular book. I suggest Minimalist Houses over this particular collection because it has a lot more variety, and greater international representation (eg. you'll see more from Germany, Sweedan, the U.S. and Japan) for about the same price. Minimalist Spaces is a nice book, but read it the store as an appetizer for Minimalist Houses, if minimalism appeals to you. Some people are uncomfortable with minimalism, and there are plenty of books and designs for you too :)."},{"Title":"Minimalist Spaces: Commercial and Residential","review":"The materials in Minimalist Spaces are thoughtfully selected from broad range around the world.

In addition, if what all these people are saying is true, then half the American population should be dead. Period. There is no way a human being should be able to live eating the typical American diet of junk food and very little fruits/veggies, smoking, drinking, etc.There is health-promoting info in here, however, but that is just basic common sense: Eat more fruits/veggies, drink more water, and cut down on meats and alcahol, etc. Because of that, I'll give it a decent rating, but don't expect to find any hard answers in this, or any other book of its kind."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"Although the concept probably has merit, you wouldn't know it to read this book.

Plain and simple it is a scam."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"Not a fun read. It did not keep my interest at all. I wish I purchased another book with the same topic with more \\"UMPH!\\""},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"I am reviewing the ninth edition (2006) of Dr. Baroody's book, Alkalize or Die. Dr. Baroody's book has helped me understand the relationship between acid-forming foods and alkaline-forming foods, yet I must say it required some level of discernment to sift the wheat from the chaff.One of the positive features to Dr. Baroody's approach to healthful living is his recognition of each person's unique biochemistry. Throughout this book he continues to remind his readers that each person is an individual and therefore might experience variant results when compared to other people.It is important to understand that Dr. Baroody's theories and principals are based as largely on his personal alternative health experiences (trial and error) as they are on any demonstrable medical science. It is also important to know that Dr. Baroody gives much credence to the metaphysical teachings of eastern spiritualism, which may be a detractor to some readers. In the book's introduction, Dr. Baroody writes, \\"My viewpoint is founded on ancient Hindu, Chinese, Tibetan, and Greco-European healing philosophies and on several great modern men in the field of health.\\" One of these \\"great modern men\\" is Edgar Cayce, who is referenced as an authority many times throughout the book.So long as the reader is a proponent of New Age and/or Eastern spiritualism, this book should be quite acceptable. For those of us who are more Western in their worldview, the book requires discernment to pick and choose what you care to take from it.An example of how Dr. Baroody's metaphysical beliefs influence his dietary advice can be seen in his counsel for reducing the consumption of red meat: \\"The destructive emotion of slaughter is assimilated by the person who eats flesh.\\" (pg. 63). For many, this statement might resonate well with their worldview, but for others this statement will likely be challenged as to it's applicability to the subject of acidity/alkalinity.Dr. Baroody's experience in the alternative health field appears to be quite extensive. No doubt he has learned a lot from published medical research and other practitioners, yet much of what he proposes in this book is admittedly derived from his own experience; some of which he still doesn't fully understand himself (for example, read chapter 4 on the \\"Vagus Nerve\\"). Those readers who are looking for a book filled with footnotes and documented scientific research will be disappointed with this work.What I found most helpful in the book is Dr. Baroody's exhaustive list of foods with a corresponding rating as to their alkaline-forming or acid-forming properties. Dr. Baroody abandons the conventional 0-7-14 pH scale in favor of a scale he developed to measure alkaline-forming and acid-forming foods. Dr. Baroody's scale (pg. 38) ranges from 0.5 to 7.5. All foods below 4.0 are acid-forming and all foods above 4.0 are alkaline-forming.The chart I refer to above is alone worth the price of the book. Depending on the readers religious and scientific convictions, the rest of the book may or may not be appreciated."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"This book is my Salvation.

It describes the fundamentalimbalance of the pH factor and the differential impact on awhole host of disease processes. The ideal diet should containa fair amount of foods in the alkaline category. Too muchacidity has been associated with many chronic conditions anddiseases. The pH level may stabilize at approximately 5.5to 7.0 on a scale of 0-14 with 0-7 being the acid foodsand 7 or more being the alkaline foods. Our daily dietshould consist of an optimal balance of the acid/alkalinefoods. The Baroody work describes this pH balance in considerabledetail. As such, it is a necessary part of the overallnutritional program for both children and adults.The standard diet of junk food tends to create a pH biaswhich is acidic rather than a representative balance ofacid and alkaline food groups. This aspect is further developedin the book.

Four years ago I was diagnosed with Bi-polar and obsesive compulsive dissorder. Later on I also found out that I had ADD. I could no longer consentrate or live. I resorted to taking street drugs for relief. I was a &quot;Macdonald's eater&quot;, eating 90% acid forming food a day.Three months ago I ended up in the hospital with something the doctors called total body failure. My bowels were irregular, my left side had doubled in size, i lost 30 pounds in two weeks, was having panic attacks, developped symptoms of Parkenson's, my kidney's had infection in them, severe acid reflux, etc.Then I began seeing a homeopath who saved my life. She gave me natural herbs that calmed my mind from the ADD &amp; regulated my panic attacks. She also gave me this book.Now three months later, I can walk around freely where as I couldn't get out of bed before. I enjoy life for once and find no need for the massive consumption of drugs, cigarettes, alcohol as before. I'm closer to God and love my-self more than I thought possible. I look forward to life and thank those who opened my eyes to it.This book will save your life. Keep in mind, I'm only 18 years old."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"This is a great book. It talks about the chemistry in foods but it sometimes ties this in with homeopathic ideas.For example when you eat meat you may be affected by the fear that the animal experienced when it was killed. I eat meat but yet there probably is some truth to this.This book makes a bold statement: white sugar is a poison.But I think this is true. I used to eat tons of cupcakes and other things and really my stomach had never really been healthy for many years.I think other sweeteners such as high fructose corn syrup are also poisonous.These sweeteners are very pervasive in the American diet.Interestingly you can find natural candy and soft drink in health food stores. These are made with RAW sugar and other natural ingredients.Something you have to watch out for is a product will say 'all natural' or 'organic sugar' on it but it still contains processed sugar. Organic sugar can still be processed I think.Also beware of so called 'sugar free' candy and things like this. These contain the sugar alcohols which are very bad.Some things that are sold as food in modern society are really more like chemicals. Those artificial lunches that they want kids to bring to school come to mind. This stuff doesn't even have to even be refridgerated.Another book which is a great follow on to Alkalize Or Die is:The Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health: Restore Your Health by Creating Balance in Your Diet (Paperback)by N.D., Christopher VaseyI originally heard about these books in one of the ARE's catalogs.The ARE is Edgar Cayce's organization (Association For Research And Enlightenment).Baroody mentions Edgar Cayce's statement that anyone who eat a few almonds every day and doesn't forget \\"need never fear cancer\\". Cayce also said that doing this will prevent skin blemishes.I just wanted to mention also that when I removed white sugar from my diet I no longer tested positive for being allergic to grasses, trees, molds, and ragweed. I know because I was tested for allergies before and after I stopped eating white sugar. It attacks and weakens the immune system and causes allergies and colds.Jeff MarzanoSugar in the Raw Raw Sugar, 24-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal, Traditional, 28-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)The Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health: Restore Your Health by Creating Balance in Your Diet"},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"I love this book because it's universal.

I've only had the flu once since 1998 and did not require hospitalization.From this book I learned that I can instantly stop an acid reflux attack by adding a little bicarbonate of soda to some water and drinking it down. It works because your stomach contents are immediately changed from acidic to alkaline for a short period, relieving the pain. Aspirin can also change our bodies from acid to alkaline temporarily,and I have wondered if that is why it is such a miracle drug.In this book you learn that disease cannot flourish in an alkaline environment. There are clear instructions for monitoring the level of acidity in your body and taking steps to increase alkalinity when needed. There is a handy list of foods and their relative alkalinity and acidity as well as other helpful visuals.It also includes the following; shopping list, meal plan, recipe section for all levels of skill, dealing with denial and feeling deprived, sections of how acidity and alkalinity affect our daily lives, a complete index including specific ailments.For those with an interest in the chemistry of acidity/alkalinity, there is a chart of the elements.I had polio and multiple bouts of strep throat and rheumatic fever as a child. I've had a problem with swallowing and choking since the polio, and for years suffered from an enlarged heart with a damaged valve.

This stuff is not rocket science, but with the level of misinformation, corporate food propaganda and misplaced skepticism we are unfortunately bombarded with every single day, you would think it is.The message I took away from this excellent little book, which I already suspected was true based on my own personal experience, is this: 95%+ of fruits and vegetables have an alkalizing (i.e., healing) effect on your body. 100% of meats, dairy products and ESPECIALLY man-made so-called \\"food products\\" have an acidifying (i.e., draining) effect on your body. Combine that with the fact that many external factors, such as emotional stress and physical exertion, also have an acidifying effect on your body as well, and you are looking at the reality that we must consume far more fruits and vegetables than animal proteins in order to maintain optimal health. And it goes without saying that man-made chemical garbage--e.g., aspartame--has no place in our diets whatsoever.Anyone who has an issue with these undeniable facts can take it up with our evolutionary ancestors--their eating habits are what determined, as homo sapiens, what our ideal diet is today. I was especially surprised by the ignorance of one so-called \\"debunking\\" website, run by someone who claims to have a degree in chemistry, that claimed that our body regulates its pH completely on its own through \\"exhaling carbon dioxide.\\" I personally don't need any 'scientific' proof for this theory because I have lived it, as a guinea pig, from unwittingly consuming nothing but acidifying foods and feeling 30 years older than my actual age with frequent bizarre health problems without having any clue what the heck was wrong with me, to consuming mostly alkalizing foods and feeling like a kid again, both mentally and physically, within a matter of weeks. Just giving up coffee alone (extremely acidifying) I noticed my vitality skyrocket. I recommend that you get this book and start today."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"I wonder how true this...your stomach has a very acid environment to protect us and to help digest food. Then the food goes into the small intestine where the body makes an alkaline environment (using bile etc). All the digestion products then go to the liver for more processing. Also the human blood stream is kept at pH 7.35-7.45 via complex buffering (bicarbonate ion etc).Also, the kidneys remove excess acids of alklaline substances. So is it truethat we must eat alkaline when the body is both acid and alkaline inside?"},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"If you're looking for a new religion, or want to read about how to live to be 200 years old, Alkalize or Die might be the book for you.

The author and his seemingly impressive and extensive \\"credentials\\", on the other hand, are somewhat misleading.What appears to be genuine and traditional schooling comes to the author from the Western Carolina University, where he received a B.S. in Psychology, and a Masters in Educational Counseling in 1974 and 1976; and perhaps the D.C. degree he earned in 1981 from Life University - College of Chiropractic.What is sketchy are those degrees that afford him the most credibility: the N.D. from Clayton School of Naturopathy in 1991, and the PhD in Nutrition from the American Holistic College. Clayton College of Natural Health (Naturopathy) appears to be an easy admission, short-term, online \\"degree mill\\" college that describes their Doctorate level completion as follows:\\"A degree from Clayton College can provide personal enrichment, professional growth for an ongoing career, or the foundation for a holistic health or nutrition consulting practice.\\"This falls quite short the scope of a Doctorate level education from one of the four Naturopathic Medicine colleges in the United States with accreditation from The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (C.N.M.E.), the only accrediting body recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Clayton is, rather, accredited by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners and the American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board. Both are private accrediting associations designed to meet the needs of non-traditional education (the schools) and are not affiliated with any government agency or recognized by the Dept. of Education. Furthermore, Clayton does not and can not award an ND. What they can award, as listed on their website, is a CTN: Certified Traditional Naturopath for graduates of any \\"doctoral\\" program; and a CNW: Board Certified in Nutritional Wellness for graduates of the Master of Science in Holistic Nutrition program or Ph.D. program. So Theodore Baroody saying he \\"completed an ND from Clayton...\\" does not of itself make him an ND. And since, conveniently, Clayton titles their courses with \\"Doctor of Naturopathy\\", etc., it is easy to mislead. The same is true for his PhD earned at the American Holistic College-Clayton's sister online college. Nuff said.I hesitated in writing this review because as a person about to about to embark on an ND from the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, OR, and as a person on a mission to play some small role in the rescue of us all from the disease that is modern medicine (that was dramatic, I know, but I believe that modern medicine should be secondary and small in comparison to naturopathic healing and prevention), I wasn't sure I wanted to employ the kind of slanderous tactics certain organizations and individuals within the medical and drug industry like to employ to, in a sense, kill the growing competition of naturopathic alternatives. Truthfully, despite his misleading credentials, I wouldn't have written this review...if he wasn't selling products! If he was just passing along good information I'd have just been glad someone was doing it! Anyone! Everyone? ...But this guy is using half the alphabet after his name in what seems to me a mere platform to earn credibility in order to sell...stuff! And that sounds too much to me like the tactics of the ol' drug industry that just wants to keep us sick...and spending our hard-earned cash to be so! Not that I think his products might be harmful in any way, but my method of operation has simply become don't trust it if it can't be trusted.So my bottom line and humble opinion is, sure, buy the book. It's simple and explained well (although there is plenty out there on the alkaline/acid balance that does not use a book and list credentials to gain credibility in order to sell you products), but think before you buy any of the products he sells in the book and on his website. Perhaps even take his supplement advice and buy them somewhere else!

Dr. Baroody explains clearly what it means to be alkaline, the eating \\"rule of 80/20\\" and how eating acidic foods uses up your alkaline reserves.Dr. Baroody writes many tidbits that other authors of other books on alkalinity overlook, such as the role of HCL acid in the stomach in creating alkalinity, how the moonlight can be alkalizing, as well as certain colors. His book contains a list of foods with their Ph levels, as well as explanations of how altering the foods can change their Ph level. For example, cooking, smoking and even eating foods in bad combinations can increase their acidity.Dr. Baroody explains that all drugs are very acidic. (Is it any wonder that MDs don't learn the importance of this factor in health? Medical schools are funded by the drug companies.) But that applies to recreational drugs as well, and he claims that it takes years of abstinence to correct the degenerative cycle of marijuana.This book is a keeper, since it makes a great reference book with its food-Ph lists and also the appendices, which include symptoms of acidity and recipes. Note: newer research may show he is wrong about almonds being alkaline; like other nuts, they are a bit acidic.Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & PlanetandBeyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't Work"},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"I should have know right from the title, which is a plain exageration, that this book would be terribly bad. I have read a number of books on the subject because I wanted to get the more information possible, and try to make myself an opinion about this topic. This books is the most terrible I have read. It is badly written, badly organized, with gross overstatements, imprecisions, and even pure lies. Is this guy trying to make an impression by talking about people that lived until 200 years old (if this was true don't you think we would know about it), or by stating that he \\"met an Indian guy that looked 70 but was really 140\\" (same thing - the oldest a man is know to have lived is 115 years old - 122 for a woman) ? What kind of a scientist says things like (and I quote) : \\"As a practitioner, I *feel* that chances of being too alkaline are around one in every thousand\\" ? Oh really, can we \\"feel\\" statistics now ? There's even a chapter (and by chapter I mean 2 pages, which is the length of each chapter) on the vagus nerve. What does this have to do with alkaline/acid balance ?What's more, unlike other books on the subject, this one is written by using the \\"I\\" everywhere, as if the author had been the only one working on this topic ; and as a matter of facts he presents things as being his discoveries. He is also constantly referring to God and \\"being aligned with God\\", which really did not help the reading as far as I'm concerned.I stay under the impression that the author has been reading litterature on the subject, and then hastily put a book together with bits and pieces from here and there in order to make easy money. This is very unfortunate, because I think this is a very important matter that people should know about, but this author is really working against the interest of the cause with this poorly written book.Books that I found much more useful on the subject are :- the Ph miracle, by Robert Young, if you want to understand how the body is working and why you should alkalize (but not for his diet - except maybe if you are severely sick - or his food guidance, that based on all the other books I read, are I think partly mistaken);- the acid alkaline food guide, by Susan Brown and Larry Trivieri, for a quick understanding (if you don't want the in-depth analysis of Young), and for the very complete food guide (knowing that you should always try and determine what's a food doing for you, if you have a doubt on one in particular);- The Acid-Alkaline Diet for Optimum Health by Christopher Vasey, to understand better how metabolism can lead to different results depending on who is eating the food, for a guidance on how to flush acids (you don't need to go 100% alkaline as suggested by Young), and how to test for effect that food has on you."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"I AM A DOCTOR OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE IN CALIFORNIA AND I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AS THE SINGLE BEST BOOK ON THE OVERALL HEALTHY DIET, WHICH IS THE KEY TO THE HEALTH OF THE PHYSICAL BODY.

After going on a crash-course conversion to 80% alkaline-forming foods, it took only about a month or so before I saw 100% relief from the chest pains that accompanied my reflux condition. Less than two months later, I am seeing other benefits such as more restful sleep and less \\"panickiness\\" at certain times.I believe that there may well be other tangible benefits to this diet that I have simply not yet identified, but that over time I may realize. In any case the diet really resonates with my personality and belief system; but it may not feel \\"right\\" to everyone that reads it. I admit to feeling a little uncomfortable at his frequent mention of God, but I still accepted the body of work as-is considering the author's background and beliefs.The bottom line is that the diet worked for me and that I like the foods I am eating now more than the ones I was eating before. The book is not \\"fun\\" or entertaining to read, and I can attest to other viewers' complaints that there are no footnotes or bibliographies referring to other bodies of work.I get the impression that if you come to this book from a strictly scientific point of view, it may be disappointing because it does not cite other literature to support its suppositions. If you come to the book needing help with a particular problem that diet may be able to assist, than by all means try it. The diet is all about getting back to basics: more plant-based food and less processed food.I am thankful that I had the fortune to come across this book to help not only in curing myself of reflux, but also to completely change my perception of the role of diet in my overall health. I am giving it five stars not because it is the greatest book I have ever read, but because it helped to completely cure my condition.

My main issue is that there is no references cited in this book. If you're willing to take the author at his word on any number of various health topics / alternative medicine then you'll have no problem with this book. Personally I found it mildly annoying to see page after page of the author spouting off information that would make anyone do a double take and providing no backup on it. If you're used to reading material that contains proper references /citations you will be extremely disappointed.My second issue is I did not buy this book to read about god, I bought it to read about nutrition. References to god pop up much too often for my liking.Final issue is the last 30 pages are a catalog for various health items the author is selling. It just brings the quality of the book down for me when stuff like this gets thrown into a book.All in all, the acid/alkaline approach is a fantastic tool to apply to your or your clients health and nutrition but I would look elsewhere for a better source of information."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"Well, 'Alkalize or Die' is one weird book. First off, it is barely what one would consider a book. It is very poorly edited and structured, with fully half of the book being nothing but fluff. Secondly, the author throws in praises to God every other page ... which is certainly unexpected in book focused on nutrition. Lastly, the book doesn't really blaze any new trail. His main message of the importance of eating alkaline-forming foods has been around since at least the 1930s. The subject is controversial, scientific backing is weak or non-existent. Yet one can forgive most of these demerits because the author's passion of the topic is infectious. Through it all he no doubt warms the heart of his skeptics.

While it's not exactly the same as the alkaline diet, it basically does the same thing because just about everything that you can eat raw is on the alkaline side. But before arriving there, I did try his version of things and alkalizing your body really does produce better health. At this point in time I eat almost 100% raw, but I do eat some cooked foods occasionally and I've found that it really does have an effect on my health to eat things that are very acidic. A big soda completely zaps my energy. So does eating meat. So if you are looking into the alkaline diet for health, I strongly believe in it. However, this book is a little silly at times. This book isn't very scientific, he brings his religious and other beliefs into it, and makes some extraordinary claims (we're really supposed to believe that he met a man who was 140 years old?). And his reasoning as to why we shouldn't eat meat? It's murder. I know there are many people who feel that way, but I'd just like a better scientific reason (it is, by the way, very acidic, which would have worked for me). If you are already somewhat convinced that the alkaline diet is the way to go, you will probably get something out of it. The alkaline charts are very extensive and helpful. However, if you're just curious and hoping that he will convince you that this diet is right for you...it's probably not going to do that."},{"Title":"Alkalize or Die: Superior Health Through Proper Alkaline-Acid Balance","review":"This book is a fast and easy read, yet quite thorough in coverage.

Instead it says to forget testing, because it is almost impossible to tell accurately from body fluids the state of body tissues. OK, sounds reasonable. What then can you do? Just adopt foods and practices that are alkaline-forming and let your body sort it out. This book tells you what they are. And remember that some acid-forming foods are necessary for good health. Balance is the issue.Included is a large catalogue of supplements for sale. Supplements are not necessary. They are concentrated and can create dangerous imbalances. If we cannot get a good read on the state of our body tissues, how can we know what they need? How can we safely self-medicate? Why not trust the wisdom of the body to maintain itself in homeostasis?Dr. Baroody says that genetically engineered foods are a difficult topic, as \\"there are many pros and cons.\\" I disagree! There are no pros at all for consumers. On page 60 he says that you need some table salt, which is not true. You need bio-available sodium and bio-available chloride, both of which are abundant in natural foods. Salt in any quantity is toxic and not bio-available. It can do nothing but harm. He advises drinking lots of water, another myth. Water drinking is entirely unnecessary if you eat a proper diet and, in the absence of thirst, is not beneficial. Of course, if you eat salt you will need water to dilute the toxic salt. He says that water drinking \\"assists proper digestion,\\" but I agree with Dr. Emmet Densmore, who said, \\"Digestion goes forward much better when the gastric juice is not diluted with fluids.\\"If you adopt a proper diet and lifestyle, you need not be concerned about pH.

I took all three tests on the same day and as far as I could tell the questions and answers were exactly like the ones in this fantastic book. If you don't have any electronics background it will be tough to understand what you're memorizing, but you could still do it. I was an electronics technician in the Navy and then switched to the Air Force where I worked as an aircraft communications, navigation and radar technician until I retired in 2000. This gave me enough background to make much of the information in the book at least look familiar though I had forgotten much of my electronics training.The only real change I think the authors should consider for upcoming editions is to write better explainations on many of the questions. Many times it seemed like they were merely restating the question. Nevertheless, please keep in mind that this is not an electronics course though you'll gain a lot of electronics knowledge through the book. Buy the book, study hard and you'll likely pass.

To my knowledge, Liliane Karnouk's book is the only book published documeting the work of some of the outstanding modern Egyptian artists.Her chapter about sculpturer, Mahmoud Mokhtar, including his famous \\"Egyptian Awakening\\" statue (inspired by Ancient Egyptian monuments) is simply marvellous. The collection of bronze sculptures by Adam Henein is exquisite.The art work by modern painters such as the late Kamal Khalifa and Inji Aflatoon, among others, depicts their brilliant art work despite personal suffering, as described in the biographies of each artist Liliane Karnouk included in this book.Although it is impossible to encompass all modern Egyptian artists in one book, particularly as Egypt is continuously delivering new and evolving talents, but unfortunately Liliane Karnouk omitted many important artists, e.g. young brilliant sculpturer Mokles Michael, or some of the established artists, such as Ahmed El Rashidi, Adel Thabet, Youssef Raafat, just to mention a few.Last note: Liliane Karnouk's previous book \\"Contemporary Egyptian Art\\" is included fully in her new book. So, if you plan to acquire one of her 2 books, this is the one!"},{"Title":"Modern Egyptian Art 1910-2003","review":"Modern Egyptian Art, besides being visually stimulating with its many color reproductions, is thought provoking. This well annotated art history, the first of its kind on contemporary Egyptian art, introduced me to artists and their work, bringing them to life in the context of their socio-political environment. Ms. Karnouk's insightful analysis of how history and the world scene has impacted Egypt and its artistic evolution at any given time, left me with a better understanding of contemporary Egypt and the influences of art in society and society on art.I highly recommend it for anyone interested in artistic expression and for readers wanting to better understand contemporary Egypt."},{"Title":"Modern Egyptian Art 1910-2003","review":"Modern Egyptian Art is an indispensable survey of 100 years in which Egyptian artists began to develop a vibrant synthesis of traditional aesthetics and the new strains of modernism developing in Europe, with a fantastic variety of results. This book is not only for people interested in the arts of the Arab world, but for anyone who wants to understand how modernism was a global movement that was always articulated locally (a notion Karnouk addresses in the chapter title \\"Premodernism or postmodernism?)-and how artists now are giving Egyptian inflections to the international movements of conceptual, performance, and video art. It is a gorgeous, superbly illustrated book, with exquisite color photographs that really give a sense of the artist's hand at work. Liliane Karnouk tells the history of many different creative movements, as Egyptian artists responded to the political changes of a century, from the opening to the West to the 1952 revolution to contemporary internationalism, and also to stylistic and thematic concerns from neo-pharaonism to realism, Islamic revival to the body, abstraction to environmentalism. Obviously much of this writing draws from primary research, including many interviews with artists, searches of the archive, and oral histories. What pulls it all together is Karnouk's acute analyses of works of art that bring them alive in their context and for contemporary readers."},{"Title":"Brave Little Jack","review":"Poor little Jack, he wish's that he could have wings so he could fly from tree to tree, will his wish come true?This book has to deal with a little squirrel that tries to save his friend from the rapids.

I am so looking forward to seeing more from this author. Her brand of writing is &quot;playful&quot; and &quot;edge-of-your-seat&quot; type of writing. I would like to know if anyone who has read this has been able to figure out the great &quot;twist&quot; at the end. I know it took me awhile to see it coming...and it was fabulous!! I hope we don't have to wait too long before she produces another wonderful book...mystery like this one...or otherwise. This book is an easy and great, fun read!!"},{"Title":"Belle Harbor Skeletons","review":"I'll start off admitting that I got this out of curiosity. I had no previous experience reading novels where any of the characters are gay, let alone the main ones, and I wondered what it would be like. I was pretty surprised; the author treats the characters' feelings for each other with respect. This isn't a porno book...it's a decent story that makes an actual point, and makes it without getting preachy.Maybe I'm too easy with stars...maybe 4 would have worked, but, based on the fact that I never even saw the twist at the end coming, I went for the full 5. I think this must be the author's first book--I'd never heard of her before--if that's the case, it's a pretty good start.There's a lot of dialogue, which moves the story faster--I didn't feel like I'd read 300 pages--and that's good or bad, depending on the reader's preference. Some people prefer straight narration, and there is some of that here, but it's more in the nature of scene setting and moving the story along to the next series of conversations.Don't assume that any of the dialogue is wasted, though, because very little of it seems to be fluff; everything ties in someplace, no matter how trivial it might seem at the moment. The only conversation I think you could make a case for being fluff is the one in the restaurant, but even that is amusing enough that it holds its own.There are several sexual references, but absolutely nothing graphic...everything fades out to the reader's imagination before it gets too hot.I'd recommend it...I guess I have, actually."},{"Title":"Belle Harbor Skeletons","review":"This is an excellently written book and reads quick. Just when you think you have figured it out, the author throws you a curve you never even saw coming.

Girls were never an important part of their lives while growing up. Their decision to live together as a gay couple, while not exactly a surprise, elicits two very different family reactions, the subject of this book.The Moss family comes from a lower-middle class background, and always placed the health and well-being of their children above material possessions, anyway. If Barnaby is happy as a gay person, that's all that matters. The Kotkin's live in Belle Harbor, the rich part of town. Thelma, Arnie's mother, is a social climber with an inordinate interest in what others think of the family. Arnie's coming out is an absolute disaster, for her, and she lets Arnie know it. She can just imagine the whispering that will go on around town, now that they have a . . .queer in the family.A few days later, Arnie is informed that his father has had a heart attack. Rushing to the hospital with Barnaby, and Helene and Jack Fentnor, Arnie's aunt and uncle who are visiting, they are confronted by Jimmy, one of Arnie's brothers. He is a medical student at the hospital and very much takes after his mother in being a self-centered jerk. He takes great exception to Barnaby's presence, and, in front of everyone, takes out a gun and shoots Barnaby, wounding him in the shoulder.The incident becomes news, jeopardizing Arnie's teaching job at the local elementary school. Barnaby is released after a couple of days (HMO). Thelma begins to realize that there is more to life than worrying about the opinion of others. A few days later, another tragedy strikes the Kotkin family. Freddie and Jerry, Arnie's other brothers, were in a car that was deliberately forced off the road by another car. Freddie escaped with minor injuries, but Jerry was killed. Arnie and Barnaby decide that they had better do some fast crime solving, because someone has certainly targeted the Kotkin family. Amid everything else, Helene and Jack let Arnie in on some deep, dark family secrets.This isn't just a good \\"gay novel,\\" or a good mystery or a good story about family secrets, it's a really good novel, overall. It moves easily, and will certainly keep the reader involved."},{"Title":"Rochambeau,","review":"If anyone has interest to read a thoughtful, excellent book about French comte de Rochambeau, this is the book to choose! Arnold Whitridge includes information that helps the reader understand the character and experience of this seasoned military leader Rochambeau as he came to America with 5,500 troops in 1780, to help his young counterpart, General George Washington win America's War of Independence. French King Louis XVI had sent him supplied with a much-needed fat bankroll!The reader will learn that even when needing to reproach one of his soldiers, Rochambeau signed his letter \\"Papa\\" The reader will learn of Rochambeau's early military experience from which he learned that to be successful, a battle near water needed to be one in which a naval blockade would be possible to reinforce military maneuvers on land. This was the key to the Continental Army's success at Yorktown, VA in 1781 - it was the naval blockade supplied by French Admiral de Grasse that was key to this success - General Washington had wanted to attack the British in New York City, but Rochambeau knew French ships would not have been able to clear the sandbar at Sandy Hook as would British ships - a blockade was not possible in NY.Whitridge writes of the Battle of Yorktown. This battle and the journey of these leaders to Yorktown, now is honored by the National Park Service Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail, the W3R-NHT. More can be read at the website of the W3R-US, the organization that conceptualized and \\"birthed\\" this NHT with its decades-long efforts. www.w3r-us.orgI cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Its subject is the decline of the English upper classes from the First World War to about 1970, a decline seen is inevitable and probably necessary, but somehow also regrettable.Such a description might make the novel seem stuffy, but it is not. _A Dance to the Music of Time_ is at times very funny indeed, and always interesting. always involving. It features an enormous cast of characters, and Powell has the remarkable ability to make his characters memorable with the briefest of descriptions. In addition, Powell's prose is addictive: very characteristic, idiosyncratic, and elegant.The long novel follows the life of the narrator, Nicholas Jenkins, from his time at Eton just after World War I to retirement in the English countryside in the late '60s. But Jenkins, though the narrator, is in many ways not the most important character. The comic villain Widmerpool, a creature of pure will, and awkward malevolence, is the other fulcrum around which the novel pivots.This final volume of the University of Chicago's beautiful Trade Paperback edition includes the last three books. _Books Do Furnish a Room_ is set shortly after World War II, when Nick Jenkins is moving in London literary circles, dealing with such characters as the doomed, eccentric, novelist X. Trapnel, his mistress Pamela Flitton Widmerpool, and of course Kenneth Widmerpool himself, clumsily but successfully trying to maximize his political influence with the help of a literary magazine. _Temporary Kings_ features Jenkins at a conference in Venice, then back in London, and introduces a couple of curious Americans, Louis Glober and Russell Gwinnett. It also features the final destructive acts of the terrible Pamela Flitton's life. _Hearing Secret Harmonies_ concludes the sequence, as Jenkins rather bitterly views the radicalism of the '60s, and especially Widmerpool's usual attempts at ingratiating himself with the latest fads in power. The novel closes with a remarkable vision of Widmerpool's end, oddly, bitterly echoing his first appearance.A great, great, series of novels. Incomparable."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"C. S. Lewis once wrote that one of the greatest services that literature offers is the opportunity to experience worlds and lives not our own. This is rarely more true than with Powell's magnificent series. I had come to feel that Nicholas Jenkins's friends were my friends, and by the end I felt almost as if I had experienced another life.If one is willing to make the commitment of time, I wholeheartedly recommend this superb series. In a hundred years time, it might be the single work that I would recommend to anyone wanting to know what life in the 20th century was like."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"The last three novels of this twelve-volume series take place in post-World War II England. The cast of characters has been substantially trimmed, as many of the narrator's closest friends have died, but new and unforgettable individuals emerge in the feverish literary world of London and the international conference circuit. We wait, and root for, the horrible Widmerpool to get his comeuppance, and watch as the other characters grow older, some gracefully, some less so, but always moving to the stately rhythms of time's music. Those who have read the first three-quarters of the series should definitely go on to the end--many treats are in store for you!"},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"To arrive at the 4th movement of 20th Century British author Anthony Powell's \\"A Dance to the Music of Time,\\" is, of course, to arrive at the season of winter, as we can see from the front of the soft-cover volume, a reprint of the painting by the 16th century French artist Nicolas Poussin, from which title Powell's masterwork, initially a 12-book series, takes its own. The series'1st movement, chronicling the schooldays of Powell's narrator, Nick Jenkins, was spring; the second movement, chronicling the palmy young adulthood in London of the narrator, his friends and acquaintances, was summer. World War II was fall. We now arrive at winter, melancholy; discontented, to quote Shakespeare's Richard III; and shot through with death. Powell's language is frequently more Latinate and pompous than in his earlier books; his plots and characters are less dense, and less funny. Our narrator, Jenkins, becomes less an actor in the tale than a bystander; the books read almost as a prolonged afterword as loose ends are tied up.\\"Books Do Furnish a Room,\\" first in the final trilogy, is set in the immediate post-war years of the late 1940's. Mention is made of the many people Jenkins knew who were lost in the war: his closest friends from schooldays, Peter Templer and Charles Stringham; his friend from young London salad days, Barnby. Several of his wife Isobel's many siblings have also been lost: as well as her aunt Molly Jeavons. Our narrator Jenkins is working on a study of Robert Burton, sixteenth-century author ofThe Essential Anatomy of Melancholy (Dover Books on Literature & Drama), and the mood is melancholy indeed. Mention is made of the difficulty and expense of getting clothing ration coupons, flowers, alcoholic beverages, gas. \\"Books Do Furnish a Room\\" is the nickname of a literary compere of Jenkins'; but he does not dominate this volume. Instead, we see quite a lot of Kenneth Widmerpool, the boys'bete noir from schooldays, and the woman he's married, Charles Stringham's universally-acknowledged to be difficult niece, Pamela Flitton. However, the book largely centers on X.Trapnel, mysterious author, whom I've always thought was based on the mysterious real-life 20th century German-American writer B. Traven, author of the 1927 novelThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre, among other works - it was made into a famous movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Walter Huston, directed by Huston's famous son John:The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (Two-Disc Special Edition). And then, of course, there's Trevanian, pen named author ofThe Eiger Sanction: A Novel; also made into a well-known movie, starring Clint Eastwood:The Eiger Sanction.The second book, \\"Temporary Kings,\\" centers on an international literary convention in Venice. We meet some new characters, principally American academic Russell Gwinnett. But the action really centers on Lord Widmerpool, as he has been named a life peer, and his wife, Lady Pamela. More of Jenkins' friends and relations are lost.In \\"Hearing Secret Harmonies,\\" the last book, set in the 1960's, we meet and will see a lot of one Scorpio Murtlock, youthful guru extraordinaire and leader of his own cult. But once again, Widmerpool, now Lord Widmerpool, chancellor of a red-brick university, will dominate, as he is first caught up in the student unrest that characterized that long-gone era; and then delivers himself and his goods to Murtlock. And yet more of Jenkins' friends, relations, and acquaintances are lost.It's rather a glum volume, all told, and not nearly as entertaining as its brilliant predecessors. But if, you've read your way through this lengthy series, and,like some of us, you want to know what happened then --- well, you might as well read it."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"The first two novels in this, the last movement of \\"Dance,\\" are wonderful, just as those in the three preceding movements are wonderful. I'm going to limit my review to the last volume, and that's because I hated it so much. Complaining about an appalling desert to a sumptuous meal is, of course, ungrateful, but such is human nature. (Amazon demands that we rate books, and my 4-star rating applies to \\"Books do Furnish a Room\\" and \\"Temporary Kings.\\")What ails \\"Hearing Secret Harmonies\\" is simple: Powell, after having spent nearly 25 years on his ambitious series, no longer knows what to do with his characters. This is especially true of Widmerpool, Powell's power-mad, creepy and ultimately intriguing antihero. Here, in \\"Hearing Secret Harmonies\\" we reencounter said Widmerpool as an aspiring leader of a crackpot cult, an amusing but trite end for a pompous Eton pupil, a wunderkind London businessman, a ruthless military officer, a journalist and a Communist spy. Are we really to believe this of one who, for most of his power-hungry life, posed as \\"another Lord Chesterfield\\" (Stringham's apt description)?Jenkins, too, is also a bit of a disappointment. The astute observer loses much of his muscle here, and what we end up with is a rather charming Tory who heaps scorn on the generation of the 1960s as embodied in the person of Scorp Murtlock and in those of his minions. Disappointing stuff from the penetrating Jenkins, a verdict that will, I think, make sense to you after you've completed such delights as \\"The Acceptance World,\\" \\"The Kindly Ones\\" and \\"The Valley of Bones.\\" With Jenkins, too, Powell has run out of ideas.That said, read the series!"},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"After a hundreds of pages dealing just with World War II, Anthony Powell brings us through the postwar decades with the last three novels of \\"A Dance to the Music of Time\\", which tracks Nicholas Jenkins and his social circle across an enormous breadth of 20th-century Britain.BOOKS DO FURNISH A ROOM, the tenth novel, opens in the winter of 1945/46 as Britain settles back into peacetime, though not without annoying rationing and shortages. Jenkins has come to his old university for research towards a biography on Robert Burton, but soon first himself involved in the launch of a new literary magazine with distinct leftist tones. Indeed, we return to a world of shady politics left behind in the early 1930s in THE ACCEPTANCE WORLD, the third novel of the sequence, and many of the characters from those days return. Widmerpool, his political career now taking off, also comes into the picture, and his continual defence of the Soviet Union makes him a more repulsive antagonist than ever.But beyond revisiting old friends, BOOKS DO FURNISH A ROOM introduces two new characters with very distinctive personalities. One is the novelist X. Trapnel, whose bohemianism mystifies his fellow characters and ultimately leads to his grisly ruin. The other character is Pamela Widmerpool. Though she appeared first in the previous novel, she was mostly a force of nature destroying the lives of numerous male characters offscreen. Here Jenkins talks with her on several occasions, revealing something of her as a person. As this volume was written at the end of the 1960s in a more frank era, Powell felt that his language could be a bit more coarse, and it is Pamela who utters all the profanity. The relationship between Widmerpool and his wife sometimes descends into mere soap opera, and the literary allusions, especially to Burton, get rather tiresome. Still, this is a pretty OK entry in the series.The last two volumes are unfortunately very weak. TEMPORARY KINGS brings us over a gap of more than a decade to Venice 1958, where Jenkins is attending a literary conference. We're introduced to some American characters, but only so that Pamela Widmerpool can destroy them. This novel is tedious, the coincidences too hard to swallow, and there's a real lack of the comedy that sustained the series. HEARING SECRET HARMONIES takes place another decade on, in the late '60s, and here Powell had gotten bored with the usual trend of the \\"Dance\\" to be centred around dinner parties and inspired by real life events, so he creates an outlandish plot with a cult leader, magical powers and ritual sex.In these last volumes, Powell tries to pare the basic plot down to Jenkins versus Widmerpool, and indeed Widmerpool's demise is what brings these multi-volume reminisces to a close. But in TEMPORARY KINGS and HEARING SECRET HARMONIES, Widmerpool is a completely different character, doing things not at all in keeping with the fellow we've long followed. Also, in the last two novels the sex really gets out of hand. In early volumes in the \\"Dance\\", the presence of a few homosexual characters added realism to the work, but Powell now reveals nearly every male character (and not a few female characters) to be homosexual and bases the plot on this, which rather reminds me of mid-century British humour's excessive reliance on cross-dressing.I am happy that I read the Dance and I'd probably even recommend it. The bulk of the series is very entertaining, and pushing through to the end didn't require so much extra effort. Still, it's a pity that Powell couldn't keep it together in the end."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"As in previous volumes, things in this volume \\"just happen.\\" Perhaps Powell's frequent allusions to myth and legend, both in literature and in art, are intended to elevate his work to the status of contemporary myth. But the mode is realism. Time and again, even more so than in previous volumes, events stain credibility, as the narrative, such as it is, limps along. Powell has absolutely no sense of pace either between or within scenes. Dramatic situations are set up but are allowed to fizzle, often because the narrator interrupts reporting in order to ruminate or to make arcane allusions. There is altogether too much shop talk about literature and art, so much, in fact, as to invite the charge of pedantry.Having read the first three volumes, I felt obliged to see how everything turned out. Virtually without exception, the deaths or fates of characters are presented in the form of a brusque checklist. \\"So much for so-and-so.\\" The exception is the demise of Widmerpool, Main Gargoyle amongst many ( the work might have been called \\"A Convention of Gargoyles\\" ), which is risible for all the wrong reasons. It is tortured, literally, and torturous. One is led to wonder who this monster was based upon, as is likely the case, since this \\"chronicle\\" is transparently autobiographical, save that we learn next to nothing about the protagonist himself, apart from his cerebral excursions, and only that his wife, in brief verbal entrees, is sardonic.The style in this volume has deteriorated into something like a parody of ornate prose. But there are good moments and an occasional snappy epigram. Thus the volume escapes even a lower score."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"Sometimes you can't appreciate the good things in life. One man's appreciation for a $500 bottle of wine can seem awkward when my own tastes like the $30 imitation just as much. Often, I can feel like a fool when entering MOMA and see paintings which I question as being art. A modern symphony of instruments in different keys at different beats is not the music I know.I felt just as perplexed by this novel. The dialogue was good, but it never grabbed me. But, others call it a masterpiece - a $500 bottle of wine. I'll settle for less. I'll take romantics D.H Lawrence, Emily Bronte, Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen etc before this novelist. He writes more for the stage play than the novel, and the wordy aspect of the same may have been too European for me - much like their movies.So take my critique as a purely subjective statement by someone who likes Two Buck Chuck more than a stash from Baron Philippe de Rothschild Chateau Mouton Rothschild. This is a tome, and unless you like the writing, it is more than you may want to tackle."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"During the two years that I have been reading A Dance to the Music of Time, Anthony Powell(1905-2000) has become one of my three favorite authors. In his novel, divided into four \\"movements\\" with three volumes each, Powell followed his narrator, Nick Jenkins, from boyhood to semi-retirement in Great Britain during most of the 1900s. Along the way I became acquainted with a variety of interesting characters living upper middle class lives in London and the countryside. Jenkins is a writer of fiction and non-fiction who is a keen observer of behaviors of his family, friends, and fellow writers and artists. Nick's observational skills are not hampered by over- reaction, and the narrator may appear uninterested in other people's feelings. The depth of his character is revealed in the compassionate and humorous interaction, observation, and description of others.The twelve volumes of Powell's work make it one of the longest novels in the English language. It is similar to Proust's In Search of Lost Time in length. The two novels also share many topics if not style, and are on a similar intellectual level. A way to help the reader decide to read A Dance to the Music of Time is to say that it is a \\"thinking person's\\" Forsyte Saga by John Galsworthy. In fact, as I mentioned in reviews of the first three movements, Galsworthy is represented in the novel by a successful but egocentric and foolish literary character, St John Clarke.The fourth movement that I am reviewing here is composed of the volumes: Books Do Furnish a Room (1971), Temporary Kings (1973), and Hearing Secret Harmonies (1975). In this movement, the theme that has been recurring throughout the saga continues; people one meets early in life tend to come around again in middle life and yet again in later life. Each time these social seasons come around, the view of the people changes with an increase in observer wisdom. Certainly Nick Jenkins gains wisdom during his many decades as a family member, student, soldier, lover, husband, and writer. At the end of the story, Nick and the reader of the many volumes are able to hear the secret harmonies of the span of life described so beautifully and with good humor by Powell. See my other reviews of this novel written Powell wrote from 1951 to 1975."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"This volume contains the final three novels of Anthony Powell's masterpiece, A Dance to the Music of Time. Readers coming to this series for the first time should start with the first volume. Powell's work is social comedy in the tradition of Jane Austen and George Meredith. Contemporary writers with whom he is often compared include Marcel Proust and Evelyn Waugh. The 12 short novels of A Dance to the Music of Time give a panoramic picture of English upper-class social life from 1921 to 1971 that is both intensely realistic and amazingly funny. Readers either love Powell's work or can't understand what others see in it. My own opinion is that Dance is the best novel written in the twentieth century. Others share this view: A Dance to the Music of Time is #43 on the recently constructed Random House/Modern Library 100 Best Poll (of twentieth century fiction) and was made into a 4-part miniseries on British television just about a year ago."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"About this fourth movement, two salient features strike me: 1) If you are not deeply steeped in literature or, perhaps, to put a finer point on it, the history of literature, if you don't understand this remark, made by Nick in The Temporary Kings, the second of these three final efforts, that, \\"It is often pointed out that one form of Romanticism is to be self-consciously Classical.\\", you are going to miss out on much of the work's depth. Indeed, if you have not read one particular book, Burton's delightful, age-old, rambling The Anatomy of Melancholy, you will miss out on much. So much is seen through a literary lens. 2.) This movement is indeed a departure from the other three, in that, were I asked to sum up its theme in one word, that word would be: NecrophiliaI'm not going to delve into the psychology of Pamela Widmerpool nee Flitton or into that of Russell Gwinnett here. But let's just say that, primarily through these two characters, this movement plumbs the depths of sadism and masochism (particularly the latter) so subtly and deftly, and yet so uncompromisingly that it makes just about anything else written on these themes seem exhibitionist and superficial by comparison.Also, a word on the opus as a whole, now that I've read all four movements: It does not measure up to the standard of Proust, as is often claimed. Really, it's an entirely different sort of work than Proust's. Proust is solipsistic (in a profound sense) and poetic. Powell is gregarious and deeply prosaic. His style of writing reminds me of the Latin I had to construe as a youth.Near the end of the third movement, our narrator Jenkins confesses to a weakness for Poe. Here, that \\"weakness\\" blossoms improbably like a rose in a charnel house. After completing this fourth movement and meditating on the entire \\"Dance\\" for some time, I discovered that the overall affect on me was that it was extremely weird, weird in a way that I find impossible to put into exact wording, weird, no doubt, in the way that critic Harold Bloom uses the word when he avers that all great literature strikes the reader in this way, as weird.As odd as this recommendation may sound, one could do worse, far worse, than to return to Poe's poem Annabel Lee after completing this massive opus in order to gain a sort of perspective, whether one likes the poem or not, perhaps particularly if one does not."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Dance series for a graduate level course over the summer of 2003....until I got to the last volume. In my opinion the books peaked with the sixth, &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot; and finshed delightfully at book nine &quot;The Military Philosophers&quot;. Most major character lines were completed and the story had reached a logical and chronological end. For this reason Volume Four reads like a long and arduous addendum. The new characters are unappealing and the loss of the most interesting personalities from the prior three volumes is immense. Further, a personal irritation of mine is the continued use of archaic verse lifted from often bad and lugubrious poetry. Powell is indiscrimant in adding pages from irrelevant works while not advancing the story line. Did he write these last three novels to augment his income as he approached his later years? Regardless they alloy this otherwise delightful series. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, END AT BOOK 9, DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS VOLUME."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"While I would recommend starting at an earlier stage of Powell's intimate epic (a contradiction in terms? maybe not), this is essential reading."},{"Title":"A Dance to the Music of Time: Fourth Movement","review":"Anthony Powell has been dubbed \\"the English Proust\\". Having read both Proust and Powell, I think it would be more accurate to say that Proust is the French Anthony Powell, A.P. being, in my opinion, by far the more accomplished writer. I remember reading a caption to the effect that after reading Powell's works, returning to other writers's required an effort of the will. This is exactly how I felt after enjoying Dance. The manyfold characters of Dance have now become more real to me than most people I've know in my life and it is fair to say that A.P. belongs to that category of rare writers who can change your outlook on life. An abridged audio version of Dance is available (read by Simon Callow) but it is on audiocassette and out of stock. I hope this or another audio version will be made available in more modern form (CD etc.) for those who like the spoken word too. I can't get enough of Dance, whether it be text, sound or TV series.I agree with a previous reviewer that the later volumes of Dance are weaker than the earlier, and I wish Powell had chosen something more mainstream than necrophilia to pepper his tale of the fifties. But as A.P. himself wrote in his memoirs: with every writer there's something to put up with. \\"Dance\\" is too good to deserve less than five stars on account of a somewhat bizarre last part."},{"Title":"Tips and Traps For Writing an Effective Business Plan","review":"I've read a lot of business plan books over the past two years. And as a result I've pretty much stopped writing book reviews for the new ones pumped out on the market. There's only so much that can be said about how to research and write a business plan. And I think the market on such books is already saturated. It would be nice if the new books written on the subject would be tailored for specific businesses, i.e., a law firm, an accounting firm, a donut shop, or a fancy restaurant. But that's just me thinking out loud.I am writing a review for this book because I think it is better than most and it has been recently published. I highly recommend this book for wanta-be entrepreneurs to read and use in pursuing their dream to be an entrepreneur.It covers all ten sections of a standard business plan well. And it includes a Part IV entitled \\"Special Considerations for Specific Businesses\\" that I have not seen included in other business plan books. Definitely a plus for this book. See the online TOC at Amazon for the specific businesses covered.I had a little problem with Chapter 4 entitled Market Analysis. For me it did not focus enough on studying your competition. You need to know who your competitors are and how much gross revenue they bring in. If you can get (or estimate) this information, then you can fairly easily estimate what your new company's gross sales or revenues will be at the end of year 1, year 2, and year 3. This is because your business plan should provide for a market share estimate at the end of years 1-3. If the market amounts to $5 million in gross revenues a year, and your company will have 5% of the pie in year one, 15% in year 2, and 30% in year 3, then it's easy to calculate your expected gross revenues. And kowing your gross revenues goes a long way in helping you prepare your Pro Forma Financial Plan (Chapter 9).I would have liked Chaper 9 more if it had included some coverage of the following two resources that your public library should have:Risk Management Association's Annual Statement Studies (RMAHQ)Financial Research Associates' Financial Studies of the Small Business (FRASSB)These two just-listed resources will provide you with much information for your financial plan if you know what your gross revenues will be.Also, the instant book was a little light on how to actually do the research for your business plan. Consider the following two books:Successful Business Research (ISBN: 0974080136)Market Research Made Easy (ISBN: 1551806762)All in all, this is a wonderful book on business plans. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Tips and Traps For Writing an Effective Business Plan","review":"I found this to be a very detailed but practical coverage of the subject. The work starts from the beginning of any consideration of writing a business plan. All through it there are disclosures and understandings of the particular stage of the construction of the plan you are working on. Finally the author explains how to use the completed product to raise money for the business. A well written and complete text."},{"Title":"Signs for These Times: Church Signs That Work","review":"While providing good information as to how a church sign message should be planned out, drafted, reviewed and approved, the actual sample church sign messages contained in the book seemed too local and &quot;cutesy&quot; for general use. Buy the book for the planning information, not the sample messages themselves."},{"Title":"Signs for These Times: Church Signs That Work","review":"Uplifting and insightful, Glusenkamp's book is a valuable book for clergy and lay people alike. Signs for These Times combines scripture with Glusenkamp's personal wit and wisdom to create a wonderful evangelical tool. Throughout the book, the church sign is shown to be a much more than simply a static message board. The sign is at once an attraction to the church, public service announcement, and social commentary. The book also offers many helps hints on creating catchy church signs and even includes an index of all the signs Glusenkamp used as a parish pastor. This is the perfect book for that special person in your parish who is responsible for the sign or just for anyone who is interested in learning more about creative evangelical marketing. Five Stars."},{"Title":"Signs for These Times: Church Signs That Work","review":"Ronald T. Glusenkamp is an amazing author. This book is a useful tool on the art of church sign messages. He even gives many examples of his own that he has used. He has a wonderful sense of humor and quite often sneaks it right into the book. It's a wonderful book to read even if you're not involved with the church sign!"},{"Title":"Signs for These Times: Church Signs That Work","review":"Although Reverend Glusenkamp may have designed the book to help churches with signs, it is great for lay people. Not only does he delve into the psychology of the church sign, he provides solid examples. He presents his ideas in a way that will make you laugh out loud. You won't believe some of the signs such as &quot;Joanna, Mary &amp; Mary Magdalene - The Original Spice Girls&quot; or &quot;Need Earthquake Insurance? - Come to Church&quot; or &quot;Hockey Playoff Special - Free Pay Per Pew.&quot; This book is well worth it and you'll find many signs that you would like to see on your church board - and many more humorous signs you'll want to pass on to friends. As a side note, you'll appreciate his approach to being positive in presenting a church's message - instead of threatening parishioners with hell and damnation, he suggests signs should offer hope like &quot;Read the Bible and get your faith supersized for free.&quot;"},{"Title":"Signs for These Times: Church Signs That Work","review":"Signs for These Times is an excellent book for those interested in using a church sign as an evangelism tool or a fun book for casual readers looking for laughter in quick witted humor that provides a commentary on today's culture. The book is very fast reading and you will find yourself quoting the author's signs in your everday conversation with friends and co-workers. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Higgins: Adventures in Glass","review":"If you want to collect Higgins glass, this book is an absolute must-have. The prices are outdated; with the recent death of Michael Higgins, I have seen pieces sell for double or triple the book's values. This is much more than a price guide, though.
