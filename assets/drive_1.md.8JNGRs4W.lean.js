Poems lift you up when you need lifting and bring you down when you need grounding.And this book is like that. Billy Merrell is a true poet and has the soul of a wise, wise man. And yet he's only 21! Amazing.The poems here may be about homosexuality and family struggle, may contain drug use and have moments of sexual description, but Merrell knows that the poems aren't REALLY about these things. Instead, they are about transcending one's own childhood and one's own adolescence in order to find sanctuary in the spirits of our ancestors.I can't recommend this book enough. Like 5 of my friends have borrowed my copy and have insisted they have their own. It's the kind of book you want to have propped up near your bed so you can read it just before you go to sleep."},{"Title":"Talking In The Dark (Push Poetry)","review":"I'm a little confused as to this book's classification as YA. Sure, there were sections that dealt with his childhood, but the most straightforward, poignant, and powerful poems were those that dealt with very mature topics: specifically, *after* he graduated from high school.Some of the poems, particularly those dealing with his friend Ben and the dissolution of his relationship, are very touching. Some are a little confusing, and I found myself backtracking to figure out who was being referred to in the poem, what the topic was, and its relevance in that particular place. Poetry, it seems, is intentionally misleading at times, and I find that to be an annoying characteristic.That said, I myself have a wealth of experiences from elementary, junior high, and high school that are ripe for writing, as they are devastatingly powerful. In my own writing classes and seminars, teachers have literally begged me to write about them, rather than the \\"typical\\" YA that I'm working on, which is more fantasy based. The problem was, I didn't know how to do it. I didn't want to write a straightforward story, because the format just didn't seem right. This book has given me some insight onto how to put my experiences onto the page. So for that - I'm greatly indebted. (Especially if I get published. &lt;grin>)"},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"Anne Robertson, a United Methodist minister in New England, writes, 'There are few things more upsetting than a God who refuses to stay put...'Anne Robertson gives a wonderful, personal development of the idea of God being bigger and broader than one can possibly imagine. I've often used the example in my preaching that God is more than any idea we could ever have of God; this is rather difficult for many people to grasp, but Robertson has a wonderful way of exploring this aspect of God. It can be challenging and disconcerting, because it is far from the norm in our everyday, quantifiable and measurable world. The modern world is uncomfortable with ambiguity, and often terrified of the unknown. Speaking of the women who went to the tomb on the first Easter morning, Robertson writes, 'The very thing that frightened the women - the unknown and the unexpected - is that same thing that frightens us today when we consider that God might be larger and more complex than our particular experience of God.'Robertson does her writing in confessional style (this is a literary/theological designation, rather than a penitential or 'just-the-facts, maam' kind of admission of guilt); she goes through her experiences both conservative and liberal, both within and outside the church, and casts her ideas for God's reality and God's presence with us in terms that many readers will find very familiar and easy to relate to.Her central cipher is that of the God-box. A box is a container (even when it is empty). Most of us (if not all of us) have a container of sorts, into which we pour our ideas of what and who God is. Even professional theologians (or perhaps most especially professional systematic theologians) do not escape the trap of trying to define God so precisely as to render God less than who God truly is, and can be. One crucial element Robertson identifies for the God-box is keeping it open in the context of community - what is in the box needs to be valuable and recognised as such by members of the community, and what other community members have in their God-boxes can be shared and used to enrich one's own. Careful not to make community a panacea for all ills, she nonetheless highlights the advantages, and shows the disadvantages of the 'go-it-alone' approach.The book continues with a look at common and uncommon images of God, the way in which we think about God both in scripture and tradition, the use and misuse of institutional religion and community, and finishes with a chapter that develops her device of the God-box in context of creedal statements familiar to many Christians through the centuries.This is a wonderful book to use for private and group study. Well-written and engaging both personally and spiritually, it is uplifting and thought-provoking in many ways."},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"In her beautifully flowing and extraordinarily insightful first publication, Anne Robertson brings her expansive and Jesus-centered Belief to her readers, challenging us not to allow Faith to become a mere reflection of our own, privatized and sometimes very convenient religious beliefs..or to cut it out if we already have. In beautiful, short chapters, she calls on each of us to allow God to be the One doing the defining. Calling on Scripture, as well as personal and professional experience, she is at once serious and light-hearted, many times using her wonderful gift of \\"getting to the point\\" in unique, thought-provoking and often humorous ways. She tackles difficult moral dilemmas and human frailties, and gives us a new, more open way to look at them. She throws the gauntlet down to those who co-op God for their own private advancement, for the \\"my way or the highway\\" type of sectioning that modern religions can break down into..leading to personal and sometimes national wars: if both sides fervently believe God is on their side, one side (or both) has placed God in a box. This book will help each person of Faith blow off the lid to see the bigger picture, and help prevent one from closing off to many of God's Creation's wondrous aspects. As she says in discussing the tensions caused by different types of services (organ music; drums and guitars; skits, etc.), \\"Recognize that your way of worship isn't the sum total of worship itself.\\" The Prelude alone will make your realize you are dealing with a writer and thinker of the first order in Anne Roberston..a fresh, new and most welcome voice in Christian letters. You'll be wanting to continue on immediately! As you proceed, you'll think you can hear God saying, \\"Finally, someone gets it!\\" Blowing the Lid off the God-box is a delightful read, and Anne's fervent belief in Love as the basic building block of all existence wafts across the pages like the scents of blossoms in the spring winds. When you finish this book, you'll realize that by offering it, she is telling you she loves the reflection of God in you, too."},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"As I finished reading Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box, I deliberately read slower, not wanting it to end. Reverend Robertson writes with clarity and insight, encouraging readers to look at the beliefs and preferences of others in a way surpassing tolerance.

Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box will definitely be at the top of my list of gifts to give loved ones this Christmas."},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"This is a book of grace. Robertson writes in an informal, utterly human style. Her confession validates the reader's struggles with the many ways that we place lids on our own God boxes and refuse to inspect the contents of other people's God boxes. I recommend the book for anyone who struggles to reconcile their deeply held instinctive concept of God with the sometimes restrictive messages we get about God from our own worldly view and from the worldly viewpoints of others."},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"Let me add my voice to what I am certain will be a chorus of praise for Anne Robertson's book, Blowing the Lid Off the God-Box. This is an important book, one which has something to say to any believing Christian, whether new to the faith or a \\"veteran,\\" liberal or conservative, young or old, clergy or laity.In simple, familiar images, Robertson presents profound truths, and a vision of God (and of our relationship to God) which is certain to deepen the faith of the reader, while increasing his or her awareness of the many ways in which God refuses to be confined to our neat, concise understandings of God.Drawing on illustrations from her own life and from her experience as a pastor, Anne Robertson draws us into a deeper, more profound, more awe-inspiring vision of the richness of God. This is an important book for anyone seeking a deeper experience of God, and it is a book which I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"United Methodist minister, Anne Robertson, has contributed a challenging work, inspiring Christians to examine their beliefs and prejudices. Using a humble approach, she describes her opinion that believers, young or old, new to the faith or \\"old timers,\\" risk the danger of isolating God by reducing Him tostereotypes and defining Him through holding to the expected, the norm, the safe. She points out the ways in which we limit God and ourselves by confining ourselves to traditional and habitual responses and practices, and suggests we examine our individual and collective \\"boxes\\" in which we place a God too large to be contained. Whether you fall into the category of liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, Baptist or Episcopalian, this book will stretch your mind and heart. An easy read, it is a profound work."},{"Title":"Blowing The Lid Off The God-Box: Opening Up To A Limitless Faith (Explorefaith.Org Book)","review":"Theologians and writers like Leslie Weatherhead, J.B. Phillips, Marcus Borg, Jon Dominic Crossan, Elaine Pagels, and Barbara Brown Taylor have long been helping us to expand our experiencing of God to counteract what seems to be human nature to pin God down to be within our capacity to understand. Anne Robertson throws her hat in the ring with this wonderful little book and encourages us to not only be open to our experience of God but to the experience others have of God as well. She reminds us, through both her personal sharing as well as her teaching and preaching, that our challenge is to keep our minds open as we live, breathe, walk and talk our life in the spirit, allowing God to light our path. As the motto for our denomination has been this past year, \\"Don't put a period where God has put a comma,\\" our faith journey can be much more vital and life-giving when we don't assume we know all there is to know about God.

Two things are going to very clear to you, one that Col Crockett thought fairly highly of himself, and that he didn't think much about Jackson and Van Buren. He also interestingly enough didn't dwell much on his family, not even giving us names of his wives or children [I not even sure he was home enough to know the names].I learned a lot about politics, and how they were carried on in the early 1830's. I must say that if our politicians behaved that way today our country would be shocked. I do think that this book shows that Crockett was a concerned public servant, and did a good job working for his constituency. He did seem to have a strong grasp on the going ons of the nation.If you are looking for a good first hand history of the 1820's and 30's give this book a shot. It is easy to read, and informative. The only caution is to remember that it was written at a different time, this book is not PC by today's standards, and there are words and sentiments that may make today's readers a little uncomfortable."},{"Title":"Davy Crockett's Own Story","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

There amongst them was this book: Last of the Donkey Pilgrims...a rather unusual find but not ignorable with the donkey looking right at you from the cover. Though not a \\"tour book\\", I took it home and was immediately taken in by Kevin O'Hara's writing style and his tale of this incredible journey. With Irish heritage and an upcoming trip being my first time to Ireland, I was enchanted by the personalized stories he told. Kevin is very skilled in painting a picture of the people and the environment. His capture of the dialogue is so skilled you can hear the brogue and the inflections in the discussions, making you feel like you are silently eavesdropping on the characters. The number of times I laughed out loud were too numerous to count, so much so that my husband also was enticed to read the book.As you read of Kevin's journey, you travel with him and you come to appreciate the challenges and difficulties he faced in this labor of love, traveling the coast, on foot, with a donkey and a cart, with no money making, staying in fields or offered shelter along the way. This journey was completed in 8 months and although Ireland is a small country, this is actually a remarkable accomplishment. As the book was coming to a close, I found myself slowing down my reading a bit so as not to rush to the end of this marvelous journey. It was after I completed the read that I bought my own copy, a \\"souvenir journal\\" of sorts from this trip.The most remarkable aspect of reading this book was how much perspective and meaning it added to our trip to Ireland. Each time we passed through a town, found a sight, traveled a road that was mentioned, we found ourselves thinking of Kevin and Missy,his donkey. We envisioned how difficult it must have been to travel some of the roads, the long expanses of road to be covered, the difficulty in climbing the hills, the beauty of the scenery, the endless rows of fuchsia hedges and the delight of meeting such industrious and good-hearted people. We also came to appreciate the value of \\"a pint\\" as a means of connecting with the town and the residents.I cannot recommend this book highly enough not only for the pure pleasure of reading it but also for the value and perspective it can add to life. It is a delightful read!! Here's to you, Kevin O'Hara!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"\\"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims\\" is my very favorite book about Ireland. I have read just about every book there is on lovely country, and this is the one that you must buy! I have read it three times through, and the book never gets old. Kevin O'Hara's writing style is accessible, humorous, and very real. It's as if you're sitting beside him in a pub, and he is relating the stories of his wonderful journeys personally. You will laugh out loud, reflect, enjoy, learn, and cry. What more can you ask from a book? Don't miss this one...it's a keeper.Lisa from Virginia"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"This is the first time I've ever written a review, but after reading this book I knew I had to let people (and Kevin) know how much I enjoyed it. The writing was so vivid I could almost imagine myself walking beside Kevin and Missie on their journey. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down...the only thing I didn't like was that it came to an end....I'll be reading this book again very soon! (Maybe I can find a way to make it last longer!!!!) Keep writing Kevin....I eagerly await your next book!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Even if you are not an Irish-American, there is a mystique about Ireland. A poor but proud country, it punches well above its weight in terms of natural beauty, great literature, fine porter, and the art of conversation. But the most exceptional trait is the abundance of extraordinary characters in all walks of life that happen to have been born and lived there.Kevin O'Hara is an extremely gifted story teller. Born in England of Irish parents, he grew up in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, but continued to be drawn like a magnet to his parents homeland. During a sabbatical from his psychiatric nursing work, Kevin walked completely around Ireland with one of those strong characters, a donkey named Missie.The journey was made more than 30 years ago, and it took a long time to get it down on paper. It was worth the wait. Ireland has changed considerably since then, in some ways materially for the better. But a rural way of life is captured in this book, one that is hauntingly beautiful and perhaps now mostly gone.Portraits of one of a kind bachelor farmers, Irish travelers, fishermen and publicans fill this book with memorable encounters, and the tension of adventure. Where he will stop each night is not pre-ordained, or at least not planned. There is hardship and triumph as a city boy and foreigner becomes accepted for the innocence and the audacity of his journey.What a wonderful road trip and kudos for the goodness to share it with us."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"LAST OF THE DONKEY PILGRIMS is delightful to read. Kevin O'Hara's experiences bring back so many wonderful memories of our own of meeting new people in different places, including Ireland. While we enjoy picturing Kevin and Missie walking along roads we too have travelled, their adventures would be a joy to follow wherever they had taken place. As one skeptical farm woman was trying to understand why in the world Kevin would undertake such a journey, her husband summed up the adventure as well as why it is so nice to share it by reading the book. \\"Isn't it grand to walk the world and chat with the people?\\"It is also grand to experience some of it vicariously by reading the Donkey Pilgrim."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I rarely write any product reviews, but this warranted taking the time. After being recommended to me, I got Last of the Donkey Pilgrims out of the library, and immediately knew it was a book I had to own - I wanted to savor every chapter for as long as I could. As Mr O'Hara takes his journey along the Irish perimeter, you are right along with him marveling at the Irish coastline and relishing the people he encounters. It is a laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, joyful work by an exceptional storyteller. I have recommended it to several people, none have been disappointed. Priceless, a must read."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"You know a book is good when you get out the highlighter to mark funny, poignant and brilliant passages. Kevin O'Hara's book is a delight on several levels. First, he is a fine and engaging writer with a self-deprecating wit, a wonderful ear for dialog, and a genetic genius for story-telling. Second, having traveled a similar route of Ireland (in a car not a donkey cart) in the same year that O'Hara did (1979), I can attest to his ability in capturing the unspoiled beauty of old Ireland before the Celtic Tiger yuppified its populace and condo-ized its landscape in the years after. Third, he pulls off an element of the book that might have been most difficult, the thread that this was a personal journey undertaken as pilgrimage and catharsis. This theme might have been cloying in the hands of a lesser writer, but he makes it work nicely.Each short chapter is a satisfying meal, a slice of his life on the road, full of unforgettable characters, spectacular vistas, adventures and epiphanies. You'll even learn all you wanted to know about the care and feeding of donkeys. Best of all you'll laugh your tail off, especially if you have any Irish blood in you. I insist that Last of the Donkey Pilgrims be the next book to read for anyone who hasn't yet had the pleasure."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"After meeting the author at a Celtic festival this summer, I just had to read his book \\"The Last of the Donkey Pilgrims\\". This is a true story of Kevin O'Hara's travels around Ireland by donkey and cart in 1979 when Ireland was undergoing a transformation coming into the modern world. This wonderful narrative is written with such detail that the reader feels like a lifelong friend traveling right along with him and Missie, his beloved donkey. The book is written in a very easy to read format comprised of numerous short chapters each detailing a specific portion of the trip. Though I have not been to Ireland myself I recognized many of the places described through the photographs and stories of my parents' travels around Ireland last year. This is a great story told by a master story teller, one you will enjoy reading again and again."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"For those who have been to Ireland and experienced its beauty firsthand, this book is a must-read. For those who have not been to Ireland but wish to know more about its land and its people, customs and traditions, this book is a must-read. We toured Ireland for the first time last year by escorted motor coach and visited many of the sites Kevin describes in his book. His description is so vivid that it is a feast for the senses and brought back many fond memories.Kevin's journey of self-discovery was founded in a promise to his mother to get in touch with his Irish roots. Not knowing where or how to begin this journey, Kevin becomes inspired one day when he spots a gentleman tipping along with his donkey and cart. At that instant his mission becomes clear and he undertakes to travel the entire ring of Ireland by donkey and cart. Being a \\"Yank\\" and knowing nothing about donkeys, Kevin undergoes rigorous training under the tutelage of Jimmy McDermmott, a master equestrian in his ancestral home of County Roscommon. He acquires his beloved \\"Missie\\" and though their relationship is somewhat trepid at first, they become lifelong companions by the end of their journey.Kevin goes to great lengths to detail every step of their way; the roads and paths traversed, the towns they traveled through, the people they meet, the sights, sounds and smells of the hills, dales, cliffs, glens, rivers, fields, flora and fauna. You will want to laugh and cheer in his triumphs and cry along with him during his trials and tribulations. I highly recommend the Last of the Donkey Pilgrims."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"... then this is the book for you! Through the astute and humorous gaze of Kevin O'Hara, you will again see and experience what made you fall in love with this \\"Land of a Thousand Welcomes.\\" Longing to delve deeply into the richness of his Irish roots, O'Hara decides to do it not as a comfortable tourist, but as a humble wayfarer traveling the lanes with his donkey, Missie. The places he describes, the people he meets and the experiences they share -- sometimes hilarious, at other times deeply poignant -- are a chronicle not to be missed. Funny as it often is, it is not so unrealistic as to avoid vivid descriptions of the hardships which were entailed in a whole year's journey around Ireland, including the north at the time of \\"The Troubles.\\" It is truly a heartwarming book which I heartily recommend -- and guess what! You will find yourself falling in love with Missie!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Nice book and a good story. It does start off a bit slow with a little too much Granny worship, but picks up nicely once they hit the road. It was a lot of miles to compress into one book and it's no wonder it took Kevin so many years to tell his story. As someone that enjoyed hitching and hiking around Ireland in the 1970's & early 80's before the great economic change, I can certainly identify with the hospitality he received. It would be nice if Kevin could get a photo book published to accompany this volume."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"At first it seemed a bit slow and I feared it was going to be one of those \\"Oirish\\" books full of Paddy-wackery. However, Kevin O'Hara seems to find his bearings a couple chapters in, about the time he finally gets on the road, and ends up writing an interesting, sometimes spiritual, sometimes beautiful book about his experience in an Ireland that barely exists in that same way anymore. My favorite bits were his evolving relationship with Missy, the donkey, the rare glimpse he gives us into the lives of a group of Travelers, Mr. O'Hara's reverence and appreciation of the countryside and it's people, and best of all, his chance encounter with an elderly woman praying the rosary after midnight in a field, just as she did as a child with her family many years earlier... that scene was magic. \\"Slan abhaile agus oiche mhaith.\\""},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"After attending a book signing in a Harvard Square book store, I had to read this book. Kevin is warm and engaging in person so I knew the book would be good. From the first page I couldn't put it down. I just had to know what was going to happen around each bend in the road. On a recent trip to Ireland I was reading it on the plane from Boston to Shannon and imagine my amazement when I discovered that Kevin stayed with my father's first cousin. Needless to say, the book is now quite popular among my Irish family members. It is a special treasure because the cousin he stayed with passed away a few years ago. This book brought back a lot of warm memories.It is a witty, honest, heartbreaking, uplifting and beautiful story. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"As author Kevin O'Hara rode around Ireland on a donkey cart, his engaging storytelling made me feel as if I were riding right beside him during his travels. I was amazed how far a roll of Kennedy half-dollars could take him. Everyone has a story to tell and author O'Hara offers the reader a vast collection of characters to enjoy village after village. This book permits you to travel all around Ireland without leaving the comfort of your favorite chair.

You are with Kevin the whole way in amazement. It would be a great book of discovery for young people as well."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I picked up this book because it mentioned a friend of mine, I didn't expect to be swept up in the tales of an adventurer walking with a donkey around Ireland in the late 1970s. If you've already read the bookRound Ireland with a Fridge, you may think you already know the story. But Kevin O'Hara is a much more stylish traveler with a true gift for painting a scene or describing the people he meets on his travels.I was living in Ireland in the 1970s and O'Hara's descriptions take me back to those idyllic days. This looks like a small book, but it's printed with one of the smaller fonts I've seen in a long time. So this gives him lots of space to describe the beauty of the County Clare coastline, or the ruggedness of County Kerry. And all along the way he meets colorful characters and learns about various pieces of Irish history.If you've ever wanted to learn about the real people or places of Ireland, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I bought this book on my way out the door on a trip to Ireland, as a friend had recommended it. I read it on the airplane and during quiet moments, and finished it on the way home.Not only is this book entertaining and well-written, I was amazed by how much I learned about Irish culture and history as I was reading.It is especially recommended to those traveling to Ireland, but has wide appeal for its insight into human nature, and warm humor."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I enjoy reading about Ireland, and thought this book would be like Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. The donkey book was much more serious. I liked reading about the different people he encountered, but at times, felt that it was a glossary of names of potential buyers. I did enjoy his time with the travelers. He exemplified the attitudes of the 70's, and I think the book would have been more effective if he had written it 25 years ago. Still, it was a good story."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Kevin O'Hara's epic 1800 mile journey around Ireland with a donkey is an amazing depiction of Irish culture, humor, historical pain, and generosity. Completing the book 25 years after his journey in 1979, O'Hara paints a detailed mosaic of an Ireland before the infusion of European Union money and a fragile peace accord that has halted the violence between North and South. With only a few pounds in his pocket, this American Irishman discovers his roots, his heritage, and bit of the Blarney during his trek around Ireland (albeit counterclockwise!) An extraordinary read!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I loved this book. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. O'Hara's descriptions of the Irish countryside, its cities and especially its people who gave shelter to him and his donkey, Missie. I found myself transported to the roads, farms and pubs of Ireland and filled with a desire to visit this beautiful country. The epilogue was particularly touching. If you've never been to Ireland, reading this book will make you want to go, and if you have been, it will make you want to go back. And maybe get a donkey."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Kevin O'Hara offers an array of personal adventure and stories to being among the hearts of the Irish people as he travails around the rugged outer roads of Ireland with his donkey, Missie. Kevin and his donkey endure an eight month trek through the abundant generosity of the Irish people while sharing the folklore, mythology and great sense of humor of those that he encounters. A reflective adventure, along with a historical catch of the best and worst of Ireland. Enjoy his travel and pursuit to achieving a goal so many doubted as you surely would enjoy a toast to Kevin's success."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"What a great way to experience Ireland and it's history. Period of time this journey cloud only happen. Donkeys are special travel mates and reveal their true nature."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Kevin O'Hara is the perfect traveling companion: curious, engaging, sunny, and honest. Missie the donkey was a lucky lady. I'd jotted down quotes but gave up when I filled a full page. And the opening of Chp 43 is one of the saddest but most beautiful things I've ever read. I'll be thinking about that paragraph for a long time."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I'm a devoted Celtophile, History, Music, Books, Movies and all my Irish family and friends. I'm a life long avid reader and Last Of the Donkey Pilgrims is one of the very best, most satisfying books I've read. Through the Author's mind, his eyes, his words sharing the wonders of the physical Ireland, the warmth, kindness and humor of the people, their indomitable spirit (which obviously he inherited) I saw a country I love but only have had a one trip exposure to. I truly admired his sense of security in himself, his ability to live with deprivation of creature comforts and his self reliance. His understanding of the sharing and reliance he had with Missie was a beautiful thing to see unfold. Maybe most powerful is his constant understanding, appreciation and awe of the gift God has given us of life and the world he's given us to live in. The essence of Ireland has never been displayed better.I enjoyed every page, could visualize every thing his eyes saw--nature or people---and it brought together all the elements of things Irish that have populated my life. I'm not a natural animal lover but the description of Missie and the day to day experiences they shared made me remember that God is in all creatures and we really can communicate with them if we allow ourselves to. It's more on a non-verbal and far more on a soul communication---a transmission of feelings on a level we don't really understand as humans unless you open your mind and allow it to happen. I was so dismayed that Missie had a few bad years but like us humans, life is not always rosy but we have the ability to have our fates change. Although Kevin had a wonderful family upbringing I'm sure his Viet Nam experience was the \\"bad experience\\" Missie had and like her, he survived, grew past that and has had a good life. There are MANY life lessons in this travel experience and the author's writing. This book will act as a reference guide to me for future trips to Ireland."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I'm not an animal person at heart, and really not a donkey person. I'm a nurse, like Kevin. His ability to learn to care for a donkey and come alongside the men, women and children of Ireland is admirable. He's comfortable meeting people where they are, like nurses often do. His insight into the human spirit helps the reader respect whatever made each unique character special. Nonetheless, not even the best nurse would have the courage to attempt this journey without a strong faith foundation. His story made me believe that God travels beside us and makes life fun and exciting, especially when we are counting on a daily miracle. I'm not sure what put such a crazy idea in his head, but I'm glad he shared his adventure with the rest of us. I'll read it again in Ireland!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"3-4 years ago, around St. Patrick's Day, I happened to listen to an interview with Kevin on a local PBS radio station regarding this book. At the time, I was planning my first visit to Ireland and the interview picqued my interest. It was not until I returned from the trip that I actually bought the book. I found myself immediately transported back to Ireland and I couldn't put it down. As I was reading, I kept my own travel map nearby so to closely follow Kevin and Missie's journey. As much as I found I couldn't put it down, I always didn't want the book to end. Kevin is a masterful story teller and makes Ireland come alive in the pages. I felt I was walking alongside them in every chapter, sharing the joys and tribulations of their journey. Recently, I read it for a second time after my second visit to Ireland. It was just as refreshing and enjoyable this time as it was the first time. While in Ireland, I wished that I had packed it along and for sure, the next time I will. It's a gem of a book and a tribute to Ireland, the people, and it's culture. Thanks to Kevin and Missie the reader gains a unique perspective and experiences the journey mile by mile."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"This is a fun story of a Yank's trip around Ireland with a donkey cart.

He is a great storyteller and the fact that he really took a donkey around Ireland is a tale worth telling! Since I spent 4 months in Ireland in 1979, it brought back so many happy memories of time spent with family and new friends. I felt like I was traveling along with Kevin and Missie, his donkey, and was certain he'd mention someone I had met in my travels. I only wish I had gotten to meet Kevin and Missie while I was there. 1979 was a special time in Ireland and Kevin brought it all to life.

I may never get to visit all those towns and regions of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but now I feel I have been to them all anyway!This book gave me an even stronger bond and familiarity with Ireland and the special people there. It was almost like I was there with Kevin O'Hara exploring all those towns, scenery, and country roads (and pubs) of Ireland, I want to thank him so much for sharing that with all of us!I highly recommend this book, it isinformative, entertaining and very funny, in addition to bringing the reader back to Ireland with the author as he tours the entire perimeter of Ireland with his Donkey Missie and cart."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Only from a genuine son of Ireland could such a wonderfully whimsical book about a pilgrim's progress across its emerald expanse emerge. Kevin O'Harahas been alifelong friend of mine, as he grew up in a duplex on Wilson Street, a street or two away from me in quiet Pittsfield Massachusetts, the bright and charismatic son of struggling immigrant parents who had a heady brood of children, an Irish Catholic family so large that Kevin, Dermott and several other of the O'Hara boys caddied for golfers to get extra clothes money when barely into their teens. As a fellow afternoon paperboy along with his older brother for the local paper, the Berkshire Eagle, I gradually got to know the family pretty well, although they all went to the local parochial schools while we went to the public schools. And what a family of memorable characters they are!Returning from Vietnam on the late 1960s, like many of us, Kevin was restless, and while attending the local community college decided to reward himself after graduation in the registered nursing program with an extended sojourn in the 'olde country', attempting to find his roots and himself, and hoping to end the wanderlust by exorcising it in the flesh. And though his leap of exploration took some explaining to his new young wife, he managed to carry it all off with a bit of blarney and bravado, setting out on an impressively improvised journey of self-discovery even as he discovered the Irish people themselves.Indeed, what he discovered while shuffling across the land in the company of a donkey was the stuff of first novels; he was soon became as Irish as the rest of the denizens of the land of the little people, passing among them as one their own. After lolling about a bit and attempting rather humorously and disastrously to apprentice himself out as a thatcher, he eventually devises an ingenuous idea, to travel across the land with a donkey cart, retracing a old Irish tradition and living off the fabled generosity of the land and its people at the same time. In so doing, O'Hara unlocked a lot of doors, those of the trusting people who thrust open their doors and their hearths to him (and his four-legged friend), to aspects of his own personality that he had learned to bury over the years. On many levels then, this was a journey of discovery and liberation.His footloose perambulation became a publicized event, both in local Irish papers and intercommunity gossip, so he often found people alerted to his approach and more than willing to exchange some food and shelter for a chance to both learn more about his own journey and the discoveries he was making about their fellow countrymen. Amazingly, many of the common folk he spent time with had never been far over the horizon, and were immensely curious about what lay over it, as to whether the neighboring counties were as clannish as they said, etc. So this psychically healing American-born Vietnam vet came to act as an ambassador among the Irish for the Irish as he wound his way through the valleys and hills of the emerald isle.I remember being regaled with such tales more than twenty years ago whenever I bumped into Kevin, whether it be at the local pub or just on the street, and he would always tell his tales with a twinkling eye and a storyteller's gift. He has been struggling to reduce it all to print for all these years. The fact is that he has succeeded rather marvelously, capturing the essence of a land which is too quickly evaporating from our midst. Ireland is changing, and many of the aspects Kevin describes so lovingly herein are vanishing. This is, of course, all the more reason to treasure this wonderful set of essays and observations from a fresh, vibrant, and singular voice, a genuinely Irish American writer from whom we all hope we can expect much more. Hope we don't have to wait another twenty five years for the sequel! I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"At a time when changes in the culture of Ireland began making the legends of the Tinkers extinct, Kevin O'Hara took his experiences with alientation from the Viet Nam War and transformed his close observations of beautiful people and landscapes into a remarkable tale of healing and insight. Much like the Canterbury tales, O'hara's stories are enlightening, revealing, and close to the balance of human truth. He has captured the essence of places and experiences that will never pass this way again. These stories read aloud in a way that will make anyone an Irish story teller. It is eaily imagined that this book could make its way into every night time story, livingroom book club, library reading series, and literate pub in America, not to mention Ireland, where it captured the attention of an adoring public. These are the unique stories of a very unique man who has been spinning these tales for decades from well garnered truths and enrapturing his listeners with soul searching, vision, and amazing obsevations that is couched in deep humor. This is a book that cannot be missed and should belong in every book collection in America as well as across the pond beacuse this is werhe we find so much of what we need to recapture the humanity that has fast slipped away in the digital age."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"This is an amazingly funny, cute, and touching account of a man's journey around the coast of Ireland. I toured the southern part of Ireland a couple of years ago and reading Mr. O'Hara's tale brought back memories of how beautiful the country is and how wonderful the people are. The book is combination of Irish history, geography, and humor.

After a long and weary day at work, I thought of what I could do to relieve the heavy burden of stress upon me. As is my nightly ritual, I cracked this book and headed for the home stretch, the last few chapters. With each chapter finish, my burden was releived.

Loved the ending with Missie talking about the years following the trip. So glad that Kevin finally got it down on paper. Bravo! I wish him much success with it."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Kevin O'Hara writes about his 1979 journey along the entire coast line of Ireland with nothing but a few clothes, coin, a ration or two, a donkey cart and of course his surprisingly unsinkable donkey, Missy. American Irishman O'Hara is a post Vietnam nurse who is looking to escape from past demons and leaves his lovely wife back in America to visit with his relatives in Ireland, particularly his loving grandmother. Virtually as a whim, strengthened by bets, O'Hara makes the improbable wish to travel the entire coast of Ireland with nothing but a donkey and cart. O'Hara does a surprising job as a writer and expert storyteller as he details his travels virtually as a diary from place to place. The book is truly heart warming as strangers along the way accept him into their home (or barn) with Missy in a barn or an overhang. With the aid of local media, many are forewarned of his arrival and look down the road for his arrival. Combined with a network of new friends that often give him an address, he often finds a place waiting for him. O'Hara captures the spirit of the people of Ireland, the history of the land and provides wondrous humor throughout the book. His early struggles with taking care of Missy are aided by many hands as he finds helping hands along the way. O'Hara describes with a heart the tragedy in Northern Ireland as he stays in both Catholic and Protestant homes shortly after the assassination of Lord Mountbatten followed closely by the Pope's visit. This is the tense part of the book as the RUG police as well as a mysterious carload of young men who may or may not be the IRA check on him periodically. However, his travel to any town, large or small, is generally followed by a meet the neighborhood at the local pub for a pint and friendship. His descriptions of the many families is interesting and amusing as he meets many folk who have stayed on with their parents as he describes the life of the Irish who are enthralled in their history referring to events in the 17th century virtually as recent times. Describing beautiful countryside and enduring barren stretches and severe weather, he and Missy walk over mountains and along bogs seeing sites that he describes in such detail you can imagine it yourself. This is a great book that puts faith in humanity and takes you on a mental trip to a wonderful place."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"What makes Ireland Ireland? What makes the Irish Irish? Kevin O'Hara had reason to wonder, and it let him to wander, led him on the wonderful journey recounted in this book, looking for the remote old Ireland soon to be absorbed into the modern world. Though born to emigrating parents in England and raised in America, Kevin felt himself to be Irish and believed that if he came to know Ireland he would wind up knowing himself.So, on the brink of age 30 in 1979, with a stint in Vietnam and training as a psychiatric nurse behind him, Kevin embarked on a personal quest to discover the country of his ancestors and the nature of his heritage. A wacky back-to-the-land scheme to become an apprentice thatcher fell through like an old roof, but Kevin came back with an even wackier idea: He would get a donkey and cart, and walk the circumference of Ireland, living off the land and the hospitality of its people.In peregrination he would find his position in the world, among the people he would discover the person he was, and in contact with the blessed earth he would find the strength to complete not just this mad 8-month journey but the journey of his life as well.So off he set, saying good-bye to his grandmother in Roscommon and waving farewell to the crowd of cronies at Rattigan's bar, elder countrymen each with his own view of the Yank's quirky quest. Bets were laid on the outcome -- would he complete his circuit of the island or would he fail to make it out of the county? Was he idiotic or merely idiosyncratic, a wise fool or simply foolish?He was touched to be sure, be it with wonder or whimsy or wand of faerie, but could this oddfellow circle the island and find the center of the eccentric, the heart of a divided country? Now, 25 years later, readers can decide for themselves, since the story has finally been published.What happens when a city boy takes a donkey named Missie for a traveling companion? When a nightly roof over their heads depends on farmers and householders met along the road? When even their daily bread depends on the generosity of the land's people? When the road stretches endlessly through a magical landscape of serene beauty and ancient grievance? What adventures and pratfalls await the wanderer? Where will the road lead and where will it end? The answers lie within &quot;Last of the Donkey Pilgrims.&quot;Full disclosure: Kevin O'Hara is a friend of mine, but I believe if you read this book, he will begin to feel like a friend of yours as well."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Titles described as \\"heartwarming\\" are not the type of book I usually read about Ireland, but the enthusiastic responses here drew me in. The beginning, honestly, was so full of blarney and begorras that I thought I'd never get past the first forty or so pages. It picks up awkwardly as if unsure of itself--I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it should not put you off. Luckily, the writing settles down as the pace of Missie and Kevin adjusts to their daily perambulations. It's a worthwhile travelogue from 1979, 150 nights spent in barns and farmhouses relying upon local kindness, and a thoughtful look at a nearly vanished, if much poorer, Ireland that nobody today--as the preface acknowledges 25 years later--could have believed would have slipped away. With slower traffic, stagnant villages, and loquacious pub chat, O'Hara recorded these now faded scenes in his diaries and recreates on the page over subsequent decades of what evidently was a long labor of love.Surprisingly few hostile or suspicious or rude people cross his path, testimony to his own savvy and also to the notoriety spread by press and word-of-mouth as he progressed each day for eight months, to arrive back where he started to finish on Christmas Eve. The religious underpinnings are gently compared, as when he fears to enter Belfast, as a Gethsemane, a fool on a donkey, or when Brother Malachy asks if his trip has moved him to grace, or when he finds himself falling into prayer on his long treks allowing introspection. The political contexts are also explored nimbly and intelligently; a game of pool in a pub turns vicious, a visit to a family who has lost a son to an IRA bomb is handled delicately, and his encounters with families for whom he's the first Catholic their children may have met speak more than the few words given. One woman exclaims as she adds his name to her address book: \\"you're the first one I've written under 'O'.\\"Having driven often all too quickly along many of the roads O'Hara trudged, it's also intriguing to get a donkey-level and slowly observed view of the Irish landscapes. He takes the circuit against Celtic practice, going inadvertently but symbolically \\"ass-backwards\\" against the sun, counterclockwise or widdershins, but manages to survive. Especially intriguing for me were his reports from rarely visited areas like the Belmullet peninsula of Mayo, the interior in Co Roscommon, or the Leitrim coast, all three miles of it. While I wish he would have spent more time in the interior of Ireland, he seems to follow the understandable preference of most travelers to make the coastal circle, and his accounts of the familiar as well as the less frequented corners are worthwhile. Most memorable for me were his night attempted sleeping in a stone circle said to have been the place of human sacrifice millennia ago; a entertainingly told pub-knowledge match that he--almost--wins; his imagined conversations of those following his trek from the pub where he began his trip; and his journeys up the Glengash Pass in Donegal and the hills that rise and dip above Dingle.For every reader that might be drawn in by the garish cover, another may be repelled (as I was initially), but despite the rather persistent touch of Oirish in the stage-dialogue that seems to be on the lips of every other expansive farmer and eloquent pub denizen he meets, O'Hara does balance these broad stereotypes--and you also read between the lines to learn how the Irish are playing their own clever roles as they meet the eccentric Yank \\"Mr Donkeyman\\" who the press faithfully plays up on his perigrinations--with efficient portrayals of landscapes and personalities. (I agree with those who have wished for pictures that should have accompanied these printed accounts; perhaps these will gain their own publication soon?)What other readers may not have noticed is how O'Hara does quite well in setting himself up as a \\"character\\" to survive: to play off not only the locals in hopes of a warm meal and shelter each night, but the visiting Yanks who gawk at him, and also the more aggressive boyos from wherever who try to knock him down a peg. He also plays off his role against the Travellers he sometimes meets or for whom he is mistaken, revealing again another often ignored or romanticized or reviled side of rural Irish tradition. He handles himself well in some sensitive situations, you sense, as his confidence grows and his bond with Missie tightens. Their relationship provides a moving coda to the tale, too.Since O'Hara's not a professional writer, his effort rings oddly more true and less pat, for you sense how long he labored to bring the right balance of stereotypical clever blather and slowly witnessed beauty to these hundreds of nights and pages assembled."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Kevin's writing draws you into his journey - a remarkable romp around Ireland with a donkey that seems human. I loved it. You could nearly smell the air and see the characters. A magical look at an island that has changed so much in the 25 years since his journey took place. I wanted to be there by his side as he runs into character after character. His book is the next best thing to being there.I didn't want his journey to end. Alas, time moves on and progress can't be stopped. If only there could be a sequel.Anyway, it is written in very short, easy to read chapters. Perfect nighttime reading. If you like adventures, humor, self reflection, and interesting characters - read this book. If you have ever been to Ireland and fallen in love with it, this book is a must read.

Having ridden my bike clockwise around Ireland in 1988, reading Kevin's book was a walk down Memory Lane. For years I've tried to relate the kindness of the people of Ireland, the grand unselfishness and pure hearts of my ancestors. Kevin's descriptions and prose did it for me; he captured in this book what I've tried desperately to portray in my answers to questions about my own round-about. Having just finished the book, I feel a bit despondent though my husband and kids are grateful for my being done; they might actually see a meal on the table now that my nose is out of the book.

The book spoke to, even roused my spirit as someone of Irish decent.Last of the Donkey Pilgrims was great preparation for our trip to Ireland - not only did it provide ideas of what to see and where to go, it offered a glimpse into the proud heritage and hospitable nature of the people we would meet in our own adventures.

It is my favorite book about Ireland - I've just started re-reading it for the fifth time."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"While reading this wonderful book, I felt like I was traveling the entire coast of Ireland myself, but without the necessity of the patience and resolve Kevin O'Hara exhibited throughout his trip. I had previously read his second book, \\"A Lucky Irish Lad\\", and I found his experiences growing up in a happy Irish family so refreshing that I had to read \\"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims\\". I thank Mr. O'Hara for sharing with me and all his readers this very personal account of his journey around Ireland's coast. He has an ability to convey the warmth of the people whom he met, and who so generously offered him the comfort of a good night's sleep, the sustenance of an Irish meal and the satisfaction of friendly discussions. A reader also experiences his battles with the elements as well as his alternating arguments with, and demonstrations of affection for, his fellow pilgrim, Missy. The fear and apprehension he experienced before crossing the border to witness first hand \\"the troubles\\" in the North, which were peaking during his sojourn, is very emotional. But then there is Missy! The more I read, the more I fell in love with his donkey co-star. And the ending of the book provides a marvelous and tear-inducing touch to Missy's eventual destiny. I only hope that the culture which Mr. O'Hara so fully absorbed, and conveyed so well, remains in the state he discovered it despite the years that have passed. But if it's changed in the least, we will always have Kevin O'Hara's reminder of the dignity and goodness of the people across the sea."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Kevin O'Hara describes his unlikely journey with warmth,humor, and extraordinary eloquence. The book meanders among encounters with quirky characters, struggles with weather and sickness, and with his own self doubt.Some descriptions are unforgettable, the old woman in the field saying her rosary to the stars, or the country woman who baked and fed rhubarb tart exclusively to Missie- the donkey!The reader can move leisurely among the narratives and be nourished. The book gave this reader a healing respite. I most highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"While planning our first trip to Ireland, I wanted to dive into a book that got me up close and personal with the land and her people. I could not have done better than The Last of the Donkey Pilgrims. Kevin's travels and encounters with those who lived on and worked the land brought him joy, hardship, humor, hunger, solitude and comaraderie. As he traversed the hills and dales of the Irish coastline with his not-always-faithful pal, Missy, he had something to prove to the naysayers who thought he was a bit \\"off.\\" But as the reader will learn, he found something within himself that was much more important.Treat yourself to this delightful read and let it, possibly, spark the pilgrim spirit in you!"},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I came across Kevin's book when I was searching for information about travelling around Ireland. I did not expect that it would offer me much, much, more than I was looking for.This book is a fantastic, pleasurable read. From cover to cover, the story contained within offers the reader an opportunity to be swept away to another land...mystical sometimes...beautiful in its landscape, and astounding in the generosity of its people to welcome a total stranger into their homes.I laughed often, read many passages to my partner out loud, and when the story took me behind the scenes to the hearth and kind treatment that Kevin received over and over, my spirits were lifted and my faith in humanity restored.I literally read the book three pages at a time as the book was so dense with interesting information, I just had to give myself the space to digest and savour words that sing.I highly recommend this book!As the Irish speak lyrically, so does Kevin bring to the reader, a heart-warming, well written, and courageous story."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"The last of the Donkey Pilgrims was a beautiful book and a great read! Kevin O'Hara is a true Irish storyteller. From the first page on he had me hooked meeting all of the locals as he walked his ass around the whole of Ireland. Comical at times and yet a deep, heart felt journey at a time of conflict between the North and the south of Ireland and also within himself as he walked with his faithful companion Missie his donkey. This is a travel book like no other.Animal lover or travel lover this is a book that is full of adventure and heart!Before I had finished the book I had already made a list of people I will buy another copy for. Yes I will buy them a copy because this is not a book a would give away."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Consider these three concepts/quotes on Strangers:The Irish held to the belief that Jesus sometimes disguised himself as a beggar and would travel from door to door to see what hospitality would greet him.Another well worn Irish adage states, \\" A stranger is simply a friend you haven't met yet\\"Blanche Dubois said, \\" I have always depended on the kindness of strangers \\" ( Street Car named Desire )Now imagine walking the circumference of Ireland , 8 to 20 miles a day, and relying on the kindness of a complete stranger to feed you and shelter you for the night, with no introduction other than the knock of your fist on their door. This is exactly what Kevin, and his faithful donkey Missie, accomplished 25 years ago.Mr O' Hara has the story telling gift... a true seanchai. His recounting of the trip is a rolliking tale. The simplest way to guage the caliber of his writing ? Loan this book to someone, then try and get it back. Just try. This is precisely why I have given Donkey Pilgrim ( and its sibling book, Lucky Irish Lad ) as birthday and Christmas gifts to everyone in my personal ambit.I had explored Ireland 3 times prior to reading this book, and discovered that I had traveled roughly 2/3rds of the route he walked, adding that much more to my enjoyment of his tale."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"I had the opportunity to travel briefly through Ireland last April - from Dublin to Galway, through the Southwest counties and along the Southern coast back to Dublin. Nothing close to this remarkable journey, but it was a great trip through the Ireland of my ancestors. When I returned home, my sister presented me with the book, \\"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims\\". I've just finished reading it. What a wonderful book. I felt as if I was walking alongside the donkeyman as I remembered many of the places and the wonderful people described in the book."},{"Title":"Last of the Donkey Pilgrims","review":"Although I don't have an Irish background, this book made me wish I had or at the very least want to visit the island.I usually enjoy reading history or a swash buckling adventure story , \\" Last of the Donkey Pilgrims \\" had a lot of history and although there wasn't any swash buckling it was a magnificent adventure. Truly A Wonderful Surprise!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The rule is to start with the good stuff, and I thought I had. Because I've read a few books by Michael Connelly, and none of them were bad. But I'd only read \\"The Lincoln Lawyer,\\" \\"The Poet,\\" and \\"The Scarecrow.\\" I'd had yet to read one book that features signature Michael Connelly, Harry Bosch. So, when a holiday and my birthday rolled around, I knew that was my chance. While taking a big chance, I got the first four Harry Bosch books. And despite a slow first chapter, I knew that my money was well spent! I'm glad I took a chance with the man, Harry Bosch.We meet Harry shortly after we meet the victim, and they are both found in a tunnel, and Harry isn't the victim. Harry knows the victim. And upon knowing the victim, this one is personal. The man he knows was a \\"tunnel rat,\\" just like him, and they fought together in the bitter war we know as Vietnam. And now Bosch is fighting a different war, and sometimes the people you love the most stab you in the back. And when Bosch gets stabbed in the back, he goes after certain people!In all honesty, I really hated the fact that this was divided into PARTS instead of CHAPTERS. But once the pages started flipping, it didn't bother me so much, because this was just so darn good! Just like the other Connelly work I've read. And if it weren't for the first part dragging a bit, it would've been perfect. But \\"The Black Echo\\" is just the beginning of Harry Bosch. And if the other stuff I got featuring him is just as good, I'm going to have to order more books! I'd better save some money."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've read rave reviews about Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series, and decided to give it a try. In short, I'm glad I did and can't wait to read the next in this series.Harry Bosch is part of the Hollywood Division of the LAPD, having been demoted from Robbery/Homicide. One day, he gets the call in that there's a body in the Mulholland Reservoir, which is his territory. He discovers that he knows the victim, Bill Meadows, from their Vietnam days. Instead of calling this one is as a drug overdose, which is looks to be, Bosch goes digging, and uncovers something much bigger.For the first quarter or so of the book, I wasn't really drawn in. I found it difficult to relate or even like Bosch, until halfway through, when the plot thickened. I think part of it is the fact that although this is the first book in the series, I felt like there was one before it that I had forgotten to read. Only slowly did Bosch's past get pieced together for the reader, but it was still hard to figure him out.The plot ended up being very interesting, and I'm glad I stayed with it until the end. The twists and turns kept me up well past my bedtime trying to figure out how all the characters ere connected. Connelly displays his vast knowledge of the Los Angeles area, and I liked reading about areas I used to live in (Studio City). Overall, the story was engaging, and Connelly's attention to detail is impressive. I definitely recommend this anyone who likes mysteries and crime thrillers."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"My first Harry Bosch book was City of Bones, which I read unaware that I was mid-series. I became an instant Michael Connelly fan, and have kept up with the series as well as reading several of his stand alone novels. This year I decided to go back to the start and read those books I missed the first time.The Black Echo is the first book which introduces us to Harry Bosch, a Vietnam Veteran and world weary detective who seems to have seen too many of the bad things in life but still strives to be a good cop, investigating crimes even when he has to bend the rules and go against the rules, frequently bringing nothing but trouble upon himself.The storyline involves what appears to be the accidental overdose death of a known junkie. When Harry recognizes the victim as a former Vietnam Vet he begins to dig a little deeper, eventually becoming involved in an FBI investigation that leads to a romantic entanglement and a complex crime that involves far more than murder.Connelly is terrific in slowly unpeeling the many layers of the investigation, and it's great fun to watch Harry gradually and methodically but the pieces together. This is a police procedural novel at its best. I have a few little complaints, some of the police characterizations were a little clich&eacute;d and over the top, in particular the internal affairs officers, who were a bit buffoonish in their stupidity. The romance angle was okay, I can see two lonely people coming together, but it never felt genuine. Outside of that I found the mystery entertaining and well plotted. The Black Echo is a great introduction to the Bosch series, which I feel keeps getting better with each book."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"\\"The Black Echo\\" is a debut in two ways - it is, apparently, Micheal Connelly's first novel, and it is also our introduction to Harry Bosch, a homicide detective in the Hollywood beat (after being busted down from Robbery-Homicide for killing a suspect). A loner and a maverick, Bosch is not popular with his bosses, nor with many of his co-workers, but he gets the job done. When he is called out to a murder scene where the murder victim turns out to be someone he knew from Vietnam - a fellow \\"tunnel rat\\" named Billy Meadows - Bosch begins another investigation that makes him unpopular. His bosses want him to write it off as another drug overdose and move on, but Bosch feels there is more there. First crossing blades - then later teaming up - with the FBI, Harry sets out to find out exactly how it was that his old friend ended up dead in a water pipe over Mulholland Dam.The mystery is labyrinthine, the twists and turns numerous; however, I must be reading too many of these, because I threw a wild guess out right at the beginning of the book that turned out to be (at least partially) correct. Of course, there was a good bit I never saw coming.I like Connelly's writing style. He doesn't start this out like it is the first book in the series. He writes about Bosch as if we've already been a long-time acquaintance of his - talking about past cases as if we should know about them, of past relationships as if we were aware, of past failings as if we were there to witness them. We're gradually given more information as we meet more people who tell us more about Bosch, but he remains shadowy even as we learn more about him - a mysterious figure even in the full light of day.A bit of noir, a bit of thriller, and bit of mystery and police procedural; I think this book has something for just about anyone who likes books of these sorts. I can recommend it - I'm certainly glad I gave it a try!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was the first Connelly book I've read and I can't wait to dig into more. The plot was intruguing and solid, the characters well-rounded, the exposition and dialogue well crafted and believeable. Enjoyed the entire book- can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I picked up one of Michael Connelly's books a few weeks ago, enjoyed it immensely, and immediately checked out several others at my local library. I've now read four of them. All, with the exception of \\"Void Moon,\\" were part of the Harry Bosch series. I highly recommend Michael Connelly as a master of the genre, and his Harry Bosch novels in particular.If you are new to Connelly, I suggest starting with this book, The Black Echo, which is his first novel in the Bosch series, and then reading them chronologically. So far, there are 11 installments, so if you like this book, you'll have plenty more to feed your appetite.Although a clich&eacute;, if I had to describe all of Connelly's novels in a word, I'd go with \\"gritty.\\" There's just an unglamorous, grimy yet edgy aspect of being a cop you get from reading his books...that cop work is mostly thankless and an easy environment in which to become disillusioned and distracted from the goal with all the intervening politics and oneupsmanship. It isn't one big fraternity where blue is the only color, and the threats from within the ranks are often as daunting as the threats from the street. There's also an everyday schmoe feel to these novels, where the characters are neither wholly bad nor wholly good...just like real life...and I think the unpretentiousness and realism of the characters and plots are what keep me coming back for more. These novels just read \\"real\\" to me. They're believable.With four Connelly novels now under my belt, there's a certain formula I've come to expect in every one: The setting will be wholly or partly in Connelly's stomping grounds, the L.A. basin. Bosch will buck the status quo, seeing inconsistencies in the first murder/death we're presented with as the story unfolds while those around him will simply take things at face value, seeing an open/shut case. Then, Bosch will refuse to \\"go along to get along\\" which generally pits him against his superiors at some level...often pushing the envelope to the point where he himself becomes a suspect or at least incurs the wrath of the LAPD, FBI, or whoever else happens to be involved in the case. Finally, Connelly won't leave us guessing until the very last page. Like a football play that you know is going to be a long pass, Connelly will throw the ball with quite a few chapters left in the book and the reciever will catch it as expected, but from there it will be anything but an uneventful sprint to the endzone. Instead, we'll get several unexpected twists and turns as the story often folds back on itself to reveal seemingly innocuous events from earlier in the story that will prove pivotal. The result is a deliciously satisfying mix of knowing what's going to happen and not knowing what's going to happen at the same time.Connelly does it all masterfully, so even when you know the basic recipe he's going to follow with every story, you welcome it like a familiar song that you've heard before, but played by a different artist so it always seems new even though you know the tune.Connelly never insults the reader's intelligence with plots that are too fanciful, twists that are too convoluted to follow, or a writing style that tries too hard. As a crime reporter for the LA Times, I have to believe Connelly had a seat close enough to the front row to really know how the game is played, and it shows in his novels. While novelists often get better with time, and I think that's true of Connelly, there's also something to be said for their first novel. They want to make their mark. They have something to prove. Connelly shows us he's got the right stuff by hitting a home run the first time he steps up to the plate.\\"The Black Echo\\" introduces us to Harry Bosch, the dark protagonist who is now the central figure in 11 other Connelly novels, giving us insight into the forces that shaped Harry Bosch into a truly noir personality. The author does this through flashbacks of Bosch's tour of duty in Vietnam as a \\"tunnel rat.\\" Coupled with the glimpses into his childhood offered in book #3, \\"The Last Coyote,\\" we begin to better understand the aloofness and brooding of the loner that is Bosch.In \\"The Black Echo,\\" Bosch realizes a homicide victim is actually a fellow tunnel rat from his days in Vietnam. What appears to everyone else as a simple drug OD by a Vietnam vet who could never hit his stride back home in the states, is -- in typical Bosch fashion -- not a simple open/shut case. It's full of curious discrepancies that Bosch just can't leave alone. Before long, the trail leads to a major bank heist involving tunnels beneath the city and pairs Bosch with his counterpart from the FBI, a formidable female named Eleanor Wish who ends up playing a significant role in Bosch's personal life as well as the plots of subsequent Connelly novels.It's a highly satisfying read, and for most who love this genre, it will be all that is needed for them to add Connelly to their list of favorites."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"If you haven't read Michael Connelly it's never too late to start (as a friend of mine recently found out). Harry Bosch is introduced in Connelly's first book (along with Eleanor Wish, the good looking FBI agent). The characters are realistic and the plot involving former Vietnam Vets who have found a new way of making a good living never lets up. The politics, the corruption, the desire for Harry Bosch to \\"fight the good fight\\" for LAPD comes thru. Bosch is no \\"Saint\\" but Connelly writes so well that you feel you literally know the characters as you read his books."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This award-winning first novel introduces the compelling and enigmatic Harry Bosch. Connelly is a master not only at creating a tight and suspenseful plot, but also at weaving an evocative back story. All the details have multiple significance: from the characters' names to the labyrinthine tunnels that link the war in Vietnam to present-day LA.After all is said and done, there is much for the reader to wonder about (and at) Harry Bosch. What does it mean to be a tunnel rat? Can a person leave the past behind? What really DID happen in the \\"dollmaker case\\" that sent Harry to the boondocks in Hollywood? How does that provide the key to his relationship with the lovely and sad Eleanor Wish?To his credit, Connelly skillfully raises moral and interpretive questions without providing final answers. Unlike most mystery novels, this one bears rereading. Like all great noir heroes, Harry is alone even when he is among friends and lovers. But unlike most he is deeply dissatisfied with his isolation. His longing for connection gives his character a rare poignance."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"After reading The Poet, I was introduced to Harry Bosch in the sequel to that novel; The Narrows. After that I read a couple of the more recently published Bosch titles. There were many references to these early books so natually I wanted to get \\"caught up\\". I ordered this MP3-CD audiobook from Amazon and just now finished it. What a bang-up first novel. Total score! Award winning for sure.This was also my first experience with Brilliance's MP3-CD audiobook technology. Fourteen hours of listening on a single disk. Sound quality was stunning. Narration was by Dick Hill and was fantastic. My only complaint was the excessively long chapters. Lost my place a couple of times and had to fast-forward through long stretches of narration. I noticed the next disk in the series, The Black Ice has much shorter chapters so kudos to Brilliance for solving this problem.If you are looking to start this series or, like me, came to check out Harry's humble beginnings, I highly recommend this unabridged MP3-CD (and the ones that follow it)."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I totally agree with most of what has been said in the positive reviews about this book. After only reading 4 pages I knew I was hooked on Bosch and Connelly's writing. I can't wait to finish the series.The only criticism I have is in regards to the ending. Making Wish a somewhat sympathetic character in the end was a bit of a disappointment. I really wanted her to be a hard edge FBI traitor, bad to the core. Instead Connelly wimped out on us a bit. Like I said this was the only minor flaw in an otherwise great book."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Black Echo is the first of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels and it is a fine introduction to one of the great detectives of popular fiction. Harry works for the LAPD and was once part of its prestigious RHD, Robbery Homicide Division, due to his prodigious investigative skills.Harry is also a contrarian who questions authority and doesn't mind poking fun of a stuffed, bureaucratic shirt, even one who is his superior on the force. Thus, when we first meet Harry he has just been demoted to the Hollywood homicide table, aka \\"the sewer\\" of the LAPD, where the detectives don't even rate their own desks. Rather, they sit at a long table, on broken-down chairs in depressing surroundings. It's enough to turn many cops sour on the job, but not Harry, who somehow remains a believer in the possibility of justice even though he recognizes corruption within the department.In Black Echo, Harry is trying to track down the killer of a Vietnam vet while struggling to manage his own demons from that war. Key to the novel is an interesting and little-known back story about the so-called \\"tunnel rats\\" who were charged with pursuing the enemy down through the labyrinth of underground tunnels that riddled the jungle. This particular piece of plotting adds depth to the story and helps this novel stand out as the classic it has come to be.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"After reading some of the more recent entries in the Harry Bosch series, I finally went back and started at the beginning. The Black Echo, by the excellent Michael Connelly, marks the first in what is a great series. Set in Los Angeles, which is described in vivid fashion by Connelly, this story involves a suspicious death of a Vietnam veteran and a bank robbery. Bosch has a way of getting in his own way, and causing people to dislike him in the LAPD. In this book, he is accused of not being in the \\"family\\" and is followed by Internal Affairs. There is enough politics and realism in this story, that it could almost be true. There are elements of many genres in this book; including mystery, thriller, a bit of romance, and enough grit to be a true crime novel. Connelly is clearly one of the best mystery/police procedural authors writing today. He has a very good understanding of the politics involved between local law enforcement and its federal counterparts. The Black Echo is a great opportunity to start back at the very beginning and enjoy the development of one of the most complex and believable characters in mystery series today. I rate this book a well-deserved 5 stars."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"\\"The Black Echo\\", Michael Connelly's debut novel and LAPD Detective Harry Bosch's premiere appearance to a grateful reading public, opens with Bosch being assigned to what is supposed to be a pro forma investigation. A \\"hype\\", a derelict drug addict, has been found dead of an apparent heroin overdose in a drainage pipe. The expectation is that a routine report would be filed and that would be that. But within moments of crawling into the pipe to examine the scene, Bosch begins to spot details that don't fit the accidental overdose scenario. More than that, Bosch is surprised to learn that he knows the deceased - Billie Meadows, a fellow \\"tunnel rat\\" veteran from Vietnam.From the opening paragraphs of the novel, Connelly's magnificent story-telling introduces the reader to Bosch's dark, troubled persona and his now familiar investigative style - doggedly picking at the unhealed scab of tiny details that don't fit, skillfully peeling away the layers of deceit on an onion that doesn't smell quite right until the kernel of truth at the centre lies exposed. In this case, Bosch quickly finds police records showing that Meadows was a prime suspect in a major bank robbery that fell under federal jurisdiction. Even though he is assigned to work with FBI Agent Eleanor Wish, their obvious reluctance to share information on the details of their investigation into the bank heist has Bosch smelling a rat! And finding the rat - trailing that rat from present-day Los Angeles to 1974 Saigon, into the jungles of Vietnam and back - the rat he knows is on the inside of either LAPD or the FBI, proves elusive indeed until Bosch makes his way past the final turn of this complex maze of subterfuge.The dark underpinnings of Bosch's meticulously crafted complex character start here - his disdain for authority; his unwillingness to fit the mould of the \\"police family\\"; the troubled nature of a psyche that is undoubtedly all too common in Vietnam veterans; his fear of surrendering to an unconditional love; the disturbing family history that began with his birth to a hooker who was subsequently murdered and his childhood travails at the hands of government agencies; the surprising extent of Bosch's visceral reaction to the murder of a street punk. Pathos is presented without pity or despair and Bosch emerges a very real and very human police officer indeed.Much of this ground will be familiar to veteran Bosch fans but \\"The Black Echo\\" will serve to bring an even deeper level of understanding to his motives and his conduct. For those that have yet to savour Connelly's brilliant creation and his mastery of the police procedural genre, \\"The Black Echo\\" is definitely THE place to start.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is Michael Connelly's first book. It features Harry Bosch, the LAPD Homicide Detective that Connelly has featured in over 10 books. This debut, first published in 1992, was widely acclaimed and won Connelly an Edgar award for best first novel.Since writing this book, Connelly has dramatically risen in popularity and many people consider him to be the best American crime fiction writer working today. I've read 8 of his books, and I personally think that it's true: he is the best, or at least one of the best.That being said, this is probably my least favorite book by Connelly. Don't get me wrong -- like all of Connelly's books, this book is well written and well plotted. In my opinion, however, the book is too long and really sags in the middle. I found myself skipping through pages, hoping for something to happen. There is also a romantic subplot in the book that isn't particularly believable or necessary to the story. I also found the resolution of the story to be completely unbelievable, and too dependent on a remarkable series of coincidences.I strongly preferred the two subsequent books in this series, THE BLACK ICE, and especially the CONCRETE BLONDE, which I found very well paced and exciting. It was THE CONCRETE BLONDE that made me a Bosch fan, not this book."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is the beginning of the very successful Harry Bosch detective series by this author. Of course, the basis of that success is the compelling figure of Harry Bosch, a besieged LAPD detective. He is not a so-called team player - going along with the spin of the day. He is hard-working, thorough, independent, irascible, and highly successful in cracking open hard cases. But is forever having to defend himself against department higher-ups. Harry also has demons. He had a troubled upbringing and went to Vietnam at an early age, where he became a \\"tunnel rat\\" - someone who descended into the darkness of tunnels to root-out Viet Cong, experiencing \\"black echo.\\"In this novel, Harry is on duty when a dead body is reported being found in an overflow tunnel near a dam in Hollywood. It seems like a simple case of drug overdose, but Harry is very concerned with inconsistencies at the scene. Furthermore, he recognizes the victim as a fellow tunnel rat from his service years before. He cannot accept that this is merely a coincidence. Harry teams with enticing yet demure FBI agent Eleanor Wish to investigate not only this murder but a well planned bank robbery of the previous year for which the victim was also a suspect. Harry has to contend with not only surveillance from Internal Affairs, but also the nagging thought that a police insider knows his next move. This is a well-paced, interesting story with an ending that places Harry back in a labyrinth of tunnels, but perhaps with one too many twists. But Harry lives to fight another battle with the bad guys and the LAPD."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is a terrific read that avoids the cutesy, smarmy vibe I get from many mystery efforts. Heironymous 'Harry' Bosch stars as an L.A.P.D. detective who's forced to battle his own department as much as the bad guys in order to get to the bottom of his case. Gritty realism abounds throughout the engaging story, giving the novel a hard edge that held my attention well. The secondary characters are well fleshed out, and Harry is superbly rendered as the flawed but sympathetic 'star' of the story. My only negative criticism is regarding the length of the novel, I think it could've been streamlined by 75 pages or so.The Black Echo deserves the high praise it attained (including an Edgar Award)- definitely worth a read!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Black Echo was the first book I read by Michael Connelly, and after finishing it, I went out and bought all his others.

To sum it up, excellent!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is the first and one of the best of a fine series of books written by Connelly. Bosch, a detective on the outs with his LA police department, stumbles into a mystery surrounding the death of an old Vietnam mate. This story unfolds many layers of complex plotting that does not feel contrived or pander to the sensational Hollywood over the top sensationalism... well not too much anyways. Instead, Connelly weaves a tale that harks back to the sensibilities of Hammett and places this into a mid 80's mindset that works pretty well.I would like to have had this story delve into the character of Bosch a little more, either through conversation or thought. It was a little on the cardboard side of character development. Instead, Connelly holds the reader with his nifty plot. That is why I am marking this book down a bit as far as my review goes. If you read the entire series, Bosch starts to develop, and as a reader you will enjoy the plots that blossom in one novel and take fruition in another. This series is definitely worth reading if you are looking for one, and I would give it five stars as a whole. It might be that only Hillerman and Block (Scudder) have better serials that this."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was my first Michael Connelly book, and after breezing thru this I know it won't be my last.

It involves old fortunes from Viet Nam, some very tough veterans, including Bosch, and a pretty FBI agent, Eleanor, who seems to be very helpful in the case. She and Bosch find much in common. Bosch starts out investigating the death of a veteran, recognizes him as an old comrade who had the same job - tunnel rat - and then gets told by the FBI and the LAPD that he should not investigate the case. As he tries to solve the first murder, two IA policemen begin investigating him after a senior FBI agent complains. Then a young witness Bosch tracked down is also murdered. Bosch continues to investigate after he and Eleanor are almost run down. Finally, he risks his life to go into a sewer tunnel after some bad guys and finds the primary bad guy. He solves all the mysteries but is less than satisfied.Because I read this book out of order, I had an inkling of some aspects of the outcome. That spoiled it a little. It really is best if you read these books in order."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The Black Echo starts with a body discovered in a pipe where Det. Bosch recognizes it to be one of his Vietnam war mates. What looks like a druggie's overdose soon turns into the case of a murder that involves a wide group of others, including high placed officials, all in pursuit of personal gains. The reader learns a lot about Bosch through his excellent detective work and through a minor romance in the story that for a change for many thrillers is a pertinent thread in the story. The thriller grips the reader and doesn't let go till the very end with thoughtful twists and turns. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"As usual, another good read from Michael Connelly starring Harry Bosch. Good suspense, good detail. It maintained interest throughout. Highly recommended escape reading."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've been avoiding starting the Harry Bosch series because ever since I read \\"The Poet\\" many years ago, I've known I would like pretty much anything this author wrote. And since there are so many Harry Bosch novels, I would instantly expand my TBR list by even more than the 750 or so novels (and about 100 series) I'm already involved with.A poor excuse to avoid a book or author or series, I know...but there you have it.So I had decided to read these books eventually...just not yet. But then I was watching the DVD of the second season of the TV show \\"Castle\\" and got to watch one of the extras that they included where Nathan Fillian interviews a couple of writers, including the mild-mannered Michael Connelly, who absolutely stole the segment. It was simply fascinating to hear his approach to writing and that's what finally pushed me over the edge.So this book was just what I expected: a good, complex mystery with great characters and well written dialogue and exposition. That earns it 4 stars. The fifth star was awarded because of the absolute realism I encountered as the plot unfolded, particularly in the way the major characters were developed. Yes, I found quite a few clich&eacute;s with Harry being a maverick cop with a past that haunts him, but Connelly writes him perfectly. Perhaps Harry is the source of everybody else's clich&eacute;s?Anyway, now I have a bunch more to read and time's running out!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I am not much on modern detective stories but I did like this one.It moves smoothly and kept my interest.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly has the gift of making plots lead to the unexpected - the twists and turns don't stop until the last page!

He is surprised when he gets there to realise that he knows the man. They served together in Vietnam, where they were 'tunnel rats'; the soldiers that went down in the tunnels to flush out the enemy soldiers. Some vets came back and found their way as Bosch had. Some, like Billy Meadows, the victim, never seemed to make it all the way back as a productive member of society.Bosch discovers that Meadows is a suspect in a large bank heist that happened six months ago. The robbers had tunnelled into the bank's vault over the Labor Day weekend and made off with the contents of the safety deposit boxes. The FBI is investigating, and Bosch is soon attached to work with the FBI. His partner there is Eleanor Wish, one of the few female agents on the bank robbery squad.As the team investigates the robbery, it becomes clear that it may have been only the start of a larger plan and that another robbery may be occurring in the coming weeks as Memorial Day weekend comes up. Additional victims are killed, and Bosch becomes even more determined to discover who is behind the plan. Can he and Agent Wish discover what is going on in time to prevent the next robbery?The Black Echo was Michael Connelly's first book in the Harry Bosch series, and the reader is interested to not only discover how the murder is solved, but to look back and see how the series originated. Bosch is the outsider, a cop not loved by the police organization he works for. He has issues relating to others but is recognized as a consummate detective, worth the hassle he tends to bring along with his investigations. This book is recommended for mystery lovers, and especially for Michael Connelly fans."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I had been trying to decide what my first purchase for my Kindle Fire would be.

I've become hooked on Harry and have been seeking out every one in the series. However, I have to check carefully for the crossovers because the author likes to mix first person in when using those other characters and I hate that.In this case, there are no cross-characters yet since this is right out of the gate. I won't go into the plot since that has been done over and over again by other reviewers. What I'll say is that this story captures the essence of \\"down below\\" as those of us that lived in the Antelope Valley use to, and probably still do call LA. I haven't lived there in forty odd years but still visit Palmdale occasionally and go down to LA. As a young child, I was born in a suburb of LA and lived in and around the basin until we moved up to Palmdale, then to Lomoc and back to Palmdale again. I've never lost my love or familiarity for good old LA.What I noticed for the first time, though this is the fourth one I've read in the series, is that the author's heavy use of street directions reminds me of the Saturday Night Live ongoing skit, The Californians. However, that's such an integral part of the atmosphere that paints Harry's environment and makes the story so real. Then there's the realistic, or at least to me, realistic police procedural detail, from the mundane to the specific. It draws me in even more along with the easy prose and narrative.Even though some of the paragraphs in this one tended to be a bit long plus there were few scene breaks and even fewer chapters, I found it absorbing. I would've preferred shorter clips since I read a lot during commercials. In this case, I was left in the middle of pages, having to constantly find my place and reread paragraphs to find it again.The plot twists and the way things turned out show the author's developing style, and we're introduced to a cast of recurring characters for future books. This is a great debut novel and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was a fast paced book. It held my attention the whole way. I enjoyed the different twists and turns."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this novel. I'm a big fan of the detective genre and I loved Chasing the Dime and Void Moon. I figured Connelly's signature protagonist would be a fascinating character but nothing could be further from the truth. Bosch comes across like a walking clich&eacute;. He's a burnt out cop. He smokes and drinks too much. He's haunted by memories of Vietnam. He's an honest cop in a corrupt department and the only way he can make headway is to call in favors. Of course, he's being unjustly harassed by those bastards in Internal Affairs. The only thing missing was the partner who is close to retirement.To be fair, I love Connelly's plotting and his knowledge of the techniques and equipment needed to pull off a tunnel bank robbery is first rate. That's why I gave the book three stars. I was just surprised to find that not only didn't the major characters, Bosch, Wish, Pounds, etc, add to the story but in fact they detracted from it. They read like the cardboard cutouts you see on the bad television cop shows. From now on, I'm going to stick to Connelly's non-Bosch books. In my opinion, they are much better."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Why does everyone love this book? It's received such great reviews, I don't understand.I read &quot;The Poet&quot; and found it to be quite enjoyable and engaging. So I eagerly wanted to visit more of Connelly's works so I started at the beginning with &quot;The Black Echo&quot;, however this book never captured me. I found myself screaming &quot;Would something PLEASE happen!&quot; Perhaps I was more interested in the serial killer plotline of &quot;The Poet,&quot; but it was a real chore to finish this one. Maybe it's the Harry Bosch character, or the slow plotting, but I'm hesitant to visit any other Connelly books now."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"With Connelly receiving so much praise over the years, I thought it was past time to try him out, starting at the beginning. I persisted to the end of the book, but it was a chore. The book started to annoy me almost from the start and never quit. Pretty words are nice, but for me, a good story, especially a procedural, needs a convincing, well-constructed plot and this one isn't. It is contrived and full of holes and ultimately unsatisfying. Way too many of the pivotal scenes, like the final confrontation in the tunnel, need someone to do something incredibly stupid, usually Bosch, the cop who's supposed be the smartest guy around, but instead comes off as juvenile and impulsive. I'm also beyond weary of narratives where everyone, but the \\"hero,\\" is stupid, corrupt, incompetent, self-serving, etc. It had already been done to death back when this novel was written. Now, it's even more tired and tiresome. The book also is just too long by at least a quarter.

Well, it does to an extent, but the protagonist, Hieronymous (Harry) Bosch, is so extraordinarily focused, and so outstandingly righteous, that it's hard to believe he's real. Living in Los Angeles, this is a concern of mine, because Harry is with the LAPD. All the flack he puts up with, because he's a loner, it makes us citizens kind of feel a little uneasy: The LAPD is like a large and legitimate Mafia, the way they spy on each other...or, on the other hand, they don't take the job seriously, like Mr. Bosch does...they have &quot;side jobs.&quot; Great! We have nothing to worry about! Cops like Harry are a fable and the cops who get fat and would rather be selling real estate are the reality!Anyway, all that aside, there's an interesting quote, when Harry and his love interest, FBI agent Eleanor Wish, are conversing at one point. She asks Harry has he heard what J. Edgar Hoover said about justice. No, he says, but he probably said a lot. &quot;He said justice is incidental to law and order.&quot;Is that Platonic, or what? Nietzschean? Hitlerian? Well, anyway, it's cute. It simplifies everything for law enforcement people, don't you think?Great book. That's why I'm not telling you what happens. Read it and find out!

The thing that &quot;makes&quot; this series is that Connelly really knows how the LAPD works. He knows the jargon, the acronyms, the politics, the methods, everything !

While there's a few elements to Bosch's character and the story in general that seem a bit familiar or even overused in these type of stories (lone-wolf, chain smoking detective that makes his own rules), at least the author \\"hang's a lamp\\" on some of these things in the story which makes them a little less troublesome in the long run.As for the story, it really sets up the pieces to the mysteries nicely and while none of the big reveals \\"floored\\" me, when they came, they were very satisfactorily accomplished. The story unfolds at a nice pace that keeps you engaged from start to finish and has all the elements you'd expect in a great detective novel and perhaps even a bit more. It'd be hard to talk about the story in too much more detail without risking spoiling elements of the story, but suffice to say this is a very promising start to what I'm sure will be a series that I enjoy for some time to come.The story is expansive enough that I could definitely see this working in a wide release movie though certain aspects of Harry's character might not be so easy to capture onscreen as you spend much of your time inside Harry's head, hearing his thinking process and often discover things right along side Harry himself.While I wouldn't necessarily put it on par with a Game of Thrones by Martin or 11/22/63 by King, it's an excellent crime/mystery story that will be enjoyed by just about anyone."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"1) Sit back in a comfy chair with a beverage2) The story really grabs you up front - Dead guy in pipe, how did he get there, how did he die, who called 911?3) Bosch shows up.

I'd heard some good things about the Harry Bosch series, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't even realize at the time I got this book that it was the first in the series. I wasn't blown away, but I found myself enjoying it more than either of the others I've read.The plot was fairly interesting, though it got bogged down by Connelly's attention to detail(or, more accurately, the lack of an editor). A good hundred or so pages, including much of the 'Bosch vs. Internal Affairs' stuff, could have been left out. The 'cops are crooked, especially in L.A.' angle was getting old even at the time this book was written, and there's certainly no shortage of material that has gone to this well since then. Many of the 'bad cop' characters just cluttere the story, and the revelation of the identity of the real 'mastermind' seemed a bit forced.I actually think that the Dollmaker case should have been more of the focus, as it sounds like a better case for an introductory novel than this story was! I understand Connelly eventually revisted that character later in the series, so here's hoping he gives the idea the development it needs.I found Bosch as presented here, to be sort of interesting, but not as intriguing as some fans of this series think. I'll reserve judgement on the character until after I've read more of the series(I have a copy of 'Lost Light' on my 'yet to read' stack of books)."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is an entertaining novel, though I did get more than a little tired of repeative musing by Harry.

We are immediately plunged into the investigation of what appears to be an overdose death of a junkie in a drainpipe at Mulholland Dam. Harry recognizes the victim as a fellow \\"tunnel rat\\" from his Vietnam war days and is unwilling to dismiss the case as an OD.As the story proceeds, we learn of the victim's involvement with a bank robbery, relive some of Harry's Vietnam tunnel nightmares, and meet Eleanor Wish, Harry's contact and partner for this case from the FBI.The reader is drawn into a complex labyrinth of murder, greed, and revenge that has its beginnings in the Vietnam war. Harry's investigation is made more difficult by his superiors in LAPD who seem to thwart the investigation and a pair of heckel and jeckel Internal Affairs investigators seeking revenge who want to boot him out of the police force.The action is fast paced and Harry is a very likable hero/underdog/scapegoat. The author, a former LA newspaperman, paints a realistic picture of police procedures and settings in Los Angeles.

I highly recommend this book and really look forward to the next one in the series."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The first of connelly's novels I read were several of his later, non-series books. (Except that all of them are actually part of a collection of overlapping character-driven sub-series.) They were mostly okay but not especially memorable. But I noted the high esteem in which the man is held and I went back and found copies of a few of his earlier works. This one, in fact, is his first, an award-winning introduction to the cranky, quirky, frequently uncooperative but always true-to-himself LAPD homicide detective, Harry Bosch. Harry is the product of one institution after another, from growing up the foster care system, to serving in Vietnam, to joining the police force. He's a first-rate detective but his in-your-face attitude toward the world in general tends to keep him in trouble and under investigation. In fact, after twenty years on the force, Harry may already be past his peak, having recently been demoted from the elite Robbery-Homicide Division at Parker Center to the homicide desk at Hollywood Division. He doesn't much seem to care, though, and he may actually be happier there. He can pursue his personal quest wherever he might be. This case begins when a body discovered in a pipe at Mulholland Reservoir turns out to be a fellow tunnel rat Harry had worked with in Nam. It doesn't take him long to decide that the apparent OD is actually a murder victim -- but why? The plot coils and curves and loops through Los Angeles and Saigon and the FBI and the Department of Internal Affairs as Harry, teamed up for the duration with Special Agent Eleanor Wish, tries to figure out what's going on, what larger crime the murder is a part of. And how is he going to deal with the two IAD bozos who, acting on orders from an Assistant Chief who wants Harry's head on a platter, get everything wrong and in the worst possible way. Harry's memories of the war and his childhood and his mother are a big part of the story and make him a very interesting character indeed. There aren't many heroes in Harry's world -- certainly not Harry himself. People are much too complicated for such simplistic judgments. The procedural details are deftly handled and Harry's ingenuity at interpreting evidence and taking the next step are fascinating. So are the departmental politics. Connelly's Chandleresque writing and relentlessly devious plotting, however (and unfortunately), are much better here than in his most recent work."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The Black Echo is the first book in Connelly's popular series featuring Harry Bosch, a world-weary detective. Connelly introduces us to Bosch just after he has been transferred to the Hollywood Division, a division that no-one really wants to work in and that for many is a career-ending division or the division to simply ride it out in until retirement. Bosch is one of those characters who wants to be a good cop but who sometimes slightly bends the rules or goes against the popular opinion of the \\"police family\\"; thus, he often draws more trouble to and for himself. (Bosch, in other words, is not \\"Dirty Harry-esque\\" but might remind readers of some of the detectives on the ever popular Law and Order series.) Harry is very much a loner both on the job and in his personal life.The plot for this particular installment of the series follows Harry's investigation of the death of a Vietnam veteran. Harry happens to be on call when he gets called to the scene of a dead body, which most want to write off as simply another addict ODing, but not Harry. Harry, a Vietnam Veteran himself, thinks there is much more to the death because he recognized the victim, a fellow \\"tunnel rat\\".Bosch begins to dig deeper and eventually becomes involved in an FBI investigation, which leads not only to a romantic entanglement for Harry with the Agent he is paired up with, Eleanor Wish, but the discovery of a complex crime that involves far more than murder.I had read The Poet by Michael Connelly several years ago and loved the book. Several times friends have suggested that I pick up Connelly's Harry Bosch series books. So, I thought I would give the series a try. I was not disappointed with this first book in the series.Connelly has a magnificent way of slowly unfolding layer upon layer of the investigation. It was fun to watch Harry not only go with his gut feeling but to methodically fit the pieces of the puzzle together. I think Connelly does a good job of character development within the novel, for the most part. Harry is the typical world-weary detective, but there are some wonderful little quirks to his personality and character that keep him from being too stereotypical. However, I felt like some of the characterizations, particularly of the Internal Affairs Officers, were just too cliched and a bit over the top.While not altogether surprised at the inclusion of a romance angle (after all Harry is a lonely man as was Agent Wish), the whole romance never really seemed genuine and it seemed a bit forced.Overall, this was a really good read, and I will be picking up the next installment of the series."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've been looking for a new author and decided to try Michael Connelly's Black Echo. This is a fabulous book! I will certainly be reading more of Michael Connelly's work. The plot was intricate, well thought through, and there were no loose ends left hanging at the end of the book. The characters were well developed and interesting. The main character, Harry Bosch, often bucks authority but is driven by a strong desire to do the right thing. Hints as to \\"whodunit\\" were given at the appropriate time and were not blatant. My only suggestion would be to break the book into shorter chapters...there were only 9 chapters for 482 pages...it was difficult to decide where to stop reading when it came time to put the book down for the night."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"12 discs14 hoursread by Dick HillFirst, let me say that Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch stories are the best series currently being published. I've read and heard books throughout the series and let me heartily recommend hearing the Harry Bosch books rather than reading them.Why?First of all, narrator Dick Hill has an amazing voice and he captures Harry Bosch perfectly. There is no one better.Secondly, Connelly's books really are well-written. I listen to a lot of audiobooks while I commute. Most are fine, but you can always tell the so-so authors. Their prose does not do well when read aloud while Connelly's shines. Combine it with Hill's voice and you have an experience, not just a book. (I'm not kidding, try it - I get two weeks of enjoyment by listening on the way to and from work rather than just two days in the traditional book format).So, it is a good book?Not just good, it's great.The plot is full of twists, turns, upsetting moments and even a few moments of laugh out loud fun. Connelly's strength is making Heironymous (Harry) Bosch as detailed and developed as possible while making the story move along. Gritty, bleak, despairing and all too human, this version of the L.A. streets and this detective are the best thing going in the world of fiction right now, in my opinion."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is only the third Connelly book I have read, after reading Echo Park and City Of Bones, I decided to go to the beginning of the series. Bosch is a Vietnam vet and a highly skilled detective in the LAPD, who doesn't like to follow the rules (when it keeps him from solving his case). After being called to an apparent OD, he realizes he was in Vietnam with the victim and has a gut feeling that it was actually murder. Eventually the robbery plot begins to unfold and there are many twists and turns, which is all I will say, so as not to give away any details.For me, the first 70 pages or so were very slow and I actually read several other books between sittings. But once Bosch's character met Wish's (the FBI agent and love interest) character, things picked up and it was hard to put down. Although I was able to guess the killer before the ending, I didn't figure out the why, and I thought the ending was satisfying. I didn't mind the Vietnam memories, like some reviewers did, I actually enjoyed them (although I admit to having an interest in the Vietnam war) and would have like to have more of them to read. Overall this was an very engaging story with excellent police procedural (although out-dated now) insights. And it is an wonderful introduction to the character of Harry Bosch that definitely left me wanting more.

Well, wish no more! Michael Connelly provides this in The Black Echo, taking you on a ride that you wish didn't end on page 482.When a man is murdered, his body dumped into a pipe line of the Mulholland Dam, LAPD homicide cop Harry Bosch is called to investigate the crime. But this crime is unlike others, because this time, it's personal. The victim, a heroin addict, happens to be a former \\"tunnel rat\\" who served alongside Bosch in the Vietnam War. It is believed and widely accepted that along with drugs comes violence, so this should be an open and shut case, right? Wrong! Bosch, who doesn't believe in coincidences, stumbles upon too many things that don't sit right with him, thus he begins his investigation immediately. Teamed with a female FBI agent, Bosch has to determine why this victim was killed, and what he finds out leads him into the past, into her bed, into the underworkings of the city where a heist is taking place, and into his own personal nightmares.One aspect that I enjoyed about this novel was learning about the \\"tunnel rats\\". As a product of the '80s, I didn't learn in depth about any wars until the late '90s. One, in particular, was the Vietnam War which ended in 1975, four years before I was born. Connelly didn't know that I had very little knowledge of the war, but he provided enough history and visual references to educate me on the underground horrors that the \\"tunnel rats\\" faced in 'Nam. That is one thing that I love about this novel. You don't have to know it all, you don't even have to know a little bit, because Connelly gives it to you as if he is educating, say, a child. And because of his outstanding imagery, it's easy to become caught up in imagining what these men, these \\"tunnel rats\\", must have endured: trudging through the confined tunnels which oftentimes felt like infernos, panicking as the stench or as the darkness encamped around you, not knowing whether you were going to be captured and killed in a booby trap, losing your sense of direction and becoming lost. If I were claustrophobic, I am sure that there would have been times when I had to put this book down because it was so real.Another aspect that I loved was the relationship between Bosch and the female FBI agent, Eleanor Wish. The chemistry between this pair is perfect, even though Bosch is a middle-aged white detective and Wish is a middle-aged black FBI agent. Connelly has written both of these characters so that there is no power struggle nor any racial tension between them evident. There are, at times, the feeling that the man has to take control, that he has to be in charge. But the two respect each other, and they try not to step on each other's toes. In fact, they find themselves attracted to each other, and that leads into another, different, world in this novel. While reading this, I thought of the interracial relationships of the past and of today. America's past isn't pretty, to say the least. While it was common for a white man to take a black mistress, it was suicide for a black man to have a white anything. Then, not so long ago, we saw the rise of interracial relationships, and it was still more white men taking black women, but not necessarily as mistresses. People still turned their heads and their noses up when they saw an interracial couple. Today, however, it seems more acceptable by society's standards. So, it was good to read a novel that reflected today's beliefs.One last, but not final, aspect that I enjoyed about this novel was the inner workings of the law enforcement world. Connelly has written such an in-depth novel where we are able to see how the different agencies work together to solve a crime. There's the LAPD and the FBI, but then there's also the other local law enforcement (BHPD - Beverly Hills Police Department, the medical examiners, etc.), and each of these organizations have their chiefs, deputies and so on and so forth. While he does use a lot of abbreviations, Connelly also, perhaps two or three lines further down, tells us what these abbreviations mean. That is another reason why I loved this book. It would've been hell to try to decipher what these acronyms meant, and I'm thinking that Connelly knew that as well. That is why he included the description of each organization, of each acronym and abbreviation. Reading this, I feel as if I have a better understanding how the law enforcement works, and what organizations deal with what. I've always seen them as a separate, secret society all their own because they have the duty of protecting and serving us, and sometimes I can't see how they're protecting and serving yet they're getting paid for it, but I have a better understanding now. And I must say, I have a higher respect for them now. Not as high as someone more patriotic, but I do have a better respect for them. But, as usual, there is always someone inside that secret society that looks to only bettering him/herself, regardless if it will hurt someone else. Connelly includes that aspect in this novel as well, and what you find here might just surprise you! No wonder he was voted as the winner of the Edgar Award for Best First Novel and that the New York Times deemed him a bestselling author.I loved this book, and I believe you will too, especially if you're interested in mystery novels. I give Michael Connelly and The Black Echo THREE AND A HALF STARS."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is the first book in the Harry Bosch series.

As I came to the end, I hesitated on where to go next. I've heard of P.D. James, Michael Connelly, Robert P. Parker and many others. I went and bought a bunch of different titles, and tried quite a few.I began reading the Black Echo, around the same time I started to read Parker's \\"Godwulf Manuscript.\\" I didn't care for either novels at first, and put them both down, would go back, put them down, and vice versa.The Black Echo begins slow, in my opinion. However, once the investigation starts rolling, things really pickup and the story gets very interesting. I found myself unable to put this book down. I am very interested in the character of Harry Bosch, the star of the novel. While I still find Kurt Wallander (from Henning Mankell's series) to be more likeable, I am beginning to think that The Black Echo may be one of the best mystery novels I've read.I'm finding I'm not into the old 1970's novels. The Black Echo, much like the Wallander series, involves an elaborate plot, that goes beyond a simple murder or two, much like in older novels. While I enjoyed \\"Godwulf Manuscript\\" and will be reading more Spencer novels, I am eager to continue with Connelly's second Harry Bosch novel. From the reviews I've read here, Connelly gets better and better with Bosch after The Black Echo, so I'm looking forward to some great reading here..."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was my first read of any Michael Connelly books. That being said, I was entertained by the book and eager to finish it and discover the answers to the mystery.For the most part, the book was successful in making me want to know more about Harry Bosch, the main character of this and many subsequent Connelly stories. When considering it for purchase, I noted that many reviewers commented upon the fact that there wasn't much character development when it came to Bosch, and in addition, they complained that he was the stereotypical over-worked, under-appreciated cop. I can certainly see where those complaints come from after reading this novel. However, I have a different take on them. If you don't like stories about cops, I wouldn't recommend reading this one. However, if you, like me, are intrigued by the idea of a police detective who has some \\"power\\" which doesn't really mesh with reality (meaning that some minor things that happen would not really be allowed in real life with our checks and balances within a real police department), you would probably be entertained by this character. And to the former complain of little character development, I felt there was just enough in the story to make me want to \\"get to know\\" Harry Bosch a little better.As for the story itself, it was entertaining enough to keep my attention. I became a little bored with the ending, as it seemed a little predictable after the first initial twists; however, I wasn't by any means sorry I read it. The ending was a little less exciting than the rest, but as I said, it left me wanting to know more about Harry Bosch.Bottom line, read it if you find yourself entertained by the mysteries experienced by the typical on-the-brink-of-being-washed-out-cop. If you don't like that sort of thing, you might give this one a pass."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The mystery/case Det. Harry Bosch is working on in this book could have been any case, and read like one.

Though meant to look like an overdose death, Harry suspects murder and is soon deep into an unpopular investigation of bank robbery, diamonds, and more murders. Harry is an amazingly complex character who elevates this solid police procedural into a vividly realistic mystery.

Harry ends up with the case, and there is more to it than meets the eye.It is a well developed plot and a well developed character. Make my day.

In Michael Connelly's first novel, detective Harry Bosch is introduced. One of Bosch's tunnel rat buddies from Vietnam is found dead and it is discovered that he may have something to do with an elaborate bank heist where the burglars tunneled into the vault. This is the third book by Connelly that I have read, and I'm finding that his books are consistently good. The Black Echo is a bit formulaic, but it's a winning formula, and like comfort food, I like to come back to a book like this when I need something familiar. With good characters, and a cool story, it's hard to go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"How dark can you make a police procedural? Michael Connelly pushes the familiar noir envelope into new dimensions in this dark-as-night-at-the-bottom-of-the-sea story. I call it a triple noir mystery because detective Hieronymus (rhymes with anonymous) Bosch1. comes from a horrible family background (his mother was a woman who rented by the hour and was murdered, leaving Harry to the foster care system),2. lived a nightmare as a tunnel-rat fighter in the Vietnamese War, and3. this investigation has enough darkness in it to put out a search light.The book's title is a reference back to tunnel fighting.Most new detective series begin with a character who is breaking in. During the subsequent books, the detective gradually develops skill and a career.Connelly does something different: Bosch is a virtually burned-out case who lives only to bring down the bad guys (be they in LAPD or outside). He's beyond the classic rebel without a cause (James Dean would have been frightened of our Harry). This story picks up on Harry after he's well along on a slide in losing control over his anger.It's the weekend and Harry's partner is out selling real estate. Harry covers what appears to be an OD by an addict until things don't add up. Pushing forward, Harry convinces himself it's a murder. No one is happy about it. But life is proceeding until Harry checks in with the FBI to find out about a bank robbery that seems connected. Harry feels like he's stepped into something he shouldn't, but the icy FBI agent, Eleanor Wish, attracts his interest anyway. Soon, the LAPD Internal Affairs team is after Harry. Can he brazen it out and keep his investigation?This story has more surprises in it than you would expect. Harry also goes off like a Roman candle at the slightest provocation. His \\"payback\\" often reminds me of \\"Dirty Harry.\\" Some of them are pretty funny, but all are powerful. You'll be cheering.You'll know something funny is going on in the investigation, but you won't be ahead of Harry in figuring it out. Black Echo makes for a more interesting, adventure-laden story that way.Very nice!Start here and work through the novels in the order they were written. You have some amazing treats ahead of you."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The Black Echo is the book that started it all, the book that began Michael Connelly's career as one of the best police procedural/detective thriller authors in the market today. I've read around half of Connelly's novels, so I know all about Harry Bosch and I know what to expect when I read a Connelly novel. Even though this is the first one in the series, and you could reasonably expect a little less quality, you'll get none of that here. The Black Echo is a great novel and a great introduction into the life of Det. Harry Bosch. On the downside, the novel is incredibly long, perhaps too long. But, overall, it is a great introduction to the series.The plot begins simply enough when Bosch is called to investigate the death of a drug addict found in a large sewage pipe by a dam. Turns out Bosch recoginizes the guy as Meadows, a former tunnel rat in Viet Nam. The medical examiner first believes the guy OD'd on drugs, but Bosch finds evidence that points to murder. While Bosch investigates Meadows, Bosch finds evidence that indicates Meadows may have been involved in a larger crime. This leads Bosch to begin working with the FBI and agent Eleanor Wish.Bosch and Wish together investigate Meadows and there are all the twists and turns that Connelly is famous for. Jerry Edgar, his partner is present, as is Irvin Irving, the IAD cop who doesn't like Bosch. The strength of the novel however, is the details of the beginning of Bosch's relationship with Wish. I've read several Bosch novels, but not the ones where Bosch and Wish develop more of their relationship. The turn their relationship takes in this book is really good and surprising and worth reading because of it.If you're fans of Bosch, read this book. This is one series where the characters really grow on you and Connelly has the talent of creating characters who grow stronger from book to book.

Bosch is a Vietnam vet with baggage enough for two lifetimes, but he deals with it by catching killers, keeping the monsters from terrorizing the innocent. For him it's more than a job: it's a calling. The latest murder he's sent to investigate sends echoes through his history, forcing Bosch to confront his past and make some hard choices as things quickly turn personal. The story clips along at a steady pace, and Connelly transcends the run-of-the-mill thriller by harkening back to such stalwarts of the hard-boiled detective genre as Chandler and Hammett. In doing so, the language pops and sparks like a live wire and elevates it to a poetry of literate pulp. Thankfully, this is only the first of many with Bosch behind the wheel and Connelly calling the shots. They make one helluva team."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was Michael Connelly's first novel (of 6 to date) featuring LAPD detective Hieronymous &quot;Harry&quot; Bosch. Matters begin innocuously enough when Bosch discovers that a dead body found in a drainage pipe is a one-time Vietnam comrade of his named William Meadows. It appears to be a simple drug overdose, but Bosch suspects foul play, and when he determines he is right, he is plunged into an investigation that develops into far more than a single murder case.The &quot;iceberg&quot; plot where a complex scheme is only gradually exposed is a crime fiction standard. Connelly is, even in his first novel, a master at this type of plot-line. His characters are three-dimensional and interesting, especially Bosch and his uneasy ally, FBI agent Eleanor Wish. Best of all, Connelly knows his territory--a former Los Angeles Times reporter, he knows LA and the LAPD (I suspect he still has sources in the department). The Black Echo is a superb novel."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The first book I read by Mr. Connelly was his departure from the Bosch series, &quot;The Poet&quot; and I knew I had to read the rest. I have read every single other Bosch novel and finally went back to the beginning and read this. I should have started with this one, its just as good if not better than the series and Bosch is a fully-fleshed out character who you can always cheer for. This book is also interesting because of its attention to detail and the police procedure as well as the first meeting of Harry and Agent Eleanor Wish, his mysterious future love. Connelly has become my favorite author and his books are a pleasure to read. Just make sure you start with this one and work your way down, it does make a difference!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"An absolutely terrific first novel in the superb Hironymous Bosch series, introduces us to Michael Connelly's enigmatic and troubled LA detective. Harry Bosch lives for his job, and the cost to his personal life and relationships is troubling.When we meet Harry, he has already been, in essence, demoted by being kicked off of the elite Robbery/Homicide squad and stuck in Homicide in the Hollywood division. But Harry is a pure detective, and will work every case with the same single-minded tenacity that gets results while alienating him from his fellows and irritating his bosses.A throw-away death of a junkie found in a drainage pipe would have gone unnoticed if anyone but Harry Bosch had caught the call. But Bosch, while having a lousy personal life IS a superb detective, and he sees what many would miss. Not only that, but the victim is someone from Harry's past which further prompts him to look deeper. Harry's investigation causes him to cross paths with the FBI and his conflicts become even more personal when he becomes romantically involved with a female FBI agent.The story unfolds with many surprises and the meticulous detail that we will come to expect from Connelly in the series. First rate all the way. A great beginning."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"After reading about a half dozen books in Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series, I decided I better start at the beginning and read them in order. The Black Echo is the first Bosch mystery and it's an amazing effort for a first time novelist. In fact, it won the prestigious Edgar Award for mystery writing.The Black Echo opens when LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch is called out on the discovery of a dead man in a drainage pipe. It appears that the victim died of an overdose, but enough red flags are raised to make Bosch suspect foul play. Not only that, but the detective actually knew the man: they were tunnel rats in Viet Nam. As Bosch starts investigating, he discovers that the victim, Bill Meadows, has been identified as a key suspect in a year old bank robbery. The robbers went through underground tunnels, and then dug their way into a bank safety deposit box vault. At first, the FBI rebuffs Bosch's attempts to pool information. But they finally relent and he is assigned to FBI agent, Eleanor Wish.As the case progresses, Bosch and Wish discover that the bank caper has its roots in Viet Nam and things get very complicated and dangerous. Bosch also suspects that someone is working from the inside and compromising their case. Even when he thinks he's got everything figured out, there is still an important piece of the puzzle still missing.I really liked The Black Echo for a number of reasons. First, the plot has numerous twists and turns, and shows Bosch's genius as a detective and Connelly's talent as a writer. In this book, we get a look at Bosch's background, which helps explain his motivations in later books. Also, The Black Echo takes place during a Memorial Day weekend. Since I read it over the same weekend, it made it more relevant.I don't give many mysteries a 5 star rating, but The Black Echo is well deserving. Not only is it a very strong start to a great series, but it has become one of my Connelly favorites."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"My reaction to this novel was a bit of a surprise to me. Normally for me, it's a given that if I don't really like the main character, I won't like the novel itself. This book sort of turned that on its head as I did like the novel itself but didn't care for the main character all that much.The novel is an interesting and well-plotted police procedural. The discovery of a body that seems to be that of a drug addict who overdosed turns up a very elaborate and involved mystery. I found the mystery to be rather inventive and fascinating in and of itself. It's difficult to discuss the mystery without giving too much away but suffice it to say that Harry Bosch knew the victim in Vietnam and that this past comes very much into play.As for Harry Bosch, I just could never see him as more than a cliched character. He's what I tend to think of as the typical go-it-alone cop with a tortured past. I didn't actively dislike him, but I didn't find him interesting either. It seemed to me that for as original as the mystery was, Bosch himself was one of the most unoriginal characters I've ever encountered in a mystery novel.I also felt that the portrayal of the internal affairs officers was cliched as well. I understand that the men and women who work in internal affairs are generally disliked by other police officers, but what I would really be interested in seeing is a novel that gives a more balanced view of the men and women who do what must be an exceedingly difficult job. Connelly's IAD cops are so ridiculous as to be little more than caricatures and the author even goes so far as to give the two of them the ludicrous names of Lewis and Clarke. Of course, this results in excessive poking of fun at their names. The portrayal of their boss wasn't any better, really, and I never understood exactly why he had it in for Bosch. I don't find the idea of cops trying to bring about the downfall of others cops a bad plot device--indeed, Elizabeth George uses it to great effect in her Lynley novels--,but there has to be a clear idea of just why the cops hate one another.Lastly, I can't help but nitpick when it comes to the dialog. The characters have a tendency to speak without use of contractions, and this rendered the dialog so stilting at times that it jolted me right out of the story. Normal people use contractions all the time, and in order for a written conversation to sound authentic, it really needs to follow the conventions of normal speech. Not so here. It was as if the characters were trying to play act at being characters from a Jane Austen novel or something."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Every now and then you read a book that announces the presence of an excellent new writer. These are great discoveries that are to be savoured: I get a shiver and my heart races with excitement each time it happens. The book cries out to be read slowly and enjoyed, but you just want to rip through it to see how it ends. Then you read the book again and again, just for the sheer enjoyment. &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; was one such book; &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; another. &quot;The Black Echo&quot; is a third. Michael Connelly's debut effort has to be one of the very best books I have ever read, and certainly one of the best detective fiction books out there.Connelly has an excellent eye for describing real life: his scenes are gritty and intoxicatingly detailed and his ear for dialogue is superb. His characters are memorable; writing with the benefit of hindsight, the Harry Bosch series has proved to be a modern classic. The old adage is &quot;write what you know about&quot;. Connelly knows crime (he was a newspaper crime reporter) and he knows LA; like the back of his hand. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story. Stick through his next, &quot;The Black Ice&quot;, which is very good but not as good as this, and then move into &quot;Concrete Blonde&quot; and &quot;The Last Coyote&quot;, which are also superb."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I became a mystery lover as a teenager reading Sherlock Holmes. Over the years, I've mostly stuck with English &quot;country house&quot; mysteries. Besides Doyle, I've read lots of books by Agatha Christie, Patricia Wentworth, Catherine Aird, Patricia Moyes, Margery Allingham, Anne Perry and others. I've generally stayed away from gritty, modern day, big city detective stories. More recently, however, I've begun to branch out more widely. A year or two ago, I got a copy of &quot;The Black Echo&quot; on the recommendation of a friend. After buying it, I had second thoughts and it sat on my shelf for quite a while. Finally, I decided to give it a shot. Surprise! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Harry Bosch is gritty, clever, insightful, and too irascible for his own good. He's just a little too outspoken and seems always to be in trouble with his superiors (nobody is stupid or tactless enough to expect to get away with provoking people like this guy does). Further, I hate to think that law enforcement people really spend as much time obstructing each other as they do here. No crimes would ever be solved.That aside, though, this is a good story. The plot is intricate and develops relentlessly. The characters are well-drawn and Connelly knows the details of police work. Things start quickly and the book is hard to put down. I'm looking forward to reading more of Connelly's books. This one gets four stars -- only because it's not, after all, Doyle and because it's the first book by Connelly I've read. I have to leave room in case he can do even better.

Being able to sit down and read the last 100 or so pages today made getting snowed in worthwhile. Another in a growing line of excellent efforts by this author, and just what I needed after the last (dismal) book I read (&quot;Southern Cross&quot; by Patricia Cornwell). Unlike that book, this one had an interesting, grab-you-by-the-throat-and-never-let-you-go story line; believable, well-defined characters; and an ending that wasn't telegraphed chapters before it came. This was a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the murder mystery/police investigation genre."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly's debut, which won the Edgar Award for Best 1st Novel, is an engrossing mystery in the tradition ofupdated L.A. noir. It begins when near-burnout detectiveHarry Bosch is called on to investigate the death of asmackhead found in a drainage pipe. Turns out the dead junkie is an old war buddy of Harry's. Other facts about the apparent O.D. begin to bother the lone-wolf detective, and what begins as a routine inquiry turns into a convoluted mystery involving the FBI, the Internal Affairs Division of the LAPD, and old secrets from 'Nam.Connelly uses a wealth of authentic detail and an intricate-but-never-incomprehensible plot to great effect,but the book is hampered by hackneyed characterizations and verbosity. In fact, Connelly's over-writing telegraphs many of the surprises of the story, especially when he tries to portray Bosch's thought-processes on the verge of discovery. Bosch's mullings circle important clues again and again, in Connelly's attempt at a kind of angst, until the reader wants to reach into the book and scream the all-too-obvious conclusions at the detective. The book could have been cut by a fourth without losing anything, and the cuts would have strengthened the tautness the mystery's spine.The character of Bosch himself is not particularly vibrant or inventive, conforming to all the cliches of the genre of wounded, lone-wolf detectives whose only saving graces consist of a plodding perseverance and a kind of reckless courage, although there is an interesting attempt to elevate Bosch's woundedness to a kind of metaphor involving a Hopper painting and the artist who is Bosch's namesake. The other characters are, for the most part, even flatter.Given that this is 1st novel, however, it is a promising one, especially in its detailed authenticity, and I would recommend it as a starting place for anyone interested in contemporary LA police procedurals."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly won the \\"Edgar Award\\" for Best First Novel with \\"The Black Echo\\", which introduces us to LAPD Detective Hieronymous &quot;Harry&quot; Bosch. Bosch had formerly been a member of the LAPD's elite RHD (Robbery Homicide Division), but roughly a year before this book begins he killed a suspect in the \`Dollmaker Case'. As a result, Bosch was investigated by IAD (the Internal Affairs Department), suspended for a month and demoted to robbery-homicide team of the Hollywood Division. As it happens, IAD weren't entirely happy with this outcome, and are waiting for their chance to get Bosch out of the police force altogether. Malicious ? They make the 'real' villains look good.Bosch proves to be an interesting character. With a reputation as being something of a loner, he's a jazz fan with a taste for coffee, beer and cigarettes. He served in Vietnam as a Tunnel Rat, before returning home and joining the Police Force.It's Harry's time as a Tunnel Rat that comes back to haunt him in The Black Echo. The book begins with Harry being called out to Mulholland Dam, where a body's been found in drainage pipe. Dismissed by other officers at the scene as simply another drug user who'd accidentally overdosed - and therefore, not needing any further investigation - Bosch isn't quite so and decides to run with it. Things take a more personal twist when he recognises the corpse as a fellow Tunnel Rat, Billy Meadows. Things start looking more and more like Meadows was murdered - an autopsy seems to indicate he'd been tortured before he died, while a pawn ticket found in Meadows' apartment links him to a major bank heist carried out the previous year. This bank job is officially being investigated by the FBI and, as Bosch believes the men behind the bank job are also behind Meadows' death, he arranges a meeting with Special Agent Eleanor Wish. Harry's intention was to request a sharing of information but he doesn't exactly get what he wants out of the meeting - and things haven't finished going downhill for him.Connolly's style of writing is excellent - a former Crime Reporter with the LA Times, I would assume there is a great deal of accuracy in his portrayal of a homicide investigation. He has created a very likeable character in Harry Bosch, while his descriptions of the city have left me feeling like I know LA. Definitely worth reading !"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This book is the first in the Harry Bosch series, and Harry Bosch is a great character. Off-beat homocide detective who you grow to love throughout the story. Excellent telling of the capers that he is investigating that gives the reader hints to the outcome so that the reader can solve the mystery themselves along with Harry. Well written, (unabridged audio cassette is very well preformed), and a great story all around. I'm looking forward to reading the next Harry Bosch book - Black Ice. Great writing Michael Connelly!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I loved this novel. The development of Harry Bosch is so good that you can get inside his skin and his head as you read the book. Ideally crime mysteries should be gritty, just like real life, without being larded with olympic sexual athletics and cutting edge technology. This novel meets that test well. Harry's sexuality is honest, credible and a necessary part of the plot. Bosch is a real detective, dealing with internal politics and overextended forensic tools. The twists in the plot catch you kicking yourself mentally for having missed the clue rather than having figured out the ending midway leaving you only to wonder when IS the protagonist going to catch on. The pace is just right. Connelly keeps developing Harry's character even into the last paragraph. The ending is realistic and definitely unromantic, just political reality. I will be keeping this novel on my bookshelf. This will become a great movie...I vote for Kevin Spacey to play Harry Bosch."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"It has been almost a decade since &quot;The Black Echo&quot; was published, introducing mystery readers to one of the best authors (and detectives) to come along in quite some time. During the intervening years, Michael Connelly has gone on to demonstrate that the promise showed in this book was not misleading. He has consistently proved that he is one of the finest writers of detective fiction ever.Before becoming a mystery author, Connelly was a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter for the Los Angeles Times. His experience as a journalist shows in his ability to grab the reader quickly with concise, descriptive prose. Connelly enables you not only to see through the eyes of his detective, but to feel what it's like to be in his skin. When Bosch has nightmares about being back in those Vietnamese tunnels, the author makes sure you smell the sweat.Along with Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder, Harry Bosch is the most intriguing detective in the mystery genre today. Connelly hits all the right notes with his protagonist, striking a fine balance between weary cynicism, vulnerability, and investigative brilliance. He remains endlessly fascinating, never failing to pique the reader's interest in both his professional and personal lives. The whole series (now numbering six volumes) should be read and savored."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I read &quot;Black Echo&quot; just after &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot; and was struck by the similarities in the plot structure. Fortunately, that's where the similarity ends, as Connelly is a far superior author than Patterson. The plot opens up nicely and is interesting enough to be challenging. There's one rather blatant flaw as the final course of events is exposed, but this doesn't ruin the suspense. Definitly entertaining, this book is perfect for rainy days or long trips."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an entertaining novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unusually descriptive -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking. (Surprising he wasn't the character needing a heart transplant, described in my favorite of Connelly's books (so far), Blood Work)."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Like the the word Echoooo in the title for my review, this story, though OK, was stretched out way too long. Based in L.A./Hollywood this story did touch on the freightening lives of \\"tunnel rats\\" in Vietnam and the horrible way some Veterans are treated by our society. The story was enough to keep me interested, however the action and suspense was lacking."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've read almost all of Connelly's stand alone novels (excepting Blood Work, but something tells me I will read that one day too)...Chasing the Dime, Void Moon, The Poet, and the Narrows. It wasn't until the Narrows that I met Harry Bosch. I tend to avoid getting into series if I can help it--unless I start at the beginning with a character (for example, I adore Victor Carl in the William Lashner series). It is mostly because I don't the attention span to go back and read all the novels in a series...who has time to read 8 or 10 or 12 novels when there is so much out there to be read? Well, the Narrows convinced me that Bosch was a worthy exception to my very odd rule. This novel is one of the finest dectective novels I have read. I'm stunned that it was a first novel. It is not very dated--except the complete lack of cell phones and computers--and holds up beautifully. THe characters are complex and the story easy to follow but filled with wonderful details that hold upon further review. What's next? Black Ice of course..."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I liked this book, but the revelations about a certain character's involvement in the case within the last 30 pages ruined it for me. It was way too farfetched and just not right."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Connelly's prose is excellent, and I enjoyed reading a story set in the Los Angeles of my youth, but this story failed to engage me otherwise. The tone of the story is very grim, and I found myself constantly putting this book down and hoping it would end.Despite Harry Bosch's intriguing name, at his core he seems to be a cookie-cutter hard-boiled detective. From the other reviews I have read, it is possible that he becomes more interesting in later novels, but I probably will not continue to read this series. Most of the characters in this novel were flat and uninteresting, with the exception of Sharkey, who was still a fairly unsympathetic character.Although the mystery plot was intriguing, some of the sub-plots were not. These elements play out more as cliches than real sub-plots. Harry's bosses, and the Internal Affairs people seem to be unnecessarily antagonistic towards him and Harry develops an improbable romance with an FBI agent. These are merely cliches, and seem inexplicable within the novel's context.While the investigation seems to make sense as you're reading, the denouement strains credibility when the author tries to tie up all of the loose ends with a contrived twist."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Gotta read it if you like Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly.

The character of Harry Bouch is a very interesting one and is expanding as your read. From beginning to the last word I was totally engrossed in the story.

The writer did a very good sketch of Bosch that I could definitely visualize him and his moves. I liked the plot and the pace. Even though you, as a reader, may closely guess how the chips will fall in the end (note - there are a few surprises), it does not deter from the desire to read up to the conclusion. This is a good read - but maybe not enough for me to be a fan of the entire series."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"A dead man found in a tunnel is initially dismissed by the first responders as just another junkie who overdosed, with the exception of Harry Bosch, who noticed discrepancies in the crime scene that would indicate what the others have assumed. On closer examination of the corpse, Harry realizes that he knows the dead man, that he had served with him during the Vietnam War and that he was a member of a group known as the tunnel rats.Harry's tenaciousness is not appreciated from his own homicide department, to the FBI and especially not to individuals in Internal Affairs. With distrust from almost every corner and obstacles placed deliberately in his way, it takes Harry's craftiness, some luck and a whole lot of scheming and good detective work for him to tie the dead man to a bank heist, a Vietnamese police captain and eventually to the reason behind the chain of events that had taken place, which involved several murders.There are enough twists in the plot to keep the reader guessing until the very end."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've recently gotten hooked on Michael Connelly detective novels. This is a really good one.

It some long stretches of musing as well as inner conflicts. Toward the ending it began to get in the main story line and was a exciting read. I got the inner turmoil early on but felt it had been addressed but just a lot of rehashing. The main characters were interesting enough, just felt the ending was a little too tied up with unbelievable twists."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've read later books in this series, but this has to be the best. This is the first in the Harry Bosch series. It starts with a dead body in a drainpipe. The victim has ties to Harry when he was in Vietnam. Great plot, great characters, twists and turns to the plot. A Great Read."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I have to begin by mentioning my favourite aspect about Connelly's novels. His descriptions are crisp and allow the reader to stay enthralled in the book. Never does he take more than a paragraph to change the scene or describe something pertinent to the plot. There are no run-on lists or Byzantine room layouts. For the majority of the locales (the sewer pipe adjacent to the reservoir, the FBI and LAPD offices, etc) he gives a sharp and trenchant description of the investigators, which readers are easily able to use as a springboard to fill in the missing puzzle pieces in their imagination. This sucks the reader in and at the very least, makes the simple act of reading a novel into an adventure. I never once rolled my eyes, imploring the pace to pick up.The layout of the novel itself is not what you would expect from a thriller. Instead of forty or so chapters with hints being dropped through a cheese grater, each day is comprised of 40-60 pages. At first I found this daunting, but the incredible detail that Connelly inserts into the investigation, from the extensive crime scene cataloging, to the autopsy and things that stick out like ice cream on spaghetti, does a brilliant job of dragging readers along for the investigation. One cannot help but empathise for the sorry state of law enforcement politics, and while some are able to make a comfortable living through \\"hobbies\\" such as selling real estate, Bosch is not one of them, and is still dragged around by the apparitions of his Vietnam War induced PTSD.Which brings me to the protagonist - he certainly isn't one of your clean-shaven, stereotypical and methodical detectives who is surrounded by bumbling assistants and yet manages to thoughtfully sift through the evidence until the means and motives behind the crime become apparent. His vices include cigarettes and beer, his temper is on a knife's edge and connected to a considerable amount of dynamite, and he is willing to openly flout departmental guidelines. This is quite understandable as murder trails become cold very rapidly. Arrogance combined with resourcefulness and a keen knack for connecting dots between apparently unrelated cases and evidence is usually enough for him to get his way.Furthermore, having Bosch as a veteran cop allows Connelly to plant seeds of intrigue - details regarding a previous case, the Dollmaker murders, lead to his suspension and later suspicion under the unblinking eyes of IAD. This also allows the author to avoid spending time on boring and possibly long-winded police training sessions. Instead, the results are provided for us to observe in the exploits of Bosch, Wish, Edgar, Lieutenant Harvey, Assistant Chief Irwin Irving and others. Most are unforgettable after a single description, and none of them are boring.The first saplings of romance begin to bloom just before the midway point of the story and the investigation. There are inklings of a follow-up thread in later novels, but even so, this book stands alone as one of the pinnacles of crime thrillers. As an apotheosis of the genre, it is not only well-written and accessible to non-cops, but blurs the line between right and wrong in several ways. I am currently listening to an audiobook for The Black Ice, and I am not disappointed so far.If only Hollywood would stop lazing about and make more movies featuring Bosch and Haller."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I always liked Michael Connelly's books. He is a master in mixing the right amount of suspense, action, and art. This book is no exception!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I never tire of Harry Bosch, the character is what most of us men asprire to, a man's man with a conscience and a soul. This novel really brings the reader to Harry's soul, tells us why Harry is the man he's become, formed by his hours spent underground in the, \\"Black Echo\\". Sure there are tidbits here and there in previous Bosch novels but this one really puts the reader into Harry's nightmares. Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, mainly because he is able to hook me with characters like Harry Bosch and Michael Haller, very believable and always leaving me wanting more. Thank you Mr. Connelly for satisfying me once again."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I really enjoy reading Michael Connelly. Everyone is a page turner that I have finished before I know it. Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I got hooked on Michael Connelly after reading \\"The Poet\\" and \\"Blood Work.\\" Figuring that those were standalone books (though some of the characters, such as Rachael Walling and Terry McCaleb feature in later Bosch novels) I would try his Harry Bosch series of mysteries/police procedurals. This is the first book in the series, it deals with Bosch being busted down to Hollywood homicide from the elite LAPD robbery/homicide division, and the happenings of an investigation that begins with a dead body in a drain pipe at the Mulholland Dam. I won't ruin the surprises or plot twists, but it is safe to say that if you are a fan of gritty mysteries with tough-as-nails gumshoes, Harry and his story will enthrall you."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was first time I read Harry Bosch and Michael Connelly.

Just ordered Trunk Music, The Poet & Concrete Blond to enjoy while on my 3 week wedding/honeymoon journey!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This book is hard to put down. It provides more entertainment than a quick read. It engages you, and you don't skip through."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"It took me a long time to finally get acquainted with Harry Bosch, and it wasn't a minute two soon. I really loved this book and plan to read the entire series -- hopefully in order though I'm not sure that is really necessary for maximum enjoyment. Connelly is such a great writer, he just makes the story flow in a way that grabs you all the way."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The good: Harry Bosch is a detective with whom it is easy to sympathize. His sidekick, Eleanor Wish also makes for an interesting character. The story is full of action and doesn't ever drag on. If you dislike Los Angeles, you'll agree with how Connelly describes the city - and I happen to not like LA very much. It maintained my interest throughout the book; in fact, it felt more like watching a cop action movie than reading a novel. Good plot twists and a nice sense of tension leading up to the climax of the story.The bad: The dialogue was occasionally quite cliched. Outside of Bosch and Wish, most characters were too cardboard for my liking - this was the downside to seeming very movie-like. Yes, I get it that there are some buffoons in law enforcement administration and internal affairs, but these characters had zero depth.Definitely worth the 99 cents I paid for it but at full list price, I don't know..."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Short and sweet: Typical Connelly with a terrific plot and characters.

But Black Echo was really disappointing. Way too long. Too detailed. I get more empathy and description out of a character in one page of Robert Crais than with Harry Bosch. I'm hoping the others are better, and I'll give second in series a try. Do they get better?"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The main story thread was good, but the book was too long, the story was overshadowed by clich&eacute;s, had many inconsistencies and a sappy ending.Harry the maverick cop (how many times have we read about these guys) carrying an SW 9mm? Never, it's too light weight, try an HK 357 or a Para 40. Then at the end of the story we find it is a revolver (SW makes no 9mm revolvers, does anybody???)Harry the maverick beer guzzling smoker is paired with the fastidious water drinking, anti smoking by the book FBI agent Wish (of course she is beautiful). Then we are supposed to believe that she is ready to share her bed after three days (Harry should be getting suspicious).Harry is trailed by a pair of dumb IAD cops. Why, in these types of stories, is every cop, but the hero (and his female counter part) stupid, or corrupt?The ending is sappy. Harry loves to bust bad cops and expose corruption in the force so why would he let Wish of easy?We know Harry is a hero; he has been built up to be this bigger than life character so, for my ending, try a twist. Let Wish blow away the last bad guy, but then let Harry find out that she is no angel as she pushes him over into the sewer water to drown. No one can trace her to the robberies and murders so, let Wish carry the series.With some good editing (chop the book down by 40%) to tighten up the story and remove the clich&eacute;s, Black Echo would be memorable and worthy of an award."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I found myself interested in the main character, the L.A. community which is an integral 'character' in the story and the well-written supporting characters and street scenes. I read one reviewer's comment that many of these scenes were cliched; what that reviewer overlooked is the timing of when the book was written--14 years ago."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I am writing this review again, as I tried to send the first one, actually, preview it, and had trouble. This is the first in the series featuring Harry Bosch, LA police detective. Gritty story, good characters. I bought the Brilliance Audio edition but had a problem with tape 5, which they're correcting. It features the investigation of a murdered man, who was a fellow Vietnam Veteran; who was dubbed a \\"tunnel rat\\", like Bosch. He has an interesting relationship with his female partner and except for the problem at the end was a great story; well read by Dick Hill. [My apologies to readers of this review, as it wasn't as good as the first one I had written, but an error screwed it up, and I'm going to contact Amazon if it keeps happening]."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"\\"The Black Echo\\" is about L.A. detective Harry Bosch and F.B.I. agent Eleanor Wish, who, not so coincidentally, become involved in the death of a man Harry once knew in Vietnam. They set out to solve a death that appears to be a suicide overdose, but to Harry's perspicacious eyes have see too many in congruencies to be content with appearances.The story is well-hewn, but not as taut, as some of the other Bosch novels. Parts VI, VII, and VIII (about 100-200 pages, depending on edition) especially could be radically reduced with a finer sheen. The story sort of drags to bring in some characters that have only incidental merit to the overall plot.As a Californian, I knew many of the acronyms and numerical titles for PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), 405 (San Diego Freeway), 10 (Santa Monica Freeway), but Connelly uses these shorthand equivalents in a way that might make the distant reader feel confused. He's given to using these initials in the text (such as O.M. for Old Man), that's rather offputting.Overall recommended."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This being my 4th Michael Connelly novel, was not as good as the other three. I think that it was still a good novel, but just not great! I have read so many books that I get kinda critical. But, if you are a veteran of the Vietnam War, then you might find it interesting with all the underground tunnel warfare tactics. It turned out to have a good ending, but I didn't think that Mr. Connelly needed to have Ms. Wish involved with the conspiracy, since she was such a likeable character throughout the entire book. If I were you, buy &quot;The Poet,&quot; probably my favorite Michael Connelly novel."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"again, annother great read. This was a very good read, and I had a really hard time putting it down. He really is a great writer."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The book'll never hook you to the main story. At first you'll be thrilled with the story but as you read on and on you'll get bored. The book's end is childish, I mean why the stiff was killed.

Read the other books instead of this one."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"second in the series, still about 8 pages into it, so not sure why they asked me to write a review after I got the book just 4 hours ago...oh well, happy days...eh?"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"After reading other connelly novels i decided to get others in the bosch series. The book was very fast paced and a good read but i found the outcome and criminal slightly predictable. The reason for the crimes seemed a slight reach and additional info seemed unnecessary.

The ending of the novel is directly from several action movies over the past twenty years, however this does little to detract from the overall excellence of the book. Bosch is a tough cop and a character that is easy to sympathize with as he works against the bad guys and the good guys to solve the case. A loose cannon in every respect, Bosch works by his own code of ethics. Although this is not Connelly's best work, one would be hard pressed to not say that it shows promise, and no one should let this book escape their attention."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly seems to be a modern and more down to earth re-incarnation of Agatha Christie. His plots are very well constructed, and he always manages to give the story a new twist, even after you think &quot;that was it&quot;. And his characters are developped very realistically and each of them a psychological study in itself. They are all characters that could live next door. The action is never a cheap appeal to primitive instincts but a result of a breath-taking plot and credible characters. A great novel!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"With cop novels based in Los Angeles you immediately compare to Joseph Wambaugh.

A worthy book if you like this sort of story."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I'm a long time fan of Connelly and not one of his books did I dislike.

Outstanding by any standard, as a first novel it is truly remarkable. The author creates four-dimensional characters that catch at the imagination and populate credible environments, in a gritty tale of death and deception. The twists and turns of the plot are symbolised by the maze of underground passages that Harry Bosch, L.A. detective and erstwhile Vietnam War tunnel rat, must penetrate to solve a case that will link his past with his present. Great read, great write, recommended!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly is a master at getting your attention and holding it until the last word. He uses all his knowledge and know-how from his crime reporter background to weave a tale full of mystery, intrigue and surprise. You cannot outguess him! His character Hieronymus Bosch is a genius at what he does, a homicide detective, and Connelly tells us just enough to keep us wondering what the next twist and turn will be. All the emotions are played when it comes to Bosch - you cannot help but join forces with this complex, super-smart detective. Connelly won the Edgar Award for this book.

It is a good story. My only complaint is that the chapters are so long. That isn't much of a complaint."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Seeing as how there are countless books from Michael Connelly, I decided to start at the beginning. The Black Echo, the first in the series starring detective Harry Bosch, is a good start to the series. It isn't really groundbreaking material, since the formula is pretty basic in the crime genre: murder mystery must be solved, mystery is entangled with plot twists, detective must break some rules in order to completely solve mystery. But what makes up for it is Connelly's slick writing. His handling of dialogue is pretty clever, and the details surrounding the LAPD, FBI, and Los Angeles in general are very fascinating. Plus, it's always a treat to read about places that I have never explored in Southern California such as Malibu & Little Saigon in Westminster (at least in the 90's, anyway). I did have two problems with this book, however. The love interest that is part of the story isn't really interesting. It bogged the story down, even if it was relevant to the plot. The other problem I had were the characters Lewis & Clarke (yes, they are named after the explorers from the early 19th Century). These two people from the Internal Affairs Department brought some unnecessary verbal comedy in the middle of the book. It doesn't really blend with the somber tone of many scenes that they are in.Other than those two flaws (and a few typos), this is still a well-made introduction to the Bosch series. It has a plot that's interesting enough, some high tension especially near the end, and a fascinating detective that is Harry Bosch. If you're into crime thrillers, then you'll be pulled easily into the darker side of Los Angeles.Grade: B"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I enjoy the mystery/thriller genre, reading Baldacci, Child, Grisham, Burke, Lescroart, Sandford, Crais, Lehane....but never Connelly until now. I'm one who sticks with a book and rarely ever give up before seeing it through to the end....wasn't so sure if this one had a chance to make the \\"garbage can before the last page\\" list. Early on in The Black Echo, thoughts like \\"when is this going to pick up?\\" and \\"what is so great about this series?\\" crept in here and there. After about 100 pages....BAM, it picks up in a hurry. As many other reviewers have noted, the plot twists and turns (and isn't that why we read these types of books?) and the characters are VERY well developed. Connelly weaves a great police procedural, while creating subtle and obvious subplots. One feels and sees from not only Bosch's viewpoint, but also other central and even peripheral characters' perspectives.Just finished this one up and already starting on Black Ice, the 2nd in the Bosch series. Can't wait to read and then come back with a review. If you haven't tried Connelly's works yet, start here and see what you think."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Usually I finish a book pretty quickly, but Black Echo took me a while to read. It caught my interest at the beginning when a body is found in a pipe by a young boy, and the body happens to be dead. The boy calls police, then takes off and disappears. Harry Bosch is right in thinking that there is more to this death than just a drug overdose, and especially when he realizes that the dead man is someone from his past.There are a lot of characters in the story and a lot of twists. I was never sure who to trust because so many of the characters turned out to be connected to each other in some way. The middle of the story was a little slow in places, but the last third of the book was very exciting and faster-paced.Since this was Michael Connelly's first Harry Bosch book, he proved that he can write this kind of novel and write it well. Harry has some flaws and he's a lonely man, but he's the man to solve the case.I definitely want to read the rest of the Bosch novels."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I purchased this book because (1) I had never read anything by Michael Connelly, and figured that since he has written so many books and has been so successful, there must be something to it; and (2) it was 99 cents; and (3) it was in the bestselling police procedurals list. I am really glad that I did. It took me about two days to read it (I was on vacation) and I did not put it down during that time. I am about to buy the second in the series - the Black Ice. This book was the author's first book and the first in a series about Det. Harry Bosch. It takes place in the late 80s/early 90s, and it is amazing how quickly our technology has changed. Because I was working as a professional at that time, I remember dictating and typewriters and pay phones - but the younger generation might not. This was an interesting book with a lot of great detail. I loved the description of his house, and never having been in one of those off Laurel Canyon or Coldwater Canyon on stilts, knew exactly what the author was describing. I really enjoyed it, and cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I read this book years ago, saw it on special at the Kindle Store for $0.99 purchased it to read again. I forgot how great a writer Michael Connelly is in the first of his LAPD homicide cop Harry Bosch Series. He has the ability to bring the reader into the world of the homicide cop. A well written, fast paced read.

I'd never read this one and was thrilled to find it for the Kindle at less than a dollar, a bargain! To refresh my memory, I investigated Connelly's bio and learned that this story was taken in part from a true event which occurred in LA. The author's experience as a crime journalist has given him a full background for creating rich positive and negative characters, the main ones with histories that pop up as the story progresses. Although not unpredictable in plot, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first novel by Connelly over the past few days, particularly because of the vulnerability revealed by Harry Bosch. Now twenty years since first written, it was also interesting to see the advances in technology, and I'm eager to read The Drop which is to be released in November. Very smart to currently offer Black Echo at a low price to remind us about Bosch! Read it now."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Harry Bosch has to investigate the murder of an old friend from Vietnam. The action in the book grips from the start and doesn't let you down.

In the beginning, nothing fits but by the end, everything does. And detective Harry Bosch, who starts with nothing but his moral compass and his instincts, ends up the same way. You can almost hear a muted trumpet wailing in the distance."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I wish I could say I like Harry Bosch as much as I enjoy reading Mickey Haller, but I can't. Mickey appeals to me more. However, this was a well-written novel and I'm sure that I'll read more of the Harry Bosch series. Connelly never disappoints."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is the first in the series of Connelly's Harry Bosch crime novels. I had read a couple of the later books and thought I'd go back to the beginning and read the first. It is an engrossing read. The main character, Bosch is a disillusioned LAPD detective, moving down the ladder of success. His single minded approach to investigations has caused his career to get permanently off track and he has been transferred to a back water district as this novel opens. A Vietnam vet, Bosch discovers the murder victim is an army comrade from his tunnel rat days in Vietnam. A joint LAPD/FBI investigation ensues. One of Connelly's strengths is slowly peeling the layers of the onion as the investigation unfolds. The time frame, the 80's, is pre cell phones, fax machines, and other digital tools and that allows for a more leisurely approach to the case. Bosch's character is really developed with the background material from his Vietnam years and a believable romance develops between Bosch and the FBI agent assigned to the case. I won't give away any plot spoilers but this story holds together very well until the last 30-40 pages when the coincidental events pile on. I think this is an excellent first novel in the series, it leaves you wanting to know more about the main character after rewarding you with a good read. I continue to think Connelly is the best author writing police procedurals today"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly has created a lead character who is likeable, capable, but not overly inflated to be believable. His Harry Bosch is really fun to read. I can picture him saying and doing these things which is what a good write does, create environments. While the twist was predictable the overall book was good and the set up was intriguing. I will happily look to read the next book in series!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is a readable book, with some good characterizations and a flowing narrative. It is, however, spoiled by a hugely contrived plot which strains believability. As the plot is worked out at the end of the book unfolds it pretty much spoiled it for me. I'd read Connelly again though, hoping that his talents wouldn't be wasted as they were in this book."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly's debut, which won the Edgar Award for Best 1st Novel, is an engrossing mystery in the tradition ofupdated L.A. noir. It begins when near-burnout detectiveHarry Bosch is called on to investigate the death of asmackhead found in a drainage pipe. Turns out the dead junkie is an old war buddy of Harry's. Other facts about the apparent O.D. begin to bother the lone-wolf detective, and what begins as a routine inquiry turns into a convoluted mystery involving the FBI, the Internal Affairs Division of the LAPD, and old secrets from 'Nam.Connelly uses a wealth of authentic detail and an intricate-but-never-incomprehensible plot to great effect,but the book is hampered by hackneyed characterizations and verbosity. In fact, Connelly's over-writing telegraphs many of the surprises of the story, especially when he tries to portray Bosch's thought-processes on the verge of discovery. Bosch's mullings circle important clues again and again, in Connelly's attempt at a kind of angst, until the reader wants to reach into the book and scream the all-too-obvious conclusions at the detective. The book could have been cut by a fourth without losing anything, and the cuts would have strengthened the tautness the mystery's spine.The character of Bosch himself is not particularly vibrant or inventive, conforming to all the cliches of the genre of wounded, lone-wolf detectives whose only saving graces consist of a plodding perseverance and a kind of reckless courage, although there is an interesting attempt to elevate Bosch's woundedness to a kind of metaphor involving a Hopper painting and the artist who is Bosch's namesake. The other characters are, for the most part, even flatter.Given that this is 1st novel, however, it is a promising one, especially in its detailed authenticity, and I would recommend it as a starting place for anyone interested in contemporary LA police procedurals."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"What a fantastic book! If you enjoy great reading and great characters plus a fast paced novel than you must read this. You never have a slow part and you never feel like it is all happening too fast. I had bought this book a couple of months ago and been reading other books for awhile figuring I would just get around to it but why in the world did I wait? It makes a lot of the other thriller/mysteries out right now look naive. If you are even half interested get this book and read it. Awesome!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I am a huge Connelly fan, so I bought the trilogy book of Connelly's first collection of Harry Bosch novels, settled into the very first one of the series \\"The Black Echo\\" and enjoyed it as much as his present day stuff (The Closers, The Narrows, etc.). I have read the reviews where other Bosch fans think that this one fell flat. Well, I totally disagree.I wish I would've been introduced to the Bosch series by reading this one from the start, but even as a backtracker, it was one of my favorite reads. This one had a nice finish. The Internal Affair Dept. cops were a little far-fetched but didn't kill my interest in this story. Don't be afraid to backtrack fellow Harry Bosch readers."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly's L.A.P.D. homicide cop Harry Bosch is on my top-ten list of favorite protagonists. Harry is intelligent and insightful. He is a loner, a nonconformist. He has a tender side, but can be ruthless. And he doesn't take any guff from anyone.Bosch is called out on a case in which a body is found in a large drain pipe. It looks, at first, like a victim of a drug overdose, one of many such cases Harry encounters each year. But it becomes personal when Harry discovers the body is that of one Billy Meadows, with whom Bosch served in Vietnam. Within a few days, Bosch figures out that Meadows was murdered and may have been involved in a huge bank heist eight months earlier, a case on the FBI books. He checks in with the FBI to reveal what he has learned. Harry doesn't understand why the Feds seem to dismiss him and his evidence.Soon he discovers that early in the bank case, he had been a suspect himself. When the FBI had honed in on Meadows, they investigated everyone he worked with in Vietnam. Although they still think Meadows was in on the heist, they haven't found enough evidence to positively link him with the robbery.Meanwhile Bosch has managed to anger just about every superior in the department. He has the FBI on his tail. Two guys from internal affairs are following him. Harry manages to embarrass them, which makes them even more determined to bring him down.Eventually, Bosch is assigned to work with Eleanor Wink, a seductive female FBI agent. But it seems that the suspects anticipate Bosch's every move. He believes one of his own department or an FBI agent is an informer. In the end, he needs to rely on tactics he learned in the tunnels beneath Vietnam.A former police reporter for the LA Times, Michael Connelly has created a great protagonist. The plot is engrossing, full of blind allies and tension. I highly recommend it and look forward to many more of Michael Connelly's novels."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"MIchael Connelly has been constantly reccomended to me by all sorts of people, and i have finally gotten around to giving him a try. I was not disappointed. in fact, i wish i'd started him earlier. A very pleasing debut.Connelly's writing is very realistic, and quite emotional. It's easy to read whilst at the same time being of a very high quality. He doesn't unnecessarily overcomplicate the plot.Harry Bosch is a very good character, and i am looking forward to reading more about him. Flawed but with his heart basically in the right place. What makes those sort of people so likeable and good for writing books around? I've no idea, but it certainly works.The plot here is good, original, effective. The only thing which seemed out of place was the books length. I felt it could have been shorter by a hundred pages, maybe. It got to draggin on a bit in the middle. However, the climax was great.I will definitely read more of his work, and i think you should too."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I just love Harry Bosch, out all my fav detectives/cops/forensic scientists, Harry is just a sensational, brilliant detective, who always gets his way eventually and always cracks the case so wide open, that you are always reading just a little bit more...In this one, Bosch is investigating the murder of a former Vietnam buddy that was found in a pipeline. But, in true Connelly style, murders are not what they seem and soon Bosch is actually investigating robberies that are somehow connected to his dead friend.What I love the most about Bosch is that he is such a tough detective, that you can't help but love him and the millions of times, he gets thrown off cases for being too damn good.Connelly is an excellent writer and although this is not quite as good as &quot;The Poet&quot; or &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot;, it is still a brilliant book for his second time. I love &quot;The Black Echo&quot; as it kept me up all night just piecing everything together and wondering what happens next and who else is involved...Excellent work from an excellent author!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I honestly don't have much to say about Michael Connelly's The Black Echo. I gave it three stars so it obviously did not blow me away but, kind of like Jim Butcher's Storm Front, it has a very compelling quality to it. I can definitely say that Connelly deserves all the awards he has received and actually does deserve to be on the NY Times list. Harry Bosch is a very likeable main protagonist as well, but in the way that most viewers enjoy seeing what Dr. Gregory House is up to. You wouldn't want to know him, just about him. The series has limitless potential only limited by its genre. (Yes, I know!! Contridictions are fun for the mind.) Anyway, despite the three stars due to its slightly better portrayal of a genre that has been covered by thousands of authors, I am going to read more by Connelly, especially books involving Bosch. If you are looking for a very enjoyable mystery novel with a lot of procedure and a lot of throwing about of the proverbial rule book, try The Black Echo."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The Black Echoby Michael Connelly is a rich, complex mystery told with great style. From start to finish, I was hooked!Characters were developed as credible individuals. Detective Harry Bosch is a no-holds-barred iconoclast, not one of the team, by his own choices. But his fierce independence makes him a great detective, able to sniff and follow the most obscure leads.This case starts with a dead junkie who happened to be in Bosch's unit in Viet Nam. But it soon becomes entangled with an elaborate bank robbery, unsolved to that time. Bosch worms his way into the FBI investigation of the robbery with a combination of promise and threat, and is paired with a tough, enigmatic (and, of course, beautiful) agent, Eleanor Wish. They make an odd (but convinving) couple, both on and off the job. Background characters are formed with unusually clear sketches.The web of crimes they follow is tied together by strands first laid down in the last days of the Viet Nam War. The reader accompanies Bosh and Wish as they gradually expose the connections and eventually uncover the complete picture. Along the way, the reader is given fair treatment, and has a reasonable chance to solve (at least parts of) the interwoven crimes. Plot pacing was nearly ideal, with a combination of routine investigation, small clues, major revelations and dicey moments to keep the reader alert and entwined.This is one of the best mysteries I've read in the past 2-3 years. I recommend it highly to fans of the genre."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"First Sentence: The boy couldn't see in the dark, but he didn't need to.LAPD detective Hieronymous (aka Harry) Bosch is a loner and a nighthawk. Called out on a routine drug overdose case, Bosch soon realizes that the victim found lying in the Mullholland Dam drainpipe is no accident case. Billy Meadows was a fellow 'tunnel rat' in Vietnam and Harry swears to bring the killer to justice.Written and set in 1992, it is interesting to see how times have changed in these 18 years. There were no cell phones, the police used radios, pagers, call boxes, and pay phones; there were no PCs, only a few computer terminals within each police station; no digital cameras, Polaroid cameras were used at crime scenes; and will getting better, there was still sexism and prejudice against gays. That said, the fundamental elements of a police procedural and a cracking good story demonstrate why Connelly and the Harry Bosch series, are one of the best.Our introduction to Harry not only sets the scene but tells us quite a bit about his life. Harry is 40 years' old in this first book, grew up in institutions after his mother was murdered, also providing an explanation as to why Harry dislike rock music, and was a tunnel rat in Vietnam before joining the police force, where he tends to be an outsider. It is this level of detail in our introduction to Harry, although better editing might have the redundancies of that detail,that sets the scene for this book.Connelly's attention to detail is also exemplified in his sense of place. We can not only see where Bosch is going, but almost hear and smell it as well. You don't have to have visited Los Angeles to know Bosch's Los Angeles.And lastly, the plot: the story was meticulously plotted with some of the best twists I've read. There's even a twist upon a twists. It takes real skill to pull that off.I first read this book in November 1996 but hadn't kept any notes. When my mystery group selected it for this month, I decided to re-read it, not only for the group but to see whether it had held up and was as good as I remembered. I originally rated it \\"Ex,\\" and have downgraded it to \\"VG+\\" only because of the redundancy, but the overall quality of the writing is there and has remained true in this book and in every subsequent book Connelly has written.THE BLACK ECHO (Pol Proc-Harry Bosch-Los Angeles, CA-Cont) - VG+Connelly, Michael - 1st in seriesLittle Brown and Company, 1992, US Hardcover - ISBN: 0316153613"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This book was okay overall but took to long to finish.

Michael Connelly is a true master of his craft and in The Black Echo he introduces us to Harry for the first time. Do yourself a favor and buy this book in hardcover because you will want to keep it--after you've passed it around to all your friends.So many crime writers get bogged down in the police procedural aspects of the book. Far from slowing the pace, Michael Connelly's police department politics and procedures educate us in a highly entertaining fashion. There's never a dull moment in a Harry Bosch novel.I'm a writer myself and I only hope that someday I'm half as good as Michael Connelly.

The plot development was good, but unfortunately, reading this after i've read other Bosch novels deprived me of the final plot twist.However, the are two things I take issue with is continuity within the series. Particularly, the fact that Lewis and Clark appeared in this novel. In The Concrete Blonde, Bosch revealed a story about two IAD detectives that were killed in the line of duty, who were none other than Lewis and Clark.The second problem I had was the fact that Bremmer is mentioned in this book (the reporter from the Times) who should not be there, due to circumstances in a prior novel, (poor description) for lack of spoiling it for first time Bosch reader.Other than that, I love Michael Connelly and the Harry Bosch character."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series. However, I was very disappointed with this book. One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such). I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)! I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book. Also, I found the book to be too gritty. It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books. It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read. So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order. Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it. I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.

Bosch finds himself joined with an FBI agent, Eleanor Wish, and pitted against enemies in his own department as he tries to solve the case. Bosch is the classic competent detective bucking the political system within the Beverly Hills police department. He's trying to solve a crime and the department is more interested in the optics of the situation, as well as keeping a leash on him.I liked this story and Harry Bosch. He's a good cop and detective, skirting the edges sometimes in order to get at the truth but still staying on the right side of ethics. Bosch is a flawed character with a lot of layers that make him really intriguing. The case was very interesting and had enough twists and turns to keep me on my toes. While my instincts were right as to who was involved, I was caught off guard on motive.This was my first book by Connelly and I plan to continue with this series.

The story line is well written and it was a delight to discover this author. If you like a good police story, then you need to read this book.

Just when you think you have it figured out, the plot takes a twist. Very enjoyable. I read the kindle version and will go back for more from this author."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've read bits and pieces of the Harry Bosch series with moderate enjoyment, so I figured I should check out the beginning. The book starts with Detective Bosch on the Homicide Squad of the Hollywood division, having apparently been demoted from the elite LAPD Robbery Homicide division for his questionable action in a high-profile serial killer case a year previously. (The events of that \\"Dollmaker\\" case are detailed in the book The Concrete Blonde, and be warned that key information about that case is revealed in this book.) This backstory establishes Bosch as a highly capable high profile detective who's somewhat of a loose cannon and marked man for LAPD Internal Affairs.The story starts with a glue-sniffing graffiti artist (the one somewhat interesting character in the book) witnessing a body being dumped in a storm drain pipe by the LA reservoir. This leads to Bosch being hauled out of bed to come check out the scene. Here, the reader is forced to make a huge leap of faith, because it just so happens that the victim is an old comrade-in-arms from Bosch's Vietnam War days as a tunnel rat. (For those unfamiliar with the term, it's slang for the U.S. soldiers sent into the vast Viet Cong tunnel networks that honeycombed the South. They were generally sent down in ones and twos armed with .45s, flashlights, and demolitions charges.) This is a major coincidence to build a story on, and the revelation leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste throughout the rest of the book.Once it's clear that there's been a murder, Bosch latches onto the case like a pit bull, pushing it through the procedural red tape. Connelly spent many years covering local crime for the LA Times, and as in the other books of his I've read, has a good eye and ear for bringing all the little bits and pieces of procedure to life. The investigation seems to point at the dead man's involvement with a recent high-profile bank heist, and soon Bosch finds himself tangled up with the FBI agents tasked with that investigation. Meanwhile, Internal Affairs has targeted him big time, and he spends a lot of energy evading their slimy grasp. There's a good deal of internal police politics at work, and Connelly does a nice job of bringing the depressing realities of this into the story.Somewhat less convincing is the character of Bosch himself. He's the ultimate embodiment of the maverick, anti-establishment, \\"lone wolf\\"cop, always rubbing superiors the wrong way for no good reason, and generally being obnoxious and provocative in a way that only gets him in hotter water. For someone as self-avowedly committed to justice as he is, you'd think he would be a little smarter about when to mouth off, since the trouble he gets himself into only diverts him from pursuing justice. And of course, he drinks a bunch, smokes a bunch, listens to jazz, and doesn't have a lot of luck with women. So, of course, his FBI liaison is a beautiful, water-drinking, anti-smoking woman agent. Sparks fly, and it comes as no surprise that they fall into bed with each other.The plot grows slightly complicated as the search for the killer intertwines with the search for the bank robbers. Connelly smoothly guides the reader through the various databases, files, and people Bosch deals with in order to advance the investigation. It rapidly becomes apparent that the key to the case somehow ties back to the Vietnam War. This is an interesting premise, but one that ultimately becomes a bit too conspiracy-thrillerish by the end. It also doesn't help that Connelly gives away what should be a shocking twist toward the end by providing a very obvious clue halfway through the book. These flaws, combined with the coincidence the story is built on and the clich&eacute; nature of Bosch, result in a book that works in fits and starts, but isn't nearly as good as it could have been."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly's series of books with detective Harry Bosch make reading thrilling!Recommend you read them in order:The Black Echo (1992)The Black Ice (1993)The Concrete Blonde (1994)The Last Coyote (1995)Trunk Music (1997)Angels Flight (1999)A Darkness More Than Night (2001)City Of Bones (2002)Lost Light (2003)The Narrows (2004)The Closers (2005)Echo Park (2006)The Overlook (2007)The Brass Verdict (2008)Nine Dragons (2009)The Reversal (Coming October 5, 2010)Love them all!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I will admit, this book was very engaging for the most part and I found myself not wanting to put it down. Michael Connelly, an experienced crime journalist, certainly knows his way around police procedure and terminology.Harry Bosch is an extremely cliched character, but I found myself liking him nonetheless. Like many fictional detectives before him, he is hard-boiled and burned out, yet very competent and intelligent. Honestly, though, the Vietnam veteran bit has been done to death in mysteries and it was groan-inducing to have to sit through lengthy and overdone descriptions of Bosch's war experiences.Eleanor Wish, the female FBI agent who becomes Bosch's love interest, was also a pretty cookie-cutter creation. However, in Connelly's defense, he did a good job of not revealing right away that Bosch and Wish would end up in bed together. He did this by skillfully not mentioning that Wish was attractive until long after her character was first introduced. Less clever writers are rarely that subtle. In most books like this, the reader can tell almost immediately which characters the hero will sleep with before the book is over because the author always immediately mentions how beautiful that female character is. If she and the hero don't end up together, what was the point of even mentioning her beauty?But the main reason this book fell flat was that the ending felt very contrived. Plus, it turns out that the entire plot was based on a ridiculous number of coincidences. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the odds of these events happening the way they do and with seemingly everyone in the book connected in some way would be about one in a thousand. It leaves the reader with the distinct impression that the author has noticeably manipulated the story in an improbable way solely to give his readers a \\"Hollywood ending\\"."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"A friend recommended Connelly to me and suggested I start at the beginning.

But like and admire some of his traits, sign me up.Connelly obvisiously knows the working of a big city police dept. well.

After several friends urged me to read &quot;Blood Work&quot;, in which I enjoyed and recommend.

The plot was interesting, although I thought at times Connelly was prodding along, in which there was too much subject matter crammed into a &quot;chapter&quot;, Connelly could have shortened the chapters, which would have made the novel flow better. The characters were excellent, Det. Harry Bosch reminded me of Lawrence Sanders'Timothy Cone character. All told, I look forward to &quot;Black Ice&quot; and will read all of Connelly's novels ASAP.

Thankfully, it has all the good elements I found in \\"Blood work\\". I enjoy reading police-investigation thrillers, and I like series that feature the same character, if the character is good. Harry Bosch is a good character in the sense that he is a bitter and somewhat unlucky man, which gives him a closeness to the reader; he's not a super-hero and he's certainly full of flaws, like everybody we know. But he's not the common anti-hero, because he's a terrific investigator, and respected as such.In this first book in the Harry Bosch series, the LA detective comes along a body in a pipe by the Holywood reservoir. Overdose? Homicide? What Bosch knows for sure is the identity of the deceased man, who served with him as a \\"tunnel rat\\" in Vietnam, twenty years before. With the help of FBI agent Eleanor Wish, Bosch soon starts to discover that this \\"tunnel\\" is much deeper than he thinks.Connelly won the Edgar Award for debut novel with \\"The black echo\\". His writing style is simple and confident, as a former journalist's should be. He doesn't waste the reader's time, everything that's in the pages has some significance, but his writing is not as tellegraphic as James Patterson's, for example. Connelly created a good character and provided him with very good plot, environment and psychology. It could hardly go wrong, and it didn't.Bosch's books will now be a constant on my shelf.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've been reading the later Harry Bosch novels, and just ran into this one. It probably would've been much better had it been the first Bosch novel I had read, but it's still darn good.The plot elements have been used before, but they're given a fresh twist here. Harry in this book as in the later ones has three distinct challenges: The case itself, and this is one in which he's coincidentally deeply involved; the continual conflict with the political agendas of superiors which threatens his ability to properly investigate the case; and the dealing with his own deep feelings and realizations, including his awareness that his decisions affect lives of those not directly involved.While some may find the beginning slow, I find Connelly highly skilled in bringing out important technical aspects of the investigation while interspersing scenes that involve more action.If you haven't yet read Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch stories, this is the one to start with.

The story concerns the death of one of Bosch's fellow tunnel rats in Vietnam. Bosch is basically a loner who lives on a Hollywood hillside over looking the city lights. A beer-drinking chain smoker, he follows his own moral compass and resists pressure to conform to department standards for a LAPD detective, taking minimum guff from everyone while staying in bounds of the rules. One of the main delights of the book is trying to figure out what makes Bosch tick. He behaves like most men secretly believe they could behave: like a real man. There is not a lot of action in this book but the narrative is tightly written and the dialogue sounds true to the ear. The author also has a fine way with setting a scene. All in all, a fine start and I can't wait to start my second Harry Bosch story and learn moe about this dude Bosch."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Although this is Michael Connelly's first book, my only regret is that I did not read it first.

It begins when near-burnout detectiveHarry Bosch is called on to investigate the death of asmackhead found in a drainage pipe. Turns out the dead junkie is an old war buddy of Harry's. Other facts about the apparent O.D. begin to bother the lone-wolf detective, and what begins as a routine inquiry turns into a convoluted mystery involving the FBI, the Internal Affairs Division of the LAPD, and old secrets from 'Nam.Connelly uses a wealth of authentic detail and an intricate-but-never-incomprehensible plot to great effect,but the book is hampered by hackneyed characterizations and verbosity. In fact, Connelly's over-writing telegraphs many of the surprises of the story, especially when he tries to portray Bosch's thought-processes on the verge of discovery. Bosch's mullings circle important clues again and again, in Connelly's attempt at a kind of angst, until the reader wants to reach into the book and scream the all-too-obvious conclusions at the detective. The book could have been cut by a fourth without losing anything, and the cuts would have strengthened the tautness the mystery's spine.The character of Bosch himself is not particularly vibrant or inventive, conforming to all the cliches of the genre of wounded, lone-wolf detectives whose only saving graces consist of a plodding perseverance and a kind of reckless courage, although there is an interesting attempt to elevate Bosch's woundedness to a kind of metaphor involving a Hopper painting and the artist who is Bosch's namesake. The other characters are, for the most part, even flatter.Given that this is 1st novel, however, it is a promising one, especially in its detailed authenticity, and I would recommend it as a starting place for anyone interested in contemporary LA police procedurals."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This book really brings L.A. to life for me, I've lived here most of my life but have never been up to the Hollywood Reservoir.

A lot of back-and-forth and dialog, that I am not sure adds to the pace of the novel slows the narrative.This is the author's first published novel. And also the first featuring the character of Harry Bosch, a loner detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, and also a Vietnam War vet. Harry is called out to the scene of a murder, of what looks like a homeless junkie. It turns out that the deceased was a tunnel rat with Harry Bosch during the Vietnam war. As Harry investigates, we learn, slowly, after going through page after page of prose that moves slowly, very slowly, that deceased may have been a murder victim, a possible accessory to a crime, and may have been killed to prevent the details of a second crime being planned from being leaked.As with Michael Crichton's early novels, or was it his first novel, \\"A Case of Need\\", the pace if turgid, and there is too much detail, and too much detail that seems forced. I still found myself turning the pages, but that was more because I had read his later works, like \\"A Lincoln Lawyer\\", \\"A Reversal\\", and others, so I knew that Connelly is a fine writer, with a fine sense of pacing - just not very evident in this first book.

PLEASE, please, Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The book introduces the character Harry Bosch and begins a long, successful series of novels. Connelly has spun quite a tale here and backs up a great story full of turns and spins with meticulous research and talented writing. If there was any drawback at all, it would be in the thin character development of the leading lady. This could be intentional, however, as her true intentions are hidden until the end. The overriding theme in the novel is the need to overcome. In the novel, Bosch is faced with fears of his past, dark memories of underground spaces, peer pressure, pressure and criticism from his command structure, and difficulty in relationships. His constant dealings with all of these difficulties combine with an intricate plot that slowly unravels as Bosch relentlessly applies old-fashioned police detective work. While the &#34;whodunnit&#34; becomes predictable toward the end, this is not unsatisfying, as it now becomes a mystery as to how Bosch will handle it. While this is not an action hero-type novel, it is a real page turner. It is cerebral mystery writing at its best. If you pick this one up, make sure you have some spare time before you begin reading it."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"After reading several Harry Bosch novels, I was eager to read the first and was not disappointed. This is wear readers learn much about Bosch's history in foster care and Vietnam. We learn about his experiences as a \\"tunnel rat.\\" The mystery and suspense is first rate. As with most mysteries, there is some second guessing of the conclusion but you just have to go with it and move on to the next Harry Bosch novel on your list. I have never been disappointed with a Connelly novel and this is no exception. It fits the bill perfectly for what it is."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"As of the date of this review, Michael Connelly has written and published eighteen fictional novels of which thirteen feature LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. It all began back in 1992 with The Black Echo but if, like many, you have discovered Connelly by way of his more recent stories, then do not for one minute think that back then he was just a beginner learning his trade and his debut novel should be considered with caution. No, quite simply if you like Connelly today then you will like Connelly \`then' just as much.This is despite the fact that it's a tale of events in the early 1990s with heavy references to events of the early 1970s. More specifically, Bosch is a Los Angeles detective turning 40 with powerful memories of his experiences as a tunnel rat in Vietnam some twenty years earlier and from which the title of this novel draws its name. But the drawing of the characters and their relationships with one another is of high quality, a skill which, in my humble opinion, only a minority of Connelly's peers in the field of crime thrillers pull off as successfully as he does. In any thriller series this is the element that probably defines success or failure more than any other, and since Connelly has been writing tales surrounding Bosch for over fifteen years, it's safe to assume that he's cracked this difficult task and he demonstrates this from the word go in his debut novel.Having already read the outstanding Concrete Blonde (the third in the Bosch series) it's sometimes amusing to read the occasional mentions of the career-defining experiences of the case built around the pursuit of the Dollmaker; amusing because Connelly decided never to write the story itself, yet the events of that case are cleverly used to help shape our understanding of Bosch's personality in small doses in The Black Echo and I am sure that he always planned to build a story around it for The Concrete Blonde two years later. To me that says much about the forward-thinking, the creativity and the plain confidence of the author.It's easy to summarise this story's plot - the body of a man is found and Bosch, by chance, is assigned to the case to find the man's killer or killers. It's not long before Bosch brings about an association with the dead man (a Vietnam tunnel rat who worked with Bosch two decades earlier) to an audacious bank robbery the previous summer and a similar heist that is planned for the imminent future. Bosch has it all figured out, and has to solve all this is in the midst of an Internal Affairs investigation coupled with high-level corruption among those who might have a vested interest in the two bank robberies. The story covers about one week, my one criticism being the absence of any chapters and the use, instead, of rather long \`parts' which for people like myself who often read books in snatches of thirty minutes at a time, can be slightly irritating. Anyone who invests lengthy periods of time to reading won't mind at all, I'm sure.All I can say as a lover of crime fiction and a fan of good series creators such as Val McDermid, John Connolly, Mo Hayder and Mark Billingham (and the owner of pretty much everything written by Deaver, Cornwell, Slaughter, Reichs, Gerritsen, Coben, Rankin and Child), is that Michael Connelly is surely and deservedly right up there with the best of them and this debut novel is a must-read for anyone who has read and enjoyed his more recent work. It's real quality."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This was Michael Connelly's first police procedural featuring LAPD detective Harry Bosch, and it shows why the series has been such a success. Bosch is a gritty police officer, but you soon see that he is far more complex than the usual hard-boiled cop. In this story, Bosch goes to investigate a dead body found in a drainpipe at Mulholland Dam, and finds that the dead man is a former tunnel rat, as was Harry Bosch, in Vietnam. It looks like a routine drug overdose, but Bosch is not satisfied and soon finds that it is murder. The finding cracks open an ongoing criminal operation that becomes steadily more dangerous for Bosch and his fellow officers. Connelly does a great job of building tension and giving the plot twists to make a truly enjoyable and realistic story with a surprise ending."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Like most people, I have picked up Michael Connelly only in about the last four or five years. I felt the Closers was amazing and possibly his best book, but Chasing the Dime and The Narrows were not much further behind. The Lincoln Lawyer was very good, but not among his very best in my opinion. I have decided to go back and read his first 3 books before finishing off some of his more recent titles, and was expecting a slight disappointment because his newer work is so good. There was very little, if any! Connelly's style has certainly altered some, but his plotting and pacing is masterful.If you are looking for more Michael Conelly to read and have enjoyed some of his more recent work, The Black Echo will not disappoint."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Once upon a time I had a teacher named Mrs. Milstein. She had a principle. Boiled down to its most simple phrasing, Milstein's Principle states: \\"if you've heard of a thing once, you will hear of it again.\\"I have yet to find anything that can stand against this principle.A case in point: Hieronymous Bosch. At least, I thought, I will never hear of this guy outside of an art-world setting. Once more, I bow to the principle.Michael Connelly is, as the saying goes--one helluva writer. He and his Bosch books stand at the pinnacle of the loosely grouped writers & fiction known as the \\"New Noir.\\" I am not a huge fan of genre fiction (especially mystery) but Harry Bosch has made a fan of me.This first book of the series, The Black Echo, introduces us to a very grim (he gets more humanized in later books) Detective Bosch. He's just been demoted, he's got a painfully bureaucratic new boss, and an old platoon-mate from Vietnam has just turned up dead.From here things only get more murky and dangerous.The Black Echo is not the strongest of the Bosch series (which really starts hitting its stride in book three). It is a good introduction to a lot of the characters you will get to know better throughout the series.Connelly's style is very cinematic. Having honed his skills as a journalist, the author is the master of taking snapshot after successive snapshot and then building these pictures into a compelling story.As a stand-alone work, the Black Echo is a B+ at best, but I cannot give any higher recommendation to a series of books than I can for those of the Harry Bosch series.Get a copy of The Black Echo today and dive in."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For the first book by Connelly, this was exceptional. Harry Bosche is a great character who loves what he does. It was fun to follow the inner workings of his cop mind. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was the ending. It was somewhat unbelievable. Nice twist though."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"_The Black Echo_ introduces Harry Bosch-- the bitter LAPD detective named after the tortured painter. Black Echo won the Edgar for best first novel and gave us one of our best contemporary detective characters.Black Ice is still my favorite, but Black Echo is a must-read for fans of the darker side of the detective genre. Also introduces (and largely explains) Eleanor Wish, who will return with a larger role later in the series."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I finally got around to reading this author! I was warned that the first books are finding their way a bit, but as they go on, they get better. I was quite impressed with this book and the character of Harry. Enjoyed it.Only thing that hindering me from rating it a 5 was that Harry isn't a character that you immediately like. It takes a while. And the ending was a bit predictable. Either that or I'm a good sleuth.I can't wait to read the following books in the series. I have an inkling they only get better."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I've been reading the later Harry Bosch novels, and just ran into this one. It probably would've been much better had it been the first Bosch novel I had read, but it's still darn good.The plot elements have been used before, but they're given a fresh twist here. Harry in this book as in the later ones has three distinct challenges: The case itself, and this is one in which he's coincidentally deeply involved; the continual conflict with the political agendas of superiors which threatens his ability to properly investigate the case; and the dealing with his own deep feelings and realizations, including his awareness that his decisions affect lives of those not directly involved.While some may find the beginning slow, I find Connelly highly skilled in bringing out important technical aspects of the investigation while interspersing scenes that involve more action.If you haven't yet read Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch stories, this is the one to start with. And if you have, be sure not to miss this one."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This first novel by the now best-selling Connelly certainly hints at what's to come in later years. It's Edgar Award is justified in that this is a good debut novel. The plot is intricate, well-woven, and ultimately satisfying. The climax is fairly predictable, but Bosch is a good hero, one that has flaws and lets his solitude at times interfere with his job. However, almost all of his peers are jerks, especially the unbelievable doofuses, Lewis and Clarke. FBI agent Eleanor Wish is a good supporting character, although her relationship with Bosch is fairly predictable in its outcome. There are some great scenes of &quot;film noir&quot;, although Connelly at times gets a little carried away with his various descriptions. The young boy, Sharkey, is an interesting addition, neither likeable or dislikeable, but a good addition nonetheless.Connelly's expertise as a criminal writer for the LA Times is evident in his knowledge of how police procedurals, although the stock characters in official roles sometime seem unrealistic.I like Connelly's non-Bosch books better, but the Bosch series is certainly one to contend with.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Parts of this book, such as the veteran's memories of the Vietnam war, are very interesting. But detective Harry Bosch as a loner with a tough outside and a tender heart is too cliched for me -- at least in this book which is the only one of the series that I have read.I still give it 4 stars because Connelly is a good writer who knows how to unfold a gripping plot and flesh out strong characters."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The second book in the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly is ever bit as good if not better than the first book.

This book was right up my alley and it's been waiting for me since 1992.The Black Echo is not just good \\"detective noir\\" and a top-notch police procedural, it's a fine novel by any standard, well-written and apparently meticulously researched. (I say \\"apparently\\" because...what do I know? I was convinced.)This is my first \\"Harry Bosch\\" novel. Nice to know I have 15 more to go!At $7.99 each in Kindle format, they're more decently priced than many ebooks, but you can get paperbacks for the same price and some collections are actually cheaper in paper.

It was a deeper look into Harry Bosch. I liked the twist and turns of corruption that excite the end of this book. More of this author for me."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"The Black Echo is our first introduction to the Harry Bosch series. Like many other series book or movie wise, that stars the same protagonist over and over again, I feel that one of the main goal of the author is to hook and draw the readers in on the very first book with a interesting and likable main character so that readers will return for more in the future. I really think Connelly did exactly that with The Black Echo. Harry Bosch is a good cop. However, there are many things in the police department that are bigger than just one cop alone. While you get the feeling that Bosch isn't a dirty cop, you also get the sense that he'll break the law secretly to get the information he wants. He's a guy addicted to the case and mystery surrounding it and he won't have a peace of mind until he solves it. You don't get a lot of childhood stories about Bosch but you do get a lot of details about what he had to do in the war in Vietnam as a tunnel rat. I'm assuming the other details will be filled in as the series goes along.There's a good cast of characters in this book. You've got the laughable Lewis and Clarke \\"super agents\\" duo, Jerry Edgar who seems to be the complete opposite of Bosch when it comes to being a cop yet somehow manages to be his partner, FBI agent Eleanor Wish and last but not least, the kid witness who seems to be in the middle of it all. The characters aren't what you would consider the most interesting you'll read in a book but everything just sticks together so well due to the excellent story telling and writing by the author. Everything just seems so real, gritty and in your face. There's not much filler here to my surprise. Or even if there were, they definitely didn't feel dragged out. Everything Bosch does seems to have a purpose. What I also like about Bosch the most is his wits. The guy is pretty smart and it's pretty exciting thinking about what he might do next or just to guess what he might be thinking about. Oh, and he can be pretty funny too at times.As for the mystery element, it's your standard affair stuff. Nothing earth shattering here as The Black Echo is one of those classic who-dun-it mystery books with surprises and plot twists along the way. I definitely like that style but the detective/mystery genre is just something I try hard to avoid reading two books in a row on. Once you get the formula down in your head, you'll know what to expect from every other mystery book and that's why I've decided to wait a bit before moving on to the next Harry Bosch novel no matter how good The Black Echo is. Also, I'm making a note to myself to avoid even reading the plot summary of future Harry Bosch novels in the series. I think that should make it that much more interesting. But whatever the case, I want to praise Michael Connelly as an author. If he's already this good back in 1992, I have no doubt as to how good he is right now in the present. Of course, assuming he didn't let the fame and money go to his head even though he definitely deserves to have both."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Time has done nothing to diminish this fine novel. In fact, it's a nice reminder of how fresh this series was in its inception. Harry Bosch remains one of the most intriguing leading men in crime fiction.The denouement took me by surprise a second time all these years later. I'd forgotten whodunnit.Well worth a second look for all Connelly fans."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Michael Connelly has written a terrific novel. He introduces us to Harry Bosch, an unforgettable character, and leads us on a merry chase. I so thoroughly enjoyed this book that I intend to read all of the Harry Bosch books that Michael Connelly has written."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"\\"The Black Echo,\\" (1992), is first in Michael Connelly's best-selling Harry Bosch series of mystery novels. I have recently been mystified by the abrupt appearance of this nearly twenty year old book on the New York Times Best Seller list, as well as the Kindle and Nook best-seller lists; but have discovered the answer to that riddle. The e-book had been priced at just .99 in hopes that once readers have discovered the excellent first book in the series that now numbers 16, they will go on to read further in it. Of course Connelly, now a mega-seller in light of the filmThe Lincoln Lawyer, based on the author's book of the same name, has had many best sellers, but it's rather unusual for such an old book to find its way to bestsellerdom. The American Connelly is a former journalist, a crime beat writer for the Los Angeles Times, who certainly earned his spurs in murder while earning his daily bread.The series, Los Angeles-set police procedurals, looks at life on the \\"noir\\" side in that city. Homicide cop Harry Bosch, formerly with the Los Angeles Police Department, but now busted to humble Hollywood for his intransigence, somehow catches a case that he should not have. And he can't treat the body in the drainpipe at Mulholland dam as just another anonymous junkie statistic. Because he's recognized the corpse as Billy Meadows, a fellow Vietnam \\"tunnel rat\\" who fought side by side with him in the underground war that still gives Bosch nightmares, whether he's awake, or asleep. And now, Bosch will be forced to relive the horrors of Nam even more intensely, as he investigates a dangerous maze of blind alleys under the city of LA. These tunnels have enabled a daring gang of criminals, with the aid of the dead man, to rob a downtown bank over a holiday weekend. Bosch, who was named after the famous 15th century Dutch painter by his mother, finds himself working the case with Eleanor Wish, an enigmatic female FBI agent, pitted against enemies within his own department.THE BLACK ECHO, which won the Edgar Award for Best First Mystery Novel, already shows the excellent narrative, descriptive, and dialogue writing that are characteristic of Connelly, and is informed by his deep, accurate knowledge of police work. The fictional case given us here is based on an actual case that occurred in LA during the writer's journalistic career. As his later work, it too is written with great knowledge of, and love for, Los Angeles, the author's adopted home town. (You could pretty much use his works instead of a road map). And it clearly follows in the footsteps of earlier outstanding hardboiled Los Angeles authors Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald, but adds the further ingredients of a police procedural. Finally, Connelly explicates his love of jazz as he goes. It introduces several characters we will meet again in significant roles in the author's work: Eleanor Wish at the FBI, his police partner Jerry Edgar, and his supervisors/enemies within the department: Irvin Irving, and Harvey (98) Pounds. And Bremmer, cop shop reporter at the LA Times. There's a supposed Vietnam-era LA congressman called Noone, a name that will sure recur. There's a homage to Chandler'sThe Big Sleep, and another to that other leading crime writer of the day, James Lee Burke.What is the black echo? A name the tunnel rats gave the feeling of the tunnels. Bosch says, \\"There was no name for it, so we made up a name. It was the darkness, the damp emptiness you'd feel when you were down there alone in those tunnels. It was like you were in a place where you felt dead and buried in the dark. But you were alive. And you were scared. Your own breath kind of echoed in the darkness, loud enough to give you away. Or so you thought.\\"What writing!! Connelly is just a wonderful writer, my favorite among American mystery authors, and I've read all his books save THE SCARECROW. (Like many other readers, I imagine, I prefer his series works to his standalones: like many other writers, his mysteries seem more powerful if they are filtered through the sensibilities of his detective protagonist.) Many of the Bosch series have been New York Times best sellers, as have some of his recent standalones such as THE SCARECROW. CRIME BEAT: A DECADE OF COVERING COPS AND KILLERS, a non-fiction collection of his journalism, was also a New York Times bestseller. Hey, if you've never yet read the Bosch series, you may as well start at the beginning here."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"This is for the Kindle version (though that fact shouldn't make any difference). This is the first Harry Bosch novel of the series and in fact the first novel of the author. It's a remarkable effort for a first novel and illustrates well what he will continue in his other works: simple, clean and crisp prose which moves along, rarely if ever bogging down. A few unusual plot twists. Well-described characters and places.However like one reviewer, I prefer the novel itself over the protagonist, Harry Bosch, LAPD Detective. I have to say I prefer the Haller books. Haller for some reason captures some sympathy or empathy for me; not so for Bosch.I give this 4 stars because of the unlikable nature of Harry and because of the very last plot twist. It was one too far, and left me a feeling of artificial manipulation by the author, reaching too much to trick the reader."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Not sure how it happened but the publisher is making a wise choice of pricing the book so low. I would not have purchased it at the normal price. Not because I don't enjoy all of Michael Connelly's books, but because it's just too much for the ebook version of an older book. I hope to see more 99 cent books from well known authors in the future. It just makes sense."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Wanted to read in one sitting, but didn't have the time. Can't wait to read other books in the series"},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"Bosch did an excellent job in ferreting out all the nuances in this book!

This is the first one in that series. It was not nearly as good. My problems follow.1. This read too much like a police procedural. One guy raising questions, investigating, and uncovering clues and leads.2. Too many unpleasant and unlikeable characters: Harry's bosses, other cops, internal affairs, FBI guys, the State Dept guy, a security guard, and witnesses. I couldn't enjoy or admire anyone. For example: a car tries to run over Harry. He survives. Instead of being supportive Harry's boss yells at him because he didn't get the make and model of the car. He acted like it was Harry's fault for almost being run over. For most of these characters I was thinking \\"oh, ick.\\" And Harry himself wasn't exciting or interesting. I didn't feel much about him.3. Eleanor is the female FBI agent who is partnered with Harry during the investigation. She gives bad advice and appears kind of stupid. She was no fun. It seemed like every time Harry would raise a question, she would assume wrong things and/or make up excuses why that was not applicable or not important. For example, after a burglary Harry asks \\"why would they take the porn pictures?\\" Eleanor said \\"Maybe one of them was a porn pervert.\\" A witness is murdered. Harry asks Eleanor \\"who knew about the witness at the FBI?\\" Eleanor says \\"Don't even think about that Harry. It can't be.\\" I was tired of hearing her devalue every thought Harry had.There may have been some good reasons for the unpleasant people mentioned above, but the way it was done wasn't fun to read. I felt more annoyance through the book than enjoyment.4. The author used too many abbreviations and slang words without defining them. I didn't know the following: spike, skag spike, score some horse, bolo sheet, hinky, Meadow was a hike, DWP seal.5. The narrator was ok for Harry, but I didn't like his voice for Eleanor. He sounded like an effeminate gay guy. It was unnatural and did not fit for a female FBI agent. I've heard many male narrators speak as women without sounding that way.STORY BRIEF:LAPD homicide cop Harry Bosch investigates the death of Meadows. During the investigation a link to a previous crime is discovered which the FBI was investigating. So Harry teams with FBI agent Eleanor to investigate both crimes together. Harry knew Meadows years ago when they were fighting in Vietnam together. Harry is a great detective but too much of a maverick for internal affairs, which is causing problems for him.OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES:There are at least 17 books in the Harry Bosch series. I wanted to read more than just this one book, so I selected two others to read: books 5 and 8. The reason was because they won awards. I am currently in the middle of book 5 \\"Trunk Music,\\" and I was pleasantly surprised to find that a major character in book 1 reappears in Harry's life in book 5. Harry had not seen this person for five years since book 1. So at this point I'm glad to have read book 1 for background.DATA:Unabridged story length: 13 hrs and 17 mins. Narrator: Dick Hill. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: one, told not shown. Setting: 1990 Los Angeles, California area. Book Copyright: 1992. Genre: crime mystery. Ending: It's a positive ending, but I didn't feel anything. The good guys win. Harry doesn't die - there are many sequels about him."},{"Title":"THE BLACK ECHO.","review":"I won't even go into the plot, just say that if you have read any of Connelly's books and enjoyed them you will like this one also.

An award winning book with great reviews...why didn't I love it? The book is good, with an interesting plot, but I kept putting it down, and wanted it to end. Maybe it was the stories from the War in Viet Nam, the killing in the tunnels and the overall reminder of the guys who never returned, or were never the same when they did return.

Before I read, re-read and loved &quot;Light in August,&quot; I had tried books like &quot;Absalom, Absalom&quot; and &quot;The Sound and The Fury&quot; countless times only to get bogged down in the convoluted grammar and personal symbolism as well as the dialogue. For some reason, when I was ready to really read and concentrate, it was certainly not easy, but it was a great, distinct pleasure....one that has stayed with me. Faulkner is, as novelist and essayist Ralph Ellison calls him, &quot;...the greatest artist the South has produced.&quot;This Modern Library compilation of some of Faulkner's short stories is a perfect place to start to read this author, or to keep returning for his keen insights into the heart and nature of the Southerners he created from the Southerners he knew. There are thirteen stories here and they include one of Faulkner's most famous, &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot; a tale of great love and, perhaps, necrophilia. My personal favorite, depressingly sad though it is, is &quot;Dry September&quot; which tells of the extreme violence not only of small town whites to blacks but of whites to whites. Every one of these superb stories is a gem, masterfully written. Most were intended for magazines and so are much more straight forward and &quot;simple&quot; than the novels.My only complaint and it is with Modern Library, is that, except in two cases, we are not told when Faulkner wrote the stories nor when they were published. Even so, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Selected short stories (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Since reading \\"A Rose for Emily\\" as a boy, I have been hooked on Faulkner. I kept a worn out copy on hand to show to my teachers who accused me of using run-on sentences (some of his sentences took an entire page.) He is a true master and when I feel homesick, after being too long in some foreign country, I read a Faulkner story and remember the South where I grew up.\\"The past is not dead. In fact, it's not even past.\\" --W. Faulkner\\"Faulkner is the greatest artist the South has produced.\\"--Ralph Ellison"},{"Title":"Selected short stories (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Just as most athletes excel in one particular event, so many writers find their greatest work in one genre , primarily. Faulkner is an impressive storyteller but the work he is most remembered for is his long- distance works, his novels, \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" \\" Light in August\\" \\"Absalom, Absalom\\" among others.The stories here nonetheless provide a real sense of Faulkner as a writer. The unmistakeable Faulkner style with its complex and Latinate sentences , its cumulative enveloping rhythm, its penetration of the inner lives of its characters, in grotesque and often extreme relationships, including those in which there is often real violence, is here in these stories.Among the stories in this collection are \\"A Rose for Emily\\" \\" Dry September\\" \\"That Evening Sun\\" \\"Lo\\" \\"Red Leaves\\".Turnabout\\" .I would say to truly know Faulkner at his best and fullest it is necessary to read the novels. But the stories too give the feeling and flavor of this great American master's work."},{"Title":"Selected short stories (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is a great collection for someone who hasn't read much Faulkner. Everyone needs to have at least read &quot;A Rose For Emily&quot; and &quot;Red Leaves.&quot;"},{"Title":"Selected short stories (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"This is a great set of classics that I intend to read again. It is from this prolific novelist that we have a countering view that the American good ol' days of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in the South, were actually not so desirable after all.It is by reflecting upon this perspective that I found \\"A Rose for Emily\\", \\"Barn Burning\\" and \\"Dry September\\" to be the most memorable stories. These particular three had a sequence of developments that focused and reflected upon ugly truths that were hidden behind public veneers of \\"Southern niceties\\". In essence, the outcomes were essentially America's fictional and somewhat factual answer to the rampant pornography throughout England during what was regarded as the pristine Victorian Era.Also, Faulkner had an uncanny way of depicting how societies with unwritten rules of proper mannerisms would be unraveled thanks to a bullying, uncouth citizen or family. His writing style was that of using actions and events that set the transition from what each person was like at the surface to what he or she was really like all along and how those around him or her would be affected in the aftermath.If you are interested in stories about how a person, individually, might have either gotten along or contrasted with the norms and tones of an immediate culture, especially in rural America, Faulkner is the ideal author. And again, this is an excellent collection for those who want to start reading Faulkner. A slight word of warning: some of you might find it shocking that there were troubles and prejudices that set parts of America on edge, especially if most of your exposure to U.S. History has been largely sanitized.As a recommendation, if you enjoy the stories but find some of the terms unfamiliar or the endings ambiguous, I suggest purchasing William Faulkner A to Z as a reading companion."},{"Title":"Selected short stories (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"I have been reading Faulkner since I attended late High school. That was about the time I started experiencing life's disapointments, loneliness and heartache. Before that time I was just a school girl untouched by betrayal,and soul degradation. People should read Faulkner when their lives have been through turmoil-then one can understand his characters. The first story I read was a \\"A Rose for Miss Emily\\". It was one of the most shocking accounts of a woman who was desperately lonely and as a result, engages in necrophilia to stop the emptiness inside of her. But I suppose a dead man is better than no man and thru the years, laying with that dead body or whats left of it, I dont think Miss Emily knew the difference.Sad and depressing as his stories are. Faulkner digs deep into the dark psyche of his characters. Lets face it, we all can relate to Faulkner's characters but we dont want to admitt that we do. Faulkner scares us but one thing I can say about Faulkner, he understands the human condition and he writes about it in an elegant prose. His writing reminds me of placing a beautiful piece of lace over a hideous and disturbed entity.I will continue to read Faulkner only because his stories force me to look at myself a little more closley and as a result, I am better for it."},{"Title":"Selected short stories (The Modern library of the world's best books)","review":"Faulkner is one of Americas best, if not our best, story writes ever.

A mysterious galactic shadow-being with the power to see through time has been sent to Null-A Venus with a single purpose: assassinate Gilbert Gosseyn! The plan succeeds... apparently. But the fourth-dimensional powers of Gilbert Gosseyn's Null-A trained double brain allow him to survive and corner one of the agents of his killer.

Ultimately, however, it is not strength of arms or brilliance of science that will prevail, but the sanity and integrity of the mind, the power, so to speak, of a superior philosophy.The richness and depth of the imagination, the headlong pace, the sudden reversals, make this book a must for any reader who longs for that sense of wonder that defines science fiction.Players of Null-A is a sequel to the famous World of Null-A by the same author."},{"Title":"The Players of Null-A","review":"The novel itself didn't impress me that much as a work of fiction -- although it's been a bestseller for years, and has won some science fiction awards. It's certainly entertaining enough, but it doesn't rank with Heinlein or Asimov, for instance. I read it againrecently, and I still found it kind of simplistic and naive -- very much a product of the 1940's, when it was written.On the otherhand, the 'real' subject of this book is not the protagonist, or the plot: it's a discipline called General Semantics. Gilbert Gosseyn (&quot;Go Sane&quot; -- get it?) has mastered this deceptively simple-seeming, but very complex discipline. As a result, he's able to deal with some pretty daunting challenges, and (well, of course) win out in the end.I discovered this book years ago, and after reading it, I began to wonder if &quot;General Semantics&quot; was 'real'. I did some investigating. Turned out it was, indeed, real.I studied the stuff, and have continued to study and apply it, for years. I can't transport myself across the universe like old Gilbert, -- but I sure owe van Vogt a debt for having put me in touch with gs."},{"Title":"The Players of Null-A","review":"This book is the second in the Null-A series by van Vogt.In my opinion, it was a very good book and much better than the first. The present book had a tighter storyline than the first and came to a more \\"satisfying\\" conclusion - one that explained a lot and only left the reader hanging a little. The technology and \\"special effects\\" in this second book do not seem \\"outdated\\" and \\"quaint\\" as in the first and should be more \\"believable\\" for readers of the present time - the book was written in the 1940's. There is better explanation of General Semantics/Null-A in this book as well, including information on the \\"pause\\"; readers don't have to take quite so much about it on faith (so to speak) as they might have to if all they knew was as given in the first book.I have read that the third book in the series was written much later and was inconsistent with the previous ones and not well liked. It has been said that maybe van Vogt was already ill when he wrote it. There is \\"another\\" third book in the series, Null-A Continuum I think it is called, written by someone else that follows the first two better apparently - this is the one I plan to go to next.Not to give too much away, but in this the the second book, a very shadowy character called the Follower appears and creates havoc. Gosseyn's mind is shuttled back and forth without his consent between his body and that of a Prince Ashargin who is closely connected to Enro - the latter mentioned in the first book as the head of a great interstellar empire. We meet the race of the Predictors. Gosseyn discovers new abilities like prediction of the future and hones others. On Enro's home world, there is a strange religion involving the Sleeping God which plays a very important part in the book as revealed towards the end - this is tied up with the origin of humans in the galaxy no less! Crang and Patricia from the first book reappear.If you liked the first book, you should really like this one. If you didn't care for the first, you may still find this one worthwhile.

Van Vogt is the premiere science fiction writer of the early period (1940's-50's). His novels paved the way for nearly all that came later. Only Aurthur C.

Goyessen is the first character to teleport himself and to control energy sources with his brain. Van Vogt's use of General Semantics as a vehicle for telling the story shows how forward thinking his ideas were.

Under the latter he had two chs. on the Inspiration and Authority of Scripture. They were only \\"ehh\\". I wouldn't recommend paying for the book, but if someone \\"gifts\\" you a copy, you WILL be rewarded by reading the chs. on Mysticism, the Person of Christ, and Adoption. These were actually helpful chapters and even enjoyable - if only here and there. In short, there are better theology texts available for the Reformed reader.

Through reading descriptions of the systems breakdowns of the vehicle, I was able to get a very good idea of how the original vehicles were designed and manufactured. Although few were actually produced over the limited production run (34), the information proved to be very helpful. With the addition of the pictures, the book provided enough information to accurately reproduce a car that will resemble the original. Granted, an exact chassis and body recreation would not be possible from this book, I will be able to get very close based on the exploded and body transparent views. I do not have an original engine or drivetrain, so the vehicle will not be exact either way. Should I desire to get more information, the book did give information as to the locations and owners of the remaining cars.I was very happy with the book and am glad I was able to get one of the few copies still available.Brian Barnett"},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"In this account of a man sentenced to death, Nabokov reveals a talent for the surreal. The accused man has not been told the date of his death sentence. He has been left completely in the dark. He has been locked up in a very bare and sparse prison, with guards, a prison director and assistant. Yet there are no other prisoners, none in the whole facility.The mental musings of the prisoner are the focus of the book. The incidents are often highly surreal and not possible. They sometimes seem like one is reading a Magritte. Yet they are illustrative and fascinating. In one scene his family comes to visit him in prison, complete with furniture. In another he sees the prison director who is also the assistant director as miniature people. Wherever his musings take us, they are truly of great interest.In the final scenes the surreal nature of the musing continues. The scene of the execution is somehow \`disturbed.' Things are not as they should be. And as a result, he just disappears, along with everything else.While the nature of the writing is extremely Kafkaesque, Nabokov had not read any Kafka when he wrote this story. In addition, neither Kafka, nor any of the major existentialists combine their philosophy with surrealism in the same way or to the same degree as does Nabokov in this book.The book is recommended to all lovers of Nabokov and to those looking for a true contemporary classic fiction novel."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"&quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot; is a strange book. First of all, it sports a brilliant preface by the author, and truth be told, this preface is superior to the contents of the novel itself. In response to just a few pages, you feel compelled to buy the author's &quot;Lectures on Literature&quot;, which are only a poor substitute for the real experience of listening to Nabokov in person. The author explains the intricacies of translation, done by his son, Dmitri, under the father's supervision, with particular emphasis put on the title. If you are lucky to know Russian, you will be able to appreciate the importance of the problem at hand, and in addition you will see how well this book is translated into English. At different points in his life Nabokov wrote in three different languages, and &quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot; dates from 1934, in a period where the author still wrote in his beautiful and melodic mother tongue. This is an early book by this author, and ever since its publication it was compared to Franz Kafka's &quot;The Castle&quot;, which annoyed Nabokov a little, which he ironically expresses in the aforementioned preface.&quot;Spiritual affinities have no place in my concept of literary criticism, but if I did have to choose a kindred soul, it would certainly be that great artist [Kafka - the Moose] rather than G. H. Orwell or other popular purveyors of illustrated ideas and publicistic fiction. Incidentally, I could never understand why every book of mine invariably sends reviewers scurrying in search of more or less celebrated names for the purpose of passionate comparison. During the last three decades they have hurled at me (to list but a few of these harmless missiles) Gogol, Tolstoyevski, Joyce, Voltaire, Sade, Stendhal, Balzac, Byron, Bierbohm, Proust, Kleist, Makar Marinski, Mary McCarthy, Meredith (!), Cervantes, Charlie Chaplin, Baroness Murasaki, Pushkin, Ruskin, and even Sebastian Knight. One author, however, has never been mentioned in this connection - the only author whom I must gratefully recognize as an influence upon me at the time of writing this book; namely, the melancholy, extravagant, wise, witty, magical, and altogether delightful Pierre Delalande, whom I invented.&quot;Any type of plot summary will not give this book justice, for you must know that this book is not about the plot. In the case of Invitation to a Beheading, writing a blurb is much like writing a blurb with a summary of an Emily Dickinson poem. Well, once upon a time ago, in the paralell universe of the fantasy realm of Nabokov's imagination, Cincinnatus C. is captured, and found guilty of gnostic turpitude, a crime escaping definition. Cincinnatus has visions. He writes about them. His family visits him in the fortress, where he is locked. And he does not understand a thing of all this mess he found himself in. Yet he does not lose his wit, and tries to manage his fate as best he can. And it turns out that he can manage pretty much, considering. The book is Russian to the bone. Nowhere else are born authors with such a specific sense of humor and absurd. Mother Russia gave us many writers with unique, inimitable style. Nabokov is one of them, although a at the same time having been a prodigal son who never returned to his native land. Like Trevanian, he carried the kernel of culture within himself, he was the culture. Like any other escapist fantasy, Invitation to a beheading can be interpreted in many ways, and that has been done for the last 60 years, and then some, but submissing myself to the author's will, I will leave the story without any further comment. Suffice it to say that this novel is a difficult book, but if you happen to be so inclined, you will jump up, ruffling your hair, to paraphrase the author. I hope you will!"},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Whoever it was that wrote the encyclopedia entry at the top of this page either didn't read the book or didn't understand Nabakov. Invitation to a Beheading is one of the most gorgeous books I've ever read. To drop it under the label &quot;anti-utopian&quot; and try to resolve the ambiguities at the end in a poorly aimed summary doesn't even hint at the richness of the book. Thank goodness Nabakov dedicated his life to writing literature instead of lousey encyclopedia entries. Leaving the political and entering the artistic, the world Nabakov lived in after all, Invitation to a Beheading is one of the finest metaphores on the artistic condition I've ever read. Yes, Kafka is mild in comparision, and, as Nabakov always asserted, there's no connection anyway. --Dane Larsen"},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Often compared to \\"The Trial\\" and \\"The Castle\\", \\"Invitation to a Beheading\\" was written, according to Nabokov in the introduction to this edition, *before* he ever read Kafka. One can believe that or not; either way, Nabokov's book is much more surreal and slapstick than anything Kafka wrote. It is, however, a quintessentially Kafkanaian situation that we find the protagonist Cincinnatus C. facing as the novel opens. He's been sentenced to die; he's not sure why, but it seems it has something to do with his refusal--or constitutional inability--to make a show of enjoying the absurdities and inanities of the world around him. This rejection of conformity, of the communal bond, it seems, has caused society to condemn him for what is the greatest crime on can commit against the group: individuality.Society demands complicity in its upholding of the consensual reality no matter how insane--and Cincinnatus C. won't endorse the insanity and thus he is a threat to reality itself, a destabilizing force.I really enjoyed the first fifty pages or so of \\"Invitation,\\" but one pretty much gets the idea after fifty pages and the routines and jokes wear stale. I found the book hard to finish, primarily, I think, for this very reason. But persevere I did. One thing that didn't help is that whoever the knuckleheads are over at Vintage who wrote the copy on this edition actually gave away the entire story, including the ending, right on the back cover! I mean, this isn't \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" or \\"The Christmas Carol\\" that we're talking about--we don't all know how it comes out in the end. Come on guys, use your heads.Anyway, the back end of *Invitation to a Beheading* does have some rewarding moments, and Nabokov's prose is impeccable as always, his observations sharp, and his wit often laugh-out-loud funny. To give the book three stars, as I do, is simply to say that compared to Nabokov's best, it falls somewhere in the middle of the scale. An early work, perhaps not essential reading, but of continued interest nonetheless...even when you do know how it turns out in the end."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"I first read this book as a student in the 1960's and was puzzled but liked it. It seemed, to quote Nabokov, a violin in a void. Suddenly in 1989 I realised it is a prophecy about the Fall of Communism, its symbolism very close to what actually happened: the State and its ideology - once wielding real power and terror- have withered to an absurd shell, its rewards and blandisments have someting of senile infantilism about them, only its power as a death-dealer is apparently undiminished. The victim, Cincinnatus, suddenly realises he has had enough, stands up and comes to his senses and the whole idiotic apparatus of oppression crumbles to dust. It could have been the story of Prague, Budapest, Warsaw or East Berlin in 1989. My favourite Nabakov, it is a beautiful, haunting and unforgettable piece of writing."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"I only came to know of this early Nabokov novel by reading the wonderful \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" by Azar Nafisi (highly recommended), a study of the relevance of literature in the personal quest for freedom from the crushing weight of oppression. Certainly the protagonist of \\"Invitation to a Beheading,\\" Cincinnatus C., is a relevant case in point, given that he has been sentenced to death for an obscure crime (gnostical turpitude)and is constantly under the manipulatory pressures of absurd agents of the state. In this he is not at all unlike Nafisi and all the other victims of Khomeini's revolutionary guards who interpret the crimes as they go along. Others may find some parallels in modern America.Many have compared this Nabokov (written in 1935) to Franz Kafka, but the wellspring is really more deeply rooted in the existential guilt that plagues the modern psyche. In earlier times, all shared in the social code of justice and understood the right and wrong, whether or not they agreed with it; but in the 20th century, there emerged a certain arbitrainess of authority that made potential criminals of all somewhere inside their minds. I think of the French author Celine in this context, as well as an unpublished novel of my own written almost 40 years ago.So it is easy to see how Nafisi could apply the parallels to her situation in Tehran, forced to veil, forced to accept, unable to flee, to the situation of Cincinnatus C. I think that anyone who has lived an even mildly contemplative life can feel the constriction that such or any arbitrary authority causes.But what I really want to say about \\"Invitation to a Beheading\\" is a bit more personal in nature. Have you ever awoken from a complex dream and thought, \\"I wish I could write this down, it's really a good story\\"? No one I have ever read, including Joyce, has done as well at capturing a dream state as Nabokov does in the early pages of \\"Invitation.\\" And, as if to prove it is not a fluke or a lucky break, he comes back to it again and again, right up until the powerful closing scene.\\"Invitation to a Beheading\\" is a powerful dream that too many of us have had, deep in our own gnostical turpitude. It is almost miraculous that one could capture it so well, especially one such as Nabokov whom we know for his open-eyed precision in the later works. But miraculous or not, our heightened ability to relate to it does not say good things about where we have come in the early days of the 21st century."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"\\"Invitation\\" gives you a glimpse at the ghosts of Nabokov future. It shows off his love of little turns of phrase; eventually his style became more abstract, and the words themselves -- rather than the images they represented -- the center of attention. It also contains the barest outlines of his future cynicism toward reviewers, other writers, and even his reader. (Indeed, I'm never sure whether he likes anyone. I suspect he's the perfect misanthrope.)This book, though, is not nearly as captivating as his later works. It only inspires me to go to the opposite end of his career and read \\"Ada, or Ardor.\\" Those who've not experienced Nabokov would do well to read \\"Lolita,\\" which despite its fame as some kind of highbrow erotica is not even vaguely so; indeed, the Vintage edition comes with Nabokov's (as always, astringent) response to those who think it pornographic. You could also try his autobiography \\"Speak, Memory,\\" but it's always felt like Nabokov's flights of imagery were getting too self-satisfied in that book: yes, Nabokov, we know you're a stylist; now say something.After \\"Lolita,\\" I'd recommend \\"Pale Fire.\\" It's Nabokov as his best and worst: stylistic fun, a maddeningly elusive story, and the sense that you're the victim of a very long joke.As with all the Nabokov I've read, \\"Invitation to a Beheading\\" is worth reading. It's just that some of his books are more worth reading than others. In a life with finite time, I don't think one has time for \\"Invitation to a Beheading.\\""},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Yet another example of the beautiful style of Nabokov. Almost a fairy tale in which a man (Cinncinatus) is condemned to death for knowing too much. The society which sentences him is ludicrous and humourous at the same time, too outlandish to believe, and the main character is the only man who could be considered in touch with reality. In the end as he is on the chopping block, Cinncinatus suddenly leaves this &quot;reality&quot; behind, and the whole world, executioner and all, crumbles behind him. This book was a constant attention getter, drawing me in to the realm of a man captured by a sick society for the crime of being real. This book is worth the read just for the power of storytelling that Nabokov exhibits."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"A very underrated Nabokov book. This is an absurd, dark and above all hilarious book about a man sentenced to death for a reason he is not sure of. The executioner (who pretends to be another inmate in order to befriend the sentenced man) is one of the most brillant characters in any comedic work.Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of absurd humorous books."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"It's almost impossible to give Nabokov anything LESS than five stars. He has become such a giant in the world of literature, that one ceases to be able to compare his work to other authors, and instead begins to hold them up against Nabokov's other works.To validate the statements of so many below, &quot;Invitation to a Beheading&quot; is probably not good intro-Nabokov. Some will find the familiarity of his other works more palatable. As well, it may be unwise to tackle this text without a general knowledge of Eastern European politics.The text is somewhat muddled in places, and I had a hard time deciding whose fault this was...the author's or the editor's. Some sentences were malingering, unclear, and broke up the natural flow of Nabokov's text, which usually reads easily. In the end, I chose sloppy editing and read on.This text is HIGHLY introspective and symbolic, and I found myself actually applying pen-and-paper to the symbols I encountered, trying to sort out what Nabokov was saying. So saying, this book ended up being more academic reading than pleasure reading, but has nevertheless taken up quick residence on my favorite bookshelf."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Nabokov surreal romp is the story of Cincinnatus C., somewhere out there in the faceless depths of Middle Europe, who has just been sentenced to a beheading for the crime of \\"Gnostic turpitude,\\" which must be the legal equivalent of a \\"Universal Fudge Factor\\"; a mental construction to give you the \\"right answer.\\" And the right answer in this case is that Cincinnatus does not fit into society, at least properly, and Nabokov does not dwell on the reason, only that he must leave it for his \\"crime.\\" Nabokov's style is Fellini meets Kafka.Almost the entire novel is set in Cincinnatus' jail cell, as he awaits execution. Yes, he is allowed to leave the cell from time to time, and the reader must ponder if the departures are imaginary trips or aspects of Nabokov's surrealism. The director of the jail, Rodion, is often solicitous of his only inmate, and plays psychological games both for his own edification as well as to have Cincinnatus develop complicity in his own fate. Cincinnatus wife, Marthe, has had a long habit of playing him for the cuckold, as she consummates numerous affairs, some quite openly. Cincinnatus' mother, whom he has met only one time before, also pays him a visit... or, as Nabokov injects the possibility, was she just someone sent from \\"central casting\\" to play the role? There is also Cincinnatus' lawyer, of the missing cufflinks. Nabokov does manage to establish dramatic tension between the utter pettiness of the other characters' daily concerns (like life writ large?) and the fate of Cincinnatus, who desires to know the date of the execution, and that information is knowingly withheld (again, a parallel with life for all of us.)No question, Nabokov is a great writer, and the reader experiences his droll wit, for example: \\"You are very kind,\\" said an additional Cincinnatus, having cleared his throat. \\"Mercy,\\" exclaimed the director, unmindful of the tactlessness of that word. Or how about rich, evocative metaphors: \\"...ne dolzhno bilo bi bit - only on the bark of the Russian language could such a fungus bunch of verbs have sprouted.\\"There is much else in this rather short novel to enjoy, including Cincinnatus reading a 3000 page novel, \\"Quercus,\\" on an oak tree, that he will never be able to finish. The director's young daughter, Emmie, has to be a precursor of Lolita. In one scene I was reminded of General Jack Ripper, inDr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (Special Edition). There are visits from \\"M'sieur Pierre, the prison's second inmate, but to discuss further would give the game away. And the reader is invited to his own reflections when Nabokov describes the last things that I dying man will think about.Despite what at least one other reviewer says, I do believe that this book is highly derivative of Franz Kafka. And it is not up to Nabokov's best writing either, likePale Fire (Everyman's Library (Cloth))or even his own autobiographySpeak, Memory (Everyman's Library (Cloth))For me, far too many of the scenes were too \\"cute,\\" without broader social or literary purpose. In other words, perhaps the novel was half again too long. Thus, in parts I found it enjoyable, and even informative, but only up to 3-stars."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Most of the enjoyment with this book is the discovery of Nabokov's creation. Frankly, I suggest that you skip the reviews here, close your eyes for the moment and simply read the book - the same recommendation that I make for most of his books. Read the comments later.Vladimir Nabokov (1899 to 1977) is a Russian born writer who went to Cambridge, lived in western Europe, then in the US, and finally retired to Switzerland. He has a medium sized body of work with numerous novels, short works, and his non-fiction. Most know him for his 1955 creation of Lolita, which he wrote and re-wrote for over twenty years before the final product. It was based on a real life French story, but set in America. He has 20 novels.Eleven of Nabokov's novels come from his early European period when he could write in many languages but he wrote his first 11 novels all in Russian. This is one of those, one of his last novels, and it was published in 1938 as a book.The book is not about an invitation to a beheading as much as it is about a man on death row. Without giving away the plot, it describes in a very fanciful and unrealistic way, but in a creative fashion as Nabokov can do, the life a prisoner on death row and the people who come to visit.The man is in a jail or in the fortress which is the jail in a small French town. His name is Cincinnatus. We are never told what crime he has commited. He is visited by his lawyer, the jailer, the jail supervisor, his family, etc. To say much more would be to give away the story.As with some of his other novels, it is part reality and part mental images or dreams. It is left to the reader to sort out which is which.I think it is good; it is interesting; but not his best work."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Actually, 3 1/2 stars.In his brilliant introduction to this novel, Nabokov makes several disclaimers as to the book's influences, motivations, and possible applications. He claims that any Kafkaesque similarities are strictly co-incidental; that the birth of the novel in those years in which Stalinism and Nazism were gaining more control over thier respective populations was of no importance; and that any possible psychological ramifications sniggered over by the Freudians are simply ridiculous -- that the novel is nothing more than a \\"violin in a void.\\" And while any Kafka influences can partially be argued away by the fact that Nabokov did not know German, it is harder to discount the turbulent political upheavals that were taking place during the novel's composition. It would be very difficult, I think, for Nabokov, a refugee from Bolshevik Russia and living in Berlin, to be unmoved by what Hitler and the Nazis were constructing and by the irony of fleeing one form of evil to be witness to the birth of an even greater evil.Although the influence of the political machinations of 1934-35 Berlin (during which time the novel was written) cannot be discounted, this is not just a political novel. Nabokov, in most of his work, has concerned himself with the issue of individuality and how the individual is perceived by a collective society. He first broached the subject in depth in his earlier novel, The Eye, in which identity and the perception of that identity become so confused that the reader is left wondering just what has happened. In this novel, the protagonist, Cincinnatus C., is accused of \\"gnostical turpitude\\" or being \\"opaque\\" in a world in which everything is transparent and immediately known to society, where ceremony is valued over intellect and where rationale becomes nothing more that nightmarish absurdity. Cincinnatus, by thinking rationally, clouds up the crystalline clarity of collective thought and is considered dangerous. He is sentenced to death.This is a brilliant novel thematically, but falls a bit short when viewed in its totality. Too often Nabokov seems a bit overburdened by his subject and the usual fluidity and poetry of his style is sadly missing. There is the usual Nabokovian comedy and irreverence but when compared to his more polished works this novel leaves the reader a bit confused and un-satiated; it does, however, makes one think and is as relevant today as when it was written, especially when we seem to be bombarded with poltical rhetoric that sees only one moral and political absolute and does not allow for any opaqueness."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Where else but between the pages of Nabokov's Invitation to a Beheading could one find a story so well written and so exceptionally powerful that you beg for more. The story follows a lonely isolated man who responds to the name of Cinncinatus. He is charged for a crime rarely described and sentenced to death for it. And what more is reason does not exist in this world, it's inhabbited by irrasional, and rather frustrating characters. The characters are odd, granted, but they are described with such passion, and such enthusiasm that they truly come alive. This is an art I love about Nabokov (as well as the other Russian authors Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, etc). However there are some weak points to this story, One is the repitition of descriptions, and Two is the vague details of some events. I got confused at some points in the book (however I am only 17 and this is the first non short story I read by nabokov). All in all the book is fascinating, and a defenite read. -sorry for the spelling errors-"},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Previous Nabokov novels took place in the recognizable world, in fact in the same city (Berlin) among the same group of people (Russian emigres). I'm curious as to what may have provoked him to change his setting so radically in the late 1930s. \\"Invitation to a Beheading\\" is flat-out fantasy. Wow.This approach may not have been all that good for him. In the books he wrote before this, the strangeness of the details - the man who's convinced he's dead, the automatons who act out the novel's actions - sat more easily in the mind because we, the readers, knew which rules were being broken. The rules of \\"Invitation\\" are totally unfamiliar, which gives us a whole lot more to figure out, and Nabokov doesn't seem to care whether we do or not.Cincinnatus C, the protagonist, begins this story as his death sentence is whispered into his ear by the presiding judge, as per the custom of his land. His crime is never explained, although it has something to do with the fact that he is opaque whereas the other citizens of his city are transparent. This may be more an allegorical characteristic than a physical one, as is the case with so many other odd things that happen to him until the novel closes.Anyway, he spends most of the rest of the novel in his jail cell awaiting execution. What he wants most is to know his death date, but no one seems to know what it is, or at any rate won't tell him. This makes it impossible for him to begin his written explanation of his thoughts and deeds, since he has no idea how much time he'll have to work. The portion he does write shows us that he believes he knows something that no one else does, but he can't seem to put this secret into words.Meanwhile, he's in one strange prison. His jailer, the director of the prison, and his attorney all have similar names and seem to change places (not to mention beards) on a regular basis. The director's daughter, a preteen, promises to rescue Cincinnatus, and when he sort of accidentally finds himself outside the prison walls, she leads him right back inside. His unfaithful wife visits a couple of times, once with her family and all her furniture and once without. And then there's his one fellow prisoner, the plump, conceited and much-admired Monsieur Pierre, whose role is at least as mysterious as Cincinnatus's own crime.The fact that this story reminded many readers of Kafka is no surprise. Nabokov claimed that he knew no German at the time he wrote \\"Invitation\\" and had never heard of Kafka, but the similarities are pretty clear. Unlike Kafka's characters, though, Cincinnatus constantly rebuffs his tormentors by insisting that they are all actors in some play, put on for the benefit of directors unknown. Maybe it's even put on by Cincinnatus himself.In other words, here's yet another prose piece on the subject of what it's like to write a prose piece. God forbid I should try to dictate to a master author what he should and should not write about, but this story can be a pain in the rear simply because it's so hard to identify with Cincinnatus's bizarre experiences. Nabokov's style is sufficiently engaging, most of the time, to keep our interest alive, but he certainly gave himself a tough job here; is stylistic beauty and invention enough to substitute for the usual rules of storytelling?Probably not, but there is enough of a plotline to keep things moving forward. Indeed, upon reflection, Cincinnatus's memoirs could be pretty nearly any other effort. The problem is that everyone around him seems to think he should stop wasting time with this project and be grateful for their time and attention. Never mind that they're about to chop his head off. I think you'll agree that this attitude is more than a little unfair, but what is Cincinnatus to do?Well, it's not exactly a spoiler to inform you just what he does about it, since that detail appears in the blurb on the volume's back cover; as he goes to his execution, Cincinnatus becomes aware of creatures like himself behind the false front that is his city, and so he simply wills that city out of existence, citizens and all, and goes to join those bright beings.Now, this conclusion feels a bit tossed off. Granted that Cincinnatus has been loudly insisting that his prison, his oppressors, his very existence are all a fiction since the beginning of Invitation; nevertheless, these bright beings do not appear until almost the very last page. So what's the big deal?Here's my assumption: Once Cincinnatus has definitively refused to take his predicament seriously, he takes on the powers of an author - indeed, the author of his own life. This may explain the surrealistic, even dreamlike, character of \\"Invitation's\\" events. Be that as it may, \\"Invitation\\" reads somewhat like a representation of the artist's journey.Those of your who have read any of my other Nabokov reviews will know that the man covered the same territory in previous work, and you'll probably agree with me that Nabokov himself would have loathed any such interpretation. It's as likely as not that my reading of this novel is just plain wrong; that there are depths here that I simply don't get. I'm no scholar, I just like to read novels.Well, I liked reading this one. It's fun. If I'm misinterpreting it, too bad. And Nabokov always insisted that his novels were to be understood purely through what they said, so I'm just going to enjoy \\"Invitation to a Beheading\\" as the amusing game it is on the surface and let it go at that.Benshlomo says, You spent the money to buy this book, so don't get yourself crazy trying to comprehend the dratted thing."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Nabokov makes it clear that he is his own man, that he is not out to mimic anyone. Yet, Nabokov seems to compete with some styles of writing, explore things, he is not in dialogue with them like Flaubert was in dialogue, or Goethe, or Dickens. Nabokov is Nabokov first a writer second and that is about it; but with Nabokov it is enough. The book is peppered with some beautifully crafted paragraphs but not consistent. The story's effect is likely what Nabokov describes in his forward as doing although there is a formative element that one may find. I've been looking for Pnin II and haven't found it. That is my favorite Nabokov book so far."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Cincinnatus is condemned to death for perpetrating the vague crime of Gnostic Turpitude, which seems, in its obscurity, to be no worse than being a highly imaginative and articulate outsider. In prison, the depressed Cincinnatus, a would-be writer, is tortured by uncertainty and time, with the date of his execution unspecified. His predicament, he says, is that he cannot use his remaining days to produce his magnum opus since he does not know, if he begins, whether he will have the time to complete his work.In his impending death, Cincinnatus faces a variation of a universal experience. Nonetheless, the underlying story that Nabokov conveys in INVITAION TO A BEHADING is, IMO, subtler and more interesting. This story explores how a society that condemns a man for, basically, thinking differently develops intricate codes of personal and legal behavior that rationalize its brutal and unjust systems. In BEHEADING, these codes--since they are the invention of the great and ingenious Nabokov--are hilarious, albeit cruel, parodies. Their effect is to torture a wrongly condemned man while serving to ritualize the expiation of guilt, which a society might otherwise experience if it had to face the substance of its actions.The quirky thing about the doomed Cincinnatus is that he acknowledges and reluctantly accepts his society's power. At one point, for example, he passively allows a nymphet to lead him back to prison after his miraculous escape. (Or did I misread?) And in the book's ending, Cincinnatus, living in his imagination, is hardly fighting society's sentence. At some level, the Nab seems to be saying, we are all complicit in ritualized and brutal societal dishonesty. The eerie resemblance between Cincinnatus and Pierre also suggests the creepy overlap of the world.BEHEADING also offers its readers Nabokov's usual brilliant and wry prose and uniquely inventive perspective. Here, for example, is Cincinnatus imaginatively triumphing over his torturous incarceration.\\"What a misunderstanding,\\" said Cincinnatus and suddenly burst out laughing. He stood up and took of the dressing gown, the skullcap, the slippers. He took of the linen trousers and shirt. He took off his head like a toupee, took off his collar bones like shoulder straps, took off his rib cage like a hauberk. He took off his hips and his legs, he took off his arms like gauntlets and threw them in a corner. What was left of him gradually dissolved, hardly coloring the air. At first Cincinnatus simply reveled in the coolness; then, fully immersed in his secret medium, he began freely and happily to...\\"The iron thunderclap of the bolt resounded...\\"Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Take a deep breath and think of this: you are on Death Row, in the final weeks of your life. It is a harrowing thought. Whenever I donate blood, I always think of what it must be like to be a condemned person strapped to a gurney as a medical professional administers one last lethal \\"stick.\\"The present book is an examination of the final weeks of a man who is ostensibly convicted of murder. Strangely enough, the crime itself is not discussed @ length. We are given access to his thoughts, his fears and the dread of his upcoming execution.Along the way, we are introduced to a variety of extremely eccentric characters. Some are such buffoons as to make the book almost a comedy - in a morose sort of way. The persona is alone in more ways than one as the jailers, prison administrators and even his wife & family seem to have little else but apathy for his plight.One of the puzzling things about the book is its locale and epoch of time. It obviously takes place in the 20th century as there are electric lights & cameras alluded to. However, we're not told what country. The main character has an Italian name (Cincinnatus) but there are also French & Russian names. The country is never named.Most anachronistic is the method of execution: Cincinnatus is to be beheaded via an executioner with an ax. Perhaps the guioltinne is still used in some remote places in the world, but I've not heard of people being executed in this manner in civilized countries since the middle ages.In any case, this is a worthwhile book for persons who have an infatuation with Death Row life & Death Row themes. Just one note: I would recommend that anyone interested in this book NOT read the back cover. Thankfully, I did not do so until after I had finished. I don't like to have the whole story \\"given away\\" and there is an interesting plot twist that is far better to be encountered while reading the novel rather than during the perusal of the back cover."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Invitation to a Beheading is a short novel written during Nabokov's prolific Berlin phase in his late 20s and 30s, (if you have only read Nabokov's more famous later works, written in English, such as Lolita, Ada and Pale Fire then I urge you to pick up his emigre period novels, all of them available in translation). It is not one of his greatest works, but it is a compelling tale of the last 19 days of Cincinattus, a mild mannered non conformist who is imprisoned in bizzarre and surreal circumstances (his crime: gnostical turpitude) and spends his final days leading up to his execution, the date of which he is not told despite his repeated exhortions to his jailers.The story is a touching piece of dystopian literature (a genre I confess to not being overly familiar with, I have read The Trial by Kafka, but not 1984 by Orwell - a shocking solecism I know, I vow to rectify it soon). Cincinattus is tormented by his captors who eat his food, use his cell as an office and play games which Cincinattus has to muster all of his remaning dignity to avoid falling into. The most tender scenes are those where he writes - a doomed literature, much like the censored writers struggling under Stalinism, who knows his work will never be read. He writes, to preserve something of himself, to avoid his essence vanishing alltogether: 'I am trembling over the paper, chewing the pencil through to the lead, hunching over to conceal myself from the door through which a piercing eye stings me in the nape.'Those little stylistic bursts of pure writing talent are the main reason I read Nabokov. For me he is the greatest stylist of 20th Century Literature. Only Nabokov could produce a sentence like the following, the final sentence of chapter 7, when Cincinattus's reading has been interrupted by the bullying guards, who have snatched a vase of peonies, splashing water: 'Cincinnatus kept staring into the book. A drop had fallen onto the page. Through the drop several letters turned from brevier to pica, having swollen as if a reading glass were lying over them.'Joyce, Updike et all, would kill to be able to write prose that beautiful."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Nabokov was an immensely talented writer, and could wield prose like few other authors. (If you're anticipating a \\"but\\" here, you're right.) But, he fell flat with Invitation to a Beheading.The story focuses on a man, Cincinnatus, sitting on death row, in what appears to be the most incompetently organized prison on earth. His execution date is forever being delayed (which irks Cincinnatus, as all he truly desires to know is the date of his impending death); he receives a visit from his in-laws in which they bring their own furniture to his cell; he is constantly slipping in and out of reality, living in an imagined world of freedom; and he speaks often of his cellmate -- a large spider.And perhaps the most frustrating element? Nabokov never intends to inform the reader why Cincinnatus is imprisoned, only revealing that (I promise this is not a spoiler) he is there for a crime of \\"gnostic turptitude.\\" Huh.The story seems non-cohesive, never really following a linear story arc, so an overall theme or \\"point\\" never presents itself. My only deduction is that the book is really a social commentary, expressing the view that capital punishment is an absurd, silly, and ultimately, wicked atrocity. Without knowing Nabokov's person feelings on the subject, it's impossible to know if this is a correct analysis or not, but it seems to fit.Skip this one and read Nabokov's finer works, such as Lolita."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"The musings of Kafka and other Eastern European writers are among my favorite. Though Nabokov claims to have had no familiarity with Kafka's \\"The Trial\\" as he wrote \\"Invitation to a Beheading\\", the book bears a striking resemblance. If one reads this book expecting another Kafka, the reader might be disappointed. If a reader views this work according to its own merits as they should, the book should be a pleasureable read.Cincinnatus C. has been imprisoned and sentenced to death for \\"gnostical turpitude.\\" Other parts of the story explain his crime is his inability to fit in with the rest of his society. The imprisonment and execution include a series of bizarre contradictions except for the fact that they occur only in Cincinnatus's mind. Frustrated by the inability of others to tell when he will be put to death, Cincinnatus retreats to a world of musing through his somewhat scattered writings. The line between reality and fiction blurs until the line is no longer existent in the final pages.Despite the inprobabilty of Kafka's influence, I think my love of Kafka tarnished this work in my eyes. No writer can explore the irrational world like Kafka, though Nabokov shows similar strength. In reality, how often does the real world make sense? Perhaps this is the reason works of this vein are so popular."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"I am a fan of Vladimir Nabokov and of this novel in particular.

I'm not knocking you. It's an enviable position to be in.If you are still interested enough to continue reading this, I'll tell you why I share the ending. What I want you to understand from this ending is that, while the novel is similar to Kafka at times, it is mostly nothing like Kafka. Dark wackiness and alienation abound but these are still two very different writers.The comparison is incredibly easy to make and I fear that, if you allow yourself to make it, you will miss the book while reading it. Kafka is wonderful and I am a huge fan. His writing is determined, though.

Ironically, INVITATION feels just as unsuccessful as THE TRIAL because it also reads clumsily, although this may have to do with each novel's translation.Nabokov also does not show his true talents on this work. Absent is the cleverness and acidic humor of his English novels. I'm inclined to believe that the translation by his son, Dmitri Nabokov, is not to blame for this, as Vladimir Nabokov was careful to check the accuracy of translations of his works.Although the novel is incredibly slow for much of the book, it does recover at the end, with the vividly portrayed maelstrom of Cincinnatus' awakening.Not the best novel of Nabokov's to begin with, in spite of its ubiquity in mall bookstores. Try LOLITA instead. PALE FIRE is perhaps his best work, but requires knowledge of his style's history before one tackles it."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"Ask me any questions you may not have, friends. By mounting the reviewer's scaffold, I've sentenced myself to reply on behalf of the author, who is otherwise disposed. What's this book about, you ask? Why, the same thing all books are about, you and me. But what happens in it? That's an impertinent question! Why should my author be troubled to say what his book is about when you can read it for yourself. Humble apologies then, but is there a setting? Oh, there may or may not be a setting, or more precisely, a sitting, in a cell in a castle across a river from a town of exceptional ordinariness, but the cell shows all the hallmarks of quantum measurability. And characters? Yes, yes, one or more. A certain Cincinnatus, who bears a close resemblance to Schroedinger's cat, is encapsulated in his cells, as we all are, awaiting his death by beheading for the crime of gnostical turpitude, of which he would no doubt be guilty if he knew what it meant. His guard, the guard's small daughter, his lawyer, the warden, his wife and in-laws, his mother whom he doesn't know, and his executioner-to-be, an outlandish primo donno, all pop in and out of his cellular anomie like punch-and-judy puppets operated by sadistic voyeurs. Is the whole tale a fabulation in Cincinnatus's mind? No, of course not. Cincinnatus is a fabulation in the author's mind. Try to ask more sensible questions, please! Is this a fable of life in the dungeons of communism? That's enough! I can't continue to evade your questions on behalf of Mr. Nabokov if you don't frame them in surreal terms!People have said about music that it is the most expressive of arts but that it's impossible to say precisely what it expresses. Nabokov's early writings - Invitation to a Beheading was written in Russian and published in Paris in 1938 - were immediately compared to the works of Franz Kafka, and although Nabokov disputes the association, I should think most readers would accept it. A determined reader could demand an either/or of this Beheading: either the whole thing is a \`morbid' fantasy in the mind of a neurasthenic fellow whose name may be Cincinnatus, or the \`real' Cincinnatus is absorbed in fretful day dreams which are brought to a final page only with his actual death. I prefer to dodge either/or questions, being a musician, and to suggest that Invitation to a Beheading is music, and therefore means whatever I think it means. You, dear reader, are welcome to share my musical appreciation.Here's how Nabokov describes Cincinnatus's departure from his cell en route to the scaffold: Cincinnatus, who, alas, had suddenly lost the capacity of walking, was supported by M'sieur Pierre [the executioner] and a soldier with the face of a borzoi. For a very long time they clambered up and down staircases - the fortress must have suffered a mild stroke, as the descending stairs were in reality ascending and vice versa. Again there were long corridors, but of a more inhabited kind; that is, they visibly demonstrated - either by linoleum, or by wallpaper, or by a sea chest against the wall - that they adjoined living quarters. At one bend there was even a smell of cabbage soup. Further on they passed a glass door with the inscription \\"ffice,\\" and after another period of darkness they abruptly found themselves in the courtyard, vibrant with the noonday sun.Now then, dear amazonian book shoppers, you'll have to join the throng of townspeople hastening toward the place of execution in order to sop up the sanguinary verbiage at the foot of the scaffold."},{"Title":"Invitation to a beheading","review":"This is the first of Nabokov's books that I've read and was rather unimpressed by it.

I don't believe what the copy on the back cover says either. Cinnatus doesn't will his executioners out of existance.

This unique collection of the four plays he wrote between 1879 and 1884 provides teachers of drama/literature with an opportunity to look at a major writer trying to develop his craft. Ibsen is concerned with social criticism and each of these plays reflects his change in perspective as he tries to write a drama that will be both socially relevant and commercially successful. You have to remember the time and place that considered it shocking for Nora to leave her husband or for Mrs. Alving to consider euthenasia for her son. By turning to &quot;comedy&quot; (of a sort) in &quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; Ibsen found a way of making his point in a manner more acceptable to his audiences. By looking at not only the plays but how each was received by the public, teachers/students can better appreciate what Ibsen was trying to do with each successive play.For all four of these plays the notion of responsibility is primary. In &quot;A Doll's House&quot; Nora Helmer decides to leave her husband because he is unworthy of her love. In &quot;Ghosts,&quot; Mrs. Alving has to decide whether she should give her diseased son poison as a mercy killing. In &quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; Dr. Stockmann decides to stay and fight to have the infected baths repaired even after the town ostracizes him. Finally, in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; the idealist Gregers Werle comes home and destroys a family by insisting the truth be told. A classroom set of this particular volume is relatively inexpensive and provides an excellent case study of the growth of a major writer. Students do not often get the opportunity to read several works by the same writer. Shakespeare is the exception to this rule, but usually students are exposed to different types of plays (comedy, tragedy, history) rather than to a series of consecutively written plays."},{"Title":"Four Great Plays By Ibsen","review":"henrik ibsen has perfected the realist movement in theatre. he has accomplished what so few have: to maintain the realistic effect, without succumbing to the tediousness of every day life. his plays ring true for the common man, yet not in a pedestrian manner that becomes boring. in my opinion, he far surpasses any other playwright in the realist movement, including chekhov."},{"Title":"Four Great Plays By Ibsen","review":"So much in reading Ibsen depends upon the translation of these great works. These four plays of Ibsen's so-called &quot;realistic period&quot; revolve around social issues of his day which plague us 100 years later. Do we ever learn from such literary wake-up calls? Although the dramatic tensions here, which could have easily have been 20th Century tensions, rumble through these plays, the translations here are wordy and dated, thus making the plays sound overly melodramatic and at times downright silly. Still, everyone should read -- and discuss -- Ibsen's plays for their uneasy questions regarding universal social problems: money, privacy, freedom to act, government corruption, unchecked journalism, and the moral and physical diseases which only seem to wear a new face each year."},{"Title":"Four Great Plays By Ibsen","review":"This book is great!

It was originally written in 1864, perhaps for new missionaries who wished to master the language through grammar-translation methods so that they could better spread the Word. It begins with a two-page summary of pronunciation and phonology. Then it turns to parts of speech, with examples of nouns, pronouns, adjectives, numerals, fractions, verbs, etc. This section concludes with a two paragraph article on word formation. The second part of the book covers syntax, with examples of such topics as affirmative and negative sentences, attributive adjectives, predicates, infinitives, possessive constructions, dependent clauses, and comparatives. At the end of the book are seven short passages presented in word-by-word translation drawn from the Bible and Hawaiian mythology.For all but the most determined reader, this book is a very frustrating tract. The author repeatedly displays the chauvinistic linguistic attitudes of the Nineteenth Century, in which Greek and Latin were held to have the most worthy types of grammars, while English grammar was acceptable if imperfect, and grammars from \\"savage\\" languages such as Hawaiian were lame, unable to express complex concepts. Thus, Alexander often points out constructions that can't be translated directly into Hawaiian or laments the lack of complex structures (but provides very weak coverage of grammatical areas in which Hawaiian is more complex than English or Greek). Of course, this was the accepted approach of the time, so Alexander can't be faulted for it specifically.Setting aside these points, readers interested in learning something of the grammatical structure of the language will find the book quite frustrating. With each grammatical point, Alexander provides a brief description framed in the terms and analysis of linguistic understanding of his day. Since this description is at odds with current grammatical terminology, hence frequently hard to comprehend, readers must rely on the examples to see what meaning was intended. However, the examples are most often presented as complex phrases, for which whole phrase English translations are provided, but not word-by-word translations. Thus, unless one already knows the meanings of each of the vocabulary items in the example, it is impossible to even identify where in the phrase the relevant grammatical construction appears, let alone understand how the construction works. Diligent work with an extensive dictionary will be needed to make any use of the examples.It's impossible to tell from the text alone whether the book might be relevant for study of modern Hawaiian. Certainly, students wishing to study the modern language might be advised to look elsewhere for a more readable grammar. But perhaps this volume may have value in its documentation of how the language was spoken one hundred and fifty years ago (that is, if the example sentences were spoken by fluent speakers, and are not simply missionary translations)."},{"Title":"A short synopsis of the most essential points in Hawaiian grammar","review":"...but, reproduction looks faded.

As a Libertarian, I needed to understand the thinking behind the man and philosophy that has swept the world. Recommended to anyone who needs a synthesis."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"Peter Singer's description of Marx's life and ideas is mostly fair and lucid, but sometimes he unfairly criticizes Marx or simply calls an idea or claim of his \\"obviously wrong\\" or \\"contrary to common-sense truths\\" (I may be paraphrasing). One example is Marx's claim that all surplus value is derived from human labor and that therefore machines and automation reduce the rate of profit. Instead of trying to explain what Marx may have meant by this and how it made sense for him, Singer simply calls it \\"obviously wrong,\\" because \\"future capitalists will not find their profits drying up as they dismiss the last workers from their newly automated factories.\\"Instead of simply dismissing Marx by saying that this is obviously wrong, I wish Singer would give this statement a bit more thought. Marx states that all surplus value is derived from human labor. The capitalist who buys machines has to buy them from another capitalist, who will demand exactly what those machines are worth (their exchange value). The machines are worth whatever they can produce on their own, minus maintenance costs (which in Singer's example would have to be done by fully automated and self-sustaining robots, since otherwise human wage labor would still be involved). In summary, the capitalist who wishes to own a completely automated robot factory cannot make a profit, because whatever he will get for the commodities produced by the machines will have factored into the price he has to pay for those machines to begin with.You can of course disagree with the logic here and I am not saying that it is necessarily true, but I do think that this is one way of explaining Marx's theory of wage labor and surplus value that provides significantly more insight into it than dismissing it as \\"obviously wrong\\" off-hand.There are many more examples, but this review has already gotten a bit long. However, I should note that Singer's claim that \\"many of Marx's other theories have been refuted by events\\" is rather dubious.a)Marx did not define \\"subsistence level\\" as mere survival, but also factored in necessary recreation and other things that would explain why some workers make more money than they need to survive, especially in industrialized countries where a too crass disparity in living standards might have significant adverse effects on the relations of production (such as social unrest).b)Marx takes a long-term view of history, and when one considers the Cold War a historic anomaly in the development of capitalism it seems much more plausible today (Singer's text was originally published in 1980) that in the long term many of Marx's predictions that Singer considers to have been refuted may very well be true, such as that \\"economic crises will become more and more severe\\" (the Very Short Introduction version of the text was published in 2000, well before the last great crisis of 2008).If anything, in 2012 one might say that many of Marx's theories and predictions have been validated, whereas Singer is the one who has been \\"refuted by events.\\"Despite the book's shortcomings, however, it does provide a decent introduction to Marx's theories, especially when one ignores Singer's editorializing. The last chapter can be skipped, as the book predictably ends with another dismissal of Marx as a well-intended utopian."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"The Past Masters Series is a concise, lucid , aythoritative introduction to the thought of leading intellectual figures of the past whose ideas still influence the way we think today. ... sees Marx as a philosopher, rather than as an economist or social scientis.

The chapter devoted to Singer's mediocre economic analysis is as long as the chapter devoted to Das Kapital!Although the book has some good material, that good material constitutes only ~30 pages."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"Because I like short books, I have tried several of the \\"Very Short Introduction...\\" series. I have been unable to finish any of them.But Peter Singer is a world famous thinker. He is probably best known for writingAnimal Liberation, a book that jump started the animal rights movement (which I haven't read). I have read Singer's critique of George W Bush (The President of Good and Evil) and liked it well enough. So I felt Singer's study of Marx was worth giving the series another shot.A discussion of as controversial a figure as Karl Marx should come with some forewarning to the reader about the pre-conceptions of the author. I came to Singer's book with a low opinion of the relevance of Marx's philosophy to our time, but with the understanding that Marx may have seemed more relevant to an earlier age. I have never read any Marx directly (and have no immediate intention of rectifying that gap in my education - one has only so much time but an endless supply of reading material), although I have probably encountered at least his major ideas in various forms.Reading Singer's book, I came out even less impressed with Marxist thought than I was when I started. I always knew the Marxist project depended on the philosophy of G.W.F Hegel (1770--1831), but I was ignorant of the gory details. As it turns out, gory they are.Hegel's philosophy was based on a quest by a metaphysical entity, Mind, to discover itself. This quest was the history of humankind, which Hegel, somewhat immodestly, thought culminated in himself. \\"When Mind, manifested in the mind of Hegel, grasps its own nature, the last stage of history has been reached.\\" (p. 39)Because this was absurd, some of Hegel's disciples tried to transform the Hegelian concept into something more palatable. History was still a quest, but not *that* kind of quest. For Marx \\"labor in the sense of free productive activity is the essence of human life.\\" (pp. 35-36). In a capitalistic society, laborers produce what they are paid to produce, not what they want to produce. Consequentially, they are \\"alienated from the product of their own labor\\". Being alienated from the \\"essence of human life\\" is self evidently wrong, and so history is a quest of overcoming this alienation.Because no matter how much you are being paid for your labor, you are still alienated from your essence by working for pay, the only solution, the inevitable solution, is the abolition of the Capitalistic order. History has \\"unconscious tool[s]... bringing about that revolution\\" (quotes on p. 56). \\"Communism . . . is the genuine resolution of the antagonism between man and nature and between man and man; it is the true resolution of the conflict between existence and essence, objectification and self affirmation, freedom and necessity, individual and species. It is the riddle of history solved and knows itself as this solution\\" (quoted on p. 37).Why anyone who is not a thrall to Hegel's philosophy should think that history is a quest and that human life has an essence is a mystery to me. Once you remove the metaphysics, all Marx seems to be saying is that he does not approve of waged labor. Well, so what? Why should anyone care about the preferences of one nineteenth century German intellectual?Singer's account attributes to Marx so problematic a view that I suspect Singer may have missed something*. According to Singer, Marx claimed that the gains of productivity are all accumulated to the Capitalist. When productivity rises (as with the invention of new labor saving technology), the same amount of inputs (and specifically labor) can produce higher outputs. Consequentially, there is a profit. According to Singer, Marx believed that competition between workers would drive down the wage they would receive to subsistence level - meaning that they gain nothing from the increase in productivity (because they would be paid the same wage - subsistence wage - whether there was a productivity increase or not).But this clearly is not the end of the story. Just as competition between workers would reduce the gains from productivity increase to the laborer, so would competition between capitalists reduce their gains. The gains would pass on to the consumer. And as most consumers are workers, rather than Capitalists, the end benefactor is the proletariat.The evidence is all around us. A century ago, a car was a luxury reserved for the richest of the rich. Today, a low wage worker in a middle income country can own a car that the millionaires of yesteryear could only dream of.In the end, Singer tries to salvage Marx by emphasizing the parts of Marx's thought that are still worthwhile. There's not much. Marx argues that because in a capitalistic society everyone makes their own choices individually, the end result is a society that no one person would have chosen. Singer calls this a \\"penetrating insight\\" (p. 92). It is nothing of the sort. No society could ever be to everyone's tastes. Were it run by a dictator, society would be chosen by one person but not by everyone else; even a democratic society is chosen by a coalition of sections of the people - so it does not correspond exactly to anyone's tastes. And this is before we've mentioned the law of unintended consequences...Marx's other \\"lasting contribution to modern thought\\" was \\"shatter[ing] the assumption that our intellectual and spiritual lives are entirely independent of our economic existence\\". I doubt such assumption was ever widely held, and anyway \\"his own view of human nature is false. Human nature is not as pliable as he believed.\\" (pp. 93-94).I suspect Marx's main achievements were rhetorical rather than intellectual. Again and again, Marx managed to shape public discourse not with his ideas, but with his rhetoric. Phrases like \\"religion is opium for the masses\\" and \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\\" are still quoted widely today. And of course, \\"workers of the world, unite\\" is a soaring call to arms.InThe Problematics of Moral and Legal TheoryJudge Richard Posner distinguishes between academic philosophers and moral entrepreneurs. The latter influence not by tight reasoning and meeting academic standards, but by carrying out their message to the people. They agitate the masses, inflame emotion, rekindle the spirit. Perhaps Marx was not a philosopher, but a Prophet.*29 August 2009 update: At the urging of one of the commentators, I've tackled Schumpeter'sCapitalism, Socialism, and Democracy. Schumpeter concurs that Marx has made this argument. One point for Singer."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"Cute little gem. Easy enough.

A serious philosophical study of Marx should be free of the prejudices against Marxist thought that an American or British writer will most likely have. I believe this small book covers the basics of Marxist theory (although it skips Marx's thinking about the arts, gender relations, etc.) but the evaluative conclusion is filled with all the typical \\"Cold War Era\\" cliched opinions you'd expect, about how the leaders of Communist countries own private cars while the real proletariat walk, etc. Oxford University Press should find a scholar of philosophy to write a new \\"Very Short Introduction\\" to Marx which is relevant to this century."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"item was exactly as described and in great condition...arrived in a timely fashion, thanks!! A+"},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"Peter Singer's \\"Marx: A Very Short Introduction\\" is a superbly lucid and concise introduction to the subject of Marx and Marxism. Assuming the reader has no background in Marx's thought, Singer covers most of the important issues of Marxism and then assesses Marx's achievements and shortcomings in a refreshingly balanced manner.What makes this book such a valuable introduction is Singer's clear understanding of what lies at the heart of Marxism: the issue of human freedom. Too many works on Marxism reduce it to a merely economic philosophy, which has the destruction of capitalism (and subsequent liberation of the world's workers) as its end. This is a gross misrepresentation of Marx's thought. Marx saw the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a classless society as means toward the true end which he sought: the liberation of humanity from oppression and exploitation and a return to our true nature as creative, self-actualizing beings rather than mere laboring appendages to an economic machine. Marx envisioned a world in which humanity toiled with its individual and universal fulfillment as the goal, rather than a world in which a few grow rich while the many dig ditches or work in Asian sweatshops for Nike. Freedom, true freedom, was the purpose behind Marx's work and also his life.I highly recommend this book as a serious, thorough, and fair introduction to this complex subject.

I recommend this book as a good place to start when looking at Marx."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"This is a remarkably clear introduction to the thought of Karl Marx. I was a little dubious when I picked it up (I read 3 or 4 of the Very Short Introduction books each year), since most of my knowledge of Singer is through his work either on Animal Ethics, Utilitarianism, or his critique of George W. Bush. In fact, I became a vegetarian 25 years ago after reading Singer and Gandhi at the same time. Marx, though, is a horse of a different color. I was simply not confident that he would write as well on the founder of Marxism as well as he did on practical ethics. If anything, he turned out to write even more clearly on Marx than anything else I've read.The problem with Marx is that he wrote so much, much of it in advanced draft form, that one can extract several different Marx's from his pages. It isn't that he is inconsistent that his thinking is constantly in flux as he considers one or another aspect of the issues surrounding capitalism. There truly is no final version of Marx's thought, but rather interim versions. The various books and manuscripts almost serve as commentaries on the other books and manuscripts. The trick is to extract the core of what Marx thought without unduly distorting his work as a whole and without reducing him to a caricature. Singer does a great job of highlighting major themes and trends in Marx's thought while not losing the sense of the difficult of determining with finality precisely what Marx wrote.The importance of a book like this cannot be overstressed. Anyone who knows anything at all about Marx knows that he would have been appalled at the Communist revolutions of the twentieth century. As Singer rightly points out, Marx would unquestionably have been a victim of one of the purges. Whatever complicity Marx had with the excesses of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao is tenuous and debatable (though given that all three cited Marx as their inspiration means that Marx's responsibility for what followed can be legitimately discussed, even if he is exonerated). Not everything he wrote about Capitalism (a term he invented) has proven to be true (though a great deal that he wrote remains shockingly relevant). Those who in 1989 delightedly proclaimed that history had refuted Marx got it all wrong. The fact is that all of us today, even political and economic conservatives, have had our consciousness completely altered by Marx. Nearly all history is done today with unexamined assumptions that we took from Marx. No one would undertake a study of any historical topic without a consideration of the socio-economic factors involved. Sociology, philosophy, political science, economics, and virtually every subject one can consider has been deeply informed by Marxist ideas. Those proclaiming Marx the loser in 1989 got it all wrong: he had won way before then. He has shaped the modern mind as fully as Freud, Martin Luther, Newton, or Darwin. We think through Marxist categories, even when we oppose him.This is just one reason why it is so important to understand what he was about. There are many other very good elementary intros to Marx's thought. Robert Heilbroner's book on Marx is a great one. Ernest Mandel has an excellent short introduction to Marx's economic theory. But I would put Singer's book up there with those. If you are looking for a clear first introduction to Marx, you can do far worse than this."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"Probably no name turns off more Americans than \\"Marx\\". That's unfortunate, because the 20th century communism associated with Karl Marx is not really a fair representation of Marx's ideas. Not that Marx wasn't wrong on a number of key issues, such as thinking that eliminating private property would produce true individual freedom. But Marx didn't have much use for government, so it's ironic that he's associated with a Leninist-Stalinist model that attempted to put all aspects of life under government control.Besides Marx the political revolutionary who felt compelled to correct the dreadful condition of the 19th century working class, there's the Marx who's regarded as one of the founders of sociology. \\"Consciousness does not determine life, but life determines consciousness.\\" (C.f. the then-current Enlightenment view that every decision we make can be as rational as we want it to be, and thus every individual is responsible for his own state in life.)But on to the review. There's a ton of books about Marx available, as well as pounds of Marx's own writings, so why read this book? Because Prof Singer has written a very readable, very understandable description of Marx's thinking: contradictions, mistakes, and all. And done it concisely.Prof Singer is sympathetic to Marx the philosopher -- no philosopher ever gets it all right -- and less sympathetic to Marx the economist and \\"scientific historian\\". But Singer presents it all in a very well organized fashion, with lots of references to Marx's writings, so that the reader can easily follow along with the main ideas as well as continue on his own.Personally, I think Singer is too harsh towards Marx the economist, e.g. Marx's prediction that a capitalist system must eventually collapse. Whereas Marx recognized that government would side with the ruling class, i.e., the capitalists, he couldn't have predicted that government would grow powerful enough to bail out the economic system whenever it was near collapse. I doubt if any 19th century economist could have guessed that. Marx also failed to note, as Karl Polanyi did much later, that the general public would require government to restrict the worst activities of the capitalists, e.g. child labor, monopolies, pollution, near-zero wage rates. And this would make society more livable for workers -- thus postponing, perhaps permanently, capitalism's end. Singer, interestingly, shows that Marx may have overstated his case intentionally at times, in order to have more effect. We can certainly see that among modern writers, who know that the more extreme the statements they make, the more attention they get and the more books they sell.Despite the things that Marx got wrong, he got many things right: the boom-bust cycle of capitalism, the alienation of factory workers from their work, the need for capitalists to find ever- wider markets, the growing disparity (though irregular) of income between capitalists and workers, the concentration of economic power into fewer and fewer hands, the influence of someone's economic situation upon the decisions he makes.... A basic knowledge of Marx is really a prerequisite for understanding many of the issues and conflicts that we still deal with today. Prof Singer's book provides that introduction in the most easily-digestible form that I've seen."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"Though what some called \\"Marxism\\" seems mostly wiped from the earth (with some notable exceptions), the eponymous system never completely disappeared from the popular conscious. Its specter has reappeared following the financial disasters of 2008-2009. In this catastrophe's wake, some have asked whether capitalism has finally burst its dam. Though capitalism as an economic system won't likely go away anytime soon, the abuses and corruption uncovered in the past few years have likely made some curious about its staunchest and most infamous critic: Karl Marx. At first glance, the current crisis seems to validate some of Marx's criticisms, including the idea that capitalism will eventually self-destruct. However, upon further inspection some of his ideas break down and don't seem to exactly fit today's precarious situation. So what were Marx's criticisms, theories and claims? And what about that whole thing called communism that spread throughout the world in the 20th century? Did Marx create that? And where did his ideas come from? Anyone teeming with such questions should pick up Peter Singer's incredibly readable book \\"Marx.\\" This book has past lives. Originally published in 1980, it now sits alongside voluminous other topics in Oxford University Press' \\"A Very Short Introduction\\" series. And yes, this is the same Peter Singer that wrote \\"Animal Liberation\\" and the recent \\"The Life You Can Save.\\" He also has a killer recipe for dal (available online).The book moves fast. Beginning with a short preface that equates Marx's impact to Jesus and Muhammad, a short biography of Marx's life follows, complete with sketches of his personal and professional lives. This brief narrative doesn't dwell on the abject poverty often attributed to Marx (apparently from his pleading letters). It suggests that Marx lived decently, excepting a few rough years, and that financial mismanagement rather than lack of income may have plagued him. His lifelong partner and patron, Friedrich Engels, appears to have contributed generously even during good financial times. Marx of course faced exile more than once and following 1849 he never returned to his homeland. He died in England in 1883 where his grave still stands. The book then launches into his influences and development starting with Hegel, whose turgid and ominous \\"Phenomenology of Spirit\\" provided the \\"birthplace\\" of Marx's philosophy. As a \\"Young Hegelian,\\" Marx absorbed and then ultimately revamped Hegel's master/slave philosophy into one involving human struggle, economics and money. The inevitability of the slave \\"conquering\\" the master - a bane to later Marxists as it never seemed to happen despite its theoretical inevitability - derived from Hegel's philosophy of \\"Mind.\\" From Hegel's \\"alienated Mind\\" (which he, now almost comically, claimed his own philosophy resolved) and Ludwig Feuerbach's notion of religion as humanity's alienation, Marx posited money as \\"the alienated essence of man's labor.\\" Most of his economic theories, culminating in the magnum opus \\"Capital,\\" begin here. After assigning the proletariat the Hegelian \\"slave\\" role Marx claimed the theoretically analogous overthrow of the capitalists by their \\"slaves.\\" This was all pure theory. The chapter entitled \\"The First Marxism\\" delineates the main points of this philosophical-economic-historical system. Marx, like Hegel, considered his system \\"scientific.\\" Within these sometimes confounding works arise the foundational ideas of Marxist theory. Things have \\"use-value\\" as utilitarian things, but when economics intervenes it assigns \\"exchange-values\\" to these things. Soon everything is seen in terms of exchange instead of use-value, including workers themselves. As such, they inevitably begin to focus on exchange-values, even for themselves, and become \\"alienated\\" from their own productive activity, which Marx considered humanity's essence, and from others through competition. Capitalists exploit workers by making them work longer and extracting \\"surplus-value\\" and get rich. Communism, as Marx envisioned it, would abolish alienation \\"between men and their products.\\" It would also abolish surplus-value and apparently lead to a society where people simply meet their needs. The would thus attain true freedom, according to Marx, whereas under capitalism they only appear free, but are in fact enslaved by exchange-value and its ramifications. The obvious question follows: so what does Marx think the post-capitalist (or communist) world would look like? Singer defends Marx's near silence on this point by claiming that Marx was simply building the groundwork for the inevitable future and that Marx intended his successors to provide the practical framework. But Marx did drop some hints, though they don't collectively add up to much. For example, a \\"real human morality\\" would replace the current \\"class morality\\" and an earthly paradise would unfold. Led by the initial \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" war and conflict would eventually dissolve as people simply meet their needs. As many have pointed out, Marx would likely never have stopped throwing up at the sight of the Leninist and Stalinist regimes that claimed his influence. Paradises on earth they were not. Singer even suggests that Marx may have \\"disappeared\\" in the purges. Perhaps.The final chapter outlines Singer's evaluation of Marx. He first finds nothing scientific in Marx's theories. Second, he claims that most of Marx's dire predictions of capitalism's ominous future did not come true. So how should history regard Marx? Singer suggests thinking of Marx primarily as a philosopher and that he nonetheless secured a solid legacy, especially in two cases. First, Marx's view that people should control capitalism rather than capitalism controlling people still stands. As economies spiral out of control many indeed do seem to sit by helplessly. The collapse of a currency or an industry sometimes seems utterly outside the control of governments or activism. Whether this is by design or coincidence remains another question. In any case, Marx's call for us to take control of our own societies still has resonance today. Second, Marx suggested that human nature can fluctuate with societal and economic conditions. Many still agree with him. But Singer criticizes Marx's Utopian post-capitalist society. It seems unlikely that communism would totally eliminate greed or corruption. He cites Mikhail Bakunin's poignant criticisms on these points. Pure egalitarianism must deal with some nefarious truths about human nature. Some of the 20th century's \\"communist\\" regimes bear this out, though some don't consider China or the former USSR \\"communisms\\" in the sense Marx implied. So should we welcome Marx back as a contender? Yes and no. Though his critique of capitalism stands as one of the most detailed and complete critiques yet offered, it was also wrong in many respects. But it was also correct in some, especially in terms of its potential wastefulness and controlling aspects. On the other hand, a moratorium on new communist regimes seems in effect. Few new ones have cropped up. But anyone can find Marx's works, once considered anathema, in nearly any bookstore. Even fancy coffee table editions of \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" have appeared. Has capitalism then defeated communism by absorbing and emasculating it as yet another \\"product?\\" Maybe. Nonetheless, Marx seems to live on in a seemingly incompatible world of increasing production and consumption. This may be his true lasting enigma. In any case, Marx, like capitalism, likely won't disappear anytime soon. Peter Singer's small book provides a great introduction to this weighty and controversial philosopher. Those who haven't started down this road could definitely start here. Prepare for a long hike."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"The first thing that ought to be noted is that Peter Singer's contribution to the Very Short Introduction series is really a recycling of a volume he wrote way back in 1980 for the old Past Master's series. So far as I can tell, the only revision in the book is a few changes in tense to bring this edition beyond the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was something of a shock--or at least a surprise--to realize that what I thought was a new book was in fact an old one.Notwithstanding, Singer's Marx is a very good introduction. After a brief biographical sketch of Marx--which dispels the myth of his living and dying in penury, by the way--Singer examines his early flirtation with Hegelianism, his reflections on alienation and history, and his political economy. It's in his discussion of the last two topics that Singer excels. I've found no better text for introducing concepts such as \\"species being\\" and \\"labor theory of value\\" to my undergraduate students. Singer returns to Marx's understanding of human nature and it's relationship to alienating modes of production in his final chapter, \\"Assessment,\\" and concludes that human nature probably isn't as pliable as Marx supposed. But it's also clear that Singer is sympathetic with Marx's critique of capitalism.A good introduction for absolute newcomers to Marx--which, these days, is probably everyone under 30."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"The &quot;Very Short Introductions&quot; series is great for us busy-bees on the go. It fits neatly in the pocket or purse for waiting rooms, staff meetings, etc. It has been said that Marx is the most influential philosopher in modern times. I feel this argument has merit. Moreover, Peter Singer does an excellent job providing a quick insight into Marx's life and work. From Marx's illegitimate son to a great summery of 'Dialectical Materialism', this introduction leaves you wanting to learn more about this man and his thoughts that have affected so many of us.The working man's philosopher of choice, Marx is an important man to understand if one is going to attempt a viable understanding of the philosophical basis of modern day socio-political struggles. In light of almost constant inundation of 'the market rules all' rhetoric, the idea that there might be another way of living more conducive to common man AND nature is attractive and refreshing. However, Singer does not take every word of Marx as gospel. He neatly squeezes in good critical analysis that inspires the reader to think and to question. I highly recommend this very short book."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"After reading the \\"Manifesto\\", Engels' \\"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\\" and Lenin's \\"State and the Revolution\\" anybody embarking on a study of Marxism should read this wonderful little book before proceeding further with Marx's works and academic commentaries on them.I particularly like chapter 6 (Alienation as a theory of history) and his account of the development of the theory of the materialist conception of history. However, chapter 10 (An appreciation) is especially impressive - or thought-provoking if you happen to disagree with his assessments. Singer argues that Marx deserves to be ranked with the foremost philosophers for two reasons: (1) his critique of the liberal conception of freedom, and (2) his analysis of human nature.Marx provided the most important of all critiques of the liberal conception of freedom, which is \\"negative\\" freedom (freedom from) as opposed to \\"positive\\" (freedom to). It sees freedom as non-interference by the state or other individuals. It embraces laissez-faire economics because it sees the market as impersonal, and anyway many supporters of \\"liberal\\" freedom believe that Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" produces the best possible result. Marx's objections to \\"liberal\\" freedom are:* The interests of individuals are not necessarily the same as the totality of individuals (i.e. the community).* Markets force us to compete with others instead of co-operating for the good of all.* Allowing ourselves to be shaped by the market is not true freedom: planning the economy is the first step to controlling our own destiny which is true freedom.Singer explains Marx's position very lucidly. He uses the example of people living in the suburbs of a city who can commute either by car or bus. As an individual I prefer to use my car instead of waiting for the bus. If 50,000 other people in the suburb do the same then the road is choked with cars and a 10 mile journey takes, say, an hour. Singer continues:\\"In this situation, according to the liberal conception of freedom, we have all chosen freely...Yet the outcome is something none of us want. If we all went by bus the roads would be empty and we would cover the distance in twenty minutes...The liberal conception of freedom has led to a paradox: we have each chosen in our own interests, but the result is in no one's interest. Individual rationality, collective irrationality. The solution, obviously, is for us all to get together and make a collective decision.\\"Marx believes that capitalism involves this kind of collective irrationality. We may appear \\"free\\" because we are not subject to deliberate interference by other people, but Marx thinks we are not free because we do not actually control our own society and will not do so until we collectively determine a planned economy.Of course, Marx underestimated the difficulty in obtaining the cooperation of each individual in the joint endeavour of controlling society, but Singer is surely right to argue that Marx is the most important critic of the liberal conception of freedom and \\"it earns Marx a place alongside Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Hegel as a major figure in Western political thought.\\"The other important achievement Singer identifies is Marx's view that human nature is not fixed. This tends to seem obvious to most of us now but it was not the case before Marx, who stressed the degree to which human nature alters in accordance with the economic and social conditions that prevail. Of course, his own optimistic view of human nature is probably false but that is a separate issue. As Singer observes: \\"Marx's view of human nature is now so widely accepted that a return to a pre-Marxist conception of human nature is unthinkable.\\"Definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Marx (Past Masters)","review":"I felt the later chapters of this book were well developed, but the first few chapters on how Marx developed his philosophy from Hegel's left me with more questions than answers. Overall, the book provides are decent foundation on which to critique Marx as a philosopher, social scientist, economist, etc. Singer brings up many common objections to Marxist thought, but he also presents Marx's ideas in a non-bias way and gives credit where he sees credit is due. I found the biography of Marx to be interesting along with the subtleties of his relationship with Engels.

In conclusion, I would recommend this book to just about anyone who wishes to learn more about logic and how it correlates with mathematics and computer science and as I have mentioned earlier the price for this book is very cost efficient, but there may be times when you could become confused and need some outside help because the book does not always use the clearest wording to define these concepts and terms.P.S.: The price for this book can range from about $10(used) to $40(new).Discrete Mathematics With Applications"},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"This book offers the best interpretation of proofs, induction, and any discrete topic!

This is the audience the text is written for and the author tries to explain everything assuming very little about the student's prior knowledge. This math is obviously hard for non-math majors. If they need to learn it, I haven't seen any Discrete Math text that does a better job for this group.The book is too simple and wordy for math majors, very strong computer science students and future math teachers. A better approach might be a book like D. Smith's A Transition to Advanced Mathematics for logic, sets, counting, mathematical induction, relations, and functions, combined with Chartrand's Introductory Graph Theory.One could use this book at the high school level for a senior level discrete math course for strong students preparing for computer science as an alternative to taking pre-calculus."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"I honestly can't see how you'd make a book explaining such topics as prime numbers and set theory any clearer than this one. I consider this to be a high quality book. It's easy to understand and reference. Its one drawback is that it covers only a limited number of topics, and none of them are heavy duty. If I found a book that explained graduate level math as well as this one explains undergraduate math, I'd consider it to be gold."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"We used this book a few years ago in school for discrete maths. I took a look at the size of the book and decided it was hazardous to my health to carry this book for the whole semester. What I did was I listened in class and did homework problems at home without reading a single word from the text. Surprisingly, I did very well in the class. My point is Epps is so wordy that it is rather dull to try to understand a concept by reading the text word by word. It's important for an author at this level to keep the text crisp enough so that the reader can have fun reading it. In my humble opinion professors should use a more concise book that's fun to read and physically safe to carry around."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"This is possibly the best written textbook that I have EVER seen. It is clear, to the point, and even includes interesting sidebars that help clarify the topic and hold the reader's attention.

If you are looking for an introduction to the subject of Discrete Mathematics, look no further.

I highly recommend this book to undergraduate math majors."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"This was the required textbook for my 100-level CIS discrete mathematics course, and was simply the best math text I've ever been forced to read. The examples were, at times, even more clear than my professor's explanations, and made the painful prospect of learning math much more palatable.The examples and explanations are clear, unburdened, and progresses nicely in difficulty levels. The lone drawback is that we routinely discovered blatantly incorrect answers in the professor's solutions-book while going over problems in class. A minor stain upon this most impressive (and almost enjoyable)work."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"I am a second year Computer Science student and I have to agree with the rest of the bad reviews because the biggest problem I had with this book was that unlike other math textbooks which have the answers to most of the odd problems, this book only answered selected exercises in the text. I also remember the horrible memories I had about staying up very late at night trying to solve the problems in this book and what made things worse was that I did not have a good instructor either. I barely passed this course and I bought other math books to try and solve some of the problems in the book, but it didn't work. I hate it when mathematics professors try to be a big shot and show off their work by making it too complex and having little or no examples of how to do the problems in the book. I agree with one of the reviewers by saying that this book should be &quot;For Math majors Only&quot;. If you are not required to buy this textbook, DON'T! Save your money and invest it in another one."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"It's NOT a typical undergrad textbook in which example after example of the mechanics are demonstrated without providing a profound discussion of the thoery.

I have two quetions for Susanna Epp. When I look into the book (Discrete Mathematics with Application, 2nd ed.), I found that example 1.3.12 to be some what misleading or confusing.

If I was forced to use the book's explaination and examples I would be S.O.L. The only reason every discrete class uses this book is because there are no other discrete books in competition. If you are a comp sci student they should break discrete math classes apart to discrete for comp sci and discrete from math majors. They should also have comp sci teachers teaching this because math teachers don't usually have a clue how to relate discrete math to computer science."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics With Applications","review":"This book should NEVER be allowed to be used by students for undergraduate Math classes.

The baby elephant tries to make his skin fit, gets a tiger to volunteer to chew some of it off, then meets up with a crocodile who volunteers to eat his ears, then meets a lion that would just like to eat him in general (there was no python in my book!). But, the baby elephant is saved by a herd of elephants and they all take up dancing. The parrot stopped laughing at the baby elephant then.

I fell in love with that book for sentimental reasons but the more it was read to me I realized its message is so good for children. I highly recommend this for anybody with small children. We lost that little book and this was back before computers were so popular that when I went looking to replace it I had a very hard time finding it in print.

Apparently, the publisher has re-formated this book to ONLY be compatible with the Kindle Fire. So, notwithstanding the fact that I had paid for a legitimate copy of this book, I was no longer able to access it.

Nice illustrations as well."},{"Title":"The Saggy Baggy Elephant.","review":"A pleasant story on the adventure of a lonely elephant trying to find out what kind of animal he is.What attracted my oldest son to this book are the similarities of the elephant to Dumbo with the big floppy ears and small sized body. The book has about twenty-three pages with Sooki meeting other animals in the jungle.The Sappy Baggy Elephant begins with him dancing around in the jungle. While dancing his feet would pound the jungle so that it shook all around. Next his kicking would knock over trees as he continued further into the jungle.One day he met a parrot that asked him why he was shaking the jungle to pieces and asked him just what kind of animal he was. In answer to this question the elephant replied he had no idea what he was since he was alone. He had given himself the name Sooki and thought it suited him well. The parrot told Sooki that his ears and his nose were too big for him. He also thought his skin was much too big for him and suggested his name be Saggy-Baggy.The Saggy Baggy Elephant is a nice story of the elephant fitting in after all and finding his own kind in the jungle. This is a quick read and small enough for a toddler to hold and help turn the pages. The pictures are detailed and colorful.Many children can identify with the elephant feeling discouraged due to his large ears, nose and wrinkly skin. Along the way he meets many other animals similar to the way a child meets new kids that might not be friendly at first. We like to read this a few times a week. My son likes to see the page with the crocodile and the elephant blowing water out his trunk having fun. This also reminds me of the elephant scene with Bill Murray in the movie, Larger Than Life."},{"Title":"The Saggy Baggy Elephant.","review":"This was (first published in 1947) and it is still delighting young readers and the young at heart to this day.

When the author Kitty Morse led eating tours of Morocco, the highlight was a meal at the villa of retailer Danielle Mamane in Fez el Jdid. Both women have collaborated on this well designed and interesting book of recipes. I recommend it for its recipes, design, stories, and photographs. In addition to recipes, letters between mothers and their newly married daughters, and introductory stories, the authors list menu plans (with recipe page numbers) for the Jewish holidays, as well as the more Moroccan Jewish celebrations of La Mimouna (Pesach period), Hillula (visiting sages), and Kappara (pre-Yom Kippur). For Jewish weddings, there is the customary flan (t'faya). For Mimouna, the recommended recipes are Chicken with Orange Juice; Sephardic Mafleta pancakes; and couscous with raisin and onions confit. My favorite recipes include Walnuts with Pomegranate Seeds (which uses a heavy dose of orange blossom water); a cucumber with lemon salad; fish filets made in Fez style (with tomatoes, potatoes, and garlic); Fresh Fava Bean Soup with Cilantro for Passover; Chicken Couscous with Orange Blossom Water for Yom Kippur; Harira or Lentil and Chickpeas Soup (for Moslem Ramadan and Jewish Yom Kippur break-the-fasts); Meatballs in Onion Cinnamon Sauce, Chicken with Saffron and Ginger and Onions; and Honey Doughnuts for Hannukah. There are Fish Fillets a la Fassi (Fez style); Dafina Shabbat Stew (skhina); Chicken with Garbanzo Beans in Tetouan style; and Tangier style Potato Stew that uses preserved beef (kleehe). The Tagine of Beef uses carrot and turnips as well as cilantro, garlic, ginger, and tumeric. The Cornish Hens with Fresh Figs uses 12 figs and 12 threads of saffron; the Chicken with Onion and Tomatoes uses toasted almonds, ginger and eight threads of saffron. Preserved fruits, lemons, and kumquats play an important role in the cuisine. There is a recipe for Sephardic Shabbat Challa, and the Top of The Shelf spice that is often used; it includes a blending of cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, allspice, mace, salt and ginger. La Maguina, a vegetable and meat frittata, is sliced like meatloaf. Some unique soups and salads are a white and chard soup a la Tangiers; a fennel salad; a tomato and bell pepper salad with garlic, paprika and sugar; fava bean salad with cumin; and tomato with preserved lemons."},{"Title":"The Scent of Orange Blossoms: Sephardic Cuisine from Morocco","review":"The Scent of Orange Blossoms is a lovingly assembled cook's tour of a regional cuisine that obviously has special meaning for the author.

Most of the Sephardic families had left Morocco when I lived there in the seventies and most of their recipes had gone with them. Kitty's meticulous research with Danielle and the wonderful stories and letters that illustrate this tome make it as much a history book as a cook book.More than anything else, at this time of great conflict and crisis in the world, The Scent of Orange Blossoms is a wonderful reminder of how Jews and Arabs can live (and cook) together in peace and harmony as they did for centuries in Morocco.I must go now and begin preparing my preserved lemons (p. 20).Salaam and shalom."},{"Title":"The Scent of Orange Blossoms: Sephardic Cuisine from Morocco","review":"I just made Kitty Morse's Mint tea from her book Scent of Orange Blossoms.

Clavells interesting tale about life after war and invasion is both disturbing and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"\\"The Children's Story\\" is a shocking tale of mind manipulation in a classroom setting. It will make you think twice about whom you want to instruct your children. I wish every parent would read this book before sending their kids off to school.I finished \\"The Children's Story\\" in only ten minutes, but then I immediately had to read it all over again because I couldn't believe what I had just \\"witnessed.\\" The story literally left me with chills up and down my spine! At least I was able to breathe a sigh of relief since my own children are homeschooled.Who do you think is responsible for the raising and training of children - the parents or the state? How much parental authority are you willing to hand over to someone else? Do you know what your child is being taught in school? Young children are easily influenced, especially if their morals, values, and beliefs are not well grounded.Here are some points to ponder: What if a teacher says that the American flag is not important and the Pledge of Allegiance is meaningless? What if a teacher suggests to the class that praying to God is a waste of time? What if a child is told that his father has wrong thoughts? What if a whole room of young children are convinced that it's okay to keep secrets from their parents?Though originally published in 1963, the book's implications are timeless and can apply to public schools today. It brings to mind the separation of church and state, parental rights, humanism, the liberal agenda, character education, and thought police. \\"The Children's Story\\" reminds us that we must teach our children carefully, especially in regard to such fundamental concepts as freedom, religion, and patriotism; and we must always be vigilant concerning their education.I'm glad to see that this book is also available as a play script. The contrasting tones of the characters can be conveyed vocally, while the reading can be accomplished in approximately the same amount of time required for the events in the story to unfold. The scenario raises many questions, making for a great discussion topic afterwards. It's not exactly a children's play, but it would be good for patriot groups, homeschoolers, high school and college students, school reform activists, or anyone who supports the Alliance for the Separation of School and State.~Teri Ann Berg OlsenAuthor of \\"Learning for Life: Educational Words of Wisdom\\""},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"This tiny book is a refreshing, chilly blast from the past. It nicely captures the intersection of a free people and a new totalitarian regime. I remember these kinds of fears from my youth in the 1960s.I wonder how my little boy will grow up now without the Cold War as a back drop. The Cold War gave everything such perspective. In a few years, I'll have to toss him this book."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"Excellent book, a real eye opener.Another reason why I am glad we home school our children. Though written during the era of the cold war, many implications apply to today, and government's intervention between church and state, and what is being taught in the public school system. Our children are so easily swayed due to their innocence, and we must be aware of what they are being taught, and the motive behind those teachings. This book confirms that."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"I heard this story within the last couple of months at a speech competition that I was judging because I teach college English. I thought the story was supposed to be providing a positive idea of how a teacher should act. The story made me think of how most public school classrooms involve mindless routine and no critical thought/intellectual questioning--more teachers should be like the one in the story. I don't think it's worse for a teacher to have students cut up the flag than to force them to memorize and recite the pledge of allegiance. Why don't people question the first act of mind control? Did anyone understand what the pledge of allegiance meant in 1st grade? I certainly didn't and once I understood later, I disagreed with it. What would I pledge allegiance to this country? I live in a very small part of it and I don't accept the murderous conditions that make this country's establishment possible. The teacher was simply liberating the students from a meaningless ritual. Additionally, I like how the teacher has the students pray to God and receive nothing and then pray to her and receive candy. It is absolutely true that people get what they want by asking it or demanding it of other people. I would be happy for my child to learn that in school. Maybe then my child would grow up to be someone who fights for his rights in interpersonal ways (like in the workplace) instead of waiting for God to solve his problems. If Clavell considers the teacher an evil character, I disagree with him. However, he's clearly a good enough writer to make his point without it coming across in an unambiguous propagandistic way. It's funny to me that people considered the little boy who questioned the teacher to be a moral figure. As I recall, all he said was that his parents told him differently. Is that the critical thinking kids are supposed to be learning in school? What a threat that this new teacher made children question what their parents told them."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"I have to warn everyone who has already given more than 5 minutes of thought to our school system and the control we give to the teachers. If you have, then this book is old news. This book is for those who blindly hand their children over to the system and think their kids are always being taught correctly. It's for the people who don't know how little our teachers are educated (education majors have very hollow curriculum - been there, done that). It's for those who don't realize that teachers are never evaluated to see if they even should be teachers. (I've known a few I wouldn't even let babysit my children for a few hours - much less leave them in their care for days on end) It's for those who have never pondered their own education and dissected what their teachers taught them. It's for those who never caught on when a teacher was teaching them something incorrect (maybe because they were never taught at home). It's for those who never volunteered in an elementary school. (If you do, volunteer for the whole grade - spend some time in each room and I guarantee you'll find a few teachers that shouldn't be with children) So, if all of the above is news to you - read the book. If it's all old stuff, pat yourself on the back and save the money. Oh, and the book is WAY overpriced. Calling it a book is a stretch - more like a booklet. See if you can borrow it..."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"A lot of [people] have referred to this book as being against the backdrop of the Cold War, but the sad thing is that since the end of the Cold War, the warnings of this book have become MORE and not less pertinent, as the hard left have used the ruse that Communism has collapsed to inject their values into all of us, like a bacillus, through the back door.I see the brainwashing of the children described in this book as being what university students in the so-called humanities go through, in nearly every university in the world.The media and universities are trying to do to all of us what the teacher did to the children in the book!And slowly as youth are filtered through the universities they will permeate the rest of society with corrupt neo-Marxist views, including elementary schools.How many people throughout the world marched in support of Saddam Hussein earlier this year , without a thought about the morality of the positions they where taking?Yes, the nightmare we read about in \`The Children's Story' is happening across the world.Too many of us have lost the distinction between right and wrong.Can the voices of freedom fight back?"},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"For years, I have carried the words of The Children's Story with me, and shared them with as many people as possible. With its roots in words we have taken for granted for years, Clavell forces us to look at all we, as Americans, hold precious, and how vulnerable we are without truly understanding the meaning of that which we espouse. A simple reiiteration of the Pledge of Allegiance, taught to first graders across the country, goes deeper than teaching just the words. Set in &quot;small town anywhere&quot;, the story of children in a classroom taken over after a military invasion, this powerful piece takes us to the core of our beliefs, and makes us aware, more than ever, of the true meaning of &quot;allegiance&quot;. From the cutting up of the American flag in the opening pages, we are consistently challenged and reawakened. The book teaches us to expect the unexpected, to appreciate our heritage, and to take nothing for granted. A simple, but moving piece of work that should be taken out of the closet, dusted off, and kept on the shelf to be read again and again!Ever since my own children were small, I have taken out The Children's Story and reread it together with them each and every Memorial Day. I have bought more copies than I can count, and given them to friends, students, and book clubs. I am proud to say that my son, a Firefighter, immediately following the tragedy of September 11th, donated 100 copies to local schools in hopes that reading and discussing it will help reignite an interest and pride in the words we speak from memory, seldom give much thought to, but will never again take for granted."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"A fellow teacher recommended I read this book about 10 years ago, and I did - thankfully. It is provocative and compelling. It hit me like a board between the eyes. Not only are our children so easily molded,so are we - by anyone or any individual or institution that we allow to manipulate us, especially television, movies, the media, this story itself. It reminds me of another obscure little book I found at a library used book sale for a quarter - and it had the same profound effect on me: Ways of Living and Dying by Harry Jonesburg, Les Livres, Inc., 1992. These books are not for the faint of heart! Do yourself a favor and read them both. I am 52 years old and I am just now beginning to understand how much my thought has been manipulated all my life. The Children's Story was instrumental in that awakening. What I learned from that story: Democracy has its price. Clavell has shown me quite clearly how far freedom of expression can take us as a people. He has shown me that &quot;democracy&quot; is a philosophy that by its very nature defies definition."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"James Clavell, author of SHOGUN, was inspired to write THE CHILDREN'S STORY when his five-year-old daughter expected a dime for reciting the &quot;plege illegience.&quot; Inquiries revealed to Clavell that few people are taught the meaning of the Pledge; they just learn to parrot it.In THE CHILDREN'S STORY Clavell dramatizes what can happen when people without true convictions encounter zealots intent on converting them. People whose beliefs are not grounded may be oblivious to almost imperceptible assaults on their value system. THE CHILDREN'S STORY reminds us that &quot;the enemy&quot; may not be hideous or foreign but may be attractive, intelligent, reasonable, gentle, and friendly.THE CHILDREN'S STORY is ideal for reading aloud. Not only can the contrasting tones of the story be conveyed vocally, the reading and discussion of this story (with occasional pauses to ask, &quot;Who likes the New Teacher?&quot;) can be accomplished in approximately the same time required for the events of the story to take place."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"&quot;The Children's Story,&quot; by James Clavell, is a short book that could be read in one brief sitting. It takes place in an elementary school classroom in the United States after the country has been conquered by some nameless foreign power. The story follows the initial re-education of the children by their new teacher.This book reads very much like a product of the Cold War era, when many feared the possibility of ultimate Soviet domination. The story is written with a subtly chilling, &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;-like flavor; it reminded me of Ayn Rand's short book &quot;Anthem.&quot; Ultimately, Clavell's scenario plays out a little too neatly to be truly believable. But the story is undeniably thought-provoking. And even with the U.S./U.S.S.R. Cold War now a thing of the past, &quot;The Children's Story&quot; is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"As frightening as authors like Stephen King or as gripping as a political dramitist like Tom Clancy might be, they have never written anything near as good as this gem.What would your child do if suddenly his or her teacher told them the American flag was not important? What would a room full of impressionable young children do if taught that it was ok, and in fact good, to spy on their parents?These questions and more are asked in this short but sweet story. And it raises an even scarier question. If we don't teach our children morals, who will? Do we trust our teachers with this job? Hopefully we do, but if not, what should we then do about it?I'm not ripping on teachers-- my wife is a teacher, and a good one. But hopefully this book frightens us just a little bit into thinking about how we can take the responsibility to teach our children ourselves and take this burden away from teachers who already have too much to teach and and not enough resources or class space to teach with, as some of them may use it improperly. &quot;Character education&quot; proposed by some to be taught alongside reading, writing, and arithmetic is not the answer. Whose values do we then use to teach? And when do teachers have time to teach it? And do we want our children adopting the values of someone the schoolboard thinks has good morals? This book reminds us that we have a responsibilty and a duty to teach our children the right way to live.Read this book-- it will change your mind about a lot of things."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"This whole book takes place in just twenty five minutes in a classroom. In just that short period, the class receives a new teacher and with just that amount of time she changes their beliefs. It portrays the innocence of children and how they can easily be brainwashed.

Fiction ? Look at how easily the early Christians used a few words to turn December 25th., the birthday of the eastern God Mithras the bull-slayer -- which has a probably origin in Catal Huyuk some 5,000 years before the birth of Christ -- into the birthday of the Christian Saviour.Clavell speculates how clever teachers can turn a few words of prayer and faith into acceptance of a new and presumably totally opposite system of values. His story, with chilling realism, will give any intelligent reader pause about the value of rote repetition of even the most noble phrases -- such as the pledge of allegiance or that famed national anthem \\"Jose, can you see ?\\" -- compared to importance of learning the meaning of such words.For anyone who treasures basic American values, this book is a gem. The message is \\"learn the meaning\\" of the words anyone chooses to pledge; in this case, the Pledge of Allegiance, but it also applies to such documents as the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. In most nations, loyalty is based on centuries of habit, heritage and tradition; in the US, similar to Christianity which is based on the truth as revealed in The Bible, loyalty is based on written documents such as the Constitution.American society is based on the promise of written words. Think of \\"I pledge allegiance . . .\\" or \\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. . .\\" and \\"the freedom of speech or of the press . . .\\" or that \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people . . .\\" Clavell makes the point, with brief but eloquent realism, that we must understand the meaning of the words we repeat, not merely their rote cadence.It is a book for everyone interested in the basics of American freedom."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"I first read this disturbing little book in 1981, in hardback and before it was given a subtitle, and I promptly bought a dozen copies to send to friends. Re-reading it now, 20 years later and in a significantly changed political climate, I find it even scarier. Instead of The New Teacher representing an authoritarian government, I see her today as a symbol of an authoritarian religious movement that seeks to insert its own values into the hearts and minds of all. Clavell's warning about the ease with which manipulation can be successful transcends specific antagonists and tells us instead to be wary of any entity that attempts to ursurp our own values and ethics in favor of theirs."},{"Title":"Childrens Story","review":"I first read this book when working in a middle school library in 1994.

While this book seems to be on the shelf in most of them, no one checks it out. No one talks about it.To me, it is what America could have been like if we had lost a world war. What could become of us if we are not aware how precious freedom is.I too, have bought and given many copies of this book to adults.

The friend who reccommended it said it was &quot;powerful&quot; and when a coworker saw it ,she said it had changed her life. Quite a burdon to put on the slim volume I held in my hands. It reads like the cautionary fable of the cold war....a new power comes to town and methodically challenges and strips away all beliefs of the town's children. The messenger is pretty and pleasant, the messege is palatable, even believable. And so all the children get led down the path.....I read this with the voice of Johnny, one of the children ringing in my head...a small quiet voice of distrust, of sensing open manipulation.

We are a people who proudly consider ourselves patriotic and loyal to our country's heritage. Take nothing for granted, because Freedom is most definitely Not free; rather it is and always will be bought and maintained at great cost. Not only the cost of precious lives and cherished honor, but by the use of our God-given intelligence. Clavell bluntly illustrates that words and flags are merely symbols of ideology, which can be manipulated to work against centuries of sacred national teaching. We must guard against a permissive atmosphere which can result in watching our deep conceptions of democracy being subtly undermined.In less than half an hour a new Teacher (cleverly trained by a totalitarian regime which has recently conquered the US in a Cold War) takes control of an elementary classroom. In bold but seemingly rational moves, with a pleasant voice and calmly logical manner she overrules all that her confused pupils have learned about love of country, respect for parents and deference to God. But before we pity these innocent children --helpless before the insidious philosophy of tyranny--we hsould recognize that we too are vulnerable to mind control and could still fall victim to mass manipulation. Unless we truly understand and prize the words of our Pledge of Allegiance.

Today, at a seminar for teachers, the guest speaker started by reading a short story and as he read I remembered this movie. Yes, the movie I remembered was adapted from this story. The book was just as gripping to me as an adult as it was when I was young. I won't go into details. Its a short read but very thought provoking.

The simple act of reciting the pledge of allegiance or praying can be corrupted by others.

But now and then, since my reading of it I get flashbacks of what its message was. It very nicely shows how a mind of a child, and maybe everybody, can be influenced and perhaps changed by a few suggestions of a second party that can seem logical at the time. How Clavell does this is to tell of a thirty minute scene in a classroom that has just recieved a new teacher. This teacher is the second party in this case. Here she offers ideas and statements that the kids rationally put together as being not bad ideas. In the end it is rather disturbing how easy it can be. For Clavell fans expecting another Clavell-like book, this is not.

And if you love rock and roll, it is a lot of fun, with endless rock and roll references and bad puns.

The main band in the book, loosely modeled on the Beatles, with Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler serving as their Brian Epstein, has them play in The Cavern, which anyone who loves the Beatles knows was the name of the Liverpool club where they established themselves in Great Britain.The other main plot concerns Death deciding to try to forget his memories of things that haven't happened yet and his granddaughter Susan temporarily takes over. She even has THE VOICE! Any Discworld book that features significant quantities of Death, C.M.O.T. Dibbler, and the Librarian is going to be at least minimally decent. The book doesn't have the gravitas or a sufficiently satisfying plot to be among the elite Discworld novels, but it is still an utterly delightful book. I'm convinced that there are no completely bad Discworld books (though ERIC comes close). As a group they have to be not merely the finest long series of comic fantasy novels, but are the best series of comic novels of any kind. At present I'm working my way through all of the Discworld books in order of publication, after having read about a dozen in random order.

I read Soul Music in one sitting -- took me two and a half hours -- without moving, save to turn the pages. I was completely unaware of time passing. After I finished it -- I turned to the front and read it again. In one more sitting. Five hours, total. I had expected this book to be brilliant and hysterical -- I was not disappointed.

Also, I am not a fan of rock music culture, so it may be a bit my fault, too.Some of the book is funny. The troll-dwarf relationship is always good. Glod was very funny as was Cliff. Dibbler was his usual sales-obsessed self. But that was about it, except for the wizards trying to wear leather. The Dean was a riot. And the Librarian with piano exploding (and the way it was explained to the Patrician) was great! This is a book worth reading just to see the Librarian and his antics. 3.5 stars for him.But Death was funny in the foreign legion, although it got a bit old with him running away, and Albert is not so wonderful (though he does better in later books). I admit I didn't fully understand Death's solution to the problem with the \\"music,\\" so that didn't help. But the Death of Rats was funny, of course. Death, his granddaughter, Albert are not too hot here, but they improve a lot in future books, but read this book mainly for the Librarian and wizards. They rarely fail to entertain."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"A rock 'n' roll story evolving around - well, rocks that roll... Neat idea, but I found the book somewhat boring.

There are simply better Discworld novels than this one!!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I have nothing bad to say about the book itself. However, the Kindle Edition of this book is full of errors, most of which appear the be the result of a bad OCR transcription which the publisher didn't bother to proofread. It contains things like \\"pointy fiat\\" (should be \\"pointy hat\\") and \\"har.d\\" (should be \\"hand\\"). Proper names are routinely butchered. \\"Jade\\" becomes \\"Lade\\" or \\"fade\\". Commas become periods and vice versa (especially in sections done in Death's voice). Some of the footnotes appear to be mismatched. And to top it all off, there are a few sections that actually appear out of order. (did the pages get mixed up as it was going through the scanner?) HarperCollins should be embarrassed for trying to sell such a shoddy e-book."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Can't get enough of Terry Pratchett, I liked all the stories in the disk world.

The way he writes ensnares the reader to keep going until you're up 'til 3am still reading.

The hilarity and excitement is endless!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is a very smart book and has tons of musical icon references. As always, well done Mr. Pratchett. This book is a wonderful addition to the series."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Classic Pratchett. Funny, silly, but at the end it's the sort of thing you can get a bit thoughtful about. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Here's another successful visit to Discworld. This time around a strange magical guitar is purchased by an aspiring musician, previously a sort of folk musician. With assistance from the mysterious guitar, Discworld discovers rock and roll. We are treated to many humorous and delightful scenes. The strangeness and perceived danger to Discworld from the destructive new music closely resembles the culture-changing effect that similar music had on our own world, but with unique Discworld twists. Discworld rock musicians suddenly become obsessed with their band names, such as the grammatically correct \\"The Whom\\". Musical ability becomes secondary to the show events, which include the creation of Discworld groupies. Overweight women begin throwing undergarments at the stage, and thankfully injuries are avoided. The new music craze sweeps up everyone, and suddenly success is only a cheap instrument away.Puns are abundant, but stay amusing enough to avoid becoming tiresome. Beyond the music plot, another angle of the story unfolds as Death's granddaughter Susan unwillingly takes over his duties when he takes leave to contemplate the universe. She struggles to keep order while keeping her humanity intact. The two goals appear to be at odds as events unfold. Susan gets tangled in one of the musician's lives, and struggles to save him from a perceived cruel destiny. The strange new music and mysterious guitar are at the heart of things, but the eventual explanations are a bit murky at best. That part of the story is speedily handled, while the rest of it drags on a bit at times. The result is a little less of a feel for serious undercurrents, which have been apparent in other Pratchett books I've read. That said, this is as solid as a troll for entertainment. A few small cracks can be seen up close, but try to push it aside as it comes at you and you'll notice only the unyielding material. Pratchett seems to be the troll of creative writing, with an always advancing cheeriness that pushes aside mediocrity."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"\\"Music is my life.\\"How many times have you heard that? From bona fide rock stars to teenage wannabes, there's something about music that occupies us, that possesses us and just won't let go. Even if you're not a big music lover, there are probably songs which can ease your mind, pull you out of a dark mood, or set your heart to racing. There's music that'll lift your heart and make you think the world is a better place than it really is, and songs that will convince you that the dark heart of the world is just as decayed and corrupt as you always thought it was. Music has a kind of magic in it that can reach to the very core of who we are as thinking - and more importantly, feeling - beings.That magic is dangerous enough on our world, where magic doesn't actually exist. Imagine how powerful it would be on one where magic really was real. Like, say, to pick one out of thin air, the Discworld.Of course, the Discworld has had its share of trouble with popular entertainment before. Acting troupes brought about an Elf invasion in Lords and Ladies and the Horrible Betentacled Things of the Dungeon Dimension nearly escaped thanks to the Disc's proto-cinema in Moving Pictures. There's just something about the arts in Discworld that leads to trouble - usually the world-ending kind.In this case, though, the introduction of rock and roll - better known in Ankh-Morpork as \\"Music with Rocks In\\" - is only really dangerous to one person, the young Imp y Celyn. Just eighteen years old and already one of the best bards of Llamados, he wants to make something of his life. He wants to be more than just another bard, and in a mysterious shop that has only recently always been where it was, he finds his chance. Or rather, his chance finds him. A guitar-like instrument that does what no guitar should do - it whines, it growls, it sends out noises that run straight down your spine and make your nerves run with fire. It's clearly not of this world, and it wants nothing more than to live. For that, it needs to change Imp's fate, and by extension the fate of hundreds in Ankh-Morpork.Soon, Imp and his band - The Band With Rocks In - are the most famous thing in the city, and the strange magic of this music is being felt everywhere. Even the wizards are helpless against it. Normally this would result in the aforementioned Horrible Betentacled Things, but in this case it's more of a reversion to teenage years that never were. Still, Archchancellor Ridcully knows that there's some force acting on people that shouldn't be there, and nothing good ever comes of that.As if that weren't enough, Death has decided to get existential and tries to figure out how he can make himself forget for a while. Why he decides to do this is not clearly explored, but it results in him leaving his duty. In his place comes his young Granddaughter, Susan, who would be great for the job if she didn't think the whole idea of personifying a force of nature was just romantic woolly thinking. And it would be even better if she knew what her connection was to the doomed musician Imp y Celyn.This book can be seen as a companion to the earlier Moving Pictures as an examination of and homage to popular culture. By transplanting it to the Discworld, Pratchett is able to look at rock music from the point of view of people who've never even thought about such a thing before, and who can more easily see the magic of it. And of course, it's his big chance to make as many music jokes, puns and references as humanly possible, from the translation of Imp's name (\\"Imp\\" meaning \\"small bud\\" and \\"Celyn\\" meaning 'of the holly\\") to some proto-heavy metal musicians trying to make leopard skin pants from a cat that has some severe hearing difficulties.It's a sort of love letter to rock and roll and all that it has brought us. From teenyboppers to punk to the horrible misuses of leather and spandex, it holds a mirror up to the way that rock music has influenced our modern culture. But it does not mock, oh no. It shws great attention to and reverence for this young art form that has done so much to change the world. To list all the references made in this book would be nearly impossible, but the amount of work and thought that went into making it is quite clear.More importantly, though, the book addresses some questions that are a little deeper than the simple rock and roll jokes. Like Death's question: \\"WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? SERIOUSLY? WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT?\\" Probably since the beginning of music, people have tried to find meaning in it. People have connected to music and to musicians in ways that they could never connect to other people, even family and friends. People find meaning in music, which then gives meaning to their lives, and the more you give your life to something, the harder the crash when that thing goes away. Imp discovers this in a very literal sense, but out here in the real world that is just as true.People mourned for Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley, Kurt Cobain and other superstars as if they knew them. And in a way, I'm sure they thought they did. Like so much else in the world, though, music doesn't have any meaning but what we give to it. The truly great musicians, the ones we always lose too soon, give everything they have. They manage to say to us what we've been saying to ourselves, but could never really figure out how to put into words. Music is the voice our emotions could use if our brains didn't get in the way so often, and the best people lucky enough to be able to create it gain a kind of immortality.Not the literal kind, unfortunately.If you love music - especially rock music - then this is a book you should pick up and read. Even if you're not a Discworld fan, you'll probably enjoy it.--------------------------------------------------------------This was music that had not only escaped, but had robbed a bank on the way out. It was music with its sleeves rolled up and its top button undone, raising its hat and grinning and stealing the silver.... It made you want to kick down walls and ascend the sky on steps of fire. It made you want to pull all the switches and throw all the levers and stick your fingers in the electric socket of the Universe to see what happened next. It made you want to paint your bedroom wall black and cover it with posters.- from Soul Music by Terry Pratchett--------------------------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Masterful puns, entertaining characters, family business, wizards, guilds, music and Death -- it'd have to be Pratchett -- who else could weave such a collection in any one book. I found this a hard slog at times, but all-in-all it was great fun and I loved the exploration of Death and the Death business."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Terry Pratchett is a phenomenal writer! I'll tell you that any of his books, especially the Disc World series are well worth picking up! In my youth I loved the Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien (and yes, I'm talking pre-movie adolescence, thank you). I read any fantasy/adventure novels I could get my hands on. Eventually I ran out of books worth reading.... In my late teens I even resorted to Harry Potter, which I thought was amusing (but with a very low reading level) until I stumbled upon Terry Pratchett. Oh what a day! It was as if I had been waiting for his writing since the first time I picked up a book! The worlds he has created within the Disc world series are so interesting and entertaining. On each page he has spelled out endless wit, comedy, and enchantment. The characters hook you from the start and in each book you learn more about them and how they intertwine with one another. The imagery Pratchett depicts with his stories is absolutely amazing! And one of the things that I think is the best about this series is you don't necessarily have to read them in a particular order. There are a few here or there within the series that do fit better together read in a certain order but besides those you can just go with the next one that strikes your fancy. Every time I finish one I CANNOT wait for the next! Soon I'll be done with the series and this is sad... But reading them all was well worth it! See for yourself!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This was a lot of fun to read for the subtle and not-so-subtle allusions to rock and the various artists. Susan as a reluctant Death made for some engaging reading as did the antics of Ridcully and company. Pratchett must have had a great time writing Soul Music. I like these new characters added to \\"the usual suspects\\". Death was at his engimatic best. Colon and Nobby made for some interesting comic relief throughout while CMOT Dibbler as the band's manager was all you could have expected and then some. I thoroughly enjoyed Soul Music."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Death is perhaps the most entertaining character in the Discworld series. Though he may be the most stable character, the character's sojourns outside normal duty in various books lead to mayhem in Discworld. In \\"Soul Music\\" mayhem yet again erupts in the absence of Death.As Death takes time to \\"think about things\\", his granddaughter Susan inherits the duties of the reaper. Guided by Death of Rats, Susan begins to take to her duties until she must collect the soul of the guitarist of Band with Rocks In. For some reason, his time refuses to expire as the less than talented musician thrives playing the guitar with auspicious origins. Creating more of a conflict, Susan even appears to be falling for him. Readers of the Discworld series, know that Death will return to save the day. Yet learning how Death untangles the twisted mess is the fun of his adventures.Loaded with wit and great one-liners, \\"Soul Music\\" is among the best tales from Discworld. Perhaps the best chuckles or groans come from the Ankh-Morporkian twist on Earthly rock'n'roll. Even the rock'n'roll cliches live in the alternate universe."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I'm posting this just to let Kindle readers know that the Harper Collins ebook version has a very large number of formatting errors throughout the book. Words were broken up with hyphens when not necessary, others were run together, backslash was used every time there was an upper case italicized \\"I\\". One paragraph was duplicated and a couple were out of sequence. There were enough to disrupt an otherwise enjoyable read.I gave it a rating of 4 stars despite the formatting errors because the story was amusing and included several of my favorite characters from Discworld. I recommend this book but suggest that anyone who wants to read it should choose the other ebook edition that is available."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"The last few weeks, my reading has been monopolized by the mind of Terry Pratchett. I have been sucked into the Discworld, and I am just fine with that. I sought out experts on which order to read the books, since there is no one straight linear way to read the books.I read the entire sequence centered on Death (and his extended family) first, since my introduction to the world of the Disc was the movie version of _Hogfather_.I bought the first one, _Mort_, just to see if I would like it. I liked it well enough; I bought the next two books in the series on the Death story-arc. A quarter of the way through the second book, I bought the final two books of the arc.I neared the end of one of those books and I bought the first three books from the \\"Guards\\" story-arc. At this point, I have only read one of those books, the first _Guards, Guards_. I was pleased, since I have to admit that I was a bit worried about the continuity of quality between story-arcs. Was I just interested in the character of Death, or did I like the world as a whole?It turns out that I like the world as a whole, and this is a huge strength of Pratchett. I want to learn about all the inhabitants and read all the stories, no matter how tangential. I don't usually keep many books in my wish list, but it is now filled up with Discworld books. He builds a world like Vonnegut did. There are many familiar elements of the world we inhabit but there is the magic element that rips from genre fiction: what Vonnegut did with science-fiction, Pratchett does with fantasy elements.There are a couple of things about the series generally that I really enjoyed. The first is what you try to develop as a writer, a unique voice. I've been struggling on finding the right word to really describe what I would characterize as Pratchett's voice. It is arch and tongue-in-cheek and just fun if you've read enough. He's a post-modern Tolkien, but that's a little off.Secondly, he is funny, and he's not afraid to go for the easy joke. There are puns-galore, if you like that sort of thing. I happen to. There is one very memorable one that he just sort of sneaks in during _Soul Music_. He takes the reader 90% of the way to the pay-off but allows the slow dawning to set on the reader, so that a bad pun feels like it was done masterfully. Which it is, it really is.If I had to make a critique of the books in the series that I have read so far is that I have read them too fast. My wife often tells me to slow down and enjoy the books you like, but I seldom listen to her. I should have here. There have been a couple of times that I enjoying the ride so much, I didn't even bother to remember what I had just read. I had to go and reread the last 50 pages of _Guards, Guards_ because of this. I enjoyed it too much.Otherwise, this is an unqualified recommendation for the Discworld books. Spend some time there, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"For some reason they changed the formatting of Death's dialog from previous Discworld books, even though it's the same publisher. It used to be printed in a small caps font that fit in well with the rest of the book, now it is big ALL CAPS formatting that jumps out of the page and is a little overwhelming.This is the 8th or 9th Discworld book I've read and the others were better, the characters were more developed."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Imp y Celyn, trained as a musician in a druid society, arrives in Ankh-Morpork ready to seek his fortune. Instead, the city rapidly deprives him of the few riches he already has. Teaming up with the dwarf horn-blower Glod and the troll drummer Lias, Imp braves the wrath of the Musicians' Guild by playing without a licence. When he acquires a special guitar from a back-alley shop, Imp learns that he and his band are meant for greatness, for sex and drugs and Music With Rocks In (well, one out of three isn't that bad).Meanwhile, Susan, the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit, is rather perturbed to learn that she is the granddaughter of Death, and when her grandfather decides to take some time off she has to step in and do the job. Which would be fine except that when it becomes time for her to collect the soul of a certain musician, she learns that music doesn't want him to die. At least, not until it decides the time is right...Soul Music is the Discworld's take on rock music, essentially doing for music what Moving Pictures did for movies. In fact, Pratchett lampshades this a couple of times, with references to the events of that earlier book informing events (such as Ridcully becoming convinced horrible Things from the Dungeon Dimensions are about to break through the walls of reality at any second). The problem is that whilst he does this amusingly, Pratchett never really breaks away from the basic concept. He throws some great new ideas and characters into the mix, with the introduction of HEX (the Discworld's first AI-based computer), the Duck Man and the excellent character of Susan, who recurs in several future books, but overall it does feel like Pratchett is retreading old ground here. The Death storyline is also somewhat under-developed, with no real reason for Death suddenly taking a few weeks off being given. In fact, it feels very odd he would after the chaos this caused last time in Reaper Man (the events of which are also referenced several times, making Soul Music one of the most continuity-heavy books in the series).Of course, as has been said in these reviews before, Pratchett on autopilot is still better than most writers at the very top of their game. Pratchett has a huge knowledge of music and lets the reader know it with references (both overt and subtle) to Buddy Holly, Elvis, the Beatles, the Stones, the Who, Meat Loaf, punk rock and The Blues Brothers roaring past the reader like bullets from a machine gun. The pace is fast, the narrative is tight and some of the cliches of rock 'n' roll are very cleverly used to set up and further the storyline.The problem is that Soul Music, whilst entertaining, lacks the spark of greatness that infused the three books that preceded it, and if read in close conjunction with the earlier volumes it does feel like a slight step down in quality. The new characters are not quite as memorable as those in the books which preceded it and the running gag with the Bursar's insanity and dried frog pills is starting to wear pretty thin by this point. Pratchett also has a slight problem with the cameos from the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, who in their own books get involved whenever something crazy happens in the city and eventually sort it out, but in other characters' volumes simply come across as useless and somewhat pointless, which seems a bit disrespectful of them after their fine achievements in Men at Arms.Still, these are really minor problem. Soul Music (****) remains a very entertaining and readable novel, and is available now in the UK and USA. An animated movie based on the book is also available in the USA (in a double-pack with Wyrd Sisters) on DVD, although it is currently out-of-print in the UK."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"A little disappointingSOUL MUSIC introduces the reader to Death's grandaughgter Susan (Maybe Pratchett saw Mort as a losing proposition as I did) and gives her chance to step into the family business as Grandad's gone missing again and she's called into duty. While there are a lot of clever bits here (I particularly like the Death of Rats a wickedly funny idea) and Susan is a nice addition to Discworld, this is another example of Death takes a holiday that I found to be a bit tired. I also wasn't enamored with the birth of rock and roll in Discworld which just seemed a bit lame in execution. Pratchett is always a fun read but I didn't find this up to his usual standards."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"\\"Soul Music\\" is the sixteenth book in Terry Pratchett's hugely popular Discworld series and was first published in 1994. He has gone on to win the Carnegie Medal for \\"The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents\\" and was awarded the OBE in 1998.Death - tall guy, a little thin, carries a scythe, likes the colour black - appears in more of the Discworld books than any other character. By and large, he makes only a very brief appearance and - while the role he plays in \\"Soul Music\\" is still a supporting role - he has a huge influence on what happens in the book. Back in \\"Mort\\", he took an apprentice who eventually went on to marry Ysabell - Death's adopted daughter. In time, the pair had a daughter called Susan, who makes her first appearance here. As the book opens. Susan is a pupil at the Quirm College for Young Ladies. She can't quite remember her maternal grandfather, let alone what he does &lt;ahem> for a living...however, she has inherited some of his abilities. Unfortunately, Death is feeling a little depressed, and it seems there are certain things he'd rather forget. (The problem is that he's not quite sure how to go about forgetting). It's all causing Albert, Death's butler, and the Death of Rats quite some concern. When Death takes soe time off in order to try and forget, it also causes Susan a great deal of bother...you see, somebody's got to do Death's job...Imp y Celyn, meanwhile, is a promising young harp-playing bard from Llamedos (a country with Welsh tendencies). After a blazing row with his father, he sets off to become the greatest musician in the world, and eventually arrives in Ankh-Morpork. While trying to join the Guild of Musicians, he meets Glod Glodsson (a horn-playing dwarf) and Lias (a troll who specialises in percussion). The trio, however, are a little short on funds and can't quite meet the subscription fee. This means they're barred from playing music professionally in the city...which is unfortunate, as the on ly way they can raise the money for the fee is by playing music professionally. Things get even worse when Lias accidentally breaks Imp's harp - though they soon make the mistake of replacing it with a guitar from a magical music shop. Inspired by the guitar, the trio invent a new style of music the becomes known as \\"Music With Rocks In\\" - something that leads them hurtling towards disaster. By the way, a rough translation for \\"Imp y Celyn\\" is \\"Bud y Holly\\"...A big plus for the book is the return of Death of Rats and the introduction of his sidekick, Quoth the Raven. Quoth, named by a wizard who thought he was also a comedian, is partial to an eyeball and - like the skull he roosts on - can talk. However, he absolutely refuses to say \\"nevermore\\". A very funny book, with a plenty of nods to famous songs, bands and movies, it's highly recommended. It may be a slight advantage to have read \\"Mort\\" - though as the book begins with a brief introduction, you'll not really miss out if you haven't."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Terry Pratchett is the funniest writer in the universe...well, not this universe...there is no one as funny as Pratchett here. He's from a universe in which the world is a disc that rests on the backs of four elephants that are standing on the back of a turtle and in which Death really does ride a pale horse and occasionally stops in at the local pub for a pint. Soul Music is Pratchett's 16th book about this cosmos.It is the story of a young musician who finds an enchanted guitar, changes his name to Buddy Holly, and introduces \\"music with rocks in\\" to Discworld. Buddy is destined to become famous and die young unless he can be saved by Death's teenage granddaughter, who has taken over Death's job collecting souls because Death himself has a bad case of angst, which I suspect he got from the food down at the Mended Drum pub.I'm not a laugh-out-loud kind of person. I greatly prefer to hold my laughter in and let it rot and fester until it spontaneously boils out in socially unacceptable behavior. But with Soul Music I couldn't help myself. This may be Pratchett's most hilarious novel ever.If you don't love this book, you just don't have a sense of humor.( I don't mean to be harsh, but I thought you needed to know.)"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"The Discworld grows on you. After reading a dozen or so of Pratchett's marvelous stories about Life, the Universe, and Everything (so to speak), you've gotten to understand Unseen University, and the Librarian, and why you can walk across the Ankh River, and the Patrician's point of view (Sergeant Colon's as well), and the necessity of Death, and why the Mended Drum never closes. More than that, events in the author's world tell you a great deal about our own. This time around, it's the importance of Music in the scheme of things. The universe didn't begin with a Big Bang after all, it began with The Chord, and the Music continues to weave its way through everything. Specifically, thanks to the ancient guitar Imp (a/k/a \\"Buddy\\") acquires (or that acquires him), it's Music With Rocks In. And Pratchett, while having some serious points to make, also has a wonderful time playing riffs on the history of rock \`n' roll and its devotees (\\"a felonious monk,\\" indeed . . .). Susan, the sixteen-year-old granddaughter of Death, is also a major player, having had to take over the family business while its proper practitioner is off on another of his vague investigations into humanity. Don't worry about the details of the plot. Just sit back, read, enjoy the music, and try not to laugh too loud."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Soul Music is another chapter in Pratchett's Discworld series. In this particular novel, Death has taken another hiatus to try and \\"find himself\\" (or maybe to just forget himself). So, the job of the grim reaper is bestowed upon his adopted granddaughter, Susan. At the same time, Imp The Bard has just bought an enchanted guitar in a music shop. Little does he know that the guitar holds a powerful secret that could mean the end of the universe. When Susan and Imp cross paths, it seams that both of their worlds are thrown into chaos. It's up to Susan to figure out the secret behind the enchanted guitar before a catastrophe occurs that even Death himself couldn't fix.Once again, Pratchett proves he's a genius at writing satire. Each book he releases seems to be better than the one before. Soul Music is no exception. Along with a plethora of new characters, the usual suspects are still there. Including the inept wizards of Unseen University who add even more hilarity to this extremely funny story. The only problem with any of Pratchett's Discworld books is that you have to read them in some kind of order to remotely understand what is really going on. This is difficult due to the fact that there are now over 40 books in the series and Pratchet doesn't write them in any useful order (or so it seems). However, you can find some good reading \\"guides\\" on the internet from time to time to help you in your journey through the Discworld. Believe me, it's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is the 16th in Pratchett's Discworld series. Alternatively, it's the 3rd in the Death/Mort/Susan subseries (\\"Mort,\\" \\"Reaper Man,\\" \\"Soul Music,\\" \\"Hogfather,\\" and \\"Thief of Time\\"). I'm torn between giving it a four or a five star rating. I really enjoyed the book and there are a lot of really funny things that make you laugh out loud when you read it. But, something seems to be missing. The best I can come up with is the lack of some character development and a minor quibble with a motive. For character development, I think Pratchett could have done some more with both Susan and with \\"Buddy.\\" Susan doesn't seem to grow much with the plot. She starts out one way and essentially ends up the same way. \\"Buddy,\\" on the other hand, gets hardly any character development at all. Even though he's one of the main characters, he's pretty much of a blank throughout the book. My quibble with a motive is that the reason Death is trying to forget isn't clearly explained. I'm 99% certain it has to do with a couple of deaths he had to oversee, but he keeps talking about bony knees (which would apply to someone else). Other than that, this is a very good book with a lot of good humor."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"When Buddy decides to enter Ankh-Morpork and become a musicion he meets Clif and Glodd.

It was hillariouse and was just plane great. The big thing about this book was that when ever Terry Pratchett would dscribe the music with rocks in, I would go into a trance.

Oh well, small details."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"As my second Discworld book, I didn't like it as much as \\"Hogfather\\", but as a professional musician I found many more things amusing than some non-musicians may. There is some very subtle humor (or humour) for musicians in here.It was nice to follow Death on one of his journies to find himself and it is always great to hear from the Grim Squeaker (Death of Rats) again.Good book."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I always have a difficult time getting into the groove with Pratchett novels. Given the serious nature of most of the books I ever read, it takes me at least fifty pages to begin to come to terms with all the slapstick parody. Usually after that, though, I find myself in heaven, and &quot;Soul Music,&quot; for the most part, upheld that illusion without a hitch.I used to be into rock music a number of years ago, but I grew out of it as I began to take notice of just how pointless all the angst associated with the scene really was; the fact that all the bands sounded the same, I suppose, must have also played a part in my disenchantment. Whatever the case, this installment in the Discworld series struck a chord with me as it began to make note of all the conventions that go along hand in hand with the music; spike-studded leather clothing, you could say, goes along pretty well with the entire scene--but outside of that, you really can't justify its usage with any other point.For a while, it's great to see Pratchett introduce element after element on the ground that &quot;it just *fits*&quot;--at least, until the end of the novel approaches, and you realize that what has been parodied is really nothing more than the superficial elements of it all.But it's all fine and dandy, because when things begin to grow stale, our attention is turned towards Death's granddaughter's approach to her newly-inherited vocation, and the more intimate details of Death's home. I don't know if any details on the latter may have been dispersed in previous installments of the series (as I've only read a handful), but what's here is a hoot--it's a neat little way to make Death a more palatable, charismatic character.The most problematic issue at hand, though, seems to be the conclusion of the novel--we're treated to dozens of terse passages that try to build up momentum for a situation so clich&eacute;d that it almost lacks any sort of impetus whatsoever, and at the end of it all you're left scratching your head at what seems to be a rushed, indolent excuse for an ending. And if you read over it, you'll realize that the passages relating to the Patrician are but a waste of time--nothing he does is important enough to progress the story, and since Pratchett forgets about him by the end (or middle) of the book, it seems like the reader is expected to have done so as well.So I'll forget, and imbue the inner recesses of my mind with the opinion that &quot;Soul Music&quot; is a great frivolous read. There's really not enough reason here to regret having spent my money; in fact, for more passages with C.M.O.T. Dibbler alone, I'd probably be willing to fork over twice as large an amount."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I really liked Soul Music. Death holding open a place in children's minds and hearts for 'Santa' struck me as both very amusing and touching, since we all know that Terry's ultimate Anthropomorphic Personification has a soft spot for humanity. 'Uncle Heavy' was having way too much fun complaining about the Death's role reversals. Susan is wonderful, and funny in her serious, sometimes ironic view of life. The Watch follow their familiar paths, and CMOT Dibbler is more himself than I've seen since Moving Pictures. (snik, snik) Good to the last 'drop', and beyond."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"If you've read any of Terry Pratchett's other books, you know pretty much what to expect from this one. Most of his books are built around a satire of something, and as you have most likely figured out, this one is primarily about rock music. The more you know about music, the more of these jokes you are likely to get. There are plenty of good jokes here, as there are in most Discworld books, but there are also some dull sections, and the conclusion is a bit weak. If you haven't read any Pratchett, don't start here. This isn't his strongest effort, and it is a sequel to Mort. If you are already a Discworld fan, you won't be blown away, but you'll find that it's as good as most of his books."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"When Imp y Celin comes to Ankh-Morpork, he has no idea that you should actually pay The Guild of Musicians to play music. Since he doesn't have the money, he, a dwarf trumpet player, and a troll percussionists start a band, the first Rock band in Ankh-Morpork. The music actually kinda hypnotizes people -- it has Rhythm, and wherever the band goes, there are always tons of listeners.Meanwhile, Death has once again decided to take a break to try and forget everything, this time joining the Klatchian Foreign Legion, and his 16 year old grand-daughter Susan has to take his place.The plot lines coincide really great, making a great, and really funny book. You'd think that Pratchett was reading the story of some real band (e.g. The Beatles, Metallica) and just telling it over, but with different names and also making it sound silly.This is not one of Pratchett's best, but makes a great addition to your library."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This isn't my favorite of the Discworld series, but it's still a solid read, and a very funny take on the world of rock and roll.

Not because it isn't wonderful, it is, and not becuase it isn't funny, it is, but becuase it relays heavily on other perviouse novels for a lot of it's humor. This was the frist book of the Discworld series, I'd read, and I liked it.

LONG LIVE SEX DWARFS AND MUSIC WITH ROCKS IN!!(two out of three ain't bad....)"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"When Imp enters Ankh-Morpork he has no clue that he is on the verge of changing the way people listen to music. In search of good fortune he left his hometown in Llamedos and hopes to earn some money playing harp in the biggest city - or at least the most crowded - of the Discworld. Regrettably no one ever told him that the Guild of Musicians has a rather 'terminal' policy concerning people who play music without a licence, the rather expensive kind that is. But he is not the only one who cannot pay the fee. Together with a dwarf, a troll and an - ook ook - ape, Imp starts an illegal band and together they play 'Music with Rocks In'. The band is an immediate success, certainly now C.M.O.T. Dibbler is their manager. When people start to ask Imp if he is a bit elvish, it must be clear that something dangerous is at hand.In Soul Music Death gets again a major part, although this time the role is played by Death's granddaughter Susan. But do not expect the witty humour that was dominating Terry's classic novel Mort. The main chunk of funny paragraphs is filled with clever puns to the names of famous music bands. Two examples: Lead Balloon (Led Zeppelin) and &U; (U2). At the start of the novel this is quite entertaining, but when you have to digest pun number 50 it has lost its originality. At the end of the story the puns are the only thing that drives the story. A story that on its own is very weak and tends to bore the reader.Soul Music clearly fails in matching the high standards set by the other Discworld novels."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"As a humor writer and as a novelist, Terry Pratchett has his ups and downs, with ERIC being the most complete failure among his 20-odd novels. SOUL MUSIC is not at the bottom, but it is not far above. Generally, any Pratchett novel featuring the character Death is disappointing, but this one has major problems with ALL its characters, none of whom ever come to life even for a moment. There is really no plot, no characterization, no meaningful action, and at the end there's a non-ending perilously close to &quot;why, it was all a dream.&quot;Each of Pratchett's novels takes on a specific feature of our own world, and the closer the feature is to mass media, the worse the novel is. MOVING PICTURES (about the film industry) was bad, SOUL MUSIC (about the popular music industry) is even worse. The satire has little bite and almost no point, as if Pratchett were so offended by these media (as am I for that matter) that he can hardly bear to dissect them effectively."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"What a story teller. I really enjoy all the disc world books."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"It hardly gets any funnier than this: DEATH (skeleton in black robe) has a teenage granddaughter named SUSAN who gets a crush on a young musician Imp y Celyn (which translates Celyn = Holly, Imp = Bud). Ructions in reality ensue when Susan tries to save Buddy from his appointment with Fate.If there is a musical catchphrase that Pratchett fails to warp, pun or riff off of, than it isn't an important one. Pratchett's characters are lively and engaging; his plot runs on rockets and his humor, whether you find it satiric or merely slapstick, is truly funny. As always, Discworld holds up a warped mirror to our world and shows a true picture. This is one of Pratchett's best. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is my first venture into realms of Terry Pratchett and his Discworld. And, well, I'm not sure what to think. Explaining the plot is also difficult because, well, any plot about a band where the pianist is a orangutan (..a librarian by profession!) and the Grim Reaper joins the Foreign Legion leads one to believe that the novel Soul Music and the term 'plot' are mutually exclusive. No one will ever confuse this book as being an example of literature.It seems that Terry Pratchett has written lots of silly jokes and satiric observations, some of which are quite funny, loosely tied into a very absurd story. Either you'll love it or hate it. I'm perhaps the exception where I think the likes of Terry Pratchett are best served as a humour columnist (satirist) for a newspaper, for example, rather than as a novelist. Soul Music does drag on. It's sort of like listening to the class clown in grade school; in small doses it's great, but after a while .. SHUT UP!!Perhaps Soul Music is the best way for you to decide on whether you think Terry Pratchett is a god or a man with a misplaced talent."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"How this got printed I don't want to know.I will read anything, from milk cartons to Richard Feynmane to bodice rippers.

Perhaps this is true, but I will not be wasting my time reading any of the others. &quot;Cult&quot; writers are often over-rated, yet I cannot understand why apparently intelligent people want to read this trash. Most science fantasy is terrible. Even Tolkien was much more enjoyable when I was 9. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is shockingly bad at any age. The only joke I laughed at (and not out loud) was the one about Thelonius Monk. Also, I think that Susan's character has definite paedophile connotations, and is generally implausible.

I recommend that you buy it"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"More of the same... Pratchett's Discworld series is sumptuous. My earlier comparisons (in my reviews of Mort and The Truth) with P.G. Wodehouse's fictional world seem pretty apt. Both Pratchett's and Wodehouse's worlds are utterly pleasurable places to immerse oneself in. Both are dreamlike fantasies which nevertheless maintain strong connections with the so-called \`real' world. Both are peopled with a wide variety of grotesques/caricatures/stereotypes which are, somehow, utterly compelling and utterly believable. Both weave fantastically complicated plots and sub-plots and employ many of the devices of farce and sitcom. I think Pratchett's world, characters, themes, philosophies etc are much more varied in scope - Discworld is, after all, an actual, literal world as opposed to Wodehouse's much more limited, self-enclosed, metaphoric world of the English upper classes/landed gentry etc. Pratchett wins, hands down, for the sheer breadth and depth of his imagination. But I think Wodehouse is far superior in his use of the English language and his works have a far higher laugh rate than Pratchett's. Typically with Wodehouse, I'm archly amused several times per paragraph, doubled up with laughter several times per chapter and swooning at the sheer brilliance of the writing and story several times per book. With Pratchett, most of my response is arch amusement and I'm only doubled up with laughter a handful of times per book (so far) and rarely swooning at the sheer brilliance of the writing or story. This sounds like I'm really laying into Pratchett. I'm not. I think it is well worth any reader's while to spend significant chunks of their life ploughing through the Pratchett oeuvre. Just make sure you allocate enough time to simultaneously consume plenty of Wodehouse too! Anyhow, back to Soul Music. Highlights include... the highly sympathetic characters of Susan Death, Buddy, Cliff, Glod, the Librarian... a plethora of groan-inducing puns... fantastic pastiches of the music industry... the loving evocation of the unique magic of rock music... and the fact that I wished the story were twice as long (yet again, Pratchett's ending is poignant, hopeful, just plain good!) I had more fun with this Discworld novel than the others I've read so far (Mort, The Truth) and I was quite moved by it. It had less flab than The Truth and was more meaty than Mort. (Though, curiously, Death himself was a bit washed up - difficult third album syndrome, no doubt!) So, tentatively, I'd say it's my fave so far... but that statement is subject to change... Feet of Clay next..."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is really a good book and got me hooked on the series. It's really not that bad, and if you think it's confusing, think, do you ALWAYS understand a joke the fist time you hear it? If you're not keen on Sci-fi/Fantasy, well, you probally won't like it, but this is on par with Xanth, Pern, and Valdemar. Alot of the book has to do with rock and roll, so you may want to brush up on your history. I would definately recommend this book to a teenager or someone who lived throughout the time of rock and Roll's beginning. If you don't care for anything like this, then you won't like this book. It's that simple.Personally, I love it, even if it's just due to my dislike of most non-fiction. I find it boring, but this book is definitly NOT Earth, it's more like a new, improved version of Xanth, Valdemar, and the world's of David Eddings."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Soul Music, the sixteenth Discworld novel by Terry Pratchett, is decidedly weaker then the other books in the Death sub-series. Like the other Death books, Death has taken a break and something must be done in the meantime. This time, however, it results in a disjointed narrative that isn't quite up to Pratchett's standards.I'm of two minds on Soul Music. It is tremendously funny, with wonderful homages to various rock and roll elements. There are numerous Blues Brothers riffs, lots of Meat Loaf references, along with song lyrics and various band names that are parodied. \\"'A song about Great Fiery Balls. [...] Couldn't really make out the words, the reason bein', the piano exploded.'\\" These sorts of references permeate the book, and make it a joy to read. Some of the band names in the book include \\"We're Certainly Dwarfs (They Might be Giants), \\"Suck\\" (Kiss), \\"The Surreptitious Fabric\\" (The Velvet Underground). I'm sure you can see where this is going.On the other hand, the Death aspect of this story covers ground that's already been covered, to an extent. Yet again, Death has decided to walk away from it all and visit humanity. Once again, somebody has to take over his job. Yet again, the person who does so has trouble with the \\"moral\\" aspect of it. In Mort, Mort fell in love and couldn't bring himself to \\"kill\\" a little girl. In this one, Susan has qualms about \\"killing\\" innocents and letting bad people live out a full life. Why can't it be the other way around? It feels very recycled, and it's only saved in Soul Music because Susan is interrupted by the onset of this strange music that's making everybody go weird.The other problem with the book is the incredibly disjointed feeling that it has. I used that word in my Reaper Man review as well, but that book was so good that it made up for it. This time, however, it's even worse. The Death storyline doesn't get much time, with only a couple of scenes with the Foreign Legion, then a couple of scenes back in Ankh-Morpork before finally being called back. Susan's story takes forever to begin, as she is first approached by the Death of Rats, is skeptical, has it shown to her, explores Death's house, etc. It got to the point at the beginning of the book that it came to a screeching halt whenever the story left the music and went back to Susan.All of that being said, though, Soul Music is still a very entertaining book. The characters are wonderful, with only Susan being slightly boring. The other characters are either very well developed, or just in there for the sake of the joke (like the band that continually changes its name because, well, they suck and they can't get any recognition). The three main band members (Imp, Glod and Cliff) are great, all being true to their racial characteristics (dwarves love gold, and so does Glod, etc), yet being wonderful personalities as well. The wizards are back yet again, wreaking havoc with everybody and everything. All but the Ridcully seem to be taken over by this new type of music, and the scenes between Ridcully and the Dean are priceless (the Dean acts like a child who is being denied while Ridcully is the father figure who is sending the Dean to his room without any supper). The jokes come fast and furious whenever the wizards are around. Death, when he is around, is as funny as always. There's something about a personification of an aspect of life \\"trying to forget\\" that's really funny, even more so in Pratchett's execution of it.Next to Reaper Man, this book comes up a bit short. It's still entertaining, and you'll still enjoy it. I would definitely recommend it. I would read a few Discworld books in between the two, though. If you don't, you may find yourself feeling worse about Soul Music then you actually should."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"In this Discworld installment, PTerry definitely did a great job on the characters, of which there is no shortage. One of my favorites is Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, who is a business enterpreneur. Also, Corporal Nobbs and Sergeant Colon of the city watch shared some pretty funny exchanges. Another of my favorites is the Librarian, an orangutan (don't ever call him a monkey), who runs the University library. This book was also the first time I encountered Mustrum Ridcully. Every character, from the Band With Rocks In roadie Asphalt to Qouth the raven, is done in a way that individualizes them greatly. Next, I'd like to talk about the plot. There are several subplots: Death tries various ways to forget his past, Susan takes on Death's role, Ridcully and the University wizards get crazed for Music With Rocks In, and Imp Y Celyn, a Llamedese bard, gets his life takenover by a magic guitar. PTerry weaves these plots together to form a gigantic plot, which heralds a long, exciting, 300-page book"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"No one agrees on which is the best Terry Pratchett novel, but a lot of his fans, myself included, would name this as a candidate. In this novel, he takes his manic punning, wordplay and double- and triple-entendre to the highest level.Soul Music has three narrative threads: Death takes a holiday (which Pratchett fans will remember from _Mort_), Mort's orphan daughter, Susan Sto Helit, and her attempts to cope with the family legacy, and the discovery of rock and roll on the disc. The three stories intertwine and the result, for me, ranged from snickers to guffaws.The big news is that rock and roll comes to the disk, through the agency of a pawnshop guitar and a skilled harpist, whose name translates as &quot;Bud of Holly&quot; and who looks kind of Elvis[h]. With a dwarvish horn player named Glod and a trollish drummer named Cliff, the band Music with Rocks In takes the Discworld by storm. The Librarian, the monk... orangutan who runs the Wizard's library, sits in on keyboards, and exceeds even the excesses of Jerry Lee Lewis. You cannot imagine a rock music issue that Pterry doesn't reach. Women fans pitch articles of clothing; espresso shops appear; rock promoters - C.M.O.T. Dibbler, of course - arrive; even the sedate wizards wear leather, do their best James Dean and show they, too, are &quot;Born to Rune.&quot;Parts of the book are a pastiche of &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; (&quot;We're on a mission from Glod&quot;), &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; and &quot;Woodstock.&quot; Other parts are simply Pratchett's own mad invention. And this book also features Pterry's best pun - &quot;some felonious monk;&quot; possibly the best pun in literature since Niven's and Gerrold's _The Flying Sorcerors_. You can spend a lot of time just working out the puns. And let me note that Led Zeppelin's &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; gets the treatment it righteously deserves.But while Buddy and his band tour with their roadie Asphalt and inescapably head towards Dead Man's Curve, and while Death does his best to learn how to forget with the help of the Klatchian Foreign Legion and alcohol, Susan makes increasingly frantic efforts to keep what passes for reality on the Discworld from coming completely unstuck. With the help of the Death of Rats, Albert and other favorites, the Disc is saved, but not without some uncommon poignancy.There are scholarly articles on whether Pratchett writes parody or satire. However labelled, this was the high water mark for his experiments with the pure form. Anglo-American literature has never had as brilliant a satirist/parodist as Terry Pratchett. He may have written better Discworld books, but I'm not sure he has written a funnier book. Especially if you know and like rock music.&quot;Bee There Orr Bee A Rectangular Thyng&quot;"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Here we are again.

He changes his name to Buddy......and, in positively classic Pratchett style, the two plotlines come together in a rush of magic, energy, and Music With Rocks In!I very highly recommend this book to anyone with... well, anyone with a willpower rating of above 10, which is what you need to move.As Death would likely say, DON'T FORGET. I CAN'T ANYWAY, SO IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. BUT YOU HUMANS...And you don't want to miss the Death of Rats who goes around saying SQUEAK."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Terry Pratchett is without a doubt one of the most gifted writers to grace the world of literature. His Discworld novel, 'Soul Music', is the most entertaining book I've read in many years. This is the story of Susan Sto Helit- boarding school student, granddaughter of Death, and acting CEO of the family business. When Death joins the Klatchian Foreign Legion to forget (in general), Susan has to take up the scythe and fill in for a time. Not particularly well suited for the job, Susan refuses to collect the life of Imp Y Celyn- a young man who along with a dwarf trumpet player and a troll percussionist, has introduced Music With Rocks In to the good people of Ankh-Morpork. Imp has been influenced by a magical guitar with a life of it's own, and given birth to 'Rock' music. Susan feels it's not right for Imp to 'live fast and die young', and this upsets the balance of nature on Discworld. Assisted by Albert- Death's manservant, and the Death of Rats- Susansets out to find her grandfather and try to set things right. Music With Rocks in has upset every aspect of society in Ankh-Morpork, much like rock'n'roll in 1950's America. The wizards of Unseen University are under a spell like nothing anyone has ever seen. Personally, I'm not a big fan of the whole fantasy/sci-fi genre, but Pratchett's Discworld novels are more akin to flights of fancy... enjoyable on many levels. His works leave the reader with a pleasant sense of fulfillment that few authors can approach. You never find yourself wishing things turned out differently than Pratchett's vision, like so many other novels today. This splendid work has to be read to fully grasp the beauty of it's complex fluidity, and the humorous footnotes are fantastic. I would recommend Terry Pratchett's 'Discworld' series to anyone- they are a pleasure to read and finished far too soon."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"The answers to those questions and more may be found in Terry Pratchett's hilariously funny and thoughtful Soul Music.Soul Music consists of two parallel plot lines which, because this is Discworld and not the earth, converge as they reach the story's horizons. First we meet Imp y Celyn, soon to be known to the world as Bud of the Holly or Buddy, as he travels the long and winding road from his home of Llamedos to Ankh-Morpork. Back home, Imp's music always made his people smile and he knew if he had a chance he could make some people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while. Unable to raise enough cash to join the musicians' guild, Buddy, after picking up a very odd guitar at a strange music store joins up with Glod the dwarf and Lias the troll and form a musical group. In short order the group has a gig at the Mended Drum.In the meantime, DEATH is in the midst of his nineteenth nervous breakdown. As DEATH walks through his land of broken dreams, he seems unconcerned about what becomes of those who should now be departed. There will be disastrous consequences for the universe (see Reaper Man) if DEATH does not perform his obligations. The Death of Rats and his raven translator Quoth go desperately seeking Susan, DEATH's granddaughter. She is persuaded by Death of Rats to fill in until DEATH can be found and persuaded to return to work. Susan soon finds herself atop DEATH's horse Binky. She's eight miles high and when she touches down in Ankh-Morpork she enters the Mended Drum to meet her first assignment - - - Buddy. And then all heck breaks loose.Buddy starts to play the guitar just like he's ringing a bell and the world seems to stop. It may be that only the good, like Buddy, die young but in this instance Susan says something DEATH would never say: \\"it isn't fair\\". Though no fault of her own, Buddy does not go up to that spirit in the sky, Buddy and his music live on. The obvious question becomes why is he still alive and to what purpose?\\"Music with rocks in\\" it becomes the next big thing. Even the wizards at Unseen University fall prey to these musical magic moments, so different and so new. Cut Me Own Throat Dibbler soon makes an appearance and rapidly transforms himself from purveyor of sausages to greedy rapacious rock and roll impresario. Soon, every kid in Ankh-Morpork wants to be a music with rocks in star. They get electric guitars but don't learn how to play. They think with their hair swung right and their pants too tight it will be all right. Little do they know that in the crafty hands of CMOT Dibbler even musicians with talent will soon be in dire straights.Meanwhile, Susan, Death of Rats and even Albert, DEATH's loyal man Friday, search Discworld for DEATH. DEATH has been seen sitting on the dock of the river in Ankh-Morpork, drinking whiskey and rye with the good ole boys at the Mended Drum, and standing guard at midnight at an oasis manned by the Klatchian Foreign Legion. His internal dialogue is priceless, funny, and thoughtful.Events proceed rapidly as Dibbler prepares the band for a huge free concert in Ankh-Morpork. This will be Discworld's Woodstock. Will Susan's sense of justice prevail? Will Buddy survive even though the sands in his hour glass are long gone? Will the Librarian get money for nothing and his chimps for free? Will the wizards ride though mansions of glory in suicide machines? The answers to these questions aren't blowing in the wind but they are in the book.As far as Terry Pratchett's Discworld books are concerned, Soul Music is near the top of the charts . . . with a bullet.Elvish has left the building."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Who but Terry Pratchett could seek sympathy for the feelings of the Death of the Discworld? And obtain it? Once again, Pratchett offers readers a rich banquet of deep philosophic questions served with his saucy wit. As usual the repast may be taken lightly, skimming off the quirky characters - the Raven takes the top marks in this book - or the horrid puns emanating from the music [Welsh for Buddy Holly??!! arghh!]. Otherwise, the gourmet PTerry fan may relish fully the issues surrounding life. And death. Pratchett, as always, may be read at many levels. Any Discworld book may be read repeatedly, and this one is no exception.Death is unique among the Four Horsemen - he's the only one that's inevitable. As an Anthropomorphic Personification, Death is something other than simply a blind force. Small feelings burrow through his consciousness. Without a human frame of reference, he cannot comprehend them fully. He is, however, aware that things aren't quite right. He therefore goes off to determine what is wrong. His departure leaves a void demanding filling.His replacement is the daughter of his foundling and his apprentice - Susan Sto Helit. With Susan, Pratchett turns away from Death to examine Life. In this instance, Life shows how powerful it can be, even self generating. Life, the universe itself, may be the result of a musical note. Never mind the Big Bang, how about the Big Bong? Life, through Music, shows its universality through Music With Rocks In. Rock music can be performed by everyone. Talent, discipline, training all may be ignored. Music With Rocks In is little more than the fullest expression of human feeling. Even Susan, much detached from her surroundings, is caught up in its force.In Susan, Pratchett demonstrates the power of his characterisation. She is Death's granddaughter, carrying his &quot;genes&quot; providing inexplicable powers. She can speak with THE VOICE, become invisible, ride Binky. She's human, with a strong sense of justice, vexed by the loss of good people and the survival of bad ones. She wants Death to be &quot;fair&quot;, but He can only be what he is - inevitable. Pratchett, of course, must somehow reconcile these views, which he does with his usual panache. Through it all, the Music strives for survival. Pratchett feels that's important because it means survival for us all.

In true Pratchett fashion, it's also a story about the hilarity that ensues when (insert improbable events here).This is the story of Imp Y Celyn, an ambitious teenage bard who acquires a magic guitar. With the help of his bandmates and his new instrument, Imp brings a new craze to the Discworld -- Music With Rocks In! Little does Imp know that he's fated to die on the night of his band's first performance ... or that there's something in that guitar of his that won't let him.This is the story of Death, who's had a *very* bad day at work. There was a tragic carriage accident, you see, and he had to go and claim the lives of two of the only mortals he ever allowed himself to care about... So, in an effort to forget, Death runs away to imbibe vast amounts of alcohol and join the Klatchian Foreign Legion.This is the story of Susan Sto Helit, a teenage girl who's recently lost both of her parents in a tragic accident. Left at a stuffy boarding school, Susan has no idea that she is the granddaughter of Death himself, and that she's about to get stuck running the family business.This book is everything Pratchett fans have come to expect and more. It's a hilarious pastiche of the history of rock and roll, a style of music that has no place in a medieval fantasy world. It's a welcome addition to the subset of Discworld books that star Death, who is terribly good at his job, but wishes people weren't always so unhappy to see him. It's a prime example of the inspired blend of satire, high fantasy, and just plain silliness that makes Terry Pratchett one of the most popular fantasists in the world.This is probably my favourite Discworld novel so far, and that's saying something. It's not absolutely necessary, but I suggest you read Mort before picking up this one."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Imp (Bud as in plants in Springtime) Y Celyn (Of the Holly trees) makes music his life (without understanding all the implications) and organizes a band with a troll, a dwarf, and briefly an orangutan; Death's grandaughter Susan considers the consequences of silliness, Death expresses gratitude with a rose in his teeth, a big hearing-impaired spotted cat arranges for a singer to appear with just one glove, the neighborhood witch arrangements are explained, a felonious monk's musical talent is discussed, and music-with-rocks-in is introduced.One of the absolute best of Pratchett, and definately the best of the thread about Death. There are more rock and roll references per page than any other book in history, and more laughs than a rational man can deal with (I had no problem...) All the hallmarks of Pratchett's finest work; beautifully tangled threads of the story, humor both subtle and flagrent, puns to tears, and more than the customary presense of Death (and Death of Rats, and Death's servant Albert). It stands as well alone as it does as part of the Death stories or Ankh-Morpork stories.Kudos!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I didn't enjoy this novel as much as I did Pratchett's Mort, but I still spent most of the book giggling to myself. More than some of his other novels, Pratchett worked in real-world tie-ins. Many of them are in pun form, some of them are just allusion, but I plan to read this several more times to see if I can find more. I recommend this book to anyone already familiar with Pratchett or anyone who enjoys Piers Anthony's punniness."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I have read with great enjoyment all of the Discword books I could get my hands on, but of them all, Soul Music is my favorite. It contains all the usual Pratchett trademarks, such as clever allusions, bizzare footnotes, and an underlying message which is as serious as the actual writing is silly. Needless to say, it's one of the funniest things I've ever read. It makes room for all my favorite Discworld characters (i.e. Death and his granddaughter Susan, the Librarian of Unseen University, and the various odd residents of Ankh-Morpork). Anyone who has read any other of the Discworld books with enjoyment needs this one as well, and anyone who hasn't needs this one to start with."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Death is easily one of my favorite characters in the Discworld series, and this book is him at his prime. Death is continually evolving into a more complex and humane character, while still maintaining a core 'deathness' about him. His residence is described in here using that great Pratchett mixture of blatently obvious statements and metaphors only he could get away with.This book is also about music out of it's place. Rock and roll passes through Discworld, and the results are great (great meaning comedically bad). Take a very detailed and complete fantasy world, add the rebellion of rock and roll, and it seems like it writes itself. But the great part about this, and all Terry Pratchett books, is that the joke only begins with the setup, the entire book just keeps getting funnier and funnier. (Compare this to The Onion, where the entire joke is in the headline, and the story is usually just fluff.)Finally, like all Pratchett books, through all of the ridiculous situations and absurd logic, there is a decent amount of drama at the end.If you already know and like Terry Pratchett, here's one of his best works on Death. If you don't know him yet, you could easily start with this book. This was the second Pratchett book I ever read, and I haven't stopped since."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"If you are into fantasy, mythology, and humor this book is a great choice for you! Three young musicians are guided by a powerful musical instrument that threatens to unravel life as the Discworld knows it. Join Death, Susan, the wizards of the unseen university and others on this hilarious, enchanting, and exciting adventure If you are a Terry Pratchett fan and you haven't read this book give it a shot! It's a winner!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"While I enjoyed reading this book, I didn't feel that it was as good as the other Discworld books. I love seeing Death's human side, so to speak, and I loved the character of Susan. Something felt lacking in this one. I couldn't really care for Buddy. Still worth reading, though."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Pratchett turns his satirical talents to rock and roll in this tongue-in-cheek tale of bard Imp Y Celyn (translated: &#34;bud of the holly&#34;) who ends up in possession of a magical guitar that leads to the invention of a whole new music that shakes the (disc)world. Throw in CMOT Dibbler as the band manager, doing what band managers do in all universes, an adolescent Susan Death as the groupie from...well...somewhere out of time and space, plus lots of pop culture references and you have a very enjoyable story.A lighter touch than some of the books on either side in the series so not quite as appealing to me - I personally like a bit of a bite in the satire. Still - a really enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"If you know anything about the birth of Rock&Roll forget it. Pratchett was there from the first day Buddy picked up that guitar to the day the music died. His story telling sings. To tell you more would be to-cut-me-own-throat."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I stopped counting typos after 50, that's not hyperbole I literally counted and bookmarked all the misspellings up to fifty(less than quarter-way through the book) before giving up, not just misspelled words either about halfway through several pages are out of order, and that's in addition to the standard shoddy formatting we've all come to know and love harper collins ebooks for. I got my money back and I recommend you don't waste your's."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Sir Terry is always good for a laugh. What can you do with a guitar that turns you into a star, but that owns you more than you own it? Read this book and find out, and along the way have some laughs."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"There were a couple of subplots in this one and they didn't marry as smoothly as other Pratchett novels have but it was still a very fun and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I am an avid Prachett reader and I have been trying to update my paperbacks to hardcovers. I had noticed that I was missing the paperback of Soul Music and immediately went on a hunt to find the hardback. I do love Prachett's works and Soul Music was one of the first I had read. It's a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I Like Terry Pratchett, and his Discworld creation.I like his death character and when he created Susan in this book he changed his Discworld stories for the better. If you are reading this series then this book should be read after Mort and before Hogfather."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I always love Death books - and this was good. Susan is a very interesting logical character who struggles to fit her absolutely not logical and easily explained family into her world view. And enter the new thing - Music with Rocks in it."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"How this got printed I don't want to know.I will read anything, from milk cartons to Richard Feynmane to bodice rippers. I could not get through this drivel.And what, pray tell, is with a character that always speaks in CAPITAL LETTERS.Don't go here, unless you are in desparate for the paradigmatic example of &lt;profanity ommitted in deference to common decency&gt;"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I gave this a 5-star rating on principle...but be careful when you buy Soul Music...some copies were misprinted and are missing 50-100 pages (well, actually,when I say &quot;missing&quot;, I mean replaced by 50-100 pages of Patricia Cornwell's Black Hornet). Make sure you check for this when you purchase it!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is another great book from Terry Pratchett, that will give you a good laugh. However, I don't think the description of the book (Sex, Dwarves, and Rocks that Roll) tells you much about the book, so read it and find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I've read all of the comments, but no one mentioned what a glorious ending the book has. I had a permanent smile on my face for like the last 30 pages. Soul Music is by far one of the best books I have read (and I'm always reading *some*thing), and I'm glad that most everyone loved it as well. I mean, how can you *not* just love the Death of Rats? Genius..."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I never heard of Terry Pratchett or Discworld until last week---now I can't wait to read the other books in the series.The idea of Death taking a holiday because he can't forget what hasn't happened yet is crazy to begin with; when you add Music with Rocks In it's an avalanche! If you're going to read this book don't plan on going anywhere for the next few hours---you won't want to put it down (except to find the rest of the series)."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Soul Music takes the reader on a romp of sex, drugs, and rock &amp; roll[1] like no other. This book has found a common ground for everyone - there's no sane person on earth who could resist it!Its a book about The Band that brings rock &amp; roll to the Discworld. As they tour the Disc, fans throw undergarments at the stage and University students paint thier rooms black. But all is not well with this new music. Its _alive_.And when something is alive, Death gets handed a responsibility. If only anyone knew where he was... In the meantime, his granddaughter[3] Susan, takes over in a hilarious ride through the history of music.Just don't let that Orang-Utan on the organ![1] Okay, just rock &amp; roll.[2][2] One out of three isn't bad.[3] By adoption."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"To say that this is the story of Imp the Bard, Death's granddaughter, and rock music is an understatement worthy only of Terry Pratchett's footnotes. Soul Music tells of how Death retires (like Sinatra, one of his many retirements in the Discworld series) and his granddaughter takes up the scythe. Imp the Bard, meanwhile, refuses to die (and the new Death refuses to kill him) due to the nefarious influences of the new music he has invented, Music With Rocks In. Pratchett uses the now familiar &quot;flat earth&quot; conceit of the Discworld to satirize all elements of music, from our obsession with Buddy Holly, to the very British in-joke of Cliff. The best of the series to date"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is another great Discworld novel. It's about the birth of Music With Rocks In on the Disc. I just finished it, and was left with a very profound feeling that, somehow, I'm quite NORMAL next to this guy.Anyway, it's about the granddaughter of Death, who has gone on a philisophical journey. Susan Sto Helit climbs aboard Binky (Death's white horse) and kills a lot of folk-until she meets Imp y Celyn. Imp, whose full, translated name is &quot;small shoot of the holly&quot; is the birth of Music with Rocks In on the Discworld. With a new name (&quot;Buddy&quot;), he and Glod the Dwarf (&quot;We're on a mission from Glod&quot;) and Cliff the Troll start a band called The Band With Rocks In, and get the entire faculty of Unseen University in an uproar, even the Librarian (&quot;Oook.&quot;) What follows is, well, hilarity. Read this, then go read Small Gods, and you'll be hooked for live on Discworld."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"I really like all of Terry Pratchett's Discworld (fantasy) books, including this one. You will best enjoy reading them in the order published, but they're good on their own. They have a unique, fey humor: I expect you will like all or none, so if they're new to you, get just one to begin with."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. Soul Music is #16.]I know that Soul Music is many people's favorite Discworld book, but it didn't come together like most of Pratchett's other works have. It took me about twice as long to get through--the pace plodded at times, there were one or two too many plotlines to follow, and the main characters weren't as relatable as in other books. There were some brilliant and hilarious ideas that kept things interesting, and things generally came together at the end, but even with the loose ends tied up, it felt like the book mostly just spun its wheels and stayed in one place. It felt like the whole thing was merely a vehicle for humorous music references, with no overarching goal."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This has been one of the best Discworld books I've ever read. It had me up late into the night reading because once you start you just can't stop.Another Discworld book thats as good as this one is Interesting Times. Try it if you want a good long laugh."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Terry Pratchet has done it again, with Soul Music. This is the best Discworld novel yet published. Trolls, dwarfs, humans and music with rocks in, it's a really funny book, with action, satirical jokes and a true observation on human nature. Just read it!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Pratchett never disappoints me, and as usual, this book was hilarious from start to finish, and you almost never see the jokes coming. I would find myself laughing out loud, then turning back a few pages to see just how long he'd been setting up a joke, then realizing that he hadn't been setting it up, it just appeared there. I'd reccomend brushing up on your Rock and Roll history before reading this, as those who are unfamiliar with the early days of Rock music may miss many of the jokes."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Soul Music, does have good old Sci-fi rythem in it, in fact it is one of the best books in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. Soul Music follows a young woman called Susan, Who is badly mistaken for a tooth fairy, finds that her world of people are starting to dance to a ghostly music called &quot;Music with rocks in&quot; its a lawless soul music that has appeared in Discworld, its alive... and it wont leave Discworld. Soul Music, is my absoulte favourite book in the Discworld series, and it will be loved for those of all ages."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"The book is fast moving, funny and exciting. It is one of Pratchett's best. I also recommend Feet of Clay and Jingo."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Discworld is a highly entertaining mickey take on the most ridiculous industry known to man. No corner escapes Terry Pratchett's wicked humour:performers, managers, agents and especially the fans (the image of the Dean in his leather cloak with the words &quot;Born To Rune&quot; on the back still makes me chuckle). Well done Mr. Pratchett! Long Live Music With Rocks In!!!"},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"This is, in my opinion, the best of the discworld books.

Also the funniest parody of Rock music I've ever read."},{"Title":"Soul Music","review":"Four Words: The Death of Rats, yes I know that He's not one of the main charecters in this book but the whole idea just works for me.This books takes us on a tour of nothing and yet still manages to teach us alot about everything.

What a cute story for all!"},{"Title":"The Runaway Angels","review":"This is a very interesting story. I have no doubt that it would provide some inspiration to those who believe in the power of faith and prayers. It has humor, drama, suspense, and an insight to the soul -- a very good read."},{"Title":"The Runaway Angels","review":"This is a very cute story filled with miracles. I love the chapters about the devastating fire, the abduction of Samantha, the war location where the soldiers and the militants were cured from their injuries, the heartbroken teenager saved from dying by a giant flower, the boy saved from a shark, the mean prince punished by the angels, the possessed school boys, etc. The stories are all very interesting, and the part about heaven made me feel so good, made me wonder about the kingdom of God. The ending was mesmerizing, how I wish I can reveal it, but if I do, there will be no more suspense for you, so I advise evereybody not to delay in reading this book--one of the cutest book I ever read. Go for it, guys. You'll not regret it. This is the kind of book that the parents and kids will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Runaway Angels","review":"Friends, parents, teachers, and kids, hear me. The Runaway Angels by Ramona Cleofas-Moore has brought me to a new level regarding my reading habits. Her first chapter about the Kingdom of Heaven and the powers of the two angels, Mark and Leslie, made me wonder about the unknown world, made me wonder the perfection of life where the two angels came from. Do they have the powers to do miracles which the author has revealed in the book? Though I don't really buy the idea of angels too much, I found the book pretty delightful and interesting to read. It carried a wholesome message and unbelievable miracles that referred to the status of this crazy world. The Runaway Angels is a breath of fresh air, away from the gory topics you can find in most of the bookstore shelves. Hear me everyone, this is something your kids must read. Oh, I take that back, it is the book YOU and your kids must read. I read it twice, and I laugh at the parts where it tickles my bones."},{"Title":"The Runaway Angels","review":"I can say this is one of the best books I have ever read when it comes to injecting social and moral values which people of all ages need today. The two angels came down to earth and saw the ugliness of earth. The had done marvelous miracles, helping young people cope up with their problems. The book also showed the different problems the world is having--wars, famine, fires,discrimination and crimes. At the same time it showed that there is a greater power that can conquer the evils and vices that confront everyone of us. The book has the cutest and most interesting situations making me continue reading the book eagerly up to the end which challenged my mind and made me pause for a while to capture what the author meant and wanted to demonstrate. I recommend this book for everybody's reading pleasure. This is a real wonderful book that kids and even the old will enjoy reading from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Runaway Angels","review":"I loved this book. The stories were so very heart-warming. In reading this book, you can truly see how the power of good will always triumph against evil. Reading about two little angels traveling the universe and helping those in need gives you a sense of peace knowing that someone will always be willing to help you when you are also enduring life's difficulties. These are excellent stories for all ages. You will honestly want to read it over and over, I know I do."},{"Title":"The Runaway Angels","review":"There is a need in ones soul to do good. It's for yourself, as well as others.There is also a good deed done to write a book for all the good.

As a result of my fascination for this heroic and brave individual I felt I really needed to research into him further. Thus, I came across this book and read it from cover to cover in a matter of days. I found it as interesting, if not more so, as the programme. It confirmed alot of what was discussed in the programme so I can at least say that it is authentic and very well researched and written. Well done to the author. It cant be easy writing historic fiction with all the research involved and the need to make sure all the information is authentic and accurate...Ms Brittlebank has done exceptionally well. Long live the memory of Tipu the Lionheart!"},{"Title":"Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy: Islam and Kingship in a Hindu Domain","review":"On a recent trip to southern India I visited Mysore and Srirangapatna, and came to learn Tipu Sultan's name for the first time. While touring the 2 thousand years old Hindu temple and the Muslim mosque with an active madrasa in it, I couldn't help being struck by the seemingly peaceful coexistence of both within the confines of the Srirangapatna fortress wall. Later on while visiting the summer palace and museum of Tipu Sultan, a more nuanced and glorious picture unfolded itself to me, bring such familiar names as Lord Cornwallis, Duke of Wellington. The tomb of Hyder Ali, his wife Fatima and Tipu Sultan further struck me with a picture of strong historical and current Muslim presence in a country nurturing Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity as well. I couldn't help googling on Tipu Sultan and Srirangapatna the first chance I could, and read through Prof Sheik Ali's tipusuntan.org with much interest. The site, compiled obviously by a modern day muslim scholar, is a glowing review depicting a national hero and freedom fighter against the British colonists, enlightened ruler with Hindu officials in high court, great diplomat skilled in building alliances with Napoleon, the Afghan rulers; and great military man familiar with the latest technology and military strategy who used advanced(by 1790 standard) rockets in the 2nd Mysore war to totally humiliate the British army. I haven't seen mentionings of Tipu the Lionheart, but the title of Tiger of Mysore is more than appropriate.Not surprisingly, my quick research also came across views from a different angle(http://www.indiastar.com/wallia7.htm), which pointed to Tipu Sultan as a merciless and ruthless ruler, slaughtering the Hindus and Christians on his way to conquer Kerala and Mangalore, 'honoring' Hindus with Islam. In letter dated January 18, 1790, to Syed Abdul Dulai: \\" ...almost all Hindus in Calicut are converted to Islam. I consider this as Jehad.\\" Fanatical jihaddist it looks like, which is more familiar and understandable to a modern day western observer. It would seem to me 'Legitimacy' would never be a question to Tipu Sultan or anybody with deep religious faith, or national fervor, or emotional confiction, just as we never question the legitimacy of democracy and capitalism as 'our way of life'.I also read on today's Wall Street Journal about the Zoroastrians' more passive way of surviving as yet another religion in the subcontinent, \\"Because Zoroastrianism doesn't seek converts, a small band of the faithful were able to live peacefully among Hindus, Muslims and Christians.\\" And the Zoroastrians' way leads to a shrinking population, prompting efforts to employ modern day help such as internet dating, fertility treatment, makes some amazing reading for me today. Islam doesn't seem to face this kind of challenge it would seem to me.I look forward to read this book and learn more about 'Islam and Kingship in a Hindu Domain', and perhaps visit Mysore and Srirangapatna again, before development turn those dusty emblems of amazing history into yet another Disney theme park...Rated 5 stars based only on the striking title of the book :)"},{"Title":"Tipu Sultan's Search for Legitimacy: Islam and Kingship in a Hindu Domain","review":"Dear Kate Brittlebank,I once again repeat that i am not commenting on the book. So there is no need for me to read it. I am a research scholar and my thesis is on historical paintings of Karnataka, Particularly the paintings that belong to Tipu Sultan's period.The picture you have chosen is in a small temple at a place called Sibi. The owner of the temple, Nallappa, served under Haidar Ali, Tipu Sultan and later Krishnaraja Wodeyar.

It also features a word for word English translation with it. In the right hand column it has the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. You don't have to pay the high price on Amazon to get this book. You can get it free, or for a donation of your choice, from Jehovah's Witnesses.Jan. 6, 2010:I would like to add a few more thoughts from two Bible scholars.I think it is a legitimate and highly useful aid toward the mastery of koine (and classical) Greek. After examining a copy, I equipped several interested second-year Greek students with it as an auxilliary test. After learning the proper pronunciations, a motivated student could probably learn koine Greek from this source alone...The text is based on that of Brooke F. Westcott and Fenton J. A. Hort (1881), [respectively], but the translation by the anonymous committee is thoroughly up-to-date and consistently accurate... In sum, when a Witness comes to the door, the classicist, Greek student, or Bible student alike would do well to place an order. - Thomas N. Winter, University of Nebraska, THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL, \\"The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, Translated by the New World Translation Committee\\". (illustrated with a full presentation of the Greek and English texts of John 1:1), April-May, 1974 pages 375-6.I have just completed teaching a course for the Religious Studies Department of Indiana University, Bloomington.... This is primarily a course in the Gospels. Your help came in the form of copies of the Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures which my students used as one of the textbooks for the class. These small volumes were invaluable to the course and very popular with my students. Simply put, it is the best interlinear New Testament available. I am a trained scholar of the Bible, familiar with the text and tools in use in modern biblical studies, and, by the way, not a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses. But I know a quality publication when I see one, and your 'New World Bible Translation Committee' has done its job well. Your interlinear English rendering is accurate and consistent to an extreme that forces the reader to come to terms with the linguistic, clutural, and conceptual gaps between the Greek-speaking world and our own. Your 'New World Translation' is a high quality, literal translation that aviods traditional glosses in its faithfulness to the Greek. It is in many ways, superior to the most successful translations in use today. - Dr. Jason David BeDuhn, quoted in The Watchtower, February 1, 1998, page 32."},{"Title":"The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures","review":"I'll admit, I'm someone who went to church for years and never researched what was being taught to me.

Instead it turned into a pretty well written review worthy enough to be shared here.Do you ever wonder why witchcraft is really about? Well then you might want to pick up,\\"Spellbound: The Teenage Witch's Wiccan Handbook\\" by Teresa Moorey. Teresa explains the in's and the outs of witchcraft from her point view. The book is filled with fun quizzes and rituals including one called \\"Your First Ritual\\". In actuality though,properly named it should read \\"Your First Wiccan Ritual\\" because most of us have experienced \\"Sunday Ritual\\" and the whole church experience. She also includes simple spells here and there throughout the book making learning about the old times fun! The author even puts in two whole chapters devoted on the seasons and the celebrations associated with them.The author removes the fantasy and misconceptions about witches. She desires that readers know that witches aren't evil and green faced old women who go about flying around on a broom and eating children as Ronald Dahl believes. (Although, I would find broom flying rather fun)Witches are just like everyone else except they are really connected to nature.The truth is witches do not follow a patriarchal religion of the God of the bible and Jesus Christ but instead embrace the life affirming ideals of the Great Mother and look to Her divine presence in nature.Near the end of the book, there is list of Goddesses and Gods with a paragraph of explanations for all them to help widen the young readers understanding of these divine figures. It's a great book that I would recommend to not only teens and pre-teens (like me) but to anyone who is very new and clueless about this wonderful nature loving path of the witch.

However, I thought the tone was very distracting. Admittedly, I am an intellectual and I love to read. I expect things I read to be very well written and I don't like it when the author's persona overwhelms the information being presented. One example, the author in referring to the different types of attacks, refers to the Nighty Night Bunny Rabbit, or NNBR. And continues this reference throughout the book. Apparently, it is some sort of inside joke. Other authors might say a haymaker or an all out attack. If you don't like formal writing, or do not read very much and instead spend most of your time at the dojo or gym, this might be the book for you. But I found the style really detracted from the book's contents, which are generally thoughtful."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"I like this book. I like the author, and get every book I can by him. He is funny as well as being informative. He is rude and uses some very rough language, but that is a breath of fresh air after reading some of the psuedo- zen stuff that passes as martial arts these days.MacYoung makes fun of himself and is quite willing to tell how he made mistakes so that the reader can avoid making the same ones. No huge egos here, well.....maybe he has an ego but it doesn't seem to get in the way like some of the ones I have seen.This book is described as a primer for reading cook books for martial arts. That may sound strange, but if you have never learned how to cook then the first time you pick up a cook book you will be lost because you will not know the language or the sklls needed to use it. In terms of martial arts, this book explains all the points that standard martial arts books leave off. After you read this you can look at other martial arts book and be able to tell what they are doing as well as being able to tell if they would be effective on the street or are just another &quot;McDojo&quot; trying to attract students.Even experienced martial artists should enjoy this book. In fact I highly recomend that everyone who is in martial arts for the purpose of dying in bed (either of old age or in the arms of a red head- preferably both) pick this book up and confirm that what they are doing is consistant with the real combat lessons that MacYoung and his friends have paid such a heavy price to learn.I am happy to say that what I do is consistant with what I read in this book, but there are some points I would not have been aware of had I not read it. This is the value of the book for even experienced martial artists. Some people just go through the motions and they have no meaning. This book will help add meaning to your practice IF you are doing something worthwhile. You may just find out that you are wasting your time, at which point this book may save your life by getting you out of a bad dojo before it is too late. I like to learn from my mistakes, I really like to learn from other people's mistakes- less blood on my part. Anyone who feels the same should get this book.

As I read this book, the truths of violence and fighting suddenly became very clear, due to MacYoung's no-nonsense, hilarious writing style. This is the book that started a whole new way of looking at the TRUTH of violence, self-defense, and fighting. I cannot recommend this book enough!"},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"Once again, Marc gives you a no-holds barred look at the reality of fighting and surviving on the street. This book is simply loaded with sound principles and easy to learn techniques for making the most of a bad situation. Marc spends a good deal of time discussing the principles behind the techniques and what to look for. I find this information on the principles behind the techniques very useful, and it is usually a very good indicator of a high quality self-defense and/or martial arts book.Because of the limited amount of space I have to write and post this review, I am only going to hi-light just a few of the many interesting things in this particular book.Introduction: It is painfully obvious that Marc has had some bad experiences with formal martial arts training and that is too bad. However, one must remember that, \\"One bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch babe.\\" I believe that is either an old parable, or a line from the Jackson 5, if I'm not mistaken. Or it may even be both.The Foundation: Attitude or Spirit: This can also be summed up as your desire to do whatever you have to do in order to not only survive a violent encounter, but also to come out on top.Fear and the negative voice in your head: In this section Marc discusses fear and the negative reinforcement training that we receive from the time we are able to crawl until the time you are put into a wooden box.Difference between fighting and combat: Believe it or not, there is a difference between fighting and combat. Generally speaking, fighting is usually a combination of stupidity and hormones gone amuck. While combat is serious life and death. And yes, sometimes fighting can lead to combat.Blows: In this section Marc discusses 4 different types of blows and what their designed or intended to do. They are as follows:Set-ups: These can be (and do include) the boxers jab. These are designed to confuse and create an opening or openings on your opponent so that you can exploit them with heavier more dangerous blows.Rattlers: These blows hit a little bit harder than an initial set-up blow and are designed to \\"rattle\\" the senses of your opponent.Maimers: These are blows that are designed to do the most damage after initial contact with your opponent has been made. For example; a slap to the side of the head by an open hand that once it hits the head, reaches up and grabs a hold of the ear and rips it off the side of your skull.N.N.B.R.: I have to chuckle every time I read about N.N.B.R.'s. Not that they are inherently funny, but what the acronym stands for is pretty hilarious. What these blows are designed to do is to put your lights out, nappy time, kissing the canvas, etc. They knock you out!Punches: Although several good points are brought up in this section, the one that is perhaps the most important is this, \\"As fast as your punch goes out, it should be just as fast coming back in.\\"Kicks: Now before I get into the \\"nuts & bolts\\" of this section, I have to admit that the subject of kicking is a sore spot with me. Not in the sense of being against it, as a matter of fact it is quite the opposite, but as being totally in favor of kicking as a means of self-defense when the kick is executed correctly, and applied properly. This in itself can be the deciding factor between improving your chances of victory, or total humiliation with a smattering of pain thrown in for good measure.Here are two important points to remember when reading this section.a. For the most part, a lot of what Marc says about kicking is correct.b. However, it is not the kick that is ineffective, but rather the improper application of the kick that is ineffective.Anger, Bullies, and Berserkers: Marc gives you an extremely good profile of the 3 types of people you are most likely to be confronted by during a self-defense type situation. He also gives you sound advice on how to handle each one of these threats.Sucker Punches, Low Blows, and Tricks: In this section Marc discusses the theory and principles as well as some myths about cheap shots and so forth. Very informative information that, like the rest of the information in this book, should be stored in the old grey matter.Weapons: Marc discusses various types of weapons you are likely to encounter and spends a good deal of that time discussing the most common of them all, the knife. He also includes 4 rules for using a weapon that are very sound and should be followed.Martial Arts vs. Street Fighting: Once again I have to take a bit of an exception with Marc's comparison of PKA (Professional Karate Association) to self-defense. To me, this is like comparing apples to oranges. Although I do understand the comparison he was trying to make. Again I must emphasize that, \\"One bad apple doesn't spoil the whole bunch babe.\\"Teachers: A good teacher is worth their weight in gold, just like a bad one is worth their weight in crap.Like all of Marc's books, this one is straight forward and well worth the price."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"After reading the great reviews, I really had high hopes for this book. I read 40 pages the first day I recieved it, and was constantly left in a state of.... ( and...ok... when do we get to the USEFUL stuff.) It's a well written book, but it's all COMMON SENSE. I could of told you everything this book does. The pictures aren't helpful at all, in that you have no idea what's going on, or how to perform any of the very few moves described in this book.

Bad guys are bad because they cheat (among other things). All the martial arts training in the world is useless if you get taken down in an ambush before you have a chance to use it or even know that you might need to. Knowing where, how, and when an attacker might act is essential knowledge for survival. MacYoung's straightforward, witty style makes this an excellent read.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"I think this book was all the extra manuscript (read 'stories') that Animal had left on his computer. It's okay as far as content, but his other titles are much, much better. His web site is just as inclusive and actually serves as a clear guide to his personal philosophy and approach to fighting and combat. I now have ALL of his books. This one might gather dust, whereas the others will continue to be dog-eared, high-lighted, well-read and savored for their wisdom."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"The book presents the author's attitude and practical knowledge of fighting and combat obtained from the streets. All his arguments are sound and clear. You will find the concepts and mostly not the specific martial art techniques. In my opinion the book is for all sorts of people, for housewives, for young men, and for martial arts experts too. The writing style is from the streets, making the book more colorful and interesting.Maybe the best side of the book is 'Martial Arts vs. Street Fighting' chapter; I think this chapter answers the childish questions which martial art is the best, what moves from dojo should not be implemented and other. This is very valuable chapter, even to martial arts experts.There are several chapters on mental characteristics of 'bed guys'. There is also a chapter 'Alpha and Beta', which structures the problematic groups and make very good points. This is definitely an interesting text because it is the essence of acting on streets.The other chapters are also informative, and they all convey the street concepts - and that is the most important of all. I surely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"The majority of martial arts books/self defense books place much of their emphasis on technique, form,and tepid &quot;how to instruction&quot;.Physical skills are emphasized at the expense of common sense and awareness. This was perhaps the first book to point out that exercising proper discretion and understanding why certain individuals pose threats to our well being can be more vital in many instances than possessing the ability to deliver lightning kicks and punches.The author,a veteran of many street wars when younger, believes your mind is still your best weapon and realistically exposes the myths behind traditional martial arts training which sadly leads many students to believe their training is a step towards immortality. I own this book approximately 8 years,have read it three times, and will continue to use it as a source of inspiration and reference. Many others of it's type have followed, so Mr.MacYoung must have been on to something."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"After reading several of his books, I feel like I've come to know Animal. I'm familiar with some of his old stomping grounds in Ventura and have met the acqaintance of people like him. The real tragedy is that there are areas across the U.S. that breed brash troublemakers who not only put you in the precariouis position of haing to defend yourself with a crude weapon like a knife, but themselves. Many such punks routinely bite off more than they can chew, relegating them to mere predators, and not too smart ones at that.Animal says it and I've seen it, but the best way to stay out of trouble and avoid the situations he teaches you how to deal with when things have gone too far, is courtesy. I'm sure Animal would never say so in print, but I'm certain he's forced loudmouthed louts into fights when they would rather not have fought because they said or did something that he found to be rude to himself or someone else. One can't be in that crowd without being part of it.Now, looking back on it, he's realized how senseless it all is. He still commands respect in his circle and under some situations others might find innocuous, he's probably capable of being driven to violence to this day. And if he's known as the author of books, there are probably those who are anxious to take him on.All this brings not only a wealth of knowledge to his books, but a tremendous sense of the senselessness of violence. Dying for a noble cause--something one believes in--is honorable. Dying because you are piss poor drunk and said the wrong thing to the wrong person is a tragedy that, like AIDS, can be avoided by keeping everything where it belongs.If you're a yuppie or a retiree, you're probably not going to be in situations Animal describes; however, it's still insightful to see how the psychology of the biker bar stand works. Long hair, bandanas, pony tails, leather jackets, leather armbands, hairy arms, ego and, of course, knives, beer bottles and puke. This is the world you'll be hearing about in Animal's books which are in essence guides to living in his world. When you're done with the entertainment there, pick up a book on the mob and learn how to survive with the Sopranos.I enjoy Animal's books, but I've never been part of that world and never hope to be. But hey, if you ever find yourself living in a post-nuclear world with Mad Max, it might come in handy."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"If you are looking for the archetype of the ultimate boisterous gascone, look no further: Marc \\"animal\\" MacYoung is your man. Most of the times he plays the \\"I dunno nothing\\" kinda type of guy, only to surprise you with his keen knowledge of formal martial arts. That's part of his game, as it is clear that he had fun writing this book as much as the reader shall have fun reading it (provided that you can get along with the Me/Myself/andI attitude). The chapters about empirical psychology show that the author did his homework before writing. If you have been around the corner, you won't find much stuff that you really don't know. However, any black belt candidate should read this book, or an equivalent one, and demonstrate an adequate understanding of it before taking his/her test.

I was serving with the 2nd Infantry Division and did not know that in the future I would become friends with Marc, work together, train together, and teach at the same events. I did not know he would write the foreword for my first book. What I did know was I was seeing the same kinds of things in the bars I was fighting in that he wrote about.Many years later, I still believe this book shares some valuable realistic advice regarding real street fights. When Marc wrote this book, he was a lot closer to the streets and had not experienced some of the martial arts he has now, and that shows in his writing.I put some of Marc's practical advice about fights into practice in the bars and other places I was frequenting. It helped me then, and it could help you now if you find yourself in violent situations. I have learned a lot from Marc both in person and from his books.

Once again, &quot;BE AWARE.&quot;I have a difficult time believing all of the author's stories. They just seem like the type of macho krap (although he warns of the macho mentality) you might hear from some barfly before someone gets tired of it and calls his bluff.Overall, it is not as useful as some of his other books.

It was either &quot;Koryu&quot; or &quot;Budo&quot;. In any case, review's author, which live in Japan and holds very high rank in Japan Martial Arts, did recommend MacYoung's books as primer source of street self defense. So, I bay his books, and let me say, they changed my view of self defense. The first of all, MakYoung teach you survival, survival and one more time survival. And you can see this through other review. You fight did not start and end in one interval of time, it starts long before it, and only sometimes you can be sure, that it finish and will not be raised again some time later. The book deals with pre- and post- fight time intervals. Fight itself also gets very down to earth advise, so you get very informative view about street fighting and street survival. The most attractive part of this book, that it teaches you not pure technique, but concept. And concept is what you need, since you are not going to remember technique all your life, concepts you do.

If you are looking for spesific techniques about \\"how to make cheap shots\\" you won't find them here, altought one could assume that from title of the book, at least I did. Nor you wont find any other techniques either. Instead, this book is full of theories, concepts and advice about self-defence, and also about long term survival in this mean world. It's kind of an life path guide, a warriors path. And this isn't \\"learn self-defense in 10 minutes in your living room\\" kind of book, it assumes that you are already training or are about to start very soon.What is special in this book is author's very good sense of black humor. You will be laughing out loud many times when you read this. For example, the chapter about advice on bad asses, he writes something like this: \\"There is a real scary thing in this world. There are people who are professional killers. There are so many ways to off someone, it isn't even funny anymore.\\" :DOne word of warning though; After you have read this book, you absolutely have to start some kind of martial art, combat- or fighting sport training! You just can't live without one anymore after this book has opened your eyes! :)"},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"This book was great! A crash course in practical, REALISTIC self-defense! This book is intended primarily for beginners, although there is something of value here for everyone -- high school kids, women, martial artists, and even barroom brawlers! Animal is real down on the \\"classical\\" martial arts schools for good reason -- they take yer money, then teach you a lot of unworkable ... like \\"pressure points\\" and high spinning kicks (in addition to having to memorize foreign terminology and a bunch of stupid \\"kata\\"), which serve to do nothing except provide a false sense of security. \\"I have earned my Black Belt, so ALL shall be in awe of my mastery of the fighting arts! Hey! You can't kick me in the knee! Stop stomping on my head! MOMMIE!\\" You get the picture. Most martial arts schools will not teach you how to win a streetfight. Sure, it's good exercise, and maybe it'll boost yer \\"self-esteem\\" to be awarded all them colored belts, but heck, you can BUY belts! A streetfight is not an athletic competition, and Animal makes this abundantly clear. Although he takes the subject very seriously (he's written about a dozen books on the subject), he doesn't take himself seriously at all, which is a refreshing change. I'm really sick of hearing a bunch of arrogant \\"tough guys\\" with testosterone issues telling everyone how BAAAAAD dey is, and why THEIR style is SOOOOO much better than all the others. Animal doesn't come across like that at all. In fact, reading his book is almost like talking about old times over a coupla beers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"I always wanted to read one of the books written by this guy. I picked what I think was his first book. Anyway, the psychology of various streetfighters he goes into is incredible. Where did he learn all that? He writes about people you DON'T ever want to mess with and describes them with stunning accuracy. Its just amazing that he has figured out so much. That in itself is why this guy is very credible to me. He couldn't have figured all this out by surfing the web or playing in dojos (i.e. the &quot;wolverine&quot; personality). You need to get this book if you are serious about fighting or protecting yourself. If you want to just play in the dojo, don't get it."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"Although Mr. MacYoung does offer a lot of advice about streetfighting, the heart of his book is really about how you can avoid dangerous situations entirely. Much of this is common sense, gut instinct kind of stuff -- which of course most people ignore! 95% of bad situations can probably be avoided. As for the remaining 5%, he has good advice for the dojo trained: there's a BIG difference between the dojo and the street. It's the difference between fighting and combat. If you're not bothered by the author's frequent salty and street language, this is an entertaining book that is practical and informative."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"Well,Senshido instructor Richard Dimitri speaks highly of Marc \\"Animal\\" MacYoung's books, and like always, Rich is right.Animal's books contain excellent tips about how to detect violence and deal with it effectively using no nononsense techniques.Marc talks about many important things in his book, such as the importance of awareness, the difference between a striker and a maimer, real stories that either happened to him or to acquaintances regarding violence, among other things.If you're into Real world self defense, not flashy Martial Arts, get this book, and others by this author.

The key lessons I've remembered are spotting some of the warning signs that you are being set up for a mugging or ambush and to scan people approaching you as a way of boosting your awareness.The hints are simple, easy to remember and useful to keep up what fighter pilots love to call situational awareness.The book also dispells a couple of myths that many people still believe such as the old favorite \`\`kick him in the groin''.It falls down in its display of actual technique. The pictures don't show much of how to do them, and some of them look to be of dubious application (though it could just be me misunderstanding them). That said, martial arts is best learned knocking bones, not trying to figure out pictures. This book delivers on most of what it promises and teaches quite a bit that it doesn't."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"Marc may have \\"done somethings\\" but this book is more the ramblings of a low level drug dealer/pot head who is trying to cash in on his street smarts than a useful informative work on self defense much less martial arts. If you grew up in a lily white upper middle class suburb and never had any contact with the rough side of society the tips on how others think might come as a revelation to you. If you have lived in an urban environment in the last 100 years there won't be many surprises. Most of the useful stuff could have been gleaned from any popular press article about staying safe. IMHO this book is a waste of money and time."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"This has some good advice mixed with lots of unnecessary filler.First, the good:1. It has lots of valid criticisms of the martial arts and their applicability to self defense such as there is too much emphasis on 'polite fighting' and rules. He makes a good case for why martial arts instructors should have students practice fighting in different environments such as uneven ground, confined spaces such as hallways, different environmental conditions, etc.2. He defines 'fighting' and 'combat' differently and makes a case for much a much different approach for 'combat' situations.3. He is very good on discussing environmental awareness and avoiding possible setups by criminals.Now, the bad:1. The book is full of braggadocio. If the author has really been in as many fights as he claims, he evidently does not practice what he preaches. His book has lots of information about how to avoid street fights, yet it seems that he boasts about some situation he was in on every other page. The best self defense is avoiding a bad situation. That being the case, MacYoung either is not that great at self defense or else loves storytelling.2. He is rather crude. It is fine to be realistic, but his language is gutter level throughout the book. It adds nothing and makes him sound like he doesn't have a big enough vocabulary to write without crudity.3. He uses some goofy terms that he evidently thinks are quite clever but are not commonly known and frankly add nothing to the content. Here are some examples: 'Nighty Nite Bunny Rabbits (NNBR's)' referring to a knockout punch commonly known as a 'haymaker'. Another is 'rattlers' which is a term he uses for a jab like punch. 'PIBU' is another one of his 'homemade' terms that is meaningless to most readers.Although some of his information is very good, I would recommend finding another book if you're looking for something good on self defense. One that is particularly good is 'Strong On Defense' by Sanford Strong. I believe it is out of print and hard to find, but it excellent."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"This is a concept-level book of self defence. By that I mean that the author Marc \\"Animal\\" Mac Young does not try to teach specific techniques, but rather ideas and underlying concepts. I think that this is a right approach, as it is very hard to explain motor skills in print. At the very least, it would take excessive amount of text and lots of pictures, and still it would be uncertain if the reader understands the technique right. That's why I feel it is much better to learn techniques from video (if you can't get hands-on instructing, that is).The book opens with basics of fighting, like types of punches, range, balance and so on. This is very interesting to read, although it is quite basic stuff. At about 1/3 of the book is devoted to these basics, and after that the book goes into more abstract stuff. At this point, the author starts to lose it. The book becames tediouos to read, and I was hard-pressed to understand some of the things Animal tried to explain. It's as if he did not possess the capacity to explain these abstract ideas to the reader. Luckily, after a while the book went on to human behaviour and human interrelations. This is again very interesting to read, as well as being an important subject. At the end of the book there is a chapter devoted to women's specific needs (threats), some stuff about weapons, the differences between martial arts and streetfighting, and so on. The book also includes a strange version of a concept commonly known as Cooper's color code of awareness (named after Jeff Cooper, who popularized the concept). In addition of making unnecessary changes to an established standard, Animal also fails to explain it properly.Animal likes to tell stories. On some occasions he falls in love with himself a bit too much, and the stories meant to be entertaining and amusing became annoying. This tendency is even more prevalent in this book than other books by Animal I have read.Despite it's shortcomings, I think that this is important book for anyone who is interested in self-defense. It's not that you won't find this information anywhere else, but this book is as good place to start as any similar book."},{"Title":"Cheap Shots, Ambushes, And Other Lessons: A Down And Dirty Book On Streetfighting & Survival","review":"As an 18 year old Marine fighting full contact karate in Japan, I picked up a copy of this book looking to discredit it....I mean a guy named \\"Animal\\" c'mon...But what I found was a great if rough read(Marc was just starting as an author then).

He's been summoned to the site, finding the woman and her grown-up daughter; the raven haired girl he used to tease. It seems Eden's mother is not well, and she's brought them there to unravel the secrets of the ancient site and to reveal some truths from the past. Eden was adopted from a white woman, and Eden's father was Navajo. When the woman dies, Eden turns to Ben to learn about her heritage, and ultimately find her real parents. But there's only one white woman who left a Navajo man close to thirty years before and that woman said she had aborted that baby.

And knee-deep in something worse than Window Rock's usual chaos. Wealthy Eden Trevoy, the little visitor he'd once adored, was back on the reservation, all grown up -- and tangled in secrets about her lost heritage. She needed Ben's help. And she wanted his heart!But Ben's People said the white woman would plunder his tenderness and then be gone. So Ben was in love -- and miserable! -- tormented by endless, impossible wanting. And Coyote laughed. She was a poor little rich girl who had everything . . . but love.My Review-I enjoyed reading of the Navajo people and their ways and when Eden met her Navajo family, Reavis' writing shone with poignancy. Without hesitation, I turned the pages (no doubt Cheryl Reavis' skill as a writer); BUT in the end, there seemed to be too many unanswered questions and the entire affair finished with a bland letdown. Yes, TENDERLY could have been a really good story. Unfortunately, I suspect TENDERLY was a victim of choppy editing.What were a few of the unanswered questions?1): in the beginning, so much was made of the mysterious arroyo and Professor Trevoy's interest in the Old Ways, then abruptly that plot line was cast aside!2): if young, virile officer, Ben Toomey, had difficulty maneuvering through the passage to this hidden arroyo (\\"The path was too treacherous to attempt . . . there wasn't a wide enough space for him to put his feet all the way down flat, and his knees scraped along the rock with every step . . . He was having to try to stay up on the sides of the rocks themselves now . . . there was an abrupt downward slope, causing him to lose his balance . . .\\") Ooooo . . .k! My reading question: exactly how did a frail old woman and her camera-toting, gear-laden daughter manage it (after Ben abruptly ran out of the arroyo, because he didn't like what Professor Trevoy told him)! Just a nagging thought!3): why the mystery surrounding the possible stealing of Eden's mother's records, photos, and notes (\\"I can't find the tapes of the 'sun serpent.' I can't find any tapes at all. . . . all of her tapes -- should be in one these boxes -- and I can't find her red notebook either . . .\\"), then abruptly that plot line was cast aside!4): In the short chapter BEFORE the epilogue; our love birds have mated and are happy, and then Eden flies off to New York City (the plot surmise: to further her banking career)! This was SO out in left field! When I got to this chapter, I shouted \\"What's going on?\\" Was it added to fill pages? Bizarre!!I'm giving this a C+ ; it was a pleasant story, but it could have been so much better. I know Cheryl Reavis can bring home a story.

The book is divided into three major parts. Part one begins with a detailed description of the ancient method of bookmaking. Next, Metzger lists the major Greek manuscripts and codices as well as a basic description of each. He also lists the major non-Greek witnesses (e.g. Syriac, Coptic, Latin, etc.) and discusses the role of quotations from the early church Fathers. Part two is devoted to the history of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament from the time of the Complutensian Polyglot and the Textus Receptus (the text used for the KJV) through Westcott and Hort until the present day. Part three is an instruction manual for textual criticism, including the many theories of criticism and the method of conjectural emendation. In this section, Metzger also discusses the many types of errors and deliberate changes made by the scribes. He then gives an analysis of several textually difficult passages (e.g. Mark 16 and Acts 20:28). The book also includes 16 photo plates that show selected manuscripts. A working knowledge of Greek is helpful because Metzger often cites Greek words in the text and footnotes without an English translation. If one wishes to learn the basics (and more) about textual criticism, then this is the book to buy."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"This book is a vital tool to use in rebutting the Ex Cathedra heresies of the King James Onlyists. Virtually every page contains important information that the KJOs would rather not discuss. (Or discuss out of context, if they acknowledge it at all.) And while this book isn't devoted to KJVOism per se, it is a great resource for the anyone who actually wants to examine the evidence for himself, rather than relying on the words of Ruckman, Riplinger, Cloud, Waite, Grady, etc...For example, while Westcott-Hort are condemned by the KJVO crowd, Erasmus is practically placed on a throne and his own heresies are ignored. His tampering with the text is overlooked while Westcott-Hort are branded as every sort of apostate and heretic imaginable. One standard is applied to Westcott-Hort, another is applied to Erasmus.Was the text perserved? Of course it was. Just not in the manner that some would have you believe. There was no additional &quot;moving&quot; of the Spirit over Erasmus, the KJV translators, or Benjamin Blayney to prevent them from making errors. Let Rome have it's Ex Cathedra doctrine.A word of warning: This book is deep. It goes into a lot of detail regarding various Greek and Latin manuscripts, as well as early versions and Patristic quotations. It takes time to absorb everything this book contains. But don't give up!

It is a tremendous overview of the sources that have been relied on that, taken together, make up the New Testament as we now understand it. It is fascinating to read about the divergences between different versions of the scriptures and the reasons for these differences, i.e., inattentive scriveners, etc. For those who may feel uncomfortable with this I should point out that Metzger is not seeking to undermine belief in the scriptures, in fact, he is the editor of the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible. However, he at no point allows his beliefs to interfere with his objective examination of the evidence. Obviously, he believes that such an examination should not undermine belief. As he states, no fundamental tenet of Christianity is impacted by the sometimes divergent readings in ancient manuscripts.

Rewriting the appendices into the body of the text would make this book even more useful.***************UPDATE: This review was written about the 1992 edition. The 2005 edition addresses my criticisms."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"Dr. Metzger's landmark encompasses a lifetime of scholarly work in the field of textual criticism and represents one of the best fundamental texts on the subject. While some have critized his method (Alexandrian and throughly influenced by Westcott and Hort), his research is impeccable and writing style emminently readable. A must for those who are being introduced to this complex and broad field of study."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"Metzger's book is a fabulous read for anyone serious in academic study of NT Textual Criticism (TC). Metzger introduces the reader to every possible arena of knowledge within the world of TC. From his opening sections on writing materials, types, and styles to his latter chapters on how to use TC, Metzger poignantly gives the reader everything he/she needs to know. Metger also does a great job at giving examples of meangingful papryri, manuscripts, and other documents. The only down side to Mezger's book is that it is not an \\"easy read.\\" Certainly the information is somewhat taxing, however, it is profitable to anyone who wants to learn the basics (and some advanced level information) of NT TC. All-in-all the book deserves five stars...it is simply an indispensible book."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"For clearness of exposition and soundness of principles, and even correct if not beautiful typographical appearance, this is the best introduction ever to NT Textual History and Criticism.OK, the Eberhard NESTLE book of some ninety years ago is again available and is a well thought-of German pedagogical feat of a textbook, glory to it!_ but, truly, it's also painfully outdated.So, what? It's true that the updating of the third edition isn't done in the best possible way_ but, what do we have to offer? The ALAND and ALAND handbook? Of course, it is a good repository of the latest data in the field, but a good, readable textbook it isn't.The 4th edn (METZGER, EHRMAN,The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration (4th Edition)OUP) is really an updated and improved revision of METZGER's now classical text, well done and helpful overall. For sheer quantity of raw material the ALANDs still hold the sway, but theirs is in no way a readable or agreeable book.So, I think it's on the whole better to stick to METZGER, and -for a good updating- to get the EHRMAN, HOLMES bookThe Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research: Essays on the Status Quaestionis. And don't forget the recent book by COMFORT,P.W.Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography & Textual Criticism"},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"This 4th edition updates a classic by Metzger. The new co-author that joins the aging Metzger is from the liberal end of the spectrum, and a few of the new views expressed in the 4th edition put a lot of weight on a very few manuscripts that agree with a liberal interpretation. There is thus a section on the \\"Oppression of Women\\", for example. Although Metzger's well-balanced approach is thus in jeopardy, the book is on the whole a useful update to the 3rd edition."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"I have used Metzger for over thirty years - all through the first three editions. Now for the fourth edition, the liberal higher critic, Bart Ehrman has been allowed to inject his tendential ideas. And, in my opinion, it has ruined the book. I am not doubting Ehrman's credentials - he was a student of Metzger - but he has an agenda, and that is evident in his additions to this edition. His feminism and radical view of early Christianity, as evidenced in his many other works, mars a classic work that deserved better treatment. Trust me, Metzger's theology is not shared by Ehrman. And his theology comes through, although textual criticism should not be agenda driven. I know that I will be skewered by some readers, but in my opinion a classic in the field has been marred by an editor who wants to steer readers away form the facts and toward his bias.If you don't know what I am talking about, just read his \\"Orthodox Corruption of Scripture\\" and his \\"Misquoting Jesus.\\"Give me back the third edition of this work - and spare me the musings of a man who admits he now denies the faith he once espoused."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"If someone wants to know how we got the New Testament this would definately be the book I would recommend. Metzger starts off explaining how copies were made he then goes on to discuss the various versions and biblical manuscripts that survive. He then goes onto talk about the various Textus Receptus versions, Westcott & Hort and Textual Criticism. This is a good book if you're interested in how we got the New Testament and I would give it five stars even though it is a bit dated. The Appendix attempts to update it but it doesn't do a good job the text should've been rewritten.The problem with this book is it's dated. Since it was written some quite substantial manuscript discoveries have been made. Metzger is bias towards the Alexandrian text and relentlessly degrades the Byzantine text at every opportunity the reader should not ignore this. However, he takes the Westcott & Hort approach that the Byzantine was very late and has no ancient readings. He presents a very compelling argument that validates his view. However, the Chester Beatty Papyri and Bodmer Papyri of around 200 AD disprove his theory entirely. These were found after this book's publication and I do believe Metzger has updated this title.Going on the attitude of this book I don't think this will be enough to sway Metzger's view on the Byzantine text. He does note these discoveries in the Appendix but he trivialises their significance. In my opinion nothing short of a miracle is going to change Metzger's attitude on the Byzantine text. Now I don't want readers to think I'm a King James/Textus Receptus supporter because I'm not far as I am concerned they're archaic and should be treated as such. Its just I don't believe the Byzantine text was as corrupt as Metzger makes it out to be and from my own research it is not as bad as he makes it out to be."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"This is a great book by Metzger, a must for any serious bible student. Goes to show why the KJV, or the Textus Receptus should be avoided when studying the New Testament Greek it is to modern of a text to be used. It is riddled with flaws so I would recomend the 27th addition of the New Testament Greek by Nestle & Aland witch used the most ancient munuscipts and Texts. The restoration part of this book is also very good, proving that the prophet mohommud of Isam was never even mentioned in the Bible the way Islamic's claim proving that he was a fraud. I would seriously recomend a book called Christians and Muslims at the tabled to prove Islam is not legit according to Islam scholars.

No evidence whatsover!His premise is that the Byzantine text is flawed. He then goes on to accuse the scribes which copied the Byzantine text of altering the text on a constant and regular basis. No evidence is given for these accusations other than they altered the text to make it conform to their beliefs or to make certain narratives more alike. Prove it Mr. Metzger.The manuscripts for the Critical Text of which Mr. Metzger is so fond was found in Egypt. Wake up boys and girls, that's where the Gnostic heretics lived. They had access to the egyptian manuscripts and were far more likely to alter them than a christian scribe who believed he was copying the actual words of Jesus or the apostles.The Byzantine church kept to the original teachings of Jesus and the apostles far longer than any other group.

There is a tremendous variety of versions of nearly every piece of text in the New Testament.

True, he is partial to the critical point of view, but who could blame him? Those who place more weight on the majority text are placing more weight on those codices that are much more recent, and are consequently further from the original.

It's an excellent introduction to the manuscript history of the New Testament. The work is well-written, relatively easy to read, and could be used by introductory college classes in the subject. Indeed, it was probably written for that specific purpose. As a side note, Bruce Metzger is a Christian, while Bart Ehrman is an atheist. Metzger even makes an appearance in Lee Strobel's infamous \\"The Case for Christ\\", while Ehrman is the author of the bestselling atheist book \\"Misquoting Jesus\\". A piquant combination!The first chapter of \\"The Text of the New Testament\\" deals with the making of ancient books in general, to give the students a feeling for the purely technical problems involved when the New Testament was written down, \\"published\\" and re-copied. The next chapter presents the most important ancient NT manuscripts. The oldest fragment of any NT text is known as P52, contains a few verses from the Gospel of John, and has been dated to the first half of the second century. Naturally, the famous Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Vaticanus are all discussed. Apart from the Greek manuscripts, Metzger and Ehrman also mention translations into Syriac, Latin, Gothic and other ancient languages. There are even fragments of a Nubian translation.The next two chapters give an overview of the history of textual criticism. For centuries, the dominant version of the New Testament was the Textus Receptus , based on medieval Byzantine manuscripts. Today, this manuscript tradition is considered inferior and is no longer used in Bible translations. Only a few fundamentalists still cling to it, usually in the King James Version. The last five chapters of the book are more technical. They deal with the methods used by modern textual critics. Of particular interest are the causes of errors in ancient NT manuscripts, including intentional changes. The notion that doctrinal changes caused Christian scribes to change the New Testament is a particularly contentious one.I warmly recommend this work for serious students."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"This text provides and excellent introduction to the history of the development of the text of the New Testament.

What makes for a challenge in reading such books is those occasions when assumptions and/or conclusions are presented as facts. Many of such \\"facts\\" can, and are, viewed differently by accomplished conservative scholars. Bart Ehrman, the brilliant Greek scholar who is the new partner in the latest edition of Metzger's work, is, unfortunately, radically bent toward a leftist viewpoint of the Scriptures. This leads to an over-confidence, typical of left-wing biblical scholars, that is deleterious to sound scholarship. In time, if the established history of left-wing scholarship holds, his work will become dated when another young and clever scholar devises some new theory concerning development of the ancient Greek text.For a more balanced, erudite view of this subject, one might want to read Harry Sturz' work.And for an opposing view, conservative to the bone, Maurice Robinson is the one to read. He is a capable scholar, though blinded somewhat by his right-wing prejudices, but one that can more than hold his own in the heated debate over the development of the Greek text, and who states categorically that Ehrman is guilty of several factual errors in this book."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"This is the quintessential book on NT textual criticism. Metzger covers virtually every issue regarding how the New Testament came into being in this volume. His scholarship is thorough and detailed, his writing is easy to read and his passion for the subject matter is obvious. In addition to describing the process of tranmission fully, this book serves as an incredible reference tool for the papyrii, manuscripts (both individual and families), codices, textual variants, etc. Metzger even includes a section on the application of textual criticism with several example passages. A must-read for any serious NT student. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"OPENING REMARKSBefore trading in this book for Kindle credits, the reviewer thought he'd post his marginalia for posterity (or, more likely, just for his own amusement). This book has been THE standard text on its subject since well before anyone knew Bart Ehrman's name, and will likely remain so even if Ehrman remains true to his decision to leave off the practice of textual criticism entirely. Given the text's likely long future, with however many new editors and editions, this reviewer's comments may eventually be of interest to one or two other readers (counting the reviewer himself as one such reader, of course). The reviewer makes no profession to advanced expertise in the text critical field; his comments, therefore, are the reflections of an interested (and, he likes to think, thoughtful) layman. In this review, ALL CAPS stand-in for italics.SELECT QUOTES & COMMENTS (MARGINALIA)Page 13. Metzger and Ehrman text: \\"In any event, it is clear that it was the Christians who early adopted and popularized the format of the codex in preference to the scroll for their sacred books. Whereas among surviving Greek manuscripts of pagan texts, whether literary or scientific writings, only 14 of 871 items dated to the second century A.D. are in the form of a codex, all the surviving Christian biblical papyri of the same period are in codex format (11 in number). Of the approximately 172 biblical manuscripts or fragments of manuscripts written before A.D. 400 or not long thereafter, it appears that 158 come from codices and only 14 from rolls.\\" Reviewer's marginalia: \\"Assumes surviving manuscripts are roughly representative samplings.\\" Though Metzger and Ehrman here make only an assertion about the physical format of ancient texts, not about the verbal content, their assertion and the reviewer's comment have broader relevance. One thing the reviewer has noticed in mainstream works of New Testament textual criticism is a tendency to assume that very tiny numbers of long-lived specimens (typically long-lived because located in environments that are unusual; unusually dry, for example) may safely be treated as representative of what was generally available at the time such specimens originated. Is this a SAFE assumption, or just a WISHFUL one?Page 18, note 23. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"The earliest known minuscule Greek manuscript bearing a date is a copy of the four Gospels, now in the public library of St. Petersburg, with its all-important colophon dated 7 May 6343 (A.D. 845) by the monk Nicolaus....This manuscript has raised problems for scholars; paleographically, the handwriting appears to be too mature and fully developed to stand at the beginning of the minuscule period, yet no forerunners have been recognized among extant manuscripts.\\" Reviewer's comment (which he's starred): \\"Suggests earlier origin of minuscules, with earliest examples non-extant.\\" However correct or incorrect this inference might be, it struck the reviewer as sufficiently important a few years ago to put an emphatic star by it.Page 21. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"In times of economic depression, when the cost of vellum increased, the parchment of an older manuscript would be used over again. The original writing was scraped and washed off, the surface resmoothed, and the new literary material written on the salvaged material. Such a book was called a palimpsest....One of the half-dozen or so most important parchment manuscripts of the New Testament is such a palimpsest; its name is Codex Emphraemi rescriptus. Written in the fifth century, it was erased in the twelfth century and many of the sheets rewritten with the text of a Greek translation of 38 treatises or sermons by St. Ephraem, a Syrian Church father of the fourth century.\\" Reviewer's comment: \\"This NT manuscript was not thought too highly of by those who overwrote it, apparently.\\" Next to Page 22, note 25 (where Metzger and Ehrman make note of additional palimpsests and provide reference to a David C. Parker article with additional details), the reviewer adds: \\"Did believers tend to overwrite (and thus show disrespect for) a certain textform? See how these [by which he meant, the palimpsest manuscripts listed in Metzger and Ehrman's footnote] are classified into families.\\" (The reviewer never pursued this \\"research project,\\" nor does he know if it is something that's already been done. Any reader who finds the topic interesting should feel free to look into the subject further; the reviewer will not be doing so.)Pages 24-27. Metzger and Ehrman identify three periods of New Testament manuscript transmission: (1) was the \\"earliest ages of the Church,\\" when non-professional individuals produced large numbers of copies and translations, often with a high degree of error, and widely varying in quality. (2) was a period of dominantly professional reproduction by trained, commercial scribes, beginning when \\"in the fourth century Christianity received official sanction from the state.\\" Though the numbers-driver (commercial) nature of the work led to a procedure where multiple scribes would pen manuscripts based upon an oral reading, inviting certain types of mistakes, line-counting (also used for pricing) and review by trained error-spotters helped improve accuracy. (3) was \\"the Byzantine period,\\" during which monks, subject neither to pressing time demands nor commercially-driven production quotas, and working from originals they could see and read rather than from ones they only heard, copied out manuscripts \\"either for themselves or for some benefactor of the monastery.\\" The reviewer's marginalia only note his impression that each stage was progressively less error-prone than the prior one (not that potential for error even went away, of course). Relating this (now) to his earlier comments, it seems to the reviewer that the importance that one's sample be representative becomes greater as one seeks to reconstruct earlier periods of manuscript history. A manuscript (however fragmentary) lucky enough to survive from \\"the earliest ages of the Church\\" might be very good or, by Metzger and Ehrman's own account, very bad, gross errors in reproduction having been MOST PREVALENT during that early period. Does this state of affairs suggest that a heavy reliance on the the longest-lived (or, as the mantra would have it, \\"oldest and best\\") manuscripts is prudent? The reviewer remains skeptical.Page 69. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"In common with other manuscripts of the New Testament, the text of Vaticanus [text type: Alexandrian] is divided into what may be called chapters. The system of division, however, appears to be more ancient than that current in other early parchment copies of the New Testament. For example, in the Epistles no notice is taken of 2 Peter; therefore, the system of divisions appears to date from a time when this epistle was not regarded as canonical.\\" Reviewer's comment: \\"Or to have been created by an editor who did not view it as canonical, whatever Christians in general believed.\\"Page 70. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Though the document [Codex Ephraemi] dates from the fifth century, its text is of less importance than one might assume from its age. It seems to be compounded from all the major text types, agreeing frequently with secondary Alexandrian witnesses but also with those of the later Koine or Byzantine type, which most scholars regard as the least valuable.\\" Reviewer's comment: \\"Note: text type determines importance; yet, importance of witnesses determines valuation of text types. Manuscripts are granted greater weight if they support Alexandrian readings.\\"Page 76. Metzger and Ehrman identify Codex Coislinianus as \\"an important codex of the Pauline Epistles,\\" but don't note any reason for their identification of it as important. They do note that it is \\"Alexandrian,\\" however. Reviewer's comment: \\"Important BECAUSE Alexandrian?\\"Page 77. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Codex Regius is an eighth-century codex of the Gospels, nearly complete....Though badly written by a scribe who committed many ignorant blunders, its type of text is good, agreeing frequently with Codex Vaticanus (B).\\" Reviewer's marginalia: \\"Again, Alexandrian = Good!\\"Page 79. Concerning Codex Purpureus Petropolitanus (77), Metzger and Ehrman write: \\"The text belongs predominantly to the Byzantine type, but it preserves a number of readings of earlier types....\\" Comment: \\"note presumption that non-Byzantine readings are necessarily older ones.\\"Page 80. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Codex Borgianus...is a valuable Greco-Sahidic manuscript of the fifth century....The text is very close to that represented by Codex Vaticanus (B).\\" Comment: \\"Yet again, Alexandrian = 'valuable.'\\"Page 81. Metzger and Ehrman: \\"Codex Monacensis....Though its text is mainly of the Byzantine type, it also contains occasional readings of an earlier type, akin to Alexandrian.\\" Comment; \\"Again, assumes Byzantine reading = late reading.\\"Page 87-8. Metzger and Ehrman note that Manuscript 33, of Alexandrian type, \\"has often been called 'the queen of the cursives.'\\" Reviewer's marginalia asks if this minuscule's royal status owes to its Alexandrian text type.Pages 88, 89, 90. Metzger and Ehrman identify Manuscript 81 as \\"one of the most important of all minuscule manuscripts\\" and note that it \\"agrees frequently with the Alexandrian type\\"; lament that Manuscript 579's Matthew is Byzantine, but rejoice that its other Gospels preserve \\"an extremely good Alexandrian text\\"; make reference to \\"a large number of pre-Byzantine readings, many of them of the Western type of text\\" in Manuscript 614 (thus identifying the Western text type as older than the Byzantine); and note that Manuscript 892 \\"contains many remarkable readings of an early type, belonging chiefly to the Alexandrian text.\\" Reviewer's marginalia: \\"Again: Alexandrian = 'most important'\\"; \\"Again, presumptive Alexandrian supremacy yields positive judgment of manuscript value\\"; \\"[Western type of text] presumed pre-Byzantine\\"; and \\"Again, circular [with a symbol for circularity rather the word 'circular].\\"p.127. Metzger and Ehrman (concerning New Testament quotations by Church fathers): \\"When the manuscripts of a father differ in a given passage, it is usually safest to adopt the one that diverges from the later ecclesiastical text (the Byzantine Text or the Vulgate).\\" Marginalia: an exclamation mark. This idea that what believers (or, the Church) tended most to receive and use, and which thus most multiplied and came to dominance, is most safely assumed AGAINST has never sat well with the reviewer.CLOSING REMARKSGranted, any non-specialist trying to assess text-critical methodologies does so without the \\"implicit knowledge,\\" the practice-acquired inarticulate awareness that may lie behind the assumptions of such expert text-critical practitioners as Metzger and Ehrman (cf. Polanyi's PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE). Though, to the reviewer, Metzger and Ehrman's approach seems in part driven by arbitrary assumptions and even circularities, it may be that Metzger and Ehrman have simply failed to make explicit some expert awareness the reviewer lacks. Of course, some experts in the text-critical field, such as those advocating Majority Text or Byzantine Priority theories, also doubt some of the standard assumptions. (A convenient sampling of a range of views may be found in David Alan Black, ed., RETHINKING NEW TESTAMENT TEXTUAL CRITICISM.) As well, the late Dr. Letis (author, e.g., of THE ECCLESIASTICAL TEXT), often suggested that \\"the quest for the historical text\\" (standard Metzger/Ehrman style textual criticism which, for example, naturalistically ignores what orthodox Christian faith has to say about its own text), leads unavoidably to \\"the quest for the historical Jesus\\" (by which he meant the higher-critical dismantling of the New Testament's message in favor of historical reconstructions at variance with that message). While probably overstated (anyone who corresponded with Dr. Letis prior to his untimely passing, as did this reviewer via email, should confirm the doctor's penchant for overstatement), Letis' suggestion does prove accurate in the case of Bart Ehrman, who followed the lead of his textual criticism right out of the Christian faith. Could it be that this Metzger/Ehrman text works from foundational presuppositions fundamentally at odds with consistently faithful Christian piety, that it in fact depends upon (and teaches to those who read it uncritically) naturalistic attitudes and methods inimical to the Faith (however at ease many believers may currently be with those attitudes and methods)?David M. Hodges21 October 2011"},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"If it already is not required in many seminary/religious studies classes, this book should be required reading.This book does not discuss Higher Criticism, or other Religious Studies methods. It focuses on Textual, or \\"Lower,\\" Criticism - which is the attempt to reconstruct or evaluate and collect the most \\"authentic\\" and accurate bible texts from the thousands of extant and varied manuscripts. This book is an excellent resource for learning this method.The book begins with ancient writing methods and details the physical form of extant manuscripts. From scrolls to codices, method of papyrus/parchment manufacture, and the ways ink were made. At first I wasn't sure if this bit was necessarry, but after reading it, I appreciated why this is not a minor subject. I am particularly interested in the Anthropology of Religion, and this includes material culture and archaeology.From there important manuscripts are discussed. Of the nearly 5,700 manuscripts of part or all of the New Testament, it was explained why the ones selected for this overview were important.If you come from a Christian background that ignores, or doesn't care about, the Church Fathers, (or are an atheist like myself) the end of Chapter 2 explains one reason why it is important to examine what the Church Fathers wrote.First, as is important for my focus on the Anthropology of Religion, it provides cultural information on the development of the Christian religion in temporal and spatial terms. Secondly though, as the book points out, their quotes from the bible within their own works can give you an idea of the form of certain bible passages at a certain known point in time... before many more later variations or variant readings crept in.Chapters 3 and 4 give the reader a brief historical overview of how manuscripts were chosen in the pre-critical and modern critical periods. For the grad student, chapters 5 and 6 discuss the current methods for performing Textual, or \\"Lower,\\" Criticism. It describes the technical nuts-and-bolts of how to find, among the thousands of extant manuscripts, the earliest and/or most \\"authentic\\" ones to use, and how to detect change, evaluate variant readings/passages, and so forth.For the believer, the facts presented in these chapters, as well as in chapter 7, may be hard to grapple with. These chapters discuss how to deal with the shockingly vast array of differences between manuscripts in their readings of any given passage. Chapter 7 discusses the types of errors in biblical manuscripts and how they got there. For instance, some insertions/additions were on purpose and are entirely new stories composed for competing doctrinal reasons (the \\"comma Johanneum\\" in 1 John 5, \\"pericope de adultera\\" in John 7-8, and others, for instance). Others were scribal errors or unintentional omissions, misspellings, etc.Those undaunted by the manipulation (intentional or accidental) of the bible's thousands of extant manuscripts will, at best, realize the compilation of any given modern translation is a large series of compromises. Finding \\"the authentic\\" words of \\"the original\\" is an impossibility. Regardless, after reading this book, one walks away with a huge appreciation for the work of the countless scholars and textual critics who have tried for centuries to get the best distillation of biblical texts.Chapter 8 gives a brief historical overview of how different manuscript types, or families, developed as well as their basic characteristics and geographical distribution. Chapter 9 concludes by displaying a few real life examples of how to perform Textual, or \\"Lower,\\" Criticism.For non-students, or lay persons, this book is still fascinating as it discusses the historical development of the bible. For grad students (like myself soon enough) it is an excellent primer on important techniques you will be using in the field. Also, for scholars, opposing scholarly views are discussed throughout, explaining the strong and weak points of alternate views and why consensus on some techniques/conclusions was reached.For the believer, it is important to know the complicated mess that is the bible in order to deal with these questions in an informed manner. I imagine atheists may read this book, only to find confirmation of their disbelief. For scholars though (both believers and unbelievers), this book is a must have. It is an introduction to your craft."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"Even though Bart Ehrman is by no means a traditional conservative christian (as witnessed by his other books), he and his co-author know their manuscripts.

This is a work that is filled with historical records, intrigue, and interesting facts that will interest anyone who has a desire to understand the goings on behind the scenes of the scriptures as we know them.I found particularly interesting his discussion of the choices that church Fathers made when deciding which texts were genuine and which were not. In one case, Origen had before him manuscripts that covered the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and the murderer who was eventually freed--Barabbas. One manuscript included the Barabbas' first name, which was Jesus. So Barabbas' full name was Jesus Son of the Father (Bar-Son, Abbas-Father). This gives a sharper image of the choice the crowd had before them--between Jesus the Son of God, and Jesus Son of the Father. We know which one the crowd chose, and Origen chose the manuscript with only Barabbas' last name, claiming that no evil-doer could have been named Jesus."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"I have just started studying textual criticism and this book does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the art and science of textual criticism."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"I have been formally engaged in lower criticism of the Greek text for over 3 decades, have published 5 large volumes on the Syriac New Testament and Greek New Testament and still do not fathom the marketing verbiage associated with this, Metzger's standard volume. To state that some great fall from a textual tradition occurred in past textual transmissions is simply without evidence. That Bart Ehrman, the Dan Brown of lower criticism, is now associated with this excellent text is yet another reason to begin abandoning the tome in favor of more objective resources. I suggest going back to B.F. Westcott's History of the Canon... or to FF Bruce. Both far greater scholars than Ehrman. For all its value, Metzger is no longer an objective treatise but is rather based on an a-priori assumption of human need to restore a text that was never lost; an historical and evidentially false premise and unabashed tool for promoting the \\"need\\" for one's own publications.In my undergrad when performing a exhaustive Claremont Profile of variations in the Synoptics, (Using SCE Legg, and all lower textual treastises), I learned from nearly every tradition of text that variations were not historically cyclical, bore no pattern of misguided or mal-intent, nor did they appear to be theologically driven. These things were evident in the peudopigrapha but not in the transmissional text of the NT. Most variants were Atticisms, (in an attempt to produce a refined \\"Greek\\" translational form using Koine as a basis), simple conjugation errors, connective, eyesight errors, (dittography), and common mis-spelling errors. Ehrman's fantastical leaps of textual causes rest solely in his desire to sell greater volumes, but not in fact. That Ehrman is now associated with this text should come as a warning to those of us who respect the objective science of textual analysis. I now say no to this tome until Bart Ehrman is removed from it.

A book that should put to rest all those who say that the New Testament is unreliable witness to Jesus. Read and see the Truth ."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"I could just say that this is a bad book, but it seems better to present some evidence of why, so I took some time to create this review. First, please note that Metzger was a liberal theologian (not a fundamentalist) and Erhman is a self-admitted agnostic. That doesn't mean that everything in the book is wrong, but it does raise a red warning flag. What follows are some of their claims, assumptions and admittances with page numbers so the reader can verify as he/she chooses and get a general idea of what this book presents.1. Pages 183-184: Mezger/Ehrman admits that Westcott/Hort's higher criticism is subjective (not based on observable evidence); Yet, the authors believe it is the best method for determining truth.2. Pages 227-228: The author's proclaim that conjecture must be perfect in order for it to stand as fact. Yet, many of the ideas presented in the book are conjectural without any observable facts to back them up.3. Page 232: The authors claim that methods involving scientific principles are in operation with regard to modern higher textual criticism (this refutes claim number one; or is it the other way around?).4. Page 238: Authors admit to use of circular reasoning in determining original text (by the Alands who are just as much higher critics as Metzger and Ehrman are).5. Page 240: Admittance by authors of the \\"necessity\\" of a humanistic approach to determining the original text (they never mention a preference for being guided by the Holy Spirit within the book).6. Page 245: Pronouncement that analysis cannot determine best texts (what happened to the scientific method idea?).7. Page 254: An admission of omission by scribes (including in their favorite texts - Aleph and B).8. Pages 256-257: An admission of nonsense being written by scribes (including within their favorites).9. Page 258: In a section entitled \\"Errors of Judgment\\" there are a number of assumptions that the authors shift toward the 'fact' department as the book moves forward.10. Page 265: The authors admit that the Vaticanus conflates (the very thing that they accuse the Textus Receptus supporters of doing).11. Page 273: An admission of their belief in the possibility that the original text could have been errant (of course, this is a clear statement that the authors do NOT believe in inerrancy).12. Page 275: An assumption of errors within the text (I agree on this point with regard to the texts that sourced from Alexandria).13. Page 277-278: While this book is well footnoted, it almost never has notes listed for its most outrageous claims. Here the authors claim that the Alexandrian text is the best and yet have no footnote to support that claim and very little verbiage to support said claim and NO evidence. The support for this claim is in their assumptive secondary claim that the \\"...textual witnesses connected to Alexandria attest a high quality of textual transmission from the earliest times...\\" Yet, they previously admitted errors, omissions, nonsense, etc... having come out of Alexandria.14. Page 278: Here the authors admit that Origen is one of the sources and centerpieces of their higher criticism, but offer no evidence to support that other than the assumption from item 13 (above). Methinks they need to read more about how flawed an individual Origen really was. He castrated himself, he didn't believe in the Trinity, he didn't believe in inerrancy and held a number of other untenable theological positions.15. Page 279: The authors suggest (assume) conflation in the Byzantine text, but offer no proof other than \\"...nearly all the critics today...\\" agree on this point. This assumption is a classical logical fallacy.16. Page 300: The authors claim the best criterion for choosing the best text is the \\"common-sense\\" method of choosing \\"the reading that best explains the origin of the others.\\" Of course, the authors make no mention of being guided by the Holy Spirit on this point, so it ends up being an arbitrary choice of the best text.17. Page 304: Admission that textual criticism is at least partially an art (not totally scientific) - it is not scientific at all, but I won't belabor that point.18. Page 306: The reason for discarding the Byzantine witnesses is clarified here (not old enough by their standards). By the way, the reason most are not old enough is because most of the oldest ones were well used by early Christians. Used books fall apart. Unused books do not. I wonder why the Vaticanus and other Alexandrian texts survived in such good condition?19. Page 318 (and from many, many, many other pages): the free use of the words \\"it is easier to believe,\\" \\"probabilities,\\" \\"there is no discernable reason,\\" \\"it is easy to understand,\\" \\"may be historically correct\\" and on and on and on. Unfortunately, most of these assumptions mysteriously become fact somewhere within the pages of this book.20. Page 322: The Vaticanus admitted to be doubly in error.I could list many, many more examples, but I'll stop here. I recommend this book for those who wish to gain an understanding of the arguments in favor of textual criticism. However, I recommend the reader familiarize himself with books that render better arguments in contraposition to Metzger/Erhman's views such as: Which Bible? edited by David Otis Fuller, Which Version is the Bible? by Floyd Nolen Jones, Forever Settled by Jack Moorman, The Causes of Corruption of the New Testament Text by John W. Burgon, and/or Defending the King James Bible by D.A. Waite. I know Christians who think that they understand this argument well, but I can attest that they do not. If you have not read any of these books that I just listed, please take the time to carefully read at least one of them and allow the Holy Spirit to lead. Don't believe your trusted family member, friend or favorite seminary professor. They too may have been deceived on this issue. This is NOT about King James only (those who think that - you know who you are) - its bigger than that. Read Proverbs 9:7-10 and consider those words carefully."},{"Title":"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration","review":"Book was received in perfect condition and in great timing.

Bendis still keeps this line fresh."},{"Title":"Hobgoblin (Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 13)","review":"\\"Ultimate Spider-Man, Volume 13: Hobgoblin\\" collects issues #72-78 of the comic book, which includes the 6-part Hobgoblin storyline and the \\"Dumped\\" coda. The saga begins what we are told is nine months ago, when the radioactive spider bit Peter Parker when his high school class was visiting Oscorp. However, this time we learn an additional detail: Harry Osborn and Mary Jane Watson were dating. Of course, this was before she learned that Peter was Spider-Man and they became a couple. We then jump to \\"today\\" as Spider-Man is doing another thankless good deed. But in the interim a lot has happened. Most recently Carnage killed Gwen Stacy at the Parker's house and Nightmare put Peter through the ringer. Before that Harry witnessed his father as the Green Goblin, trying to coerce Spider-Man to be part of an attack on the White House. Harry was used by Nick Fury and the Ultimates to defeat Osborn and when Peter tried to comfort his friend all Harry has to say is, \\"I'll kill you all.\\"So when Harry shows back up at school, Peter knows this is not good. He warns MJ to stay away from Harry, but wants to know why and he does not want to play that game. As he pointedly reminds her, \\"every time you DON'T listen to me you get thrown off a bridge.\\" The Parkers are moving to a new house in the neighborhood and when Harry shows up Peter becomes the last person to know that he is now dating Harry's girlfriend. We then go back a week to see what happened to Harry before he showed back on the scene, when he was finally released from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and was approached by Mr. Shaw, an associate of Norman Osborn, who restores Harry's repressed memories of his father's life as the Green Goblin and shows him a bunker where the senior Osborn set up a mini-Oscorp. There is everything Harry needs to become a second Green Goblin.The inevitable battle between Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin is problematic for our hero because Harry is not a villain and not his father, but a friend who is hurting. But the story becomes even more tragic because ultimately writer Brian Michael Bendis, penciler Mark Bagley, and inker Scott Hanna coming back to the love triangle that is creating as much tension as Harry's transformation into a movie. When MJ shows up in the middle of the battle she has obviously made a mistake, but not as big as the one that she keeps asking questions when listening would be a better idea. Nick Fury has his own idea of how to deal with Harry as the Hobgoblin, which complicates things as well. Plus, he does not take having his eye patch knocked off of his face well. However his threats seem rather trivial given what Peter has to say to MJ at the end of issue #77.I really like \\"Ultimate Spider-Man,\\" not only because I like the way it plays off of what happened in the original run of \\"The Amazing Spider-Man\\" but also because I really like the web-head as a teenager, more so than I did the first time around with Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Taking the hint from the \\"Spider-Man\\" movie to have Mary Jane be the girl next door from the start is proving to be a masterstroke and knowing that their ending up together is inevitable makes what is happening poignant rather than predictable, as the last page of issue #78 that concludes this trade paperback collection amply proves and does not allow Bendis et al. to run in new directions as the \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" annual #1 that just come out evidences as well. I also think that doing fewer and longer storylines not only makes economic sense in terms of setting up this reprint collections, but also because it allows for considerable more depth than we had in the early 1960s with the revolving supervillains every month. I have not been overly enamored of the other Ultimate titles from Marvel, but then I think they all pale compared to this one, which is as much of a testimony to the inherent popularity of the character as to the talents of the creative forces behind this comic book."},{"Title":"Hobgoblin (Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 13)","review":"Hobgoblin had to be one of my least favorite trades out of the Ultimate Spider-man series. It's not that it's bad in any way, it just didn't bring anything new and enjoyable to the table. I like the overall concept of the series and the written script is fantastic, but there are things within this volume that were hard to digest.First of all (Mild Spoiler) Peter goes on a real verbal rampage with M.J. This is somewhat justified, but he really threw everything he had into her face. If he were to feel some remorse for his actions, it might be more valid, but M.J. just was a huge victim in this book, and it was hard to see her cry.I said it before and I'll say it again. I'm having trouble with the new Goblin concept. I understand it's more realistic to make him a hulk-like villain, but it's really not as interesting. The Goblins are really dumbed down and look silly in some panels. I love the intelligence that the villains bring, after all they can't just be beefy thugs. The Goblins however lack any real personality, much similar to Carnage. If these characters evolve into villains with a better motivation and control, then I would love to see them duke it out. However, the introduction to Hobgoblin is not only forced upon Harry, but it feels like it's forced upon us as readers.Don't get me wrong, nothing jumped out at me throughout this book and disgusted me. In order to realistically criticize something, one must analyze the content for problems within the product. I see this volume as a team-player in the series, but it is in no way a highlight or \\"favorite scene.\\" The second half of the book is very interesting and it bugged me in a good way, if that makes any sense. (It poked and prodded me with a shocking concept that turned out to be very relevant and well-thought).If you love the series, I wouldn't stop you at all from buying the book.

However, volume 11 was... disappointing to say the least, and most of the issues in volume 12 were basically trow-away stories. Luckily, this volume redeems the series, in my opinion.The thing that I really liked about this volume was the great dialogue and character moments. There were just so many great moments between Peter and Harry, Harry and MJ, and especially MJ and Peter. You really care about these characters. Because of this (spoiler) when Peter and MJ break up, it doesn't feel forced, but rather understandable, even though you feel sorry for them and know they should eventually be able to find their way back to each other. Plus Bagley does a great job with facial expressions. Oh, and if what you want is beat-em-up action, that's in here too.

Nick Fury eventually gives him the all clear and Harry re-enters high school which causes all sorts of problems for Peter and MJ's relationship. Harry still is seriously screwed up and is shown by a mysterious figure from his father's past, a secret bunker full of Oz formulas, Globin weaponary and other nasty stuff. Suffice to say Harry eventually transforms into Hobgoblin and dukes it out with Spidey as well as Nick Fury's SHIELD. This story really shows the ulterior motive of SHIELD and causes a lot of internal and emotional conflict for Peter.

Unfortunately it really misses some of the essential spirit of the originals which were much more organic. The series tries to go in directions the original series wouldn't but ultimately it feels like a lot of the superficial memorable elements of the old series are pasted on top and then distorted. The old Peter Parker was never really interested in being cool. He was a nerd and he wanted to be liked, but he was busy with his own issues, he didn't try so hard to fit in. This Peter Parker is a pretty boy wannabe straight off the WB (ahem, CW I guess...). Bendis is a good storyteller but sometimes it seems like he's trying to make his mark more than tell a sincere story.This particular edition misses the mark more than most of the series. It takes the element that the Ultimate Series missed the mark on the most (The Green Goblin) and pastes it onto the character that could have been the chance to get it right, The Hobgoblin. Gone is the mystery that was the genesis for both characters, in it's place is the same overplayed family melodrama that has misunderstood the role of the Osborns in the original Spider-Man books. The Goblins don't have that evil goblin-esque presence that was so great in both of the characters, they've been reduced to second rate Hulk like Gargoyles. And Harry Osborn, the most misunderstood character in the Marvel Universe since the 1990s, has been torn further from the core of what that character originated.Ultimate Hobgoblin had the opportunity to get right what Ultimate Green Goblin missed, but instead it sinks deeper in the same tired interpretation of these characters we've gotten the last fifteen years. It might be surprising to a lot of readers that these interpetations were not always so universal. Both the Goblins and the Osborns deserve different interpretations. I doubt it will ever happen for them again unless they can make a break from each other.The writing is competent, the art is good, but there are better Ultimate Stories than this and there are better Spider-Man stories than anything produced this decade."},{"Title":"Hobgoblin (Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 13)","review":"ultimate spider-man by bendis and bagley is one of the best series out there. not as much action and non-stop bad guy fighting, but a good mix of that and a lot of peter parker being a teenager with problems (girls, bullies, being grounded, etc.) along with his spidey life.the series is great great great. only a few minor things that could be better:1. i don't like how nick fury comes in and tells spider-man he's going to work his whole life for him and shield. the idea of peter being...trapped in a web? haha...well it isn't too cool. superheroes need to fight the good fight because they want to, not because shield will go and take away their superpowers (as fury has threatened) if they don't comply. plus the issues where the ultimates come in aren't that great, the whole series gets hijacked by them and not a lot of spidey. imo, the ultimates are easily the worst part of the ultimate universe. beyond ultimate spider-man and the ultimate fantastic four the ultimate universe isn't too great.2. bendis needs to cut down on the tuchas talk. seriously if parker grew up in nyc today he'd more likely speak spanglish than yanglish.3. geldoff."},{"Title":"Breaking a Horse to Harness: A Step-by-Step Guide","review":"This is a great book for a new person teaching a horse to drive.

When Dad comes to read him a bedtime story, he's all for hearing it giving Dad the bum's rush, but Dad falls asleep, mid-story! The boy and his friends have the party anyway, with Dad right in the middle of the action.The cover image really was a mystery to me. Although it's an image that you'll find right in the middle of the book, it doesn't match the others - even the little boy's hair color is different! That's got nothing on one image inside, though. In the kitchen, Dad is sitting with his head on the table and it looks like one eye is open. Creepy. The images are a little dim (it is nighttime, after all) but they're also hilarious.

The Remedy -- describes it beautifully: why we have the ups and downs of our economy, which cause incredible human misery, and why we have increasing poverty at the same time that there is hugely increasing wealth.And Henry George provides a logical and workable -- even elegant -- remedy, one which will untangle many of the perverse incentives we cope with today: we say we value work, but we tax it. We say we want to promote sales, but we tax them. We say we want to encourage entrepreneurial effort, but we allow huge barriers designed to discourage the person with an idea from being able to execute it. We say we want a society that naturally creates more jobs, but we allow a relative few of us to pocket the funds which would create those jobs. We say we value initiative, but we reward the \\"dog in the manger\\" far more than we reward the laborer. We say that urban blight is a bad thing, but our tax code encourages it. We say we dislike urban sprawl, and long commutes, and low wages -- but we've failed to implement the simple tax reform that will correct these ills. We work longer hours than our counterparts in other countries, and have less to show for it. We allow a relative few to own our airwaves, and resell them at higher and higher prices, collecting advertising revenues from all who would run for public office or advertise their products.If we truly mean to end poverty, to reward initiative, to ensure that the next child born in America is truly the equal of all who are here today, to ensure that our environment is protected for the common good, George's framework for understanding provides the missing puzzle piece.And as we consider what sort of country we'd like Iraq to be, it is worth considering that if we only give them a constitution without giving them an economic system that considers all people equal, truly equal, we've not accomplished much with the American lives we've lost there.If we can figure it out for Iraq, with all its oil wealth, maybe we can figure out how to share America justly among Americans, too.George lays out simply and elegantly what the underlying problem is and how to solve it.He dedicates the book \\"To those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.\\" Might you be among those who see and feel, and would strive, if only you could see the source of the problem?Churchill, Twain, Huxley, Shaw and many others came to see what George was pointing out. Will you?This one is worth your time!Get a copy for yourself, and send one to your favorite legislator, be he/she local, state or federal. Then start looking for other Georgists, also known as Geoists. You'll find them a lively group with a vision that might inspire you, too.

George demonstrates that ownership of land is the key to inequality; along the line he considers and sheds light on a number of other theories. He also makes predictions regarding the general development of the United States that have been very perceptive.At the same time, he isn't afraid to wax poetic. Why shouldn't one? We know why Cain killed Abel--because the farmer requires fencing off land, and calling it his, and his crops will be watered with the blood of his excluded brother. Isn't that where we still are--sacrificing human beings for property? And can we even determine who is in the right and who is in the wrong? George sets out a way of formulating the problem that allows us to get beyond things. It is still worth thinking about, since these problems have grown. And we can't run away from them...as Cain found out all too well. [32]"},{"Title":"Kon-Tiki","review":"If not handled just right it would fall apart. The pages are too small. Hard to read.

It is a short book collection of 17 of the funniest essays that Woody Allen has ever written. I found myself laughing out loud all over the place, and actually finished this book in two brief settings. I generally like to read 1-2 essays a day, but with each one, I wanted more.Death Knocks is one of the essays in this book that really got me going. It was so damn funny. It felt like a funny version of Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal... where the person meant to die will not allow Death to take him. I loved it. A Look at Organized Crime was another absolutely hilarious essay written as you can imagine.Finally The Gossage-Vardebedian Papers has got to be one of the funniest essays ever penned. It is the exchange of letters between two chess players as they try to make sense of a game that they are having through the mail. I'm telling you, my gut was bursting.This is a great place to get started when reading Woody Allen novels. There are no plays contained within as are in his book Without Feathers, but the essays are of a much higher caliber. I know you are going to love this one.

A funny, fast-paced quilt of humorous references and seemingly meaningless non-sequiturs. I find his stuff quite amusing . . . while it's true that his humor might bounce off folks who haven't had enough (or too much) college education, it is a bit unlike anything else out there.There are many good bits here. One that comes to mind is the final story \\"Mr. Big\\" wherein the search for the existence of God is re-cast as a detective noir in the Maltese Falcon tradition."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"A philosophy course teaches oneness, with successful students moving on to twoness. A cook for a band of South American rebels weakens morale serving up an exclusive diet of Gila monster. Hitler's barber contemplates loosening the neck-napkin to allow clippings to fall under his Fuhrer's collar, but \\"my nerve failed me.\\"Even if you don't know these light humor pieces directly, you can figure out the identity of their common author. Oh, yes, there's also a skit about Death playing gin rummy with a would-be victim.\\"Getting Even\\", a 1971 collection of short humor pieces Woody Allen wrote for magazines over the previous five years, captures his transition from nightclub comic to filmmaker. It's very worthwhile for Woody fans, and certainly amusing enough, if in a broad way. But Allen was still a work in progress in 1971, and \\"Getting Even\\" shows him in what today would seem atypical form - straining for laughs rather than brushing them off.Most of the time he is funny, if a bit bitty. A piece on Organized Crime notes criminal activities that include loansharking, hijacking, and \\"the transportation of a large whitefish across the state line for immoral purposes\\". The Hitler story squeezes every possible idea out of the idea of tonsorial services in the Third Reich, from Goring calling dibs on a hobbyhorse to Hess flying to England with Hitler's Vitalis. Names like Freud and Camus come up often, even if a half-imagined rimshot is never far behind.A couple of pieces never get off the ground, such as one involving nasty, stupid rabbis who brain pupils and paint Easter eggs. Here as elsewhere, Allen displays more hostility toward practicing Jews than he does to Nazis, something he didn't grow out of over time. A collection of scholar-annotated laundry lists likewise falls short, while a promising beginning to a \\"Lost Generation\\" memoir devolves into a series of broken-nose gags.Like other reviewers, I was impressed by the final piece, a detective-fiction parody called \\"Mr. Big\\" where a Sam Spade-type finds himself up against a seedy group of philosophers with God in the role of the Maltese Falcon. Less self-consciously smart but just as fun is a Dracula tale where the count mistakes a solar eclipse for sundown and pays the price. Both of them offer not only funny lines, but building comedic momentum and thematic structure the other pieces lack.Woody got a lot better at this very quickly; his next collection, \\"Without Feathers\\", is rightfully regarded as a classic. But \\"Getting Even\\" suffers from the higher expectations the name \\"Woody Allen\\" conjures today.

And if you're concerned because you don't like Woody's whining style in his stand-up and movies, be assured you can't do that in prose.

The others are Without Feathers and Side Effects. Many of the pieces in Getting Even appeared in magazines, mostly The New Yorker, but also Playboy, and Evergreen Review. While others first appeared in this anthology. In total, there are 17 articles in the collection. Considering that they were written over 35 years ago, there are some references that do not come across well today. Yet as a group they are still quite funny.&lt;u>The Metterling Lists&lt;/u> is a piece of satirical literary criticism of &lt;u>The Collected Laundry Lists of Hans Metterling Vol. 1&lt;/u>, a supposedly scholarly work of 437 pages that analyzes the first six laundry lists. Fortunately Mr. Allen only takes seven pages to mock this fictional piece of scholarship.&lt;u>A Look At Organized Crime&lt;/u> provides a very brief history of organized crime in America including the murder of Kid Lipsky by Albert (The Logical Positivist) Corillo who locked Lipsky in a closet and \\"sucked all the air out through a straw.\\" It also provides a description of a Mafia initiation ceremony and ends with some tips on fighting mobsters.&lt;u>The Schmeed Memoirs&lt;/u> are represented as the recollections of Hitler's barber. Yet they can't be taken too seriously because he claims he didn't know Hitler was a Nazi and thought he worked for the phone company. There is a funny where Hitler fears that Chruchill will grow sideburns before he can. It is humorous to view World War II from the perspective of Hitler's hair.&lt;u>My Philosophy&lt;/u> consists of the Critique of Pure Dread, the Eschatological Dialectics As a Means of Coping with Shingles, and The Cosmos on Five Dollars a Day. It ends with two Parables and a short list of Aphorisms.&lt;u>Yes, But Can The Steam Engine Do This?&lt;/u> provides a humorous take on the scientific research saga with a history of the Earl of Sandwich's research into developing the sandwich. Starting with his birth in 1718, the tale is filled with bread experiments, research into cold cuts and cheeses, and years of failures followed by his final success and lasting fame.&lt;u>Death Knocks&lt;/u> is a short play in which an inexperienced angel of death, who comes to claim Nat Ackerman's soul, is lured into a losing game of gin rummy and returns empty-handed.&lt;u>Spring Bulletin&lt;/u> is Woody Allen's satirical take on college course descriptions. It includes a course called Introduction to God which is described as \\"Confrontation with the Creator of the universe through informal lectures and field trips.\\"The next piece, a guide to the interpretation of Hassidic tales, includes tales like the following and Mr. Allen's interpretations of them.A man journeyed to Chelm to seek the advice of Rabbi Ben Kaddish.\\"Rabbi \\" the man asked, \\"where can I find peace?\\"The Hassid surveyed him and said, \\"Quick, look behind you!\\"The man turned around, and Rabbi Ben Kaddish smashed him in the back of the head with a candlestick. \\"Is that peaceful enough for you?\\" he chuckled.There are six other tales and their interpretations in this piece.&lt;u>The Gossage-Varbedian Papers&lt;/u> tells the sad story of a chess game played at a distance via letters. The correspondence starts out with a missive from Gossage stating that one of his letters must have gotten lost in the mail since his chess board is set up differently than Verbedian's. The insults and the confusion worsen as the letters go back and forth. A must for any chess fan.&lt;u>Notes From The Overfed&lt;/u>, Mr. Allen claims, was inspired by reading Dostoyevski and a Weight Watchers magazine on an airplane trip. In it an Atheist is converted when he decides that, if God is everywhere, He must be in food. Then consuming everything in sight, he achieves sanctity and obesity through compulsive eating.&lt;u>A Twenties Memory&lt;/u> mocks the name-dropping memoirs of the post-war lost generation. Filled with references to Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Earnest Hemingway, Alice B. Toklas, and many others, a non-entity tries to gain fame by the shared light of his famous contemporaries.In &lt;u>Count Dracula&lt;/u> the famous vampire wakes up early due to confusion caused by a solar eclipse, and visits the baker and his wife for what he thinks is an evening snack with disastrous consequences.In &lt;u>A Little Louder, Please&lt;/u> a true afficionato of the arts confesses his one failing - an inability to understand the gestures of mimes.&lt;u>Conversations With Helmholtz&lt;/u> consists of notes taken by the student of a famous elderly psychoanalyst of their conversations together. Senility has certainly gotten the better of the older man, but his reputation and fame keep the younger man from realizing this with humorous results.&lt;u>Viva Vargas&lt;/u> is subtitled Excepts From The Diary of A Revolutionary, and reveals much of the same humor that the author later used in the movie Bananas.&lt;u>The Discovery And Use of The Fake Ink Blot&lt;/u> provides a humorous social history of a device used in practical jokes.The last story in the volume, &lt;u>Mr. Big&lt;/u>, is my favorite. It is narrated by a Philip Marlowesque detective who is hired by a lovely woman claiming to be a Vassar student. She wants him to find a missing person, God. The mixture of Raymond Chandler's format with the existential search for the meaning of life is extremely funny even after the passage of many years.All in all, if you like the early Woody Allen movies, you will love this book - even though some of the material is no longer as fresh."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"Reading this is like participating in Allen's creative process since many of the short sketches here are reminiscent of scenes from Allen's earlier films. Very funny stuff that had me laughing out loud. However it's best to read this and imagine Woody Allen's voice is telling the stories, it makes them even funnier. Not all of the sketches work as well as others but when he's on the sketches are hysterical. A very short collection of Woody Allen shorts."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"For someone with no exposure to Woody's prose, this was a revelation. What a smart writer he is! He manages to find a unique voice, and with this voice he beats his own obsessions to a pulp, until they stand up and say 'Uncle'.Woody gets even with literary biographies, crime, philosophy (and philosophy and more philosophy), death, religion, intellectualism, political revolutions, psychology, and of course, mimes.My favourite piece is the last one: 'Mr. Big'. It's a brilliant Raymond Chandler parody, where the blonde bombshell who comes into the private eye's life is not looking for a missing husband, but proof of the existence of God! Ingenious! There's one passage where the detective deduces that since Socrates killed himself, Jesus was murdered, and Neitzche went crazy, then there is someone out there and He doesn't want to be found.Woody tends to fall back on absurdity for his humour a tad too often (at one point, someone's forehead falls off), and if the collection was any longer it would have gotten tedious. But it's just long enough. Bite sized and tasty."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"Even for people who do not like Woody Allen's movies, his satiric books must give a great laugh!This man is so intelligent that he allows himself to un-taboo'ize just about everything.

He ended 50s as one of the horses in an amazing stable of writers on \\"Your Show of Shows\\" that included Mel Brooks, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, and Carl Reiner. Showcasing his patented wry humor, the stories in \\"Getting Even\\" have the post-vaudevillian variety show feel to them. He lampoons intellectual, philosophical and psychological traditions and especially enjoys exploiting the old Jewish stereotypes. Each story is fast paced and peppered with one-liners and guarantees at least one good chuckle. An entertaining book that is rife with painfully accurate insights into the absurdities of our everyday life."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"According to the aliens inStardust Memoriesthis is exactly what we need. This is the first collection of Woody's pieces for the New Yorker magazine, from 1966-1971. For me, this was the first truly inspired, laugh out loud funny collection of writings I had ever read. It was a revelation to me as to just how funny the written word could be. This book sets up the framework for the brilliantly funnyWithout FeathersandSide Effects. I recently re-read all three books and was astounded to discover just how timeless they are -- each book displaying Woody's tremendous talent as a writer and his unsurpassed imagination. This book led the way for every great comedic writer working today, from Steve Martin to Jon Stewart to Demetri Martin. I cannot recommend this book high enough."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"I've owned copies of this book several times and loaned it to people whom I think will like it, but I never get it back.

It is the usually quick-witted and quercky early Woody Allen most people know and appreciate. It is a collection of short stories, unrelated in topic. He loves absurd references and off the wall comparisions and they make for a few laugh out loud moments. I recommend this book to anyone who likes off-the-wall writing and comedy with some intellectualism thrown in to the mix. This is early Allen, written before many of his biggest movies came out also."},{"Title":"Getting Even","review":"This is a first collection of Woody Allen's early articles that appeared in various New York publications in the 1960's. They are hit and miss, but mostly hits. A Woody Allen movie fan will recognize his parodies of intellectual pretension and his continuing obsessions with death, metaphysics, and religion.Allen is a master of parody. The pseudo-intellectual silliness in the review of \\"The Metterling Lists\\" and the life of the Earl of Sandwich in \\"Yes, But Can the Steam Engine Do This?\\" are laugh-out-loud hysterical. \\"Conversations with Hemholz\\" is a lesser light about one of the alleged founders of psychoanalysis and the petty rivalries that tickle the funny bone. \\"Schmeed's Memoirs\\" about the top Nazi barber is a miss.The \\"Hassidic Tales\\" are also top-rate Allen on display. The interpretations of rabbinical misfits by his \\"noted scholar\\" are wonderfully absurd justifications for equally absurd behavior. His \\"Death Knocks\\" is a weak first encounter with one of his most famous and laughable fears.The other pieces in the collection from chess-by-mail to encounters with Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas all have their moments. One can foresee the germination of \\"Bananas\\" in \\"Viva Vargas\\" and \\"Play it Again, Sam\\" in \\"Mr. Big.\\" Curiously, in this volume sex takes a holiday since there are no pieces on his second greatest obsession next to death.If you are an Allen fan this small volume is well worth buying at the price for which it is now selling. Since it is a collection of separate pieces you also have the luxury of reading each in any order at any time. I enjoyed reading early Woody, not only for the laughs but also for a view of the potential that would make him a legend later."},{"Title":"The Cherokees","review":"As an Okie with Cherokee heritage, I couldn't resist the temptation to explore the book after reading the teaser that was provided with the title.

Certainly, this book is not (and could never be) a substitute for reading and examining the Church Fathers and their considerations on Scripture. However, if one uses this work more for quick reference and leads, it can be most helpful. After all, the sheer volume of the Fathers' works prevents even the most learned patristics scholar from remembering who commented on what verse. As an example, I have used this volume to quickly find some comments on the verse regarding rendering unto Caesar what is Caesar's - seeing some of the comments listed, I then went to the source and read the Fathers' comments in context. This volume, then, is a tool (perhaps a shortcut) to find certain texts that may be of use.Is this volume comprehensive? No. But, even in its current state, it is over 200 pages (when the Gospel of Mark, in the New American version, is about 35 pages) - trying to collect all the commentary by the Fathers would extend the length much more. As such, it is a starting point, useful for quick reference. It should not be held to a higher standard than that."},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","review":"This first book in a series of commentary on the scriptures is highly recommended. Many modern commentaries are concerned with historical background, sources, etc., which are useful in their way, but once you get past that and want to just dwell on what it means spiritually, this is a great way to do it. This book includes the text of the gospel of Mark in short sections, so you don't have to flip back and forth between the book and a copy of the Bible, but can just stay with one book. Underneath each section, the commentary proceeds verse by verse with selections from different early Christian writers. This structure makes the book easy to use in slow, meditative reading of both the Bible text and the commentary on it, so you can dwell on it a verse or two at a time, or you can go at a faster pace if you wish to. And while it's very good for devotional reading, it is not sugary or overly sentimental, as some modern devotional writing can be sometimes. It's just good, solid stuff from intellectual and spiritual giants who had pondered the meaning of the scriptures for a long time before they put their thoughts on paper. Some years ago, I had occasion to see a Jewish commentary on the first five books of the Bible that included sections of quotations from ancient Jewish rabbis commenting on the meaning of the passages. I remember thinking at the time that I wished Christians could have a commentary like that too, using ancient Christian writings. So it's wonderful to see this first volume and I'm looking forward to getting others in the series."},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","review":"The ACCS is a unique achievement in the world of biblical scholarship. In an age in which legitimate scholarly commentaries seem to be limited to the &quot;current&quot; and &quot;relevant,&quot; the ACCS reaches back to the roots of not just biblical scholarship, but biblical piety, and it is there where it makes its mark. With the ACCS, we read of the role of scripture in the lives of faith of great men such as Augustine and Chrysostom, and we thus come to realize that any &quot;scholarship&quot; done on the bible in their day was done out of faith. Anyone current in modern biblical scholarship can see how this is a far cry from the detached scholarship coming out of so many seminaries and graduate schools today. As a catechetical tool for parish religious education programs, the ACCS comes highly recommended as a means by which the believer can come into contact with the Christian past. However, the merits of the ACCS stop here, in the face of more than a few criticisms and obstacles which it ignores.First of all, the commentary on Mark, and I might suspect the whole series, over-simplifies the Christianity which it seeks to present, giving the impression that the &quot;Patristic period&quot; was a time of consensual thinking void of serious conflict. Often, certain passages of Mark will be commented upon by church fathers who did not even consider each other as &quot;orthodox&quot; (a loaded term in need of qualifying), or who were only considered by many to be orthodox in their own time, or only years after their deaths.The less critical reader may come away with the idea that patristic theology was a school of thought not unlike reformed or existential theology, which we know is not the case. By offering examples from third century fathers like Origen (deemed a heretic after his death and hardly an example of &quot;consensual thinking&quot;), fifth century fathers like Augustine, and eighth century fathers like John of Damascus, there is a tendency toward anachronism in the ACCS, which can only paint an artificial picture of ancient Christianity, a picture which seeks to ignore (and I would wonder why) the diversity and conflict so common in the church during late antiquity. Also, given the method by which certain texts of the fathers were chosen (and not chosen) for the ACCS, I would wonder at the criteria: do we only hear from the texts of the fathers which agree with the agenda of the editors, or do we really get a full picture of the ancient church?Second, I would question the editors' choice of sources, of examples which are supposed to serve as representative of patristic thought. Many of the sources cited were not even biblical commentaries, and thus any examples of what a church father said about a biblical passage runs the risk of being taken out of context in the ACCS. More often, the writings which the ACCS editors present as a father's comments on a biblical passage were from mere letters, or treatises on topics other than the particular biblical passage at hand. Usually, when a father did quote scripture in such non-biblically focused works (such as catechetical lectures, apologetics, etc.), his goal was to proof-text from scripture in order to make a point, his goal was certainly not scripture commentary. However, in presenting such passages out of context as if they were solely commentaries on scripture, the ACCS again paints an artificial picture of ancient Christianity. You would think that the doctoral students who worked on this project with Professor Oden would know better.Finally, I would question which biblical manuscripts the fathers were commenting upon when they wrote the works which serve as the sources for the ACCS. As Professor Oden should know, there was no single Greek (or Latin, or Syriac, etc.) manuscript of the New Testament in the age of the fathers which could have served as the only basis for commenting upon scripture (consider here the codex vaticanus, sinaiticus, etc.). However, in presenting all the varied comments by the fathers on these passages of Mark, giving only the English RSV as a referent, the reader again gets the false impression of a mushy &quot;consensuality&quot; among those who only later came to be called fathers of the church, a &quot;consensuality&quot; which is supposed to span centuries as well as cultural/linguistic/geographic boundaries.The questions the ACCS does not answer are how we are to reconcile the disparity among the manuscripts of the NT used by the fathers, and the basis upon which can we use a ready-made English translation whose underlying Greek text was quite unlike that used by the men whose comments are employed in the ACCS. These ultimately come down to a question of method. These questions are not answered because (conveniently perhaps?) they are not addressed, but shouldn't they be, in the spirit of scholarly inquiry? It is this lack of variant readings and clear articulation of method which, I feel, calls the &quot;scholarly&quot; legitimacy of this work into question.In conclusion, I would have to add that it is the perspective of the reader which will determine the usefulness of the ACCS. If one's goal is merely to refer to what some of the fathers said about a passages of scripture, in order to find a link between the church's past and present, then the ACCS is a fine reference. However, if one's goal is to probe the methodology and presuppositions behind what has come to be known as patristic exegesis, the ACCS can only serve as a convenient starting point for one unfamiliar with other sources on the subject. Even in that case, the usefulness of the ACCS cannot be expected to last long for those with the deeper questions."},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","review":". . .of an amazing series of commentaries.This commentary on Mark's Gospel, from the perspective of the Fathers of the Church is a long-awaited and much needed reference for Christians eager to explore the Scriptures as they were seen by those who used them in the earliest days of the Christian faith. If the rest of the series lives up to the standard of &quot;Mark&quot;, we have a lot to look forward to.Only in the &quot;Computer Age&quot; could such a project be feasibly undertaken. Kudos to Oden and company for their effort.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","review":"Mark (The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture)The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture is a unique commentary series. Scholars and computer technology comb the writings of ancient Christian writers on particular books of the Bible. It is considered to be an ecumenical project with general editor Thomas C. Oden. This series, which receives high praise from J.I. Packer, Richard J. Neuhaus and Bruce M. Metzger, is an attempt to bring awareness and understanding to Christians concerning ancient beliefs.Scholars familiar with ancient Christian writings offer hand-selected portions of these texts. I recently received my review copy on The Gospel of Mark, free of charge, from InterVarsity Press. There are 284 pages. Besides the commentary there is an introduction to Mark, biographical sketches, timeline on the writers of the patristic period, an index of contributing ancient authors as well as an appendix: Method of Investigation into the Early Exegesis of Mark.Oden and company suggest that \\"the early church widely regarded the author of Mark's Gospel as the authentic voice and interpreter of Peter.\\" (pg. xxi) The earliest ancient writing confirming Markan authorship is Papias (AD 60-130). Eusebius and Jerome would both agree to Markan Authorship.Eusebius records this account and says \\"But now we must add to the words of [Papias] which we have already quoted the tradition which he gives in regard to Mark.\\" (pg. xxi). Africa, Asia and throughout the northern Mediterranean have several Christian texts quoting the Gospel of Mark from early times. The view that Matthew and Luke share literary dependency on the writings of Mark is an idea that did not develop in full form until around the nineteenth century. Oden and Co. also suggest that Markan priority is debatable since \\"there are notable proponents of the dependence of Mark on Matthew.\\" (pg. xxix)This commentary purposely omits addressing the textual issues surround the long or shorter ending of Mark. Instead, it simply gives the citations of ancient writers in order to determine how they interpreted this text. Scholars such as Maurice Robinson argue for the longer ending while Daniel Wallace argues against.The Apostolic Constitutions, a fourth century writing, quotes vss. 17-18 in their entirety. They suggest, \\"these gifts were first bestowed on us the Apostles when we were about to preach the gospel to every creature. Later they of necessity were afforded to others who had by the apostles come to believe. It is clear that these gifts were not given for the advantage of those who perform them, but for the conviction of unbelievers, that those whom the word did not persuade, the power of signs might put to shame.\\" (pg. 239)This commentary set can be appreciated by the layperson and the careful academic alike."},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","review":"It is in very good shape and has lots of information about how the Church Fathers perceive/interpret the verses and chapters of Scriptures. God Bless! Thanks! Fr. Chris"},{"Title":"Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, New Testament II: Mark (Vol 2)","review":"Hmmmm.... J.I. Packer, Thomas Oden, and Timothy George giving &quot;advance praise.&quot; My first question, after seeing that Intervarsity Press was the publisher of this series, was, &quot;What are conservative evangelicals doing reading the Fathers?&quot; After perusing the Mark commentary, I can see that they haven't, at least in any diverse way. The idea that the &quot;Fathers&quot; were a monolithic entity who were in agreement on &quot;exegesis&quot; runs throughout this book, as well as the Romans volume. Any trained exgete will know that this is madness--there has only been one period in the church when views and scholarship were more multifarious than the present age: the Patristic period!The particular sort of scholarship as well as the conservative (read: unrepresentative of biblical scholarship as a whole) intent of the series is indicated in a cover blurb from Richard John Neuhaus (NOT a conservative evangelical). Can you detect the ideological underpinnings of the ACCS from this perjorative sentence?: &quot;In the desert of biblical scholarship that tries to deconstruct or get behind the texts, the patristic commentators let the pure, clear waters of Christian faith flow from its scriptural source.&quot; Goodness, is that really what is going on in the ACCS? Which Fathers, may I ask--Origen? Universally ignored or maligned in conservative seminaries (the largest of which in the world I am a product), Origen is one of the few really interesting voices in the ACCS, but only his least &quot;dangerous&quot; commentary is allowed in the series, it seems. Same for the Cappadocians, and many others. In any event, it is no &quot;commentary&quot; at all--which manuscripts were being commented on? Were these all from exegetical works, or were the exerpts from the Fathers taken from letters, sermons (polemics) and such? Why these comments, and not others? Is this ALL the Fathers had to say on the issues? Certainly, only a selection could be presented, but again, why these comments arranged in this way? A possible answer: these support the readings of the biblical texts the editors wanted to promulgate.Sadly, these questions go unanswered, I am afraid. None of the diversity and dissent of the first centuries of the faith shine through in this volume, and that is what is needed in any deeper reading of the Fathers. Early Christian writings can indeed shake up our complacent scholarship and our spiritually devoid lives, but not if they are packaged in such a mundane way. Ideologically-driven scholarship is immediately suspect. I predict that this laborious project will gather dust on the library shelves of mainstream centers of scholarship and seminaries, if they bother to spend budgeted money on it at all after the IPOs hit the bookstores of the world, blaze for a while (nice, slick covers on these volumes), and fade away.In all, avoid the steep price for these books, unless you want high-dollar Sunday School literature. And it's too bad, too--this is a great idea for a commentary set. Maybe Doubleday ought to take over the idea from IVP; they gave us the Anchor Bible series and dictionaries. Now THAT would be something to be reckoned with.Next."},{"Title":"Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Diverticulitis: A Self-Help Plan","review":"Except for the title, you cannot find any reference to Diverticulosis in this book. Otherwise, it is a useful book."},{"Title":"Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Diverticulitis: A Self-Help Plan","review":"I was diagnosed with IBS many years ago when I was having three or more episodes each week. My life was unmanageable with it; I couldn't leave the house because I'd be fine one minute, and in a cold sweat and excruciating pain ten minutes later. Often, there was no warning.My condition had built up slowly, over a period of about five years. Initially, doctors thought that it was a food allergy. In time, they realized that I had a chronic condition--probably IBS but possibly diverticulitis or something related--but their advice involved an extreme (and unrealistic) limited diet and painkillers that knocked me out for nearly a day. Their advice seemed like a band aid, not a cure or even a workable solution.I was becoming an anxious recluse, afraid to leave the house or schedule anything important. The pain was beyond anything I'd experienced, except in childbirth.I bought this book out of desperation, and started applying some of the dozens of helpful tips right away. Most worked, but a few didn't. (They didn't make it worse, they just didn't help.)Gradually, I narrowed my focus to three or four recommendations that helped the most, and I used them every time. (For me, enteric-coated peppermint oil capsules are vital at the earliest symptoms. I learned about those readily available capsules in this book.)My IBS episodes became shorter. They \\"aftershocks\\" (lesser episodes that followed a major IBS attack) were gentler and smaller in number. In time, they stopped altogether.It's been over four years since my last full-blown IBS episode. During those years, I've had three minor incidents, but nothing that kept me in bed for a full day afterwards.This book is the single most important reason why I was able to resume a relatively normal lifestyle after being pretty much housebound for close to a year. Years later, I can barely remember how awful life was when I constant worried about an IBS episode interrupting everything from professional meetings and my kids' school picnics, to grocery shopping.My doctors were amazed and impressed at my improvement, and time has proved that my condition is stable now.Some doctors estimate that IBS and related issues are second only to the common cold as reasons why people call in sick at work. Whether or not that's true, I was amazed when I started admitting that I have IBS. Close to half of my friends confessed that they suffered from IBS episodes as well.Without exception, everyone I've talked with who has IBS--including my mother--has used this book with rave results. Many of them have referred other people to this book, too.This book changed my life for the better."},{"Title":"Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Diverticulitis: A Self-Help Plan","review":"I have found that the information in this book has helped me more than anything I have tried in the past 12 years...

I have read a lot of Russian history, including very academic works, and I found this biography a real chore to read and understand. Unless you have a very good background in Russian history, I would not recommend this biography."},{"Title":"Ivan the Terrible","review":"There are some people that you can read about again and again: Henry VIII; Mary, Queen of Scots; Elizabeth I; Richard III; Leonardo da Vinci, Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart. Ivan the Terrible is one of these fascinating characters.Author Isabel de Madariaga has written an energetic new biography of Ivan IV. All your favorite Ivan stories are here: how he snapped after the death of his first wife, how he created the group that evolved into the KGB, how he killed his own son. But wait, there's more!De Madariaga raises a question I haven't read anywhere else - that Ivan may have been influenced by the tale of Vlad Tepes Dracul, a Wallachian ruler who inspired the tale of Dracula. She details how Ivan very likely was familiar with the story. In fact, she finds evidence that Ivan would have read (or had heard - we don't actually know if he was literate) a version of Vlad the Impaler that excused his cruelty as being for the sake of his subjects.In any case, Ivan certainly was terrible, although he was called that not for his behavior, but for his position as ruler of all of Russia. \\"Terrible\\" in this case meant \\"awe-inspiring\\" rather than cruel. As it happened though, the name fits no matter how you look at it."},{"Title":"Ivan the Terrible","review":"De Madariaga presents the reader with an intriguing interpretation of the life of Ivan IV. The material found in this book isn't going to turn the historical community on its head (there is no new archival research here), but this is nevertheless a very thoroughly researched undertaking.The author does an admirable job of trying to establish the facts surrounding an individual who not only lived in a time when written records were generally scarce, but who actively attempted to obscure the truth and rewrite history in the Chronicles. What the reader is left with is what is generally a balanced assessment of Ivan IV. This is, to say the least, quite an accomplishment, given the centuries of exaggerations, lies, and ideological embellishment, that stretches from the contemporary European propaganda to Russian Imperial historians to their Soviet successors. Thus, we not only see the man who arrests, tortures, kills and destroys, but a person intensely devoted to the Orthodox faith (as insanely paradoxical as they come). Moreover, what de Madariaga continually does is remind the reader of the context of Ivan's world and his peers; in many ways, despite what period writings may say or our modern value systems may despise, Ivan fit in quite well with the rulers of his day.Nevertheless, as is most evident in the concluding chapter, de Madariaga is not an Ivan apologist. Ultimately, she finds Ivan to have been a disaster in every sense of the word. He may have significantly expanded Russian lands, but at the price of the wholesale destruction of his original dominion. By the time he died, he had driven the economy into the ground, absolutely obliterated a once thriving agricultural sector, dealt a heavy blow to the aristocracy, killed the only viable heir to the throne, achieved nothing in the diplomatic arena (except to alienate all those around him), and made a significant dent in the Russian population (and this is to only speak of the material aspect of the population, to say nothing of the hideous moral aspects). And to this end, de Madariaga justly credits him with the responsibility for the ensuing years of turmoil experienced in the Time of Troubles.De Madariaga succeeds in producing a piece that is certainly academic in its demeanor, but for the most part, accessible to the lay reader. The language can get a bit dry (and obscure: tergiversation? contumely? quondam?) and there are occasions where the book drags a bit, but ultimately its worth reading. A few final minor gripes. There are points where de Madariaga goes a bit off course. On a few occasions, she addresses the literacy, or lack thereof, of Ivan. Her argument is, and I am not overly simplifying this: other scholars can't prove that he was illiterate, and learning to read isn't really that hard, so we should assume he was literate! The fact of the matter is, there is no way of telling; this however is irrelevant in the broader picture. Simply stating that his literacy is in question and then moving on to point out that this was an individual who was certainly intelligent and educated (someone who knew a great deal about a wide range of religious and classical works) would have been preferable. Finally, there is one other fault with the book, though this is on the supplementary material. The maps are inadequate, randomly spaced throughout the book, and in one instance downright awful (I'm hoping this is a printing error; the sea is the same color the land?!?!). It would certainly be helpful if another map, showing the change of the borders during Ivan's reign, was provided, as well as a rudimentary family tree.With all this being said, none of these shortcomings should dissuade an individual interested in pre-Petrine history, Ivan IV, or even the casual reader if he is so inclined, from reading this book."},{"Title":"Ivan the Terrible","review":"Don't pick up this volume with the hope of entertaining reading.

There are a lot of names tossed around, but rarely is a name discussed that is without 1) a prior description earlier in the text, and/or 2) a context in the discussion itself to help you appreciate the relevance of the person.I also chose Madariaga's because every other book was reviewed as being inadequate academically speaking."},{"Title":"Ivan the Terrible","review":"I was very enthusiastic about getting to this book.

Both Dean Montalbano and Suzanne La Cour are brilliant writers and make for a very easy and thoughtful read."},{"Title":"The Ogham and The Universal Truth Of The Trees- As Above, So Below","review":"The Ogham and The Universal Truth of the TreesBy Carolee RossOne of the pitfalls of being a professional writer is that my reading standards are exceedingly high and often, overly critical. Recently, I learned of a book titled \\"The Ogham and the Universal Truth of the Trees\\" that is fascinating and truly \\"reader-friendly.\\"If you are a lover of ancient history, nature, the mysterious origins of communication and Druidic lore, don't miss this book. While most esoteric books are dry, difficult to comprehend and somewhat pedantic, \\"The Ogham and the Universal Truth of the Trees\\" soars above the rest. It is a rare and beautifully written book that combines myth with published fact and a plethora of extensive research with lyrical poetry, both in the written words and in quoted poems.Authors Suzanne La Cour and Dean Montalbano are well versed in metaphysical matters and the magic of unseen realms. Their love for the subject is noted again and again, as they describe the \\"door between the Realms\\" and the individual and collaborative journeys it took to write the book.The writers begin with definitions and terms, a sort of metaphysical primer, so that readers unfamiliar with many of the terms are given a foundation for the rest of the book. Terms such as \\"acme,\\" \\"fifths\\" and forfedha\\" are explained with brevity and clarity.The authors continue by each describing their Oghamic experiences. These are journeys that speak of bliss, beauty and energy and readers cannot help but being drawn in by the authors' retelling of the inspiration for the book. The book was obviously written by two authors with different views, yet the contrast and diversity makes for a fully-developed and interesting text.Trees are listed by order of the Ogham and phonetic pronunciations are included for those unfamiliar with ancient words. We are introduced to the trees by the lovely expression, \\"A Clover Laughed,\\" bringing us into the beginnings of time and pre-time. An unforgettable passage by Mr. Montalbano follows:\\"Light of thought shimmered around - it swirled and collected into tall vertical clusters. Thousands of unseen, unfelt voices collected and intoned silent melodies as the light took form. When Light-Thought had become Solid-Thought the first of the Great Ones had appeared.\\"The book continues with the various cycles during which the Trees appeared, from Cycle One, \\"A Clover Laughed,\\" through many more, such as \\"A Journey Moonward and \\"A Vision.\\" The authors lead us through several more cycles concluding with The Final Cycle, \\"What End is This?\\"From the Birch tree (or Beithe) and the Rowan (Luis) through the Oak or (Duir), each tree is described through other known names, magical associations, medicinal/cosmetic use and how they are used in divination. Legends are shared and often, poetry associated with a particular tree is quoted. We learn that the Druids considered the writing of SACRED work - their beliefs, magical practices, etc., profane. They did not use Ogham script for writing because it was considered sacred. It is believed that the \\"Finger Ogham\\" was used to communicate secretly when among outsiders.Lessons in using the Ogham in divination, provided by Mr. Montalbano, are explored and for readers who want further study, an extensive bibliography is included at the end of the book. Throughout, the illustrations of Sandy Starr add to the overall splendor of the book.Of particular interest are Suzanne LaCour's \\"additional thoughts\\" about the Ogham and the trees. It is yet another touch that adds a feeling of sincerity and friendship for the students nourished by the words of the authors. One of my favorite passages occurs when Ms. LaCour describes the ancient Yew she comes upon in Ireland:\\"I cannot even begin to describe it. The trunk was fairly pale in color and I could not have gotten my arms around it no matter how hard I tried. The trunk looked like it was made up of vertically placed, incredibly thick ropes (which may have been multiple trunks), the foliage was very dark and the roots were enormous. I don't even know how tall the tree was, I was so impressed by the sheer girth of it and the energy emanating from it. I had never been in the presence of such a Tree as this before.\\"The writers are gifted teachers who were born to nourish others with the mysterious knowledge of the world not seen with the eyes, but experienced with the heart. The collaborative team of La Cour, who is an expert in \\"The Realms of Faerie\\" and Montalbano, who wrote The Myth Cycles, makes for a tome to be treasured. As the authors advise, \\"Plant a Tree!\\""},{"Title":"The Ogham and The Universal Truth Of The Trees- As Above, So Below","review":"I have several books on the ogham and trees, including how to connect with the spirits of various plants and trees (whose pace is so different from our own human one). It is clear that the authors have spent much quality time with the trees they write about and the tone of the book is intimate so I feel almost like the authors are friends sharing their interesting stories and their wisdom. It also includes a chapter on each tree in the ogham as well as fresh insights and some interesting history that I was unaware of. I am really enjoying this delightful large-format book, learning much, and slowing down to converse with these lovely green beings! Thank you!"},{"Title":"Is Japan creating a yen bloc in East Asia and the Pacific?

Documentary filmmaker and psychologist Cohen unearths data that is non pareil in the Diana assassination genre. I dog-earred and highlighted nuggets on every other page.

Prince Charles was in close proximity (literally) to Temple founder Jo di Mambro on several occasions.Cohen spent many years in France and is conversant with many of the shadowy players who figure prominently in both hits.

Phelps restores the desire for revenge to a natural place within the human psyche. But then she explores alternatives to violence as ways of accommodating this basic human need. She is remarkably adept at exploring storytelling as a means of satisfying the need for revenge, particularly in relationship to social justice. Her range of reference in these arguments is amazing. Relying on history, psychology, philosophy, and literature, she creates a very rich read, full of ideas and insights. You keep stopping to rethink things you thought you already knew.If you think there's no reason for hope because of all the violence in the world, give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Shattered Voices: Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions (Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights)","review":"Phelps skillful conflation of an international history, philosophy, law, and literature persuasively argues that truth commissions contribute to personal and public healing and resist the cycle of retributive vengeance. Shattered Voices should be read by all who fear the consequences of existing hostilities in Bosnia, Iraq, and Sudan as well as those who consider language and storytelling as markers of civilization and essential to justice."},{"Title":"Shattered Voices: Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions (Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights)","review":"Drawing from Ariel Dorfman's play, \\"The Death and the Maiden\\", Phelps studies the value for victims of human rights violations of their lost voice, and of thier right to know the truth about the crimes suffered. She studies how those ideas had been made concrete by the work of four early truth commissions (Argentina, Chile, South Africa and El Salvador), in what could be seen as an early development of what has come to be known as the right to truth, recognized now by several UN documents and the UN Convention for the Protection of all persons from Enforced Disappearances. The book provides interesting conclusions about how to provide adequate opportunities for victims to exercise this right and for transitional justice policies to recognize it. As it was published in 2004, unfortunately, the book doesn't include how these ideas had been followed by later truth commissions that made great efforts in these areas, as Guatemala, Timor-Leste, Peru or Sierra Leone. An update including these experiences will be welcomed."},{"Title":"Shattered Voices: Language, Violence, and the Work of Truth Commissions (Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights)","review":"It is interesting but very intellectual and difficult to read.

It wanders all over the place."},{"Title":"Beginning Direct3D Game Programming, Second Edition (Premier Press Game Development)","review":"I've been waiting a long time for a book like this. I'm a Unix software developer by profession, but only a hobbyist when it comes to PC game programming. Back in the good old days, before Windows and DirectX/DirectWhatever, it was possible for us casual programmers to keep up with the technology and have fun experimenting with graphics and game programming. I simply lost interest when the complexity of the operating system and video hardware started getting in the way.I've been searching for a good book on Direct3D graphics programming for years and finally found one that delivers what it promises. Wolfgang Engel, the author, obviously understands how frustrating the learning process can be. The content of this book is masterfully structured to give the reader a solid understanding of everything you need to know. It's friendly, informal, humorous, and focused. It's a big book, but it reads fast, and keeps you interested.The author assumes you know C and maybe a little C++. That's about the only prerequisite you'll need to understand the material"},{"Title":"Beginning Direct3D Game Programming, Second Edition (Premier Press Game Development)","review":"This is a great book with which to learn directx 9; it introduces the new shader abilities of directx. the only downside is that this book is only useful if you have a good background in C programming or better yet c++, not to mention the fact that this 2nd edition doesn't have the original chapters from the 1st edition about physics and collision detection by Amir Geva. if you know C, this is the book for you if you want to get started with direct3D without delving too deep into windows programming and general directx programming"},{"Title":"Beginning Direct3D Game Programming, Second Edition (Premier Press Game Development)","review":"The title of this book is misleading. It's not so much a beginners book as it is a fast-paced primer so you can get on to the good stuff. Chapters five and six (the first that take you into actual code) are *extremely* accelerated and don't really explain exactly what's going on in a lot of the code, though it's easy to figure it out once you load up the samples and play around with them for a while. It's written well, is easy to read, and it gives a great overview of the basics, just don't let the title fool you.My advice? Go through a bunch of online Direct3D tutorials first, then read this book."},{"Title":"Beginning Direct3D Game Programming, Second Edition (Premier Press Game Development)","review":"This is THE shader programming introduction from the expert !

This one maximizes your direct3d knowledge."},{"Title":"Beginning Direct3D Game Programming, Second Edition (Premier Press Game Development)","review":"DirectX is difficult to master. Even drilling down into just D3D is exceptionally challenging for most students. I have been looking for a DX book to use on an undergraduate course and in the process I have reviewd a few. While most books have something to offer few have drawn the whole of any of the DX modules together. Given the standard of the SDK documentation there is a clear need for good textbooks. My reaction to the present text is that it is very unsutiable for beginners. In the first place, it is not well written. Secondly,some of the code is way beyond what beginners could grasp and there is very little hand holding to reassure pedagogues like me. Thirdly, the material of matrices could do with being looked at again. However, it is not all gloom. The chapter on animation is really very good and well worth spending the time on.All too frequently we see computer programming texts come out without proper regard for the readership. Occasionally the reading public have the right to expect publishers to get material out there that was written to be read by others. I don't blame the authors, but the publishers who don't put enough editorial weight behind their offerings. I have no doubt but that this book could have been a much more useful book with appropriate editorial input.

There's not much that beats giving it to the scum who put a huge dose of Wrong in your life. Donna Landsman, formerly Donatella Bonnati, feels that the Santangelo family did her wrong when her husband Santino was shot dead by one of them. Forget the fact that he was trying to rape Lucky's little boy when it happened. Yeah, forget it. With a new look and a new name, Donna is back to do it the Sicilian way.But that's not all-- There's revenge, and then there's revenge for the revenge. That's Lucky's to take after Donna's plans become reality. And you know Lucky, she does it with style.Like its predecessors, the multiple plotline is in effect. If I have one complaint, it's that too much of the story centered around dead-end relationships; the casual sex got a bit repetitive, and, being disposable, the couplings didn't really hold much interest. Though it was refreshing to see women using the men for a change. Other than that one gripe, it was a story well-told but not so engrossing, with the exception for me being the acts of revenge-- about the only thing I'd call page-turner material in the book. Even Lennie's \\"prisoner in a cave\\" deal (haha, most ridic plot, what was Collins smoking and can I have some) didn't have me dying to find out what would happen.

Vendetta is an incredible book from cover to cover. Lucky is well developed. Her relationship with Alex could be viewed as a one-night stand that shouldn't have happened. Given the circumstances surrounding the reasons Lucky and Alex are together, Vendetta was written in a way where a reader can't help but applaud.There's a super twist in this novel. The suspense was handled well and in the end, the happy ending is the icing on the cake especially after the sorrow Lucky faces. Super action. Super dialogue. This is an erotic mainstream romance novel the way it should be. Authors in the business should be required to take a Jackie Collins course before they can publish their first book. Outstanding."},{"Title":"Vendetta: Lucky's Revenge","review":"The further adventures of Lucky Santangelo Golden--a powerful and beautiful woman. There are too many plots to explain here but they're all fun and full of colorful characters. Don't worry if you haven't read the previous books--Collins fills you in quickly on who the characters are. Also this book is full of strong female characters who don't need a man to survive and get revenge if a guy crosses them. Even at over 600 pages this book reads quickly and is very entertaining and well-written.

It was really great to tie in some of the other characters, Brigitte, Gino, Lennie, etc. That's what so great about her. I often wonder if Jackie is not Lucky and visa versa.

Does Jackie get to read these?"},{"Title":"Vendetta: Lucky's Revenge","review":"I really liked that book. From the few Jackie Collins books that I have read, this was by far the best. Lucky is a very strong woman - that's the way today's woman should be! They should not let people walk on their feet. What I admire is the faith and trust that there is in Lucky's and Lennie's marriage. It's not directly their fault if they had both committed adultery, only once. The one to be blamed is Donna. Lucky was trapped in believing that Lennie was dead, that's why she slept with Alex, while Lennie slept with that italian girl so as to save himself. A must read book for all Jackie Collins fan. I am not exactly one of her fans, but I definitely am now after having read Lucky's Revenge!"},{"Title":"Vendetta: Lucky's Revenge","review":"Another great novel by Jackie. The series on Lucky is great!!! Every novel pulls you into the story and makes you want more.

After the end of this novel I keep wondering, &quot;what happens now?&quot;, the story is not over there is more to be told. She leaves angles open that makes you want more.

Where is the freshness? Hollywood seems old and tired and so do all of the characters. They all still live back in 1975, I guess. Maybe Jackie has changed or maybe I have, but I got so hung up on the awful writing that I couldn't get into the plot, and didn't care about any of the characters who are still thinking about sex just as they did in 1975-- nothing seems to have changed. The characters still &quot;give head&quot; and the men still think the length of their you know what means anything. Whoa, Jackie. It's 1997. People think twice before passing bodily fluids. The Mafia is boring and &quot;Donnatella&quot; (villainess) doesn't light my fire. I certainly don't care whether Lucky prevails or not-- and maybe she should comb her &quot;wild mane&quot; of hair, which is about the only description that Collins bothers to give of her, other than that she's gorgeous, of course. All of Collins' characters each have about 4 characteristics that drive them-- i.e., ambition, greed, lust and sexual attractiveness. That's it. That's all there is. Read carefully and you can see this for yourself-- they do not do one thing that isn't caused by one of those four characteristics the author has given them. Everything they say or do is driven by ambition, lust, etc. etc. This makes for a lot of characters who are like wind-up dolls. I gave this book a generous 4 because some of Jackie's earlier books did give me a lot of enjoyment, but maybe that was because it was back in 1977. Oh, by the way, Jackie still gives good author photo. She looks twice as good as she did on her first books when she was 20 or 25 years younger.

In it, Foucault not only explicates the results of his early books on madness, medicine, and the history of the human sciences: he also offers programmatic statements that link up his methods with the main stream of 20th-century French historical researches. The *episteme* linking seemingly disparate fields of inquiry is here explicitly presented against the background of Ferdinand Braudel's *duree*, and other famed devices for recontextualizing historical facts. For Foucault is intent on demonstrating his method without reference to (*against*) the philosophical luminaries that had until then monopolized such meta-theory.The uninformed, and perhaps some of the informed, may be surprised to find Foucault actually considering the fact itself: hardly a promising beginning for showing how everything seemingly natural about social life hinges on systems of power. But it is precisely the historical fact that Foucault is concerned with, the dry, value-free content of the \\"archive\\": he is interested in the conditions of the possibility of grasping the events of the world in the manner of the historian, and proceeds to elaborate a system for comparing and construing such data without reference to processes of consciousness or any other valorizing quantity from outside history.He proceeds to do this by elaborating a pragmatics of discourse quite unlike linguistics of the Saussurean (or Gricean) variety, studying how contexts of information combine to produce a happening intelligible as an event, not only as a linguistic counter or evidence of an intention. His analysis strongly resembles that of the celebrated Thomas Kuhn, who in truth aimed not to relativize science but to explain its true \\"background\\" in actual scientific practice. Drawing many examples from (and correcting naivete in) his books *History of Madness*, *Birth of the Clinic* and *The Order of Things*, Foucault attempts to show how an intellectual history can carefully collate and juxtapose historical information without imposing an idealizing \\"mentality\\" on the originators of a discourse.Recapping as it does his work of the Sixties, fans of Foucault's analyses in *Discipline and Punish* and *The History of Sexuality* may expect this book represents only \\"transitional\\" views of Foucault's, later discarded in favor of a full-blooded Nietzschean pursuit of power relations. But \\"genealogical\\" theories are not ignored here, particularly in Foucault's inaugural address for the College de France, \\"The Order of Discourse\\", generously included at the end of this volume. It is true that Foucault's theory does not represent the program of a \\"history of truth\\" elaborated in \\"Truth and Juridical Forms\\", early lectures on the history of the penal system included in volume 3 of the New Press's *Essential Works*. But by the same token those interested in the French social theorists who preceded Foucault will find that Foucault's engagement with their problems, especially those of his teacher Althusser, is here much more explicit than elsewhere.In conclusion, this book is unlikely to grab you unless you have already made a significant investment in Foucault, or \\"contemporary\\" history more generally. But for anyone who has indeed spent some time thinking about such things, this book is an anodyne statement of important and influential views about history and how it is done."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"\\"Archaeology Of Knowledge\\" finds Foucault at his barest, trying to build up his own theory. Like others have said, it is fascinating to see how much he tries to encompass and how extremely difficult his own enterprise is. Foucault spends many pages trying to explain to us what he means by \\"discoursive formation\\", \\"object formation\\", \\"formation of concepts\\", etc., and the place where his own theory stands vis-&agrave;-vis a so-called \\"history of ideas\\". You can learn lots from this book, because, like myself, sometimes you get lost in Foucault's magistral writing, his fabulous way of weaving history and thus cannot clearly follow his own particular method of research. If you want to see some of his (earlier, almost stricly discourse-oriented) key concepts clarified, reading this book will prove very fruitful. As always, you're left with a lot of questions and with a distinctive feeling of \\"now what?\\". But then again, that's what's so utterly beautiful and engaging about Foucault... he forces you to think for yourself and provides you of the right tools to do it.I read the spanish translation of this book so I can't comment on the english one, but the contents of this book are priceless."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"Let's be childish enough to use coarse categories: &quot;Discipline&amp;Punish&quot; is Foucault's most beautiful book. &quot;The Order of Things&quot; is the most brilliant (that's why it made him a star). Let's also say &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot; is his most exciting book. Then &quot;The Archaeology of Knowledge&quot; is the most fascinating: it is Foucault's attempt to write a theory of what he is doing. And it is a brilliant failure: this is the only time that we see Foucault, the master of brilliant formulation, completely naked. It is endearing to watch how he is trying to write a piece of philosophical theory, while all his other books demonstrate how unnecessary such theory is.This is no light reading and the English translation is barely comprehensible. I bet that there is a serious mistranslation on any given page. With good translations at hand, some notorious readers (Foucault lovers and Foucault enemies alike) might actually have understood what the words &quot;discourse&quot; and &quot;dispositif&quot; mean. Countless articles and books would not have been written. That's why a good German translation would have been even more desirable (the one in print is as miserable as the English one, same bet)..."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"In this book Foucault wished to both show his own way of looking at things and to distance himself from his previous more structuralist leaning book on the same subject, THE ORDER OF THINGS. The book is more of an interesting insight into how Foucault did research for then it is a way of showing how someone else can go about imitating his style of post-structural archeology.Foucault tries to outline throughout the book both how and the importance distancing histories from subjects and eras. He would rather and did focus on the discourse itself, but not just privileged discourses on the surface, the deep underlying genealogies that stem from rules, processes and agreed upon or forced barriers that underlay a topic. Foucault of course throughout his career used his perceived method to trace how power institutions came to use knowledge from the enlightenment to present as an ever encompassing tool of political and theory laden subjective strands that now masquerade themselves as the methods of institutions in a neutral/objective fashion.In a sense disguising their power in the rhetoric of objectivity and science whether the institutions methods really warrant that or not given their previous genealogical history. I say genealogical because Foucault by admission borrows heavily from Nietzsche in instituting his perceived method of archeology and in his focus on power relations through his short histories.This way of doing things is not only in opposition to his own earlier writings, he is also implicitly going against the likes of Marx, Sartre and Hegel. He does so in outlining the impossibility of an overarching meta-historical position. The size and interconnectedness of discourses is just too large and amorphous to really pin down a teleological element or epochal formation that makes any sense. Also a general criticism against vanilla structuralism and his own earlier idea of \\"epistemes.\\"He criticizes the teleological wish that every subject in the humanities, become a \\"true science\\" in some sense. Saying that they may not be unfinished subjects, but rather alternatives to science as a way of describing the world.In the appendix they added his seminar DISCOURSE ON LANGUAGE, in my edition of the book. It seems to be a helpful more easy to understand shorter version of what he said throughout the book before. Playing a similar role to STRUCTURE, SIGN AND PLAY, in Derrida's writings about his own deconstructive way of reading. I thought the questioning of Foucault's, can we have a philosophy in some way which is not Hegelian in this essay a strange, but thought provoking one. If what Foucault means is, \\"can we now have a philosophy which is ahistorical after Hegel?\\" I'm not exactly sure, seeing as anti-foundationalist stances are always in some way based on humanity's relation to it's own knowledge, Foucault may have a point in that all philosophy after this point will have to take historical discourse into account, since foundationalism is no longer an option.The thing is I agree with a lot of what Foucault says, but I'm not sure anyone else could use this method other than Foucault. There aren't any obvious flaws in what he says or how he lays things out, yet I'm sure even the most diehard foucauldian, would have trouble really implementing a history under the same parameters that Foucault himself did in any kind of exactness. Still a worth while read for those interested in how Foucault viewed himself and his own work. I would recommend to those with an intermediate level of knowledge in philosophy and also after having read some of his histories. As what he says makes a lot more sense if you understand the examples he lays out from his other works."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"A friend who found Foucault's The Order of Things useful and interesting recommended that I give the Archaeology of Knowledge a try. I had enjoyed his first book, Madness and Civilization, so I took up the challenge.I spent an extremely frustrating month trying to make sense of The Archaeology and then gave up. From the first page on Foucault uses totally unfamiliar concepts in a vocabulary loaded with neologisms which he neither defines nor references. Since the concepts are used in extraordinarily complex locutions, invariably along with other idiosyncratically opaque terminology, it seems impossible to discern their meaning from the context in which they occur.I have since been advised that The Archaeology of Knowledge is much more approachable for one who has read everything else that Foucault has written, and who has also mastered Derrida and Kristeva. That may be true, but it's not a risk I'm willing to take. Even if I did eventually manage to decipher the code used in producing The Archaeology, I doubt that the intellectual payoff would be substantial. Foucault is the kind of author who delights in keeping people guessing, making sure that no one can ever be certain as to his meaning. It all sounds very profound, but what does it mean. When all is said and done, Foucault wants to keep us off balance, uncertain, but somehow deeply impressed, as in \\"Perhaps this is what Foucault means by discursive formation! Ah ha!\\" Or, \\"Oh, I see: dispersion refers to the post-structuralist notion that any signifier is inevitably modified by an infinitely large number of other signifiers, so its meaning is never absolute... I think ...\\" But we're never sure.I have since read interviews with Foucault written when he was at his most influential. Success seems to have been an intoxicating experience for him, and he indulged himself in a sort of yes-I-am, no-I'm-not obfuscation. There is a common and suitably profane English term for this, head-[blanking], sufficiently familiar so that most readers can fill in the blank. Readers who find virtue in head-[blanking] by construing it as an instance of \\"the death of the author\\" are kidding themselves. An author who writes an incomprehensible book that somehow gets to be taken very seriously is not dead, but very much in control.In any case, I'm sure that The Archaeology of Knowledge will have a long life in references and indexes as Foucault's major methodological work. Learned people, moreover, will purport to discern its meaning and will discuss it with ease and assurance.I had a similar experience 30 years ago when I studied ethnomethodology. I could talk about it with facility and self-satisfaction, but I couldn't shake the vague suspicion that I had merely become adept at exchanging utterances in a shared but meaningless logic of head-[blanking].As an addendum, an irate reader of this review took me to task for evaluating a book that I do not have the conceptual wherewithal to appreciate. He may have a point, but I've read Habermas, Eagleton, Anthony Giddens, Peter Berger, and other contemporary social and cultural theorists with little difficulty, so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to be able to make some sense of Foucault."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"Do not be fooled by those who dismiss this as a mere curiousity in Foucault's oeuvre. This difficult work is absolutely essential for understanding his central concept of 'discourse'. All of his works are better understood after a careful reading of this difficult work; this is true even for the later 'geneaological' works."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"When Michel Foucault wrote in The Order of Things that underlying all human activities were standardizing sequences of phenomena that he called \\"great uniform texts,\\" he saw more stability in human discourse than he did in his very next book, The Archaeology of Knowledge. In this latter effort, Foucault reversed course and envisioned human history as composed of discrete epochs that in The Order of Things he called \\"epistemes\\" that were discontinuous in the sense that the disappearance of one episteme had nothing to do with the appearance or direction of the other. Further, when he examined these epistemes, which he now labeled \\"discursive formations,\\" he stopped probing their depths to glean meaning and substance as he did in The Order of Things and began noting the prevalent discourses and comparing them to isolate elements in common.Regardless of whether Foucault called an epoch an episteme or a discursive formation, that epoch functioned pretty much the same as discontinuities were prevalent from one to the other. He does not mention how and why an episteme loses its characteristic discontinuity to become a discursive formation with a new discontinuity. Perhaps he himself does not know so he contents himself with describing the traits that are continuous within one episteme but are discontinuous within the succeeding discursive formation. He adds some new terms that he clearly hopes will clarify his assorted theses. The first term is a \\"discursive practice,\\" which contain the vocalized discourses--mostly speeches and writing--of individual people. A discursive practice has meaning only for those who live in that episteme or discursive formation, thus making it discontinuous. The second term is a \\"non-discursive practice,\\" which refers to the collective discourses of states, groups, and institutions. Foucault creates a paradox for himself when he notes that the discourses of a non-discursive practice are not limited to that epoch. These discourses, he suggests take on a life of their own due to their association with long-lived institutions, thus carrying meaning and content from episteme to discursive formation. This obviously cannot happen due to his earlier assertion about the impermeability of the boundaries between epochs, but since this does happen his core premise about the nature of historical epochs is nullified.In addition to the logical flubs and inconsistencies that run rampant throughout the Foucault canon, The Archaeology of Knowledge is dressed up in semantic phraseology that defies all but the most dedicated and knowledgeable readers. I sometimes wonder whether readers who praise him truly understand him."},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"Foucault's Archeology of Knowledge builds the foundation of Foucault's work. Not an easy read but in my opinion essential in understanding the broader purpose of Foucault's earlier and later works.

It is reading that requires intense concentration and no interruptions!"},{"Title":"The Archaeology of Knowledge and the Discourse on Language","review":"The Conclusion of this book (Chapter V) is perhaps the most interesting. Foucault appears to be corresponding with an undisclosed someone, wether with himself as a self critique, or with a critic. I won't put asside the possibility he is coversing with someone from the Tavistock Inst.; as Tavistock Publications Lim. was the first place of translation for this text. If he had not suceeded, in his archaeology of knowledge, an undermining of structuralism, with the thesis on human discourse, then perhaps it is because of a lack of conviction on part of this &quot;someone&quot; or on part of himself.Understanding the implication of Foucault's thought process from a first read requires a refflective reader and in many ways requires a far-reaching mind from the start. This work is composed of a terminal plethora of architectures and teleological plethoras of exemplifications from science and history. Economics, stats, documents, records, and items from all discourses are examined and presented as artifacts of discursive knowledge. The Archeaology itself is the thematic for the Archive, and the archive is the preservatory of knowledge, that such discursive knowledge is preserved is archaeology. Foucault's task then is to undermine the archives of knowledge and present that knowledge back upon the structural framework of rational discourse. With observational power and radical ability, Foucault goes beyond the framework and invisibly subordinates it's needs to be observed and it's intention to be ritcheous (ritcheous in all that it accounts for, and ritcheous of the observer.) From the most primordial archean, to the revival of the primal archaic state, to the archaology of all knowledge, Foucault shows that in a way discourses built upon historical facts are like artifacts themselves. Here in the conclusion we see that the problematic of language (langue) as the derivational principal of discourses, cannot be made paletable (literaly!)And so the audition fails because language or the &quot;langue&quot; is not sufficiently constructed for what it represents in discursive practice. At the zenith of the teleological project, when temporal conceptualization extinguishes itself from being quantified into being qualified, at the last quarter of the era, perhaps this work will be gleamed from the resevoire and conrgessively discussed."},{"Title":"The Car Stereo Cookbook","review":"The book is very good and allows for experimentation, but at the same time, the book is a tad out of date because of the newer technology that has emerged since the writing of the book."},{"Title":"The Car Stereo Cookbook","review":"Its a good book, you do need a little knowledge of car audio but not too much is required.

Who's to say that the reader should already know the difference between a 12dB/octave slope and an 18dB/octave slope in a crossover? I sure didn't, and I had to look at another book to find out, making me question the usefulness of this book. A safer bet for a beginner would be Auto Audio by Andrew Yoder.

And then there are diagrams for dual preamps head outputs but the pictures show one one set going to the amps. Then there is a huge chapter on subwoofers and the author gives no information on techniques for mounting the box to the car. The head installation was way to general. Good points made are setting up speakers for best ohm ratings (serial vs parallel), determining voltage with a multimeter, what power cable gauge to use. The book is several years old and seems out of date on some subject matter. There is also a lot of dialog on things that are obvious. Consider this book for tips, not as a bible for installing since you won't find too much on how to actually install anything."},{"Title":"The Car Stereo Cookbook","review":"This book is absolutely great.

The biology sections were generally weak - for example, there are no explanatory diagrams, which I think would have been very helpful to the reader, at least if biology textbooks are trustworthy in their pedagogical methods. Admittedly, there were a few color plates stuck in the middle of the book, but these were more of the gee-whiz variety rather than informative support for the prose. Also Bentley does a lot of name dropping, but does little to specifically outline the projects of those he mentions, sometimes giving merely a paragraph to researchers who are apparently doing \\"cutting-edge\\" work in digital biology. Finally, the writing style is inconsistent. Sometimes Bentley writes as if he's a researcher, sometimes as if he's a magazine writer, sometimes as if he's playing short-story fiction writer. This was very distracting. I think the audience that would find this book useful are people who are starting at ground zero in their investigations into computer modeling / implementation of biological structures into computer software. Those with more advanced interests are advised to look elsewhere (cf. Steven Johnson's book on Emergence)."},{"Title":"Digital Biology","review":"The basic premise of \\"Digital Biology\\" is that biological systems (brains, plants, insects, etc) were \\"designed\\" in a certain way because there was an inherent advantage to this design. Therefore, if we can understand the principles behind the design, we can take these techniques and use them in our software and hardware.Many things in nature seem as if they have no reason behind them - however, as the book illustrates, there are certainly valid, good reasons. An example would be neural networks: since our brain uses this instead of hard coded rules and programming, it is much more flexible. It can learn by trial an error the \\"best\\" approach, something traditional algorithms cannot do as efficiently. By taking this mechanism we can create very sophisticated - almost intelligent - programs and robots.There are numerous chapters in \\"Digital Biology\\", each dedicated to a specific subject. Each chapter begins by explaining how a specific biology mechanism works (i.e., the chapter on \\"immune systems\\" gives a short tutorial on how the body's immune system works). Then, different ways that similar mechanisms are used in artificial applications are demonstrated.Among the most interesting chapters:\\"Evolution\\", this chapter elaborates on the principles of Evolution and how they can be used in Computation. What are Evolutionary Algorithms ? What are Genetic Algorithms? What is Genetic Programming? Evolvable Hardware, and more.\\"Brains\\" - this chapter was FASCINATING. It started with a short introduction of how we believe brains work, and how these principles can be a foundation for AI and ALIFE: by using Neural Networks.\\"Insects\\"- Insects are interesting because in many ways a group of insects acts as one larger organism. Sometimes many simple organisms can form one fairly intelligent \\"Creature\\". There are ways to use these techniques in computation as well, as this chapter shows. (Swarm Intelligence, Boids, etc)Overall this is a very interesting book. It covers a lot of subjects, yet does NOT go too deeply into any of those - I don't think that was the purpose of the author. My main criticism is the way the book was written - some chapters are very raw, the examples chosen could've been better. (I think my favorite one was where the immune system is being compared to the music industry, and antibodies are compared to boy bands. Probably the strangest analogy I have read in my life). I also think that there was too much emphasis on real biology, especially since in many subjects there was no analogy in digital biology. Nonetheless, if the idea of using biological mechanisms in software or hardware appeals to you, this should serve as a fascinating introduction."},{"Title":"Digital Biology","review":"There are so many \\"revolutionary\\" developments in science, and especially in computer science, that it is hard to keep track of them all, and hard feel that they can all be as revolutionary as they claim to be. You have to suspect, though, that if Peter J. Bentley is claiming a revolution, then something wonderful is happening; he is a scientist in the very field of computers, not a reporter, and so his book _Digital Biology: How Nature is Transforming Our Technology and Our Lives_ (Simon &amp; Schuster) is that excellent form of popular science writing, enthusiastic witnessing from an expert in the field. It is obvious that he loves his work, and that it has far-ranging implications, but it is even better that he can communicate the enthusiasm and let the reader share in it.Digital biology represents a remarkable two way street. Natural processes such as evolution or ant colony behavior can be modeled within a computer to build stronger problem-solving tools. In turn, computer programs can illuminate aspects of behavior of systems large and small in nature, showing just how physics, genes, and evolution have accomplished the complexities we see around us. The best part of Bentley's book is that he has plenty of examples of how these ideas are already at work. Consider what seems to be an inescapable metaphor for brains and for computers, the ant colony. Ants are themselves, like all other insects, tiny robots able to take in small degrees of data and perform small feats of manipulation. One ant is a very limited creature indeed. (Are you getting the analogy? One neuron, too, is practically useless as is one flip-flop gate.) But a mass of ants in a colony starts to show real intelligence. Put a little food out a distance from the colony, and by laying pheromone trails, and following the stronger trails, the huge numbers of ants will in effect calculate the shortest, most efficient way of getting back and forth to it. Making digitally simulated \\"ants\\" and electronic \\"pheromone trails\\" is already solving difficult problems; \\"Ant Colony Optimization\\" is already a respected field in computer science. It has been used to solve the otherwise almost intractable classic Traveling Salesman Problem: A salesman has to get to many different cities on his rounds; what is the most efficient route? Solving this problem took too long for even the fastest of ordinary computers, but letting the digital ants go at it works. It isn't just a matter of solving puzzles, either; such optimization programs are already being applied to communication network routing and electronic circuit design.In some ways this book is a primer on evolution of different types, and while some fundamentalists continue to make religious objections to evolution in nature, it is obvious from the examples Bentley gives that evolution really does happen in many ways separate from our world of DNA creatures. Bentley draws from examples in many disciplines, and is interested in finding commonalities between them. He demonstrates that from DNA to ants to brains to growth to programming code to evolution to universes, complexity is generated by interactions of similar things, controlled by feedback, and subject to change from the outside. This pattern is more important than the stuff the system is made of. This has not quite the clear universal ring of a Newtonian law, perhaps, but it is certainly an illustrative pattern which is played at all sorts of levels. To Bentley, the pattern is so much more important that the stuff which shows it that he sees no basic difference between biological life and life within a computer. His quickly paced, entertaining book is a good introduction to one of the new ways computers are changing how we look at everything."},{"Title":"Digital Biology","review":"This book did not deliver what I was expecting. I thought there would be detailed examples of the use of biological concepts in computing. Unfortunately I was very wrong.There are some examples, however they are very vague with little or no detail. Frequently the author asserts a technique has too many applications to go into in any detail without boring the reader. Next he proceeds to rattle off a dozen vague applications such as scheduling, optimization, etc. without giving enough information about the application to be useful.The center of the book contains a number of pictures that are the result of one technique or another. Unfortunately he does not elaborate on how any of them were created. I enjoyed seeing the coffee table his computer designed. Unfortunately the only explaination he gave on how the program worked was something to the effect that it was complicated. A bit more detail or perhaps even code would have been much better.Beyond my perceived technical shortcomings, the author's style did not appeal to me. For example he wrote a fairly detailed account of what it might be like (as though a virus could think) to be a virus invading a host. Perhaps this was an attempt to engage the readers' imaginations. If so, the effect was wasted on this reader.Two stars seemed right as there are worse books in the world. However I doubt most people would gain much from reading it."},{"Title":"Digital Biology","review":"I agree with other reviewers of this book who say that it doesn't deal with any of its topics deeply (as the author says in the book, it's just a summary of conversations he had with the scientists he gives all of about half a page to each, and material he found on the Internet) and that the writing is just a shade above mediocre. The author isn't a bad writer, necessarily, he's just very inconsistent. If he stuck with facts instead of pretending to be a fiction or magazine writer, he'd do well. Also, if he stuck with a British voice and didn't cater to Americans, that would be a good move. If you want to tailor your writing to an American audience, fine--do that and don't make a point of it. Otherwise, stick with your native tendencies, as it tends to make the book more readable.This book is just ok. A few parts were downright painful, but mainly just because of the writing. The content was never painful, just boring in many places. For anybody with a background in complex adaptive systems, current computer science research, or any of the in vogue areas like network theory or chaos, this book can easily be put aside for others. If you're a layperson just looking for an introduction to the research being done connecting computers and biology, this book might be good. For serious readers, there are better books like 'At Home in the Universe' by Stuart Kauffman (excellent) and 'Complexity' by Mitchell Waldrop (also excellent). Those books are much older, but much more thought-provoking and well-written. They may not cover some of the newest research, but this book covers everything with such lack of depth you won't really get anything more out of reading it.In short: not a bad book, but could have been much better in writing and content, and serious readers would do better elsewhere."},{"Title":"Digital Biology","review":"It is difficult to read this book and not catch the bug of biologically inspired computing.

Starting with the definition of a digital universe (that makes you think twice about our own), it introduces evolutionary computation, neural networks, ant colonies, artificial immune systems and other fascinating computational metaphors. It explains their foundations and underlying theories and describes their practical applications.My only complaint: there are no references to scientific papers.

The author presents some very interesting perspectives on existing ideas about biology and machines. Useful notes at the end and the further reading section is good.Rather than be another &quot;here is the future&quot; book by yet another science journalist, this is a book with its feet very much in the present and written by a scientist who is active in the field (rather than a journalist). Do not be alarmed! This guy writes well. I'm not going to say it's a one- sitting read (because that would just make me too much of a techno-nerd), however it's definitely a page-turner.In terms of books available, I think that there is presently only one other non text-book that takes an overview of this field (Moshe Sipper - Machine Nature), though I'm sure there are gonna be a lot more before too long . If you want 2 books - buy both.

This book has a spiral binding and for those of you that are familiar with the current Time-Life type of book, forget what you know. This is a very hardcore cookbook with no pretty pictures to clutter up the subject, not fancy presentation suggestions and it is most certainly not the type of cookbook that requires you to open a can of cream of what-ever soup, dump it on what-ever, heat and serve! No, no, no! This is a book filled with hardcore original recipes; recipes that are to be prepared from \\"scratch,\\" and served to people who are into eating food; good food and authentic food.The directions in the preparation of each and every recipe in this work are extremely meticulous...there is little to no room for error and the authors have bent over backwards to assure that errors have not been included. The directions are clearly written and as I have indicated, extremely precise. As an example the directions for the preparation of Roux is probably the best I have ever read or tried. Roux is familiar to those dealing with French cooking, but the brown roux as prepared in Louisiana is a completely different substance; it is the basis for many traditional dishes and if the roux is unworthy; so goes the final dish. The proper preparation of roux is not all that simple and it is extremely time consuming. Is it worth it? You bet!Oyster soup, Squirrel-and-Oyster Gumbo, Crab-and-Shrimp Bouillon, Creamed Egg Chartres, Oyster Pie, Frogs' Legs Sauce Piquante, Speckled Trout Marquery, Chicken Rochambeau, Yams and Sausage, Green Peas a la frangaise, Shrimp dishes beyond number and the list goes on and on. Trust me folks, there is a years worth of cooking in just this one little book. I love the section on boiled crawfish. The authors have included here four of the only black and white photos in the entire book to show the reader how to actually eat the little critters.If you are going to cook or attempt to cook authentic Creole and Acadian dishes then you might as well learn to do it right. This work, while not as good as you would get if you actually took lesson from an authentic chef, is pretty much the next best thing. Food prepared in the manner outlined here is far, far, far different than you are served at so called Cajun restraints. Years ago my wife spent quite a lot of time taking lessons in authentic Mexican cooking from a wonderful lady. There is a world of difference in my wife's Mexican dishes than anything you can possibly buy at commercial eating establishments. I would give my eye teeth to take lessons from an authentic and skilled chef from this region of the country...alas though...we will use this book until if by chance this happens for us.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Times Good University Guide 2006","review":"I love this book because i was looking where to go for my master degree and it helps me a lot to choose which university to go!

To Macaulay and his ilk, Charles I's Archbishop of Canterbury was a stock villain, culpable for the royal policies that provoked the English Civil War.Hugh Trevor-Roper's biography (first published in 1940; Phoenix Press reprints the very slightly revised 1961 edition) cannot be called a rehabilitation, but it does correct, and has largely superseded, the Whig caricature. (The Britannica entry on Laud, for instance, reads like a precis.) Instead of a Wolsey-like grand prelate, Laud is shown to have been an honest, hardworking man, notable both for extensive charities and for fostering Greek, Arabic and Persian studies. His most conspicuous faults were personal rudeness, excessive severity as a judge (even by the severe standards of the time) and political maladroitness. Though he left behind many volumes of writings, he never grasped the importance of propaganda or public opinion. His immediate reaction to opposition was clumsy suppression, an instinct that led him to advocate the forcible imposition of episcopal governance on the Scottish church. From the failure of the &quot;Bishops' War&quot; followed the disintegration of Charles' personal rule, the Short and Long Parliaments, civil war and Laud's own murder by Act of Parliament in 1645.Trevor-Roper recounts Laud's career in, as one would expect, a lively and opinionated, yet thoroughly scholarly, fashion. He emphasizes high politics and ecclesiastical conflict but also directs attention to Laud's achievements as Chancellor of Oxford University, where his impact may have been more lasting than on either Church or State. There is little speculation about the Archbishop's private life, for which hardly any evidence survives. He never married, apparently kept no mistresses, lived unostentatiously and left behind almost no purely personal correspondence or anecdotes. Trevor-Roper surmises that he tended to have allies rather than friends, but the truth is unknowable.Excellent though it is in most respects, &quot;Archbishop Laud&quot; suffers from distortion in one key area. The biographer takes it as a fundamental truth that 17th Century men were as secular in outlook as his own 20th Century circle of acquaintances. Therefore, religious principles must have been mere masks for social and political content. Men adopted Puritan or Arminian or Roman Catholic theology because they liked the political doctrines associated with those labels.That premise is no doubt true of many figures of the day, but Trevor-Roper's own narrative exposes its dubiety in this particular case. The tenet that Laud advanced most persistently, in the teeth of massive opposition by both clergy and laity, was the importance of preserving continuity with the pre-Reformation Church. He was not sympathetic to Roman Catholicism but would not abandon traditional doctrines and rituals simply because they had been labeled &quot;popish&quot;. In these views he followed Lancelot Andrewes and Richard Hooker, and it is largely because of his efforts that their species of &quot;Anglo-Catholicism&quot; lasted beyond the lifetimes of their personal disciples.None of the distinctive issues addressed by the Andrewes-Hooker school is important to Trevor-Roper. Hence, he concludes, none of them could really have been important to Laud. The &quot;true&quot; reason for, say, upholding the mystical character of the Eucharist was evidently to strike a blow at enclosures, emigration and the pretensions of Parliament. Rather an indirect blow, one might think.If one imagines that Laud's ostensible hierarchy of values was his real one, his life comes into clearer focus. Activities such as the promotion of scholarship and the recovery of the church's property rights were not disconnected enthusiasms but elements of a program for reinforcing the links between contemporary and ancient Christianity and safeguarding a refurbished church from the influence of modernist opinion. Likewise, his indifference to politically attractive pan-Protestant initiatives, a stance that puzzles Trevor-Roper, reflects his desire to hold the English church at a distance from Reformation theology.Although Trevor-Roper pronounces Laud a &quot;failure&quot;, the Laudian tradition held a prominent, occasionally preeminent, place in the Church of England for three hundred years, and from that base it has gained an extended, if attenuated, influence. The descendants of Puritan zealots now study the Fathers of the Church, take the sacraments seriously, pay heed to the continuity of Christian experience, celebrate the ancient holy days and even admit religious images into their sanctuaries. From the perspective of 1645, that is an astonishing evolution. There is no way to know what might have been, but one cannot help suspecting that today's Protestant Christianity would be much more drab, anti-historical and unintellectual had William Laud never lived."},{"Title":"Archbishop Laud, 1573-1645","review":"There is no reason to doubt that Laud was a deeply religious man. Even Trevor-Roper seems to recognize this at times, but the author paints the picture of a single minded and selfless bureacrat who is driven by a sociological ideal of restoring the post-Reformation church to its pre-Reformation glory. Theological convictions and religious ceremonies are humbug for Trevor-Roper's version of Laud. Laud's program is a social and practical one according to the author.Trevor-Roper finds it ironic that Anglo-Catholics would revere Laud and consider him a saint and a martyr since he was a \\"restless, practical bureaucrat.\\" It is hard to see how alienating the middle class Puritans of the Midlands and East Anglia was practical, or how the attempted enforcement of Anglican liturgy upon the fiercely independent and Presbyterian Scots was anything short of madness. It is difficult to understand Laud if one does not take seriously his love for the \\"beauty of holiness.\\" Trevor-Roper concedes that Laud has had his defenders, but that they have been clergymen who understand nothing more than Laud's theology and religious ceremonies. That Anglicans retain the correct posture of the communion table and other \\"insignificant cermonies\\" would not have cheered Laud's heart since his policies were a complete and utter failure.Trevor-Roper's assessment of Laud is akin to a biography of Che Guevarra that considers his commitment to the ideal of communism incidental. That said, I gave the book four stars because Trevor-Roper spares the reader the two extremes of Laud the intolerant religious bigot and Laud the saint and martyr."},{"Title":"The Highfield Mole (Circle in the Spiral)","review":"Few books that I have read were as compelling and addictive as this one, and with 3 more published in the series and a 5th on the way, it will provide many more hours of entertainment. This book was hard to put down. I just kept saying to myself as reading, one more section, one more chapter, and yet kept reading when I should have put it down. I had to stop reading it at work because I would not want my break or lunch to end. The story is fast paced, the plot twists uncanny, the characters incredibly interesting and the concept chilling.Will Burrows (pun intended I am sure) is obsessed with archaeological digs, a passion his father has encouraged. His father is the curator at the local museum and dreams of finding something to put his academic career back on track. But they dig in secret, hiding their tunnels and their finds. Will works on projects for his father but also has his own side digs in areas of interest for himself. And in some ways he feels more at home underground than above. But when his father goes missing, and Will discovers a mysterious tunnel and journal, he and his friend Chester go digging, looking for Dr. Burrows. What they find will surprise them and just might cost them their lives.The greatest strength of the story is the uniqueness of the story line. The plot is so enticing. Discovering an underground world and civilization is not a new plot, but how this one came about, and its interactions with topsiders, is unique and fascinating. Overall it was an excellent read and I cannot wait to read more books in the series.

This book is first of a series."},{"Title":"The Highfield Mole (Circle in the Spiral)","review":"Once you get engrossed in this fantastic story, there is no putting it down! This book, and the US version that is about to be released, \\"TUNNELS,\\" makes a great holiday gift, or gift any time, for the young Harry Potter fan who misses the HP series. It is a rolicking, riveting adventure and keeps the reader enthralled! Sure to be a big hit with readers, young and old."},{"Title":"The Highfield Mole (Circle in the Spiral)","review":"As a self-published author (Survivor Planet, The Key to Space), I've paid extra attention the past few years to other self-publishing projects. So I've seen everything from horrendous to professional level. The Highfield Mole blew me away. It's not simply professional level; it's outstanding. In fact, the editor who discovered Harry Potter put up close to a million dollars in advance to the authors to publish this under the title Tunnels. Of course, I obtained a copy of Tunnels as well and even this professional level of editing altered less than 5 percent of the book. The vast majority is original, showing just how good the self-published version is. So because you probably can't get a copy of The Highfield Mole (only 500 hardbacks and 2,000 paperbacks produced), you won't miss anything if you read the Tunnels version. Although the publisher is hyping this as the next Harry Potter, well, I don't believe that there will be another phenomenon like Harry Potter for a generation or more, if ever. But it's clearly going to be a best-seller when it comes out as Tunnels in the U.S. in 2008. And even though it's intended as a juvenile science-fiction/fantasy series, I think it will appeal to adults and a wider readership. It's an exciting beginning, and I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"The House Of Blue Leaves: A Play in Two Acts","review":"The House of Blue Leaves is an exellent critique of the desire to achieve celebrity in our society. The characters in this story, namely Artie and Ronnie, are searching out fame in their own way (writing music for motion pictures and blowing the pope sky high, respectivly) mainly to achieve some sort of validity in their lives. They believe that their existance is meaningless without the acknowledgement of others. Through sharp, and sometimes dry and cynical writing, Guare makes you feel for the characteres and leaves you stunned at the end. With it's assortment of colorful supporting characters it is both a very funny and a very sad work of art."},{"Title":"The House Of Blue Leaves: A Play in Two Acts","review":"Guare's &quot;House of Blue Leaves&quot; is by far the most memorable, well-written, and exceptionally challenging play that I've yet to come across. Granted, the only production I've seen was an amateur presentation at a local performing arts center but, that aside, the content of Guare's play completely overshadowed any lackluster performances. As for the philosophy employed in so many recent films (Magnolia, Being John Malkovich) regarding self-affirmation through the powers of universal forces, &quot;House of Blue Leaves&quot; exemplifies this modernist philosophy through and through. Although &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot; is the more regarded of Guare's plays, HOBL is the most exceptionally subtle and quietly subversive. Very, very impressive work."},{"Title":"The House Of Blue Leaves: A Play in Two Acts","review":"The story and the characters are zany but fragile. I saw the 1986 production with Swoosie Kurtz and John Mahoney who would later become nationally known as Frasier's Dad. It was a very good production with great actors and many jokes but it is NOT a happy story. It's sad and working class. I saw it many times because tickets were very cheap to Catholic school kids (because it's about the Pope???)"},{"Title":"The House Of Blue Leaves: A Play in Two Acts","review":"Arrived in time.

There is very little action and the jokes are very dry. The storyline of a man who has had his dreams stepped on his entire life now finally seeing them about to become a reality is marred by the trite stereotypical characterizations. Several of the characters do not add to the story and their presence doesn't even make sense. Further, the story just plain isn't interesting. This is one I would definitely pass on."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"I loved this book of small town characters described by a young girl growing up in Germany in the 50-ies. Hegi writes here the way Fellini made movies, her choice of words is stunning. I read this book before reading &quot;Stones from the River&quot;. &quot;Stones&quot; gave me explanations for the mysteries in &quot;Floating&quot;. These mysteries make &quot;Floating&quot; the book it is, this is how young Hanna sees the people around her. &quot;Stones&quot; describes the previous 40 or so years, and if you read it first, &quot;Floating&quot; won't be mysterious, it will be just short evolution of characters from before, and you won't be able to identify with Hanna, because you'll know too much. So if you have a choice, read &quot;Floating&quot; first."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"If Ursula Hegi's &quot;Floating In My Mother's Palm&quot; doesn't read like a novel, it's because it is a collection of loosely but seamlessly connected short stories which offer the reader a delectable taste of provincial life in post-war Germany. The unifying factor is Hanna Malter, a young girl growing up in the small town of Burgdorf amidst a seemingly large and disparate cast of characters who in one way or another shape her childhood experiences. These stories tell of idiosyncracies, deformities, illegimacy, masochism, incest, dark premonitions, murder, suicide, madness, magic and healing, but in the most gentle, lyrical and dream like way possible, ie a million miles away from the cheap sensationalism common to purveyors of pulp fiction. Each story is complete in itself and without exception, beautifully told. Readers of this wonderful collection of vignettes is going to have his own personal favourites. Therein lies the fun - it's like choosing from a box of chocolates. There is a pervading sense of sadness in these tales which spring from the religious limitations and provincial-mindedness of a society on the fringe, but you're never conscious of it until it's over and you get the chance to reflect on it. Hegi's talent and integrity as a writer is self evident in the way she has achieved the near impossible, that of transforming characters with the makings of a grotesque into believable human beings. The result is a poetic and strangely uplifting novel that is a joy to read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"The question here is which book to you read first the prequel - &quot;Stones from the River&quot; or &quot;Floating in My Mother's Palm&quot;? I read SFTR first and found this a little less in depth, while at the same time continuing on the lives of the characters introduced one generation earlier as viewed from the post WWII generation. This book answers several questions I had regarding the seemingly meandering ending for SFTR, and now helps it all make sense. I suppose if I had read this, I would have given &quot;Stones&quot; 5 stars instead of 4 stars. Some of the stories are ordinary while others are extremely touching. All loosely connect to each other.Any way you do it, don't read one of these two books without reading the other."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"Ursula Hegi uses her usual hypnotic prose in this book, which flows like the water in the rivers that she loves, even as fast as 8 kilometers per hour like the Rhein. The stories continue to flow seamlessly, through her whole book. Yes, \\"stories,\\" as even though the book is a novel, it is composed of chapters, which are in fact free standing stories in and of themselves. All the stories are narrated by her protagonist, but each story could be lifted out of the book, and be self-contained.Her subject of each story is unique, and yet it is all mixed with her wondrous elucidation of the struggles, feelings and progression of the German people in \`reconstruction' after the World War II. The people left, in so many country towns of Germany, in the aftermath of the war. These people were only trying to live; before, during and after the war. They were not part of the political maelstrom we call National Socialism. Their lives were very much more simple than that, and they did suffer quite terribly, yet they stoically went on, as people have proved in every corner of the globe, that this is what human beings do. They pick up what is left and go on.Hegi does not concentrate on the effects of the war, they are coincident with the life that is found in post-World War II Germany. Hegi concentrates upon the life of her protagonist, a very smart and very sensitive young lady, from age 7 through about 14, as she grows up in this environment. The problems that she encounters though are the normal problems that all people encounter in every environment. Only the backdrop has to do with where they are and what the landscape is like. Hegi pays attention to that, but not overly, it is the people that are her subject: from Love to Death, from teenage pregnancy to sexual child abuse, from amputation to neural disease, these are the things that Hegi speaks about, and how they affect her narrator as she grows up in the midst of it. As she grows up in life, perhaps wherever she might be.Hegi writes modern day literature. It is worthy of the classification, and will endure the test of time. All readers who enjoy wonderfully written contemporary literature should not miss the opportunity to indulge themselves in Hegi's book."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"RECOLLECTION OF A YOUNG LIFE BEFORE THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER. The book is aptly named. Floating in my Mother's palm is a girl's (Hanna) recollection of different bits and pieces of her life before her other-than-conventional mother (Jutta) died in a small town (Burgdorf) in post WWII Germany. Through out the stories, Hanna recollects, you can see the guiding post of her mother at each important point.FLOATING.. IS THE FIRST OF TWO BOOKS, BUT IS SET LATER IN TIME. The second book is Stones from the River, which chronicles the life of Trudi Montag; a young dwarf woman that is one of the key characters in young Hanna's life. I would recommend reading &quot;Stones from the River&quot; prior to this book as it sets the stage for many of the characters in this book. However, these are differently constructed books. I found myself trying to link the facts (they were consistent) and found, I might be missing the point of the story. It's not the details but the interweaving of events that fashion a life. Stones from the River uses the details of a very different life to weave the story of Trudi Montag. Floating uses broader strokes to paint Hanna's tale.HANNA LIKE TRUDI, LEARNS FROM THE OUTSIDERS VIEWPOINT Hanna's unconventional mother Jutta is a painter and is close to her daughter in an different sense. She passes on to her daughter her &quot;unclouded&quot; view of people and society and with this Hanna experiences many different sides of the small town she grows up in. Trudi Montag, the town grape vine, also adds to this unique view as she is only too happy to provide Hanna with the knowledge of the town's darker side.A short book in comparison with Stones from the River, but one very complete in its own sense."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"I have read her novel, Stones from the River, and because of that novel, I didn't hesitate to buy this one. I still don't regret buying this novel. It's beautifully written, lyrically so and haunting.Hanna loses her mother at a young age but this book is not only a reflection of her mother, but of the people and their stories in her town. Told from Hanna's point of view and at different ages, the people in that town becomes alive through her eyes. She makes them real. She makes their stories real and valid.It is an emotional book ~~ where her housekeeper's son finds out he's illegimate; where she watches her childhood friend raped by her grandfather give up the baby she had come to love; watches her neighbor in the apartment above them give himself to man after man who degrades him. And other stories as well.This is a book perfect for reading groups to read and to discuss ~~ there are lots of different stories in here and it's not written poorly like too many other books out there today.12-18-03"},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"This book, written before &quot;Stones from the River&quot; is almost a collection of stories that, taken together, form a novel about a townspeople's postwar lives in Nazi Germany. The glue that binds the pieces is their presentation from one girl's point of view. And it works--this thin book is rich in understanding of what emotions, fears, and desires drive actions in individual lives. Each chapter ends with vivid imagery, poetic, is metaphoric; each is a story in itself. It's different than Stones from the River, but there is no need to make comparisions--each is wonderful in its own right."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"These stories were really wonderful vignettes of characters developed in &quot;Stones From the River&quot; (though the latter book was published later, I believe). I selected this book after reading &quot;Stones&quot; and &quot;Salt Dancers&quot;, and liked this one the best of all. Hegi's writing is tight, sparse, and clean in this &quot;novel&quot; and Hanna, the teller of the tales, (and the baby to whom Trudi from &quot;Stones&quot; was so attached), is a fine observer of the both the strengths and weaknesses of her fellow townspeople - yet she is sympathetic in her recounting of some personal and pivotal time in each person's life. I've wondered whether my enjoyment of this book stems from having met some of these characters from &quot;Stones&quot; - but I actually enjoyed this book more. &quot;Stones&quot; provided the broad narrative for several decades of history in their little German town while &quot;Floating in my Mother's Palm&quot; sheds light on the more personal stories of these characters. Strongly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"There are two things that must come together to form an excellent novel - a good story and the ability to find the words to tell it. Hegi is a master storyteller and gifted in her use of language to convey strong characters in memorable settings. Floating in My Mother's Palm is a first person account of the childhood of its main character, Hanna. As Hanna recounts aspects of her life that shaped her character and perspective, she introduces you to other characters in the town of Burgdorf and provides a view into their lives that make the town and its people real in every aspect. Each character is reminiscent of someone I've known from my own life. Its remarkable how the lives of characters from a small town in Germany can be so similar to those in Anytown, USA. The situations may be different but the issues are the same. Many of the characters in the novel appear in other work by Hegi, making the body of her work an intimate experience, leaving the reader feeling like they are getting closer and closer to each character with each novel read. Hegi's writing has never disappointed me."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"There are few better artists than Hegi when it comes to evoking a sense of longing and hope as she delves deeply into the created characters.

Like Stones, the environment in which the stories take place is grey and depressing. Some of the stories are very uplifting but most are about horrible things that happen to regular people. The only reason the repetition of this type of story makes sense to me is that at a certain age these are the types of things kids focus on."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"This book has left an indelible impression. Everything Ursula Hegi has written has been enjoyable, moving, and thought-provoking, but this little book overwhelmed me. Images from the book have stayed with me over the years; some sad and some uplifting. A remarkable book."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"Floating in My Mother's Palm was a great book. There were many themes in the book, but only a couple stood out the most for me. Faith most definitely was a primary theme in this book. Faith came into place when Hanna's grandmother had a disease that spread throughout her body. It also came into place when Hanna's friend had polio in her leg. Hanna rubbed holy water on the little girl's leg that she had stolen from church. Both the girls believed and had faith that by doing this the little girl's leg would heal.Fear was also incorporated into this book. In took place in a one of the chapter's where a man by the name of Siegfried Tegern kept having a bad dream about dying. This fear compelled him to buy several dogs to protect him, which in the end, became his destruction."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"In the tight community of Burgdorf, a girl observes the foibles of the town's people as they go about their lives. Each neighbor--young or old-- somehow touches Hanna's life, unintentionally parting with a lesson, depositing a memory that makes up a childhood. The events unfold in Hegi's lyrical, mellifluous voice, rich with the texture of the people and smells of the place.Floating In My Mother's Palm is structured less in a novel format that in the form of interlinking short stories. Eventually, the characters that reappear in Hegi's stories become familiar with their physical traits and idiosyncrasies. Some, like Trudy the dwarf, populate Hegi's Stones From The River.Growing up in a loving home of a father who is the town's dentist and a mother who is an accomplished painter, Hannah the child observes life's tragedies as they happen to others, never to her, until her mother's premature death. Interestingly, this event, which is foreshadowed in the opening of the book, is skimmed over. Hannah indulges in memories of her remarkable mother, but the emotional devastation expected from the start of the book and supported by the tone of the other tragedies is curiously missing. Even the adult Hannah selects only two of her mother's paintings out of an atticful. When tragedy strikes Hannah, it is less impactful than those taking place in other households.Floating In My Mother's Palm is a beautifully told story that holds the reader's attention and never lets go. Highly recommended.Talia Carner, author,Puppet Child and China Doll"},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"The term \\"hard to describe\\" comes to mind after reading the final page and closing the book of these wondrous, sad, lovable, heroic set of stories.As the main character, Hanna, plays out the highs and lows of her tragic life, Ursula Hegi writes from her heart of how difficult was the reconstruction of life for most Europeans after World War II.I was totally hypnotized by the magic of this novel.My mind wandered to stories I had heard.The suffering and hardships which had been spoken of by \\"real\\" people lingered in my psyche until now and will do so forever.I am totally mesmerized by the strength of those who have encountered a crisis of any kind.Thank you, Ms Hegi, for this beautiful account of an all too common tale.-Yvonne Bornstein, Author, Eleven Days Of Hell - My True Story Of Kidnapping, Terror, Torture and Historic FBI and KGB Rescue"},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"While I agree that it's not QUITE as good as Stones From the River it certainly is far better than most books out there.

While this is the first Ursula Hegi book I've read, it definitely won't be the last. This is a such a beautiful and brilliant collection of short stories. Most of the stories are told from the vantage point of Hanna Malter, a young girl whose mother is a painter and her father is a dentist, in post WWII Germany. They live in a small town, Burgdorf, about 30 minutes from Dusseldorf. All the stories are essentially character studies of various people from their village and the intertwined nature of their lives with the Malter's. There is not a bad story in this collection -- some are funny, some are disturbing, some are sad --- but all are wonderfully written and make you feel like a voyeur in this small town, learning all the hidden secrets of various people that permeate Hanna and her family's life.

Hanna's story jumps forward from the conclusion of \\"Stones from the River,\\" where she and Trudi had formed a strong bond. Here, though, we learn of a man who dreamed of his death, and in trying to stop it only perpetuated it. We discover the impetuous side of Hanna's otherwise dependable father. And we learn of Trudi's own romantic notions. While reading, I was reminded a number of times of Ray Bradbury's \\"Dandelion Wine,\\" except set in Germany.These are whimsical, magical, sometimes dark stories of one girl's childhood and those who shape her and her community.

It's a series of short vignettes about the people who live in a small German town in the 1950s. The narrator is a teenage girl, born just after WWII, and much of the novel deals with the consequences of war for the various townspeople. This is a town populated by a truly eclectic cast of characters. Hegi does an excellent job of delving deep into and developing each of her characters and their relationships to one another. This is the same town that was the focus of Hegi's novel Stones from the River, which is set in the same town in the interwar period and WWII. Some of the characters appear also in Stones, some do not, and they don't necessarily occupy the same places in each book. Trudi Montag, the central character in Stones from the River is far less sympathetic and far less interesting in this book. From publication dates it appears that Hegi wrote this book before she wrote Stones from the River, though I read them in the opposite order. The characters and life of the town are far more fully developed in Stones, though character development is still clearly Hegi's forte, even in this book. For those interested in Hegi's work, I recommend reading Stones first. Had I not had the background I did from Stones, I think I would have found this book less interesting."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"Ursula Hegi takes us back to Burgdorf in the 1950s, a time when WWII is barely spoken of in Germany, although its scars are everywhere. This time we get the stories through the Hanna Malter, born a year after the end of the war, as she struggles to make sense of her town and her place in it. Told as vignettes, rather than as a continuing narrative, Hegi gives her young narrator a keen eye to observe her town and a clear voice to tell us about them."},{"Title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"after WWII. Hegi is one the most lyric fiction writers going today.

Her grasp of human nature in all its facets gives the reader the option of simply enjoying the entertaining storytelling or to delve deeper and discover the more esoteric aspects of cause and effect that propel our lives.When in the mood for an overall uplifting, realistic read I suggest picking up this book.

What I really love is that the authors have obviously worked so hard to create a comprehensive, one-stop reference guide with all the vital information any parent could possibly need - in short paragraphs with simple instructions on how to implement various treatments and what to expect after treatment.There is more vital information here than in all my other natural health care books combined! Really. Facts that I had to learn from friends or the Internet (such as not to give astragalus when your child has a fever, or that some aromatherapies counteract the effect of herbal remedies) were all in this book, and I'm still discovering new information as I dig deeper into the book. You'll also appreciate the vast range of A to Z ailments that you can quickly look up, including common childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, chickenpox and many others (over 150 ailments to look-up). Other chapters include incredibly helpful information about what you can do to keep your child from getting sick not only now but for the rest of his life. Truly a one-stop holistic pediatrician shop!Thick with an abundance of resources, remedies, treatment options and descriptions, this is absolutely the very best whole-child health care material I have ever had the pleasure to place on my bookshelves. It is my new standard baby shower gift and one that every parent and caretaker should not be without. The next time your child gets sick, you'll have all your options at your fingertips, then *you* choose what you feel comfortable with. A very worthwhile book and one that you won't be disappointed with!"},{"Title":"Your Vital Child: A Natural Healing Guide for Caring Parents","review":"This is a must have for any parent, especially those who prefer natural care before seeing a doctor!

From pivot tables and charts to statistical analysis choices and applications which can be easily updated, no business user should be without Analyzing Business Data With Excel."},{"Title":"Analyzing Business Data with Excel","review":"The book has errors in its formulas. Even the data sets used throughout the book cannot be found on the book's website. It is also very dull to read. I feel like I am reading a dictionary or reference book. It could be better if they contained updates that fixes the errors in its formulas, provided exercise problems to practice all the Excel skills it tries to teach you, and provided a CD or website location that contains all the data for the examples the book uses. It should try to relate its examples to real world problems or projects that you would actually use in a job situation. For example, the book can try to build several Excel models, with each chapter building a function or module of the overall model. All in all, I would not recommend the book.

If the author would stick to one plot instead of trying to do so much in the short amount of space he has, I'd be grateful.

While there, a theft of a valuable Rembrandt painting occurred, and even though the magician has been cleared of the theft, he worries that his reputation will suffer if word gets out. So he asks Holmes & Watson to help him. The magician has been invited to return to Sandringham House to once again perform, and wants Holmes & Watson to accompany him & investigate the theft. Now that is a good plot, but instead of trying to flesh that out somewhat, we have two other plot lines that muddy what could have been a good story. -sigh-If you're planning on trying this as your first Holmes pastiche, don't.

I can't remember whether the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary was among the others, but I do remember being confused at some point in time by the similarities in appearance and name of these dictionaries. So I found the \\"No likelihood of consumer confusion?\\" review very helpful as I hadn't bothered to run it down so thoroughly. Thanks! It seems to me that only a legal system trapped in its own ever-diminishing circle could have concluded that there was no attempt by Random House to imitate.The dictionary, however, I have found to be excellent. In the three years or so I've had it I've found one mistake - a typo where \\"liberal\\" was used instead of \\"literal\\" in the definition of the word 'Pharisee'. I measure that against the innumerable occasions where its concise and elegant definitions have been a great help and source of knowledge. I really can't speak too highly of it, but I'll now just have to go out and compare it in my \\"relatively sophisticated\\" way to the Merriam-Webster."},{"Title":"Random House Webster's College Dictionary","review":"I have been using the Random House College dictionary since I received it as a gift in 1981.

I really wonder about all this confusion. I chose this dictionary as a desired gift because of its superior, clear definitions and wonderfully organized entries, which put the etymological references right at the end where we educated folks like to find them. My final decision as to which dictionary to buy rested on the full definition given of the word \\"megalomania,\\" which all the others merely listed as a psychiatric condition.

I found about 6 or 7 at the bookstore and spent some time reading each of them. I ended up choosing the Random House Webster College Dictionary. There were several features of this dictionary that I liked. It was easy on the eye: there was a little space between entries, which made words easier to find, and there was a minimum of abbreviations and symbols. Etymologies are placed at the end of an entry, rather than at the beginning. That means that what you see first are the definitions, not a line or two of technical information that most people don't read anyway. When a word has more than one meaning, the different senses are numbered 1,2,3...etc. I found this clearer and less confusing to the eye than 1a,b,c or circles and squares to categorize the various senses. I also liked that Random House lists the most common meanings first. Finally, and maybe most important, people look up words in a dictionary most often to find out what they mean. So any dictionary rises or falls on the quality of its definitions. With Random House, I found the definitions clear, straight forward and easy to read.I would have given this dictionary five stars, but I found the paper quality, which looks a little like newsprint, to be less than top quality and likely to turn color with age. All in all, however, this was the one I liked the best.As an added tip, you might want to check out the Random House thesausus, which I also gave my niece to complement the dictionary.

Appendices present Deren's articles in the \\"Village Voice\\" as well as manifestoes and program notes; a bibliography, filmography, and list of resources points the reader toward more useful and fascinating discussion of the film as trade and medium. Especially recommended reading for cinematography students, connoisseurs and critics, and college libraries and references shelves."},{"Title":"Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film","review":"To place the words \\"essential\\" and \\"Deren\\" in the same title, much less the same sentence, is quite ironic, for the essence of a thing was what most interested poet, dancer, and independent film-maker, Maya Deren. Editor Bruce McPherson has culled some of her previously published writings for Essential Deren.Deren, who was greatly concerned with \\"the distilled experimental emotion of an incident,\\" and who felt that it was \\"more universal and timeless than the incident itself,\\" was convinced that the film camera was the perfect medium to capture such a distillation. Her writings spend a good deal of time criticizing the general cinema of her day (most of the material here was published in the 1940's) because mass-market films, in her opinion, did not fully utilize the camera; she felt that cinema as an art form had scarcely been touched. She describes the camera as if it were alive, fraught with possibilities: \\"The complexity of the camera creates, at times, the illusion of being almost itself a living intelligence which can inspire its manipulation on the explorative and creative level simultaneously.\\" Recording fiction (general cinema) and reality (documentary) did not employ the camera's almost infinite possibilities and to ignore this potential, according to Deren, \\"constitute[d] a gross, if not criminal aesthetic negligence . . .\\"The camera, however, was not to create a series of disparate, unrelated images; the film-maker was an artist and everything created by the camera needed to \\"serve the original intent and idea of the film-maker: \\"Extending from theory to mechanics (including very practical chapters on lenses, tripods and frames), Essential Deren is an inspiring read for anyone interested in independent film-making."},{"Title":"Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film","review":"A fascinating collection of writings by someone who did not compromise on the idea of film as an art, as a form that did not necessarily need \\"story\\", and how story dominates everything we think film is now.

She was and remains essential, and any artist working in any art form can learn something here."},{"Title":"Essential Deren: Collected Writings on Film","review":"I love what Maya Deren has to say about film and its medium. This is a classic look at our ever beloved art, from (unfortunately), a very technical way. I believe that the most profound things can be said, most effectively, in a very simple way. She wrote probably like she thought and spoke...I just have to re-read most of it in order to understand it. Anyhow, will take me another year to finish, however, I'm determined to finish it, page-by-page."},{"Title":"The Dark Tunnel","review":"My expectations of The Dark Tunnel were rather low. After all, Kenneth Millar wrote it in the early 1940's. Well before he renamed himself Ross Macdonald and many years prior to finding the narrative voice that characterizes his \\"mature\\" crime novels.So, I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up this early entry in the Macdonald canon and found I could not put it down.The protagonist and narrator of The Dark Tunnel is Robert Branch, an assistant professor of English at a fictitious university located some 50 miles outside Detroit. On the same day he is rejected from enlisting in the Navy because of poor eyesight, Branch becomes embroiled in a fast and furious mission to expose a Nazi spy ring that has infiltrated his school's campus.To describe this compelling novel as fast paced would be an understatement. Much of it consists of nonstop action that unfolds like the TV show \\"24\\". But that's not its only virtue. The dialogue is wonderfully clever and the descriptive passages are remarkably original and evocative.Some readers may object to the insensitive and politically incorrect ways homosexuality is referred to in the pages of this 60+ year old novel. But one has to remember that the social mores of that remote time differ radically from those of today. Hence one has to judge the book as a product of its time.The Dark Tunnel is a very entertaining work of fiction. It demonstrates that Ross Macdonald's considerable talent as a novelist was evident early on and extends beyond the hardboiled crime genre. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Tunnel","review":"A fast-paced thriller from a man who is becoming one of my favorites. Good dialogue, full of frustrating dumb-asses who don't want to believe the truth, wiseacre humor. Already with this first novel, Ross Mac had learned to just tell the story and leave out extraneous stuff. There is both a literal and figurative \\"Dark Tunnel\\", and both are interesting. Great setting on a college campus. Far-fetched once or twice, but a really good read."},{"Title":"The Dark Tunnel","review":"This book is not Ross McDonald at his best. It's an early effort.I have several of the old paperbacks of his books still out there I got used from small retailers through Amazon, as well as some of his newly republished classics.

An excellent A to Z book for a beginner, as well as an intermediate kayaker. Very well written, magnificent illustations, great (British) sense of humor. The deficiencies: very vague on correct forward stroke techniques; describes many variations of eskimo roll, but again somewhat vague on how to learn to roll. Also the section on features of different kayak models is 15 years out of date, not updated for this edition.

However, he seems unable to clearly translate this teaching ability to print. This book reads like a laundry list of things to do in a kayak: equipment choices, paddle strokes, rescue techniques, rolling, surfing maneuvers, etc.; without rhyme or reason as to their purpose or when they should be executed. The book does cover a complete range of topics relevant to the sea kayaker: all topics just mentioned plus weather, tides, navigation, wind, etc. Unfortunately, many sections are out-of-date, such as the equipment section; a lot of information, such as that on nautical charts and on weather, is specific to kayaking in Britain; and some information, such as that on tidal currents, is just plain wrong. I did learn quite a lot from the sections on turning strokes and eskimo rolling, but not as much as I feel I should have and not enough to know where or when to use a particular technique. Overall, I was disappointed with the quality of instruction presented in this book."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Sea Kayaking, 4th (Sport)","review":"I found this book very helpful as I was learning kayaking.

For one thing, the argument is used that the land-trust technique touted by the author's real estate services company prevents the mortgage-holder from exercising a due-on-sale clause. Cleverly backed up by a partial citation of a federal regulation, but not true.This technique may indeed be valuable, may indeed make everyone feel safer, but the central premise is faulty.

Yes. It is a very very large dungeon.However, there are some serious flaws in the way this hugest of all dungeons was made. However, if you are willing to fix some of these, it could be a lot of fun. Here is what I would change:1) Add more monsters. Each level has about 3 or 4 different types of monsters. A floor with a hundred rooms should have a little more variety.2) Give the players a means of selling and purchasing items (hopefully magic items, since the dungeon seems to have almost none of them. Treasure is almost nonexistant, and much of it is laughable (like enormous tapestries which are impossible for a party to carry through the larger-than-life dungeon for months or perhaps even years before they get out).3) Add more of a story line. No group is going to want to traverse this dungeon for the next year or so just \\"to get out.\\" There is a plot to the entire dungeon...it is an enormous prison for demons which is run by celestials. However, several sections of the dungeon have been damaged and the demons are escaping. However, your party won't run into any of these creatures for a long time because there are none in the first two sections of the dungeon. Each section takes about 8-16 hours of game time to get through.For the money, it is a pretty good deal if you compair it with typical, smaller adventures. It is many times their size. Much of the text is devoted to monster stats and abilities. Several bosses' stats take up an entire page! I also agree with the reviewers who pointed out the numerous typographical errors in the text. It is almost comical.Basically, each level has three or four types of monsters, which are found in groups throughout the level. Each level has a couple of sub-bosses and one big boss. Some of which are easy and some of which are extremely tough. The first section, for example, has kobolds, orcs, troglodytes and fiendish darkmantles. A few rooms have swarms of fiendish rats or stirges. Our dungeonmaster threw in a trio of 4th level ogre barbarians on this level, which made it much more challenging and exciting.If you want to take a party from first to say, thirty sixth level or so in the same dungeon, this is it. The makers of the dungeon recommend that you limit the leveling to 4 per dungeon level, which is about half normal progression. This slow progression rate may be much too slow for some players, which means you have to use normal progression. If you use normal progression, the monsters become not much of a challenge, so you have to either level them up or change them entirely."},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"When our gaming group finished up its home-brewed epic campaign, we were looking for an alternate campaign that could fill some of the time while our regular DM worked out his sequel.

What about quality?Overall, the quality of the campaign is solid, though not perfect (more on that later). The dungeon is carefully designed in multiple segments that allow the DM to guide the players through sections balanced toward his party, or even theoretically split the dungeon into multiple smaller dungeons. Every encounter block is laid out in full detail, including all the vital statistics for all monsters and traps. The encounters also include specific help on scaling difficulty up or down to make things as challenging as desired every single combat. As a whole the campaign spans from level 1 to 20 and beyond, so there's something for everyone and everything can be tailored to your liking.The WLD also has its share of background and story involved. The dungeon as a whole has an overarching premise that shapes the encounters and explains its origins, and the individual sections each have their own unique problems, politics and personas. It is, in many ways, more like a small underground city than a simple dungeon.So overall this is a solid series of adventures tied together in one underground campaign, and includes plenty of information for the DM to keep things running smoothly. It does suffer from some flaws, however, that would keep it from being a true classic.First, on the production side, the adventure has some glaring typos. Not a huge, huge number, but enough that you notice them and wonder if AEG should have spent a little more time editing the product before release. Nothing major, but with no official errata and a second printing seeming unlikely in the near future, it leaves the DM with the task of cleaning up a few errors.There's also some loose ends in the way the dungeon works that the DM has to decide on. How exactly do creatures survive in this enclosed environment? If you run the WLD as a single campaign, with the party essentially trapped inside for a really long period of time, how will you handle training and supplies? There's also the question of how to handle doling out experience, because the somewhat combat-heavy environment of the dungeon means that if you gave the players the normal experience per kill they would level up too quickly if you run the adventure as a single campaign. Unfortunately, it fails to have a detailed method of handling this, leaving it up to the individual DM to construct a method he likes. (In my case, I use a formula that takes into account how much of the dungeon the players have explored and the encounter levels of monsters and obstacles they have overcome.)Another area the DM needs to inspect is how and when to restrict access, if desired, to various sections, lest players wander too far and get into something well over their head without warning. There's also a question of scale, as the designers have left open for the DM whether to use five foot or ten foot squares on the maps. They designed the maps originally with five foot squares in mind, but in retrospect have recommended using 10 foot squares instead (which is what I use; 20 foot wide hallways makes more sense given the size of some of the inhabitants and the amount of traffic the dungeon had in its heyday). This difference of scale makes for a REALLY big dungeon, which is nifty, but it does lend itself at times to minor oddities here and there in some of the encounters.Finally, while the dungeon has a lot of interesting areas and a fair amount of political infighting (or outright warfare) between inhabitants, the initial sections the players encounter are mainly dungeon crawling through an abandoned, ruined area filled with nasty critters. Unfortunately, as our group has found in playing it out, the combats in that initial area tend to drag out a bit over time since the players tend to encounter the same sorts of creepy crawlies over and over. Yes, there's some variety, but over the course of time it's overshadowed somewhat by the fact that the majority of encounters are with a handful of particular monster types that have infested that area. So in the first group of sessions you end up with fairly similar fights, which gets a little repetitive. Fortunately, the problem is relatively short-lived in the scale of things, as moving to the next section of the dungeon completely changes the enemy makeup.So overall this is a solid, ambitious product that's an interesting read and, at the very least, provides a slew of adventures to try for all levels of play, and for the more enthusiastic gaming groups is an epic adventure that can last for years bringing players from level 1 to 20 in the process. The technical flaws in the product keep me from putting it in \\"instant classic must-have\\" status, and the high price tag means you might want to take a closer look at it before purchase to see if it's something you really want to do. After all, it would be a shame to spend $70 on a phonebook only to decide you're not going to run it after all.Bottom line, the World's Largest Dungeon is worth a look, especially if you're a fan of classic dungeon crawling. Minor flaws aside, an opus of this magnitude certainly stands out from the crowd. And any player group capable of completing it deserves a hats off. This aint your grandpa's dungeon crawl!"},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"This book (more of a module really) requires more unpacking and understanding than any other I have ever bought. Well worth the price it contains so many rooms, features, monsters and other accoutraments to make your average adventurer (read: my gaming groups) drool with envy. I am very pleased with this purchase, and I highly recommend it. A note of warning though is that you should be very ready to sit down and tdo a lot of reading should you wish to FULLY utilize this module in your gameworld. An 800+ page book is nothing to laugh at, even should you be a fast reader. The only downside I can consider to exist, is that AEG doesn't also sell a poster-stle huge map of the dungeon. Not wishing to reveal too much about this module, I will not say much more. Simply put then I bought it, loved it, and recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good ole dungeon crawl... for if you enter this one it may never really end ;)"},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"While this product is incredibly large, the title of it is a bit of a misnomer. It is not exactly a \\"dungeon\\" in-as-much as a prison located over various planes. There are numerous areas, or planes if you will, that are shaped as a dungeon level, so the feel is mostly there. However, a few are less dungeony than others. For instance, one area is outdoorsy filled with unicorns and elves; another is based on a fiery plane, and a deep, dark watery plane just to mention three.The writing is surprisingly good, considering the vastness that the authors and editors had to deal with. The encounters are well described with each \\"room\\" listing various elements, outlined in separate paragraphs, such as treasure, initial reactions, monster stats (not at the back of the book), Encounter level, and even suggestions on how to scale the room to make it easier or more difficult. I am quite impressed with this level of detail.I only have two quibbles, and both are significant enough for me that I knocked the rating down a star for each. My first is that I prefer a product that is designed to cover a lot of different aspects of play, and by drafting this \\"dungeon\\" as a planar escapade, the entry level characters are essentially forced to be prisoners as well. They are forced to travel plane-to-plane to escape; no opportunities to go back-to-town with bags of loot; no roleplay opportunities with town adventures. It is strictly a dungeon experience, period. Even though it is mentioned in the first chapter that a DM can decide to have the \\"dungeon\\" be an in-and-out experience, the writing doesn't easily support it as the progression is designed to be an \\"Escape the Prison\\" idea.The second quibble is the product cost. I would prefer a variation on adventures that can be purchased separately but be more fulfilling over the course of twenty levels. Not every player will want to be locked into a dungeon setting at every session. If the DM figures out a way for the players to exit the dungeon from time to time in order to accomplish some other goal, then the value of a self-contained 1-20 level adventure lessens as the DM has had to resort to other routes anyhow.In summary, it is a fine product. But be certain to understand its limitations before deciding to invest in the hefty sum required to purchase it."},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"Given the option I would have given the WLD 3.5 stars. It is ambitious, and the writing is surprisingly strong throughout. The premise is intriguing, and supports the environment well. But if the WLD has all this potential, why did my group play a couple of times, and then ask to play something else?Well, sometimes size matters for the wrong reasons, and the WLD loses a full star for being too big for its own good. Without spoiling anything, the WLD is divided into \\"sectors,\\" each with a thematic link. But given the designers' desire to make sure they held the undisputed claim to the title \\"largest,\\" they traded bulk for pacing. No matter what the backstory, there are only so many dire darkmantles that any group is interested in facing, for instance. And if the fights lose their tension, they become repetitive. Then the game slows and the players lose interest.So fine, the DM can change the encounters to perk them up. Well, now you (the purchaser) have the chore of reworking the thematic element of the sector or choosing to ignore it. If you choose to ignore it, the dungeon suffers, and becomes a \\"fight club\\" venue where random monsters wait in random rooms with no regard to the overall ecology of the sector. You don't need to drop a large wad of your cash on this book to get that. On the other hand, if you simply remove the redundant encounters, the already large amounts of empty space become even more empty. I don't know too many groups that are thrilled by mapping an endless variety of rectangular rooms.Another 1/2 star comes off for the maps. They are big, and there are a lot of them, but they aren't very interesting. No stairs, no tunnels, no balconies, no towers, no height variations, nada. To be fair, it's not all bare rectangular rooms, but enough of it is to get tedious (again, the size issue.)Dungeon crawling is fun, and it has a fine tradition in D&D.; But the most beloved dungeon crawls (Tomb of Horrors springs to mind, or Hidden Shrine of the Tomoachan) always had a little something extra that piqued the imagination; good descriptions and details that made the environment come to life and a sure hand on the pacing between combat encounters, traps, puzzles, and down time. In the end, I feel that the WLD lacks that sure hand in its attempt to fill space. Sure, there are interesting encounters and great ideas, as well as opportunities for role-playing and even some interesting tactical situations. Unfortunately, they are spread over too much time and area to keep the players interested.Do I feel cheated? No. Would I buy it again? Well, as I see it frequently offered here at 60% off its cover price, the answer is yes. But I must confess that it will likely sit on my shelf more as an interesting curio than get much use."},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"The book is hardbound and is very sturdy. It is bound in such a way that it will lay flat pretty much wherever you open it to. The layout is two column with pretty small text (I'd venture a guess and say around 6 - 8 pt.). Illustrations are grayscale and sparse. That is to say, you get an AWFUL lot of content in this book. The maps are very nice, color and are folded in such a way that each quarter of the map is 8-1/2\\" x 11\\"; perfect for scanning or copying.The introduction spends a few columns going over the real-world whys and wherefores of the WLD. It then launches into a game-related backstory for the WLD. The backstory is important if you want to use it as a cohesive whole. The designers include notes at the beginning on alternate ways of introducing the dungeon. It gives well over 20 reasons/hooks.After all the introductory stuff is out of the way, a mere 12 pages, we get into descriptions of things that aren't on the map. These include empty rooms for when the DM doesn't want to use what's in the region, or when they want an extra room to customize the experience. There are also some above ground encounters describe that lead to the first room of Region A.The room descriptions is where the WLD really shines. They include grey-box text for the DM to read aloud, information on encounter conditions, tactics (including stat blocks for every creature/NPC in the room), and scaling info for DMs who want to make the encounter more or less difficult.The storylines of the 16 regions are all interconnected, but it is done so in such a way that you can take one region out and run it on its own. I think this is a very cool way to handle an adventure this large. DMs won't have to run the whole thing straight through if their campaign won't support such an undertaking; they can pick and choose parts of it.In addition to areas controlled by monsters, there are also \\"safe\\" rooms buit in where the PCs can recuperate in relative safety. All of these are in the dungeon in a way that fits in with the logic of the location.The 16 maps all connect and can be laid out and one giant, wall-sized map. The \\"outside\\" of the dungeon has passageways that lead off to areas not detailed, allowing creative DMs room to customize their WLD experience, or allowing them ways to get higher-level characters into regions built for more powerful characters, thus avoiding the regions for lower level characters (e.g. Region A, designed for levels 1 - 3). That's pretty good foresight on the part of the designers.The WLD is a huge undertaking for any group. I did notice a few errors, particularly in some room descriptions where they've been written as though the PCs enter from one direction, but there are multiple entrances to the room. But, these errors don't detract much from the enjoyment factor of this product. As I've mentioned, it's mind-bogglingly huge, and I can only imagine the amount of effort editing this monster was. I've seen more errors in TSR products (during the lean years of the mid-90's) that are half the size of but one region. A lot of people will balk at the $100 price, but astute shoppers can get this at substantial savings from online vendors. If you look at it from the prospective of 16 different dungeons (since each region can be run as a stand-alone adventure), then $100 breaks down to a reasonable $6.25 per region. If you want to challenge your players with a good old-fashioned dungeon crawl, the The World's Largest Dungeon is a good investment and will keep you busy for several years."},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"My group and I have only played through the first zone, and we've had fun doing it, but the game is seriously lacking in some respects. First of all the traps in the dungeon have unrealistic expectations for the level of characters it was built for. When traps, secret doors, and locks require a rogue to roll an 18 to a 20 to deal with it, that is an unrealistic expectations. The party rogue in our game has died twice now and we lost our party cleric at the last session (granted his death was bad tactics not bad design).Also my characters and I have been frustrated with the structure of treasure in the dungeon. Some rooms are chalk full of treasure and all you have to do is stumble on the room. Other times you'll fight a CR 5 encounter (for a party of levels 1-2 thats really tough) and they'll get next to no treasure. Also a lot of the treasure is pointless for the game, there needs to be more equipment treasure (weapons, armor, useful eqipment, common expensive spell components, and so forth), all the gold and jewels don't matter if the party reaches it's carrying capacity and has no where to spend it.The Wererat Sorcerer that is the \\"boss\\" of Region A was a disapointment. The party had very little difficulty with him.Also a lot of the material, and I mean A LOT is still written for v3.0 and not up to current 3.5 rules like the advertisments claim. This hasn't been a huge issue thus far because my group and I know the rules well enough to know what is stupid and messed up.All that being said the book provides a decent frame work for someone who know's what they're doing. But that's all it is a frame work. The Dm really needs to craft most of it himself which is self defeating to the product."},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"840 Pages...16 full color maps...1600 rooms...yeah..ok that is big. Very Big. Guesstimates are anyone's...uh...guess as to how long it might take a party to get through this massive adventure but based on average play I'm going to say 1 to 2 years. You could conceivably raise a party from first level to, oh gosh, I don't know...the mid teens if not higher. Level 20 certainly would not seem out of the question I would hazzard to guess. Each of the maps represents one section of the book, which then is obviously broken down into 16 sections. The maps also connect to each other. Each section has it's own background to it with its unique encounters. It will be up to the DM to maybe establish a room as a safe haven. Why? Because once you get into this thing, you're basically not getting out until you're finished. EAch section has it's hierarcy of monsters with a boss.Now, this presents a major challenge to both players and DMs. is the commitment going to be there to play this thing through. For the DM who is investing the money (and at Amazon's discount of $40.00 it really isn't that bad) he's probably not going to be to happy if his players want to opt out after awhile. That's going to be up to the DM to allow an escape clause or not which I don't see as a problem. There are other issues too...you found the treasure? Gems, Jewels, golden idols? Guess what..there's no way of getting out to sell the stuff for Gold and buying better equipment. So as a fair DM, you'll have to maybe compomise and have the players find better armor or weapons or take them off monsters or whatever. Delving into this huge crawl your players could, if they wanted, really hand around the beginning levels and rack up experience through exploring the entire map and random encounters. As the DM you'll need to find a way to move them along after they've achieved sufficient level.There have been complaints from other reviewers that the Dungeon is boring and that many rooms are empty. So guess what..the good DM comes up with a way of making it more exciting. Maybe you had some more encounters and populate some of those empty rooms. Who says this has to be played straight forward as written? I think the designers did an admirable job of describing the dungeon and making it unique but still, with over 1600 rooms how unique can you be?At it's core, the World's Largest Dungeon is old-school, roleplaying...the early 80's, stay up all night eating pizza and doritos kind of hack-n-slash adventure that many RPG veterans will remember from the good ol' days when we used to say, \\"Plot?

It does have some high points and low points that I wished I had known about before purchasing it.First off, if you want a dungeon crawl, this is for you. It's massive in scale, and there's really not all that much prep the DM has to do beforehand. Reading the intro flavor text of the region your party is in will generally cut it as long as the players don't mind you pausing to preview some of the more complex rooms when you encounter them. Of course, there's a lot of possiblity for customization. I found entire rewrites and themes online that people had tried out and has good success with.As long as you keep in mind that any of this can be adapted whenever necessary, it won't get boring. That said, a lot of content in each region can be repetitive. It's an intended aspect, as each region of the dungeon is meant to have a theme. It's executed fairly well except for the fact that regions can take a lot of time to get through, and it becomes fairly tedious killing a 14th group of darkmantles. So, as a DM, do some improvising. Throw in a miniboss or maybe just some different creatures whenever you feel it's necessary to keep the players on their toes.Now a few negative points. First of all, the book needs some serious editing. There are lots of mistakes. Many rooms descriptions don't correspond to the maps provided. These mistakes are difficult to spot beforehand, and they're difficult to clean up during a gaming session. If you go with the map, you have to adjust the room description and encounter on the fly, which can be tricky. If you go with the text, you have to restructure the map which can be downright impossible. Sometimes, events happen ignoring that the map specifically prohibits that from occuring. My best advice in this situaiton is to simply explain to the players beforehand that there are some problems with the module that will have to be worked out during the game. All of my players are okay with it, and we use those opportunities to take bathroom breaks, get food, etc.Another problem is the level of detail the book goes into. I find myself having to give players hints more often than not. Some of the solutions to puzzles (usually optional ones) are just so vague that I can't imagine how anyone could figure it out without reading the DM-only text. It's quite a shame, because it seems like so much work was put into some parts of the book that players just glaze over.A big problem is the complexity of some of the maps. Here are your options:1. Have super genius players with a knack of cartography and a photographic memory.2. Have players with a knack of cartography and a lot of time and paper.3. Find some way to give your players the map. I added maps to some sections of the dungeon (such as the library in Section E and Longtail's room in Section A) and made one of the players take ranks in Profession(Cartographer) so that I didn't have to continually say, \\"There's an 80-foot hallway that forks to left and right at the end and that has two doors on the left at 20ish and 50ish feet as a door on the right at 70 feet.\\"One final point of contention is party balance. If you give standard XP, your party will be far too high level for the encounters. The book explains this. My players, however, felt that they were getting the short end of the stick when they realized they weren't leveling up as quickly as the PHB/DMG says they should be. WLD explains why this is and how to explain it to players, but my players still didn't like it. In the end, I ended up giving them standard XP (thus making them more powerful than the book intends) and simply using the guidelines given in the book to make the encounters more difficult (and adding my own touches more often than not).To sum up, if you're looking for a big dungeon crawler, this will do the job. That's not to say that there aren't good opportunities to roleplay. My party has had some interesting experiences including some with minor NPCs. It really just depends on how much the players are interested in it. You'll need to have some players that are understanding of the flaws of the book and willing to cooperate with you on that point. Don't be surprised when a left turn takes the party to a room that doesn't look like the map shows, because it happens.There's really a sense of accomplishment when you (as the DM or a player) get through the World's Largest Dungeon. I just wish it were a bit more DM friendly."},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"I bought this with the hopes that it would be a good old dungeon crawl with all the great things we all love about a dungeon.

So far, the game has presented about five or seven sidebars each one talking about how a normal aspect of DnD is somehow bad or wrong and how the DM is supposed to control that. Fine.The issue is that, the book seems to try and force itself on the game, rather than work with it. The DCs in World's Largest Dungeon are set so that, supposedly, a character of average skill would always succeed on a ten, and the book says \\"Oh! Don't let your players take ten gyuh huh.\\" Bull. If you don't want a character to take ten, have the DCs routinely be 11 + predicted skill to 15+. Taking ten is a sacrifice of the ability to bypass very difficult occurences by chance. And as for taking 20, they're completely wrong: taking twenty requires that an event be allowed to be performed multiple times. If it can be performed multiple times, a player can just perform it multiple times until they get a twenty (obviously, DMs that have the approach of \\"I roll all your rolls for you\\" can avoid that problem). But the point is, that's how it's supposed to work: That's what taking twenty represents. A book that says this is wrong is essentially ignoring the implied aspects of the rules.Apparently, the book wants you to have a 55% chance of success, not a 100% chance or a 0% chance. Of course, the funny thing is that if you average those two out, that becomes a 50%.Seriously: World's Largest Dungeon is like every other book not made by Wizard's of the Coast. Because it doesn't have the mind of the creator of d20 and DnD, it doesn't pay enough attention to the *system* and ends up coming short. One thing I will admit is that there's no possible way to create a dungeon this gargantuan and have characters not over-earn XP, save perhaps by barring random encounters (adding set encounters in at set times).This book *is a novelty item* You can run a campaign with it, but any decent DM is going to require as much effort interpreting and using this book as creating a simple campaign. If you have nothing else to do, it makes for an OK standby, but as far as practical DMing material goes, it's a no-show"},{"Title":"World's Largest Dungeon (Dungeon & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","review":"This book is certainly large, and with all of the maps, a value, but a GM will need to modify it heavily to suit his campaign in order to make it useful.As other reviews have stated, there is not a lot of variety and it can get just plain after you have played a level or two."},{"Title":"U.S. Policy Toward China: An Introduction to the Role of Interest Groups","review":"I must admit I expected better. As a former student of Dr. Sutter's at George Washington University, I eagerly anticipated reading U.S. Policy Toward China: An Introduction to the Role of Interest Groups. I expected to read an extended analysis on how the drift and confusion of post-Tiananmen policy toward China was the result of a multi-pronged assault by various inside-the-beltway interests groups. While Dr. Sutter does eloquently explain how many of the interest groups more actively involved in China policy are working at cross purposes, he fails to convincingly explain how these groups have actually influenced the policymaking process.Instead, Dr. Sutter's work appears to be a combination of an exquisite overview of China policy between 1989 and 1997, with a cut and paste appendix listing a multitude of private and non- profit groups with an interest in China policy. The only tangible connection between the main overview and the appendix is the title of the book. Perhaps unintentionally, this is Dr. Sutter's point. For all the light and heat interests groups generate in trying to influence China policy, their overall effect in actually altering the formation of China policy may be minimal at best. With interest groups often pursuing narrow and contradictory goals, their influence on the overall policymaking process can only be detrimental.Dr. Sutter's solution is to implore the U.S. government to continue pursuing policy goals that serve the national interest, while consulting with the multitude of interest groups at an earlier stage in the policymaking process. Does Dr. Sutter feel these interest groups have positive insight to offer? This question is unanswered. However, &quot;consulting&quot; with interest groups early on the process does have the effect of allowing potentially disruptive groups to feel that their point-of- view does matter. Even if their policy prescriptions are not accepted, at least these groups can feel important. Earlier consultation of interest groups in the policymaking process strokes the egos of their leaders and membership and can help co-opt potential opponents into supporting a particular policy that they would not normally support. Style over substance matters above everything else in Washington and allowing interest groups to feel self-important, even if they are truly ineffective, does buy political breathing space to implement policy without fundamental alteration.My feeling is that U.S. Policy Toward China is a Congressional Research Service briefing paper that somehow grew outside of its intended purpose. With his overview of China policy and his chronology of post-normalization events serving as the pillars of what could have been a groundbreaking study on post-Tiananmen China policy, the work is severely weakened by its lack of connection to its title. The end result is a disjointed book that fails to live up to its promise."},{"Title":"The Trouble on Janus","review":"With three beeps in the night, Jack Jameson and Danny One Jameson are off on their final adventure. This time, Dr. Leopold Atkins needs them to find out what's happening on the distant planet of Janus. He's recently gotten an order for a robot to be the royal robot buddy to the young prince. The suspicious part is that the robot is supposed to be programmed to obey the Duke without question.With the application of freckles, Danny and Jack look just like the prince. But a last minute problem makes Jack take the place of the robot. Can he maintain his cover? Where is the real prince? Is there any way Danny can help Jack out of this problem?When I discovered there was a fourth book about this pair, I was thrilled. Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to the last couple in the series, even when I was a kid. First, Danny hardly has more then a walk on part, a definite downgrade from the other books. Second, the coincidence of Jack and Danny looking so much like the prince was too much to swallow. Finally, the two communicating solely through ESP was too convenient for my taste.Overall, I do like this book, however. The alien planet is truly foreign and really captures the imagination. The plot takes a few unexpected twists I really enjoyed, and it's hard to figure out how Jack will make it out alive. Finally, watching Jack slowly get some skill in poetry, his school assignment before they leave, is a nice touch and fun to watch.While not up to the last couple of books in the series, this story still has plenty to offer a fan of Jack and Danny. Even with its flaws, I enjoy it."},{"Title":"Pharmacotherapy","review":"The 2005 edition of Pharmacotherapy is one of the best investments I have ever made.

Jung's life and his humble experiences. I have read his other works, includingMan and His SymbolsandDreams, and never fully understand them until I read this last book of his to which brings it all together in terms of his scientific approach. This 400-page book is a window into his inner world, and it is such a remarkable read.In this book, Jung revealed much wisdom and insights from his early years up to his remainder of his life. One even can learn about oneself from his life. It is very much worth reading. It is both fascinating and inspiring.My favorite line of Jung from this book:\\"As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.\\""},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"At one point in the largely fascinating hodgepodge of his remiscences, musings, and summings-up of his life and work, aka \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections,\\" Jung makes a startling admission, the implications of which, if he notices at all, go unremarked upon. That is, Jung describes the development of his psychoanalytic system as driven by his desire to fit his own experiences--many of them unconventional, inexplicable, if not downright paranormal--into some order of normality. \\"I may be insane,\\" he might well be saying, \\"but if I can fit my experiences into a coherent template and demonstrate that a lot of other people's experiences can also be explained thereby, then I am perfectly sane.\\"This attitude doesn't invalidate Jung at all; it merely honestly affirms the solipsistic basis of all our so-called rational thought. We use reason to rationalize how we intrinsically are the way a lawyer uses argument to defend a murderer. Nothing wrong with that...especially when someone is brilliant enough to come up with an explanation that rationalizes--and thereby normalizes--a good deal of the rest of us in the process.This celebrated book is not so much an autobiography, it's not even completely written by Jung, but sort of cobbled together from a variety of source material, some of it by Jung, some of it transcriptions of what Jung said, all of it, we're assured, overseen by Jung and given his imprimatur of approval. Jung himself makes it clear that this book isnt to be taken as strictly biographical inasmuch as he believed, quite rightly, that autobiography inevitably becomes either hagiography or apologia.By way of contrast, what Jung does here is give an account of the major events of his life, (including his psychic life--the dreams, visions, etc) that shaped his work. As a result, \\"Memories, Deams, Reflections\\" is a curious blend of intimacy and impersonality. Jung divulges the content of some of his most harrowing dreams, but at the same time he manages to give away almost nothing of his personal life with family, friends, lovers, etc.I find it puzzling that where psychoanalysis is still considered seriously at all, it's dealt with in almost strictly Freudian terms, as if Freud's bacon hasnt already been fried and refried, his water carried and carried back, enough times already. Jung is saying something entirely different than Freud, something, it would seem, far more cogent to our times than Freud's reductionist psychological materialism, which seems now so much a product of the late 19th century. Is the relative marginalization of Jung a judgment passed by the academic elite that Jung, always abundantly more popular, especially among New Age types, is considered a bit of a crackpot, a pseudo-scientific fabulist akin to a Tolkein or a C.S. Lewis, a mystico-literary curiosity suited more for artists and occultists, and not for serious-minded medical men?Jung is often derided as a god-obsessed, would-be prophet of the New Aeon (as opposed to Freud's scientific atheism), but a careful reading of Jung's reflections in this book shows the matter to be quite different. What Jung tried to point out is that the \\"god-need\\" in our psyche is real, even if god, per se, is not. Human beings have a need for \\"religion\\" almost as desperate as their need for air. And if it isnt Judaism or Islam or Christianity that satisfies this need it'll be something else, like Marxism, Fascism, Scientology, Environmentalism, Statism, Satanism or any one of the ten-thousand-and-one \\"self-evident truths\\" that people will cook up in order to provide a transcendent meaning to their lives. One look at the rabidity of some radical green activists, for instance, is enough to convince you that worship of God has been replaced in their minds by worship of Mother Earth, and the violent fanaticism that led to Inquisitions and Crusades in the one instance is never far from the surface in the other. Our age has its sacred cows just like any other and those who dont worship them are subject to ridicule and ostracism just like they've always been.Wherever one god is overturned, another rushes in to claim his place. The throne is never left empty for long. Our psyche, it seems, abhors a god-vacuum.This is an important insight into liberating ourselves from the notion that we now stand liberated from the need for god. That notion, perhaps more than any other, has led to some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century.What Jung points out more than anything else is the limits of reason, boundary beyond which science cannot go. The psyche, he argues, has its own reality and its own needs and they cannot always be squared with what is reasonable or scientific. During a period of intellectual history in which we've been led to believe that science could provide us with verifiable answers to all our questions if only we were clever enough to understand them, Jung's insistence that there exists a class of \\"truth\\" that cannot be categorically proven-- except, perhaps, by gathering evidence of its traces in what is common in our dreams, histories, and cultural artifacts--must almost by the definition of \\"science\\" be regarded as a form of mystification.Thus, Jung's rather ill-deserved reputation as a \\"mystic,\\" \\"prophet,\\" and \\"sage.\\" If he were any of those things, it was only incidentally. As \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\" amply points out, Jung approached his project with intellectual and scientific rigor, even to the point beyond which science, and to some extent, intellect itself, could not go. At that point, he rather courageously refused to dismiss what could only be limned darkly and sought instead \\"proof\\" that it might well exist in the abiding need we have for it to exist. Jung is something of an archaelogist of the psyche. He searches for traces at the bottoms of consciousness, he reconstructs the bones of giants (the Archetypes), and he identifies their evolutionary descendants in our own shifting times.If god were a brontosaurus long extinct, he's left his tracks in the ossified mud of the lower layers of our brain. No one may ever have seen a brontosaurus in the flesh, but something left those tracks, something left those bones, something Big.If Jung is a \\"Christian\\" as he's often maligned to be, than he's the sort of Christian who would have been burned at the stake. Jung's idea of \\"Christianity\\" is one of perpetual heresy, of a \\"god\\" in a constant state of development--an idea that he took a lot of heat for in his book \\"Answer to Job.\\" Jung's notion of religion was always, first-and-foremost, one that demanded an on-going personal relationship between the individual and whatever he might conceive as \\"god.\\" In the absence of such a relationship, man's connection with god withers; when god stops growing and religion stops developing than Christianity (in this case) ossifies and dies, just like any other mythologyWell, Im in Florida at the moment, in a hotel room, lying next to my boyfriend--its nearly 6pm and we've been out all day. I think I'll give him a massage; altho he might have drifted off to sleep, in which case, I'll let him nap for a while. Anyway, while I'm off taking care of that, I really think you should begin reading \\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\"--its gotten me back into Jung and reminded me of why I used to love him so much. I've started drawing mandalas; I'm whistling a happy tune; even my coffee tastes fresher.

Jung talksabout his astonishing life and experiences (includingdreams, visions, hauntings and other aspects usuallytalked about obscurely and mystically if at all) as simplyand honestly as if he were sitting in your living roomsmoking his pipe."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"If a regular person described the things that Jung describes in this biography, you'd say \\"this person is completely insane\\".As far as I can tell, Jung was utterly insane by any definition of the term. He was having day long conversations with voices in his mind, seeing visions that you'd laugh about if someone told you. Once, he recounts going on a long trip with a friend, then decided to go home (they were days or weeks away from home, and hadn't reached their agreed upon destination) because he'd had a dream the night before. OK. You feelin' OK there, Carl? Hello? Anybody in there?...Earth to Carl!Notwithstanding the fact he was evidently off his rocker, his ideas have been tremendously influential in a huge number of artists' lives and work, not to mention millions of \\"regular\\" folks.In this book, he details his life long search for, and identification and exploration of the soul. He firmly believed there is a soul, and I must agree with him that those who think life doesn't have any purpose just aren't in touch. Regardless of religious belief, Jung believed the real purpose in life is to explore consciousness to the fullest during the short time we're here, and search for that little speck of light that will carry the soul into the next stage.Mind blowing stuff to be sure. Forget about conventional organized religions. You can pray all day long to an absent God with a congregation who think they're going to \\"heaven\\" if they just do the \\"right thing\\" while keeping an angry God at bay.But, if, on the other hand, you're on a real spiritual journey, Jung can provide your road map."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"...my only complaint is that his family hacked out all the &quot;controversial&quot; stuff.

Don't misunderstand - I liked it but found myself a little bored at times. However (let the contradictions cease!!) I liked the format of this book as autobiogrpahy more than most of the others I have read. I would recommend this to people who want to know about him and the way he thinks (the way he became enlightende) but I would recommend some of his others book for those looking to be enlightened!Thanks"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"As I began to read this book I immediately noticed that I was relating to things in Jung's life that I have never been able to express to other people. So here I knew that I had found a man that could express very complicated ideas and I pressed on hoping that we would be more and more alike. In fact we were and I am so happy to realize that others feel the things that I have always thought were unmentionable, or didn't even realize were there until they were gently raised to the surface.There were times while reading the book that I got bogged down in the complexity of what was being said only to have a huge &quot;OH!&quot; when I finally understood what Jung meant and how I identified with it so deeply. My pattern of reading the book was to read for awhile and then put the book down (I could only take so much at once) for awhile to let things settle in my mind. I have had several powerful dreams while reading this book and had them analyzed. After things settled a bit I would be &quot;called&quot; by the book and pick it back up and sure enough WHAM it would hit me again with something and I would have to work though it again. This continued until the end of the book.My life is slowly changing because of this book and others of his.

Yes, the book is excellent. Yes, it contains invaluable thoughts from Jung. Yes, it is a must read for any Jungian or anyone else for that matter. However, there is something that should be taken special note of. If, when reading the first few chapters on his early years, you find yourself identifying very closely with his experiences, beware. It is well known that many people experience synchronicities while reading this book. Example: a person may have a dream, and the next day find that very dream explained in the book, wherever that person left off reading the day before. These synchronicities can have a very large effect. If you are one who finds yourself identifying with jung's thoughts and feelings to a high degree, you may experience more than just dreams. The book becomes an integral part of your life. It won't let you skip around or stop reading it for too long. You will be bound to the book to finish it in order. When you reach the 10th and 11th chapters in which he describes his afterlife experiences and thoughts, be extremely careful. You may enter into that same \\"shadow of the valley of death\\" while you are reading this part. This is not a book to be taken lightly. It gives you knowledge coupled with experience, not just knowledge. Do not bother opening it unless you want to embark on a serious psychic journey, which will result in increased wisdom and understanding through many unforseen experiences.

Self-involved, Jung loved himself. Perhaps his fans/followers will love him more. Me? Not so much."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"When I first began my exploration into Carl Jung's ideas, I started with a Jung introduction written by another author. Realizing that was getting me nowhere, I went straight for the horse's mouth, and bought Jung's autobiography. One of the best literary decisions I've ever made. This book is one of the most fascinating things I've ever read, and is worth ten Jung introductions. In it, we get to experience and see the world through Jung's eyes. Jung had a beautiful way of expressing himself, so that much of his prose reads like poetry. He does an excellent job of trying to communicate through those completely uselss things we call words the inner reality of the human experience. Jung refers many times to his ability to see a world that apparently other people couldn't see. He does an amazing job of helping the reader to see what he saw, even at the expense of his own ego. When he was young he fancied himself a bit touched, and I have to admit that after reading the kinds of things that went through his mind as a boy that I thought he must have been at least half insane. His experience with \\"the will of god\\" in particular left me shaking my head, thinking, \\"And we've based our knowledge of psychology on this guy?\\"I think when he was a boy Jung was indeed a little crazy, and maybe it was that slightly off-kilter mindset that allowed him to become such an excellent psychotherapist. He steadied out as he got older, and thankfully stopped having dramatic visions of god doing disgusting things.Jung also provides some excellent insight into the character and mind of Freud. Freud too was a little nuts, and Jung makes no bones about showing us this. He reinforces the notion that everything should be taken with a grain of salt, even the most revered ideas of the world's greatest thinkers. Truth changes, and is relative to the environment in which it is perceived.My only criticism of the book stems from Jung's musings after he has detailed his relationship with Freud and other aspects of his academic career. He enteres a stage of his life in which he decides to \\"confront his unconscious,\\" i.e., to study it himself in as great a detail as possible. Here, Jung fades into a dreamy, imprecise rambling about what he calls his \\"fantasies.\\" Jung never explains exaclty what he means by \\"fantasies.\\" Is he talking about dream material, or waking reveries? Or is he referring to the mysterious \\"visions\\" that plague him from time to time? He doesn't elaborate. But he goes on for what seems like fifty pages at least simply rambling about nothing. He stops giving detailed examples as he did earlier in the book and loses himself in a kind of drug-induced reverie that leaves the reader standing out in the rain. I simplly did not know what he was talking about at this point in the book, and Jung should have done a better job at elucidating what kinds of things he was engaged in at this point of this life.Nevertheless, I would highly recommend this autobiography to anyone interested in Jung. Some small knowledge of psychological theories will help you out, but there's always a dictionary and wiki if you don't have that."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Very spiritually awakening philisophical book.A must read for anyone studying Jung or psychology.I had to read it for school but might have read it anyway on my own."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"In conclusion, after reading Jung, I came to realize that God is mistery itself.

Being a part, man cannot grasp the whole. He is at its mercy. He may assent to it, or rebel against it; but he is always caught up by it and enclosed within it. He is dependent upon it and sustained by it. Love is his light and his darkness, whose end he cannot see. \\"Love ceases not\\"--whether he speaks with the tongues of angels,\\" or with scientific exactitude traces the life of the cell down to its uttermost source. Man can try to name love, showering upon it all the names at his command, and still he will involve himself in endless self-deceptions. If he possesses a grain of wisdom, he will lay down his arms and name the unknown by the more unknown, ignotum per ignotius, that is, by the name of God. This is a confession of his subjection, his imperfection, and his dependence; but at the same time a testimony to his freedom to choose between truth and error."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jung was not only a brilliant intellectual; he was a traveler in consciousness whose key breakthroughs came from personal experience of nonordinary reality. Unlike some &quot;Jungians&quot; who have turned his terms and models into a catechism, he was constantly improvising and shapeshifting the language and concepts he used to evoke multidimensional reality. If he were still with us, he would be using a new vocabulary, and reporting from further frontiers. Read this account of his soul's journey to expand your horizons of possibility, and read Robert Moss' &quot;Conscious Dreaming&quot; and &quot;Dreamgates&quot; to learn how to practice the art of dream travel and visit the places where Jung received inspiration."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Since 1964, when I first read this book, I have covered lots of &quot;territory&quot; in religion, psychology, philosophy, and natural science. This book stands out as the most important. It formed the foundation for my deepest and most rewarding insights into human existence. &quot;By their fruits ye shall know them&quot; truly applies here, for this is the &quot;pick of the crop&quot;."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"One of the few \\"life-changing\\" books I've encountered. The book served as a gateway into the terrifying beauty of consciousness."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"When a friend introduced this book to me almost 20 years ago, it launched for me, a deep personal interest in the works of Carl Jung. I think this is an excellent book to start out with because it is Jung's telling of his life's story.Jung explains his early questions about God, his deep curiosity with the human mind, his work with psychotherapy and dreams analysis, and his fascination with the unconscious--which would eventually put him on the path to his life's work.Through this book, you can see how Jung developed his ideas and you can get a feeling of the passion that he experienced as he made his discoveries. This sense of development is especially helpful because it will lay down a solid foundation for later readings of his other works (such as his collection of lectures that were published in the Bollingen series).It will also help when you're reading other books about Jung that are not written by Jung. For the past 20 years or so, it has become quite popular to toss around the word 'Jungian'... almost making it a junk adjective like 'psychic' or 'cosmic'... There is a fair amount of misunderstanding about Jung's work. Even within the Jung Institute, you'll find some differences of opinion.For these reasons, the best place to start is with what Jung *actually* said. Also, if you have a basic knowledge of psychological terminology, this book is fairly easy reading."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jungs autobiography: Excellent as to understanding Jung's work, life and philosophies etc. This is the book to get if you are at all interested in Jung from an overall perspective i.e. from the cradle to the grave. I would also recommend the movie 'Matter of Heart: The Extraordinary Journey of C.G. Jung ' ASIN: B00028G6LC.As regards the field of psychology, you will have an understanding of how his views came about and developed. You will also understand Jung's relationship and split with Sigmund Freud (Archetypes Vs Libido). Personally I think both have merit, but to ignore Jung's philosophies associated with archetypes, is a grave error indeed. I still ponder on how Jung collected information from mental patients and discovered how their dreams etc had a common archetypal base.Even though I have a interest in psychology, the matters of the spirit are of greater importance to me. Jung's discovery of Archetypes, gave me a personal accepted understanding of the tree of life; a profound stepping stone upon the path from exotericism to mesotericism and gnosis. This is the greater message of Jung in my opinion.Added to this review years later: Yesterday I watched the movie \`A most Dangerous Method'. One can also see the movie \`My name was Sabina Spielrein'. These movies deal with Carl Jung's extramarital affair with his patient Sabin Spielrein. Points of discover: Carl Jung \\"that his own life was scandalously immoral on account of his sexual excesses and that he formally repudiated belief in Christianity despite his father's being a minister of religion. He saw the Catholic Church, with its dogmas and moral teachings as the source of all the neuroses which afflicted Western man\\" ([...])Points of consideration: Jesuit Catholic Luciferic deception i.e. spiritual head of the one world government, new world order. Universities generally teach Freud, why? Jung reveals man's spiritual reality. Add to this darwins THEORY of evolution inclusive of his families inbreeding which then saw his families members directly connected with the Eugenics movement. This is then used for racism and elitist theory regarding culling of humanity, also Hitler's final solution.Back to the Jesuits; we see the infiltration of the Christian churches with ecumenism, Loyola theology; a methodology to re-integrate the lost sheep of Protestant Churches. This also involves the new age religion, very sinister. Catholic Schism i.e. it hates Jung for Jung hating the catholic church and also revealing the spiritual side of man, who can have direct connection with God. Yet now uses Jung (with teachings on Imagination) associated with Teilhard de Chardin (Jesuit).Obviously, the Jesuit catholics use whatever methods they can get their hands on to further their ends. For me, when it comes to Jung, I still don't chuck the baby out with the bath water. I see that his teachings of dream analysis and Archetypes still have powerful merit. I also see that he was hated via the jesuit catholics for safe guarding the Gnostic library. The truth is a crack that runs very fine between a mountain of lies."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Jung's work is often difficult to read. This is an excellent introduction to his thinking, and a fine outline of his life. Man and his Symbols is also a good intro to Jungian thought.However, over long, somewhat pompous comments are really not appropriate. Jungians would call this inflation."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"&quot;Memoirs, Dreams, Reflections&quot; helped me to establish a contextual framework for understanding the life of this truly seminal thinker and his work. It is an excellent place to start before diving into some of Jung's often esoteric and abstract essays, transcribed lectures, and books.One of Jung's greatest achievements has been his ability to produce a new vocabulary for modern man to deal with the processes that occur where the personal psyche meets objective reality. His genius lies in his blend of deep intuitive thinking and strict scientific empiricism. Jung's contributions are still slowly trickling down into the collective understanding of modern culture."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Admittedly, this is the most important book for those interested not only in the Jungian approach in psychology, but also in the life itself of Carl Gustav Jung. Indeed, this is an autobiography, imbedded in which is most of Jung's theories and quite an adequate outline of his cosmotheory as well.Now, this being the book that &quot;allows&quot; us a glimpse into the soul of this psychologist, i was for one somewhat puzzled by the overall insight i got. While for the most part i appreciated Jung's bold approach in matters considered heavy taboos in his time (not to mention our time as well for certain particular issues), on the other side i found that Jung is self-contradicting at times, or murky, for lack of a more descriptive term.Jung dares to look on the &quot;other side&quot; and consider it openly an integral part of &quot;this&quot; side. What others deem as &quot;paranormal&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; is to Jung just the other side of the same coin. He discusses the reality under the accepted reality but he is not straightforward about it. If i wanted to take it far enough I'd even say he's not honest about it. He does mince hiw words much too often and stops short of telling you what he really thinks. But this hardly undermines his openmindedness. Same goes for his treatment of religion.In the beginning of the book he goes to great lengths in his denouncing of the western religion, and yet, all throughout the book he leaves countless hints that he's religious himself, without ever explaining in what sense. This was in my view perplexing.The part of the book where he details his views on psychotherapy and explains how he approached his patients is definately the highlight of this book, and it should be of paramount importance for those interested in that subject area.The last third of the book is mostly about Jung's travels. That part, might be disturbing for some, as one can sense that Jung felt some kind of well hidden superiority over the people he encountered. This superiority is often enough brought forward as his surprise over the insights these people offered him, but it still remains a mystery (at least to me) what he actually &quot;took&quot; from these people pertaining to their beliefs and approach in life. If anything, that is.All criticism aside, this is still essential reading. Jung was a person torn between the desire to explore the off-limits and his fear of being ostracised by the scientific community. In the gray area within that struggle is where one discovers Jung's most thought-provoking theories because that is where he presents himself bare."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I was at my local library looking for 'serious' books on dreaming. I was sick of all the flimsy material I was reading and wanted to find out what the big thinkers thought about the subject. This book came up in my library search and I picked it up thinking it would be a book about what a psychologist thought about dreaming - in all honesty I didnt know anything about Jung or had read any of his material. I started reading this book and found out I had picked up his memoirs, which was really disappointing for me as I dont generally like reading autobiographies of any kind - but I simply couldnt put the book down! The imagery of his language drew me in, and a simple sentence was enough to set me into a train of thought that could last for hours on end - it has simply been the most amazing book I have ever accidentally read so I had to buy it! This is not a book for anyone looking for hard facts about anything, but rather an exploration of this man's amazing life. The way he is able to weave the stories of his life together without sounding mystical, over analytical or insane is absolute genius. If you are caught up in the mysteries of the world and are looking for someone to identify with, then you cant go past the life of Jung."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Recently, I had an inexplicable craving for this book, which I first read when it was assigned by a high-school Teacher Who Changed My Life. This time around, I opted (in the name of time famine) for the abridged audiobook version, read by Michael York---a fateful decision, as it turned out, since the contrast between York's plummy, uppercrust English accent and Jung's retelling of his \\"personal myth\\" (not his life, but his inner life) is as uproarious as it is surreal. Shove one of these tapes into your car stereo and let the man who channeled the Collective Unconscious, psychology's answer to Lemuria---a consoling fiction that laid the cornerstone of the New Age (and obliterated beyond repair the notion that psychology was even remotely scientific)---provide a wonderfully incongruous voiceover to the geography of nowhere (Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Wal-Mart, Target, Costco...) as it flashes past.Thrill to Jung's formative childhood dream of a giant, one-eyed phallus sitting erect on a king's throne---a monstrous thing \\"made of skin and flesh, and on top there was something like a rounded head with no face and no hair. On the very top of the head was a single eye, gazing motionlessly upwards.\\" Gird up your loins for a week of fear-crazed bedwetting: \\"The thing did not move, yet I had the feeling that it might at any moment crawl off the throne like a worm and creep towards me.\\" The one-eyed trouser snake of locker-room lore, as reimagined by H.R. Giger! Pure terror! Listen, in rapt fascination, to the account of the female patient who believes she travels to and from the moon, where the moonpeople are threatened by a hypnotically beautiful vampire, who turns out to be a buried memory of sexual abuse, risen from her childhood nightmares. Laff until the tears run down your cheeks as Jung recounts the Battle of the Titans, in which he and Freud struggle for control of the historical narrative of psychoanalysis, each interpreting the other's dreams as maliciously as possible---as evidence of sublimated sexual pathologies, death wishes toward the father figure, or worse! (Profoundly unsettled by Jung's interest in the then-recently discovered mummies of pre-Christian \\"bog people,\\" Freud is convinced that the Swiss analyst's obsession with \\"these corpses\\" masks a death wish toward him, and faints dead away at the dinner table.)Jung's account of his childhood crisis of faith is worth the price of admission, all by itself. In it, we accompany the author on his way to school. Rejoicing in the chirping birds and exquisitely blue sky, he offers a silent prayer of thanks to the Creator God: \\"The world is beautiful and the church is beautiful and God made all this and sits above it far away in the blue sky on a golden throne and...and...and...\\" Suddenly, our narrator is struck with A THOUGHT TOO MONSTROUS TO THINK! Tormented for days by this soul-shriveling blasphemy, he finally decides, after much agony of mind, that God must have intended him to think this scaldingly sacreligious thought. This revelation \\"liberated me instantly from my worst torment, since I knew that God himself had placed me in this situation.\\" Abandoning himself to divine will, Li'l Jung allows himself to think the unthinkable: \\"I gathered all my courage, as though I were about to leap forthwith into hellfire, and let the thought come.\\" (Pregnant pause by York.) \\"God sits on His golden throne, high above the world and under the throne an enormous turd falls upon the sparkling new roof, shatters it, and breaks the walls of the cathedral asunder.\\" (That, Virginia, is why they call it a throne.) \\"I felt an enormous and indescribable relief; instead of the expected damnation, grace had come upon me, and with it an unutterable bliss.\\" (Where are the Farrelly brothers when we need them? Do not go in there!)Let that be a lesson to the morbidly religious among you---not to mention those bibliocentrists who turn up their noses at the obscure pleasures of the audiobook."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"It begins with his first memories, and ends with his near-death experience, weeks before his actual death. Precious few are the books that one returns to time and again, and this is one of those. The language is simple, magical, and, to use Jung's own term, numinous.What is most interesting: there is absolutely no mention of Jung's rape by an older man whom he regarded as a father figure, an incident which Jung confessed to Freud in correlation with his \\"religious crush\\" on his mentor. There are those that speculate it was this Amfortas-like wound that, after his break with Freud, deepened his crisis. But, it was also this crisis that propelled Jung into an explosion of creativity, the result of which was his groundbreaking Psychological Types and his soon to be released The Red Book."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Read along exploring the mind and spirit of this century's (and possibly the next) deepest thinker as he takes you on a reflective journey through his inner and outer lives. A wonderful book to bring us back to our grounding in the spirit. Jung not only speaks of but lives out the archetypal truths of mankind. His description and recounting of his discovery of the Biblical &quot;stone the builders left untaken&quot; which he had his builders use as the cornerstone of his castle is an inspiring revelation of a turning point in his life and beliefs from this most eastern of western philosophers. One comes away from the book with a fulfilling sense of wholeness that remains a part of the heart. It is a book to buy, read, and reread at different times throughout life"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This book does give a good overview of Jung's ideas, and how the developed in his life and interior thought. What I most love about this book, however is the feeling I came away with for Jung himself. It made me feel that he was a deeply compassionate, openminded and rational man, if imperfect as all men. Its greatness is that it puts a human face behind all of the science and ideas of his legacy, and gives the reader an insight of his own inner experience which one can relate to."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is to me the most important book I have ever read in my entire life so far. It has been my companion book for over 25 years now. The first time I read this book was a Brazilian 1975 Edition. A memorable translation. I did the mistake of lending it to someone else and I have never had it back. Then, three years ago, I found that Brazilian Edition and I bought it. I read it over and over, particularly when I needed someone to teach me something really important to my life. Then, I decided to taste the English (American) Translation. I bought this one. I wasn't disappointed. The translation seems to be very carefully done. But although it is a good edition it misses few paragraphs and letters if compared to the Brazilian edition I have. Was this English translation \\"censored\\" in any sense ? I doubt that. I simply think the translator just \\"missed\\" some pages of the original (in German) edition. I hope one day I will be able and have the opportunity to read the original in German to find out what Jung really meant by writing this monumental book.Oh, by the way, I have never read any of Jung's \\"scientific\\" books. This is by far everything I had to have to face Life and people and myself confidently. Jung is by far the wisest soul of the 20th Century.By all means, buy this book and read it!

I read an article in the New York Times about Jung's Red Book, which said he used much of the material that came forth during the time of its writing and illustration to co-author his autobiography (Dreams...). So since the Red Book wasn't yet published, and since it was $200 compared to $10 something for Dreams..., I purchased Dreams...Each day of reading this magnificent book was a splendid journey, a meditative circumambulation around one of Jung's (and our collective) mandalas."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This \\"mythical\\" (Jung's word) book on Jung's life is certainly a beloved \\"bible\\" of many Jungian analysts and devoted fans, many claimed to have re-read this book once every year or so (so as to have a closer touch with the psyche of the guru). Fair to say the book is rich in metaphysical speculations, Jung's web-of-dreams as demonstration of his mythical (alchemical?) life goal in understanding human psyche (his own individuation), his famous or infamous encounter with his own unconscious (the raw data as recorded in the Red Book has been an embarrassment of his descendants for many years), near-death experience (rich speculative materials for New Age mediators), and his life-after-death speculation has given rationalization for some current Jungian shrinks to treat patients based on the belief of a trauma happened in one's previous life....not to mention his UFO mention.Yet, Jung had categorically maintained that his analytical psychology belonged to the realm of natural science and that he himself was a scientist. As such, he never proclaimed the physical existence of metaphysical entities, though he didn't deny the possibility of such physical existence. This position is quite different from some current Jungian psychologists and new age fans of Jung. And Jung made this (him being a scientist) quite clear in the book. For example, concerning the \\"loud report in the bookcase\\" (p. 155) that Jung described as having meaning (i.e.\\"synchronized\\" with or even caused by his psyche), Jung gave the readers a fair view of Freud's scientific argument in Freud own words. I shall quote as length here because it shows the true character of Jung (p 361): \\"At first I was inclined to ascribe some meaning to it if the noise we heard so frequently when you were here were never heard again after your departure. But since then it has happened over and over again, yet never in connection with my thoughts and never when I was considering you or your special problem. (Not now, either, I add by way of challenge). The phenomenon was soon deprived of all significance for me by something else.\\" Jung didn't refute Freud's argument in his book.In summary, a book with excellent materials to study Jung from different perspectives. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I found this book both wonderful for all that it opens up as psychic possibilities, and sad for what it reveals of one of the &quot;enlightened&quot; minds of the times. The author's brief treatments of the primitive savage, the black servant, the exotic Oriental Other, and the madonna/whore are about as subtle and articulate of examples of ethnocentrism, racism, and sexism as you would want to consider. These passages recalled &quot;Into the Heart of Darkness&quot; ...the horror, the horror. It is also a sad &quot;autobiography&quot; that contains no treatment of the importance or meaning of one's spouse and five children, not to mention all the lovers. Jung appears to be a man who fought institutional rules, made his own, and then broke those,too. Most likely the experts who carry on his legacy have dealth with all this, but it left me wondering... if Jung (and his co-writer) was not capable of honestly facing his &quot;outer&quot; or worldly experience, why should I believe that he was capable of honestly treating his &quot;inner&quot; experiences? And if it's true his family edited out the difficult parts, it makes it even more suspect. The preface could have at least dealth with it.

I found it hard going and didn't inderstand it."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"&quot;What we are to our inward vision, and what man appears to be sub specie aeternitatis, can only be expressed by way of myth. Myth is more individual and expresses life more precisely than does science... Thus it is that I have now undertaken, in my eighty-third year, to tell my personal myth. I can only make direct statements, only &quot;tell stories.&quot; Whether or not the stories are &quot;true&quot; is not the problem. The only question is whether what I tell is _my_ fable, _my_ truth.&quot; (C. G. Jung, p. 3)If you're looking for a book &quot;about&quot; the life of Carl Jung, keep on looking. This is not so much a biography as it is a window into the process of Jung's experience. Think of this as Jung's &quot;case summary&quot; of his life. We don't read many of the amusing anectdotes, or &quot;objective&quot; critical insights that other biographies offer in abundance. Instead we get to experience Jung's auto-mythos for ourselves.Jung reveals much, imparts wisdom, offers us early memories, and paints the canvas of his life for us. It's an incredible gift from a wise and self-reflective man. Jung was not without his faults, as other biographers have pointed out, he had many--some quite appalling! More than one of his analysands became his lover--behavior that would cost him his license today. But again, this is material you should look elsewhere for. Here he ponders his fears, his weaknesses, the ones that he has already accepted and worked with.I recommend this book for people who have never read Jung before. It teaches more about his approach than any of his other books. It finds the meaning in his own life, viewed through his approach to life. &quot;Meaninglessness inhibits fullness of life and is therefore the equivalent to illness. Meaning makes a great many things endurable--perhaps everything.&quot; (p. 340)"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This book is less complicated than most of Jung's other writings and really explains the man Carl Jung.

I have read and re-read this work because at different times in my life I needed to re-evaluate where I was and where I was going.Other books by Jung are more intellectual and scientific, whereas, this autobiography has the wisdom of a person in the later part of life and it was written not so much to teach but to leave with us his legacy.Having myself had a near death experience, I was especially re-affirmed by Jung's own near death experience and his dealings with this phenomenon. His acceptance of his own humanity and his returning from this state to share with us his knowledge and vision is a gift to all of us.It is not easy to return to our humanity and deal with the sufferings we encounter but growth is the only evidence of life. We have to come down from the mountain top and work in the valley.This brings to mind two books written by Hannah Hurnard called Mountains of SpicesMountains of Spicesand Hinds Feet in High PlacesHinds' Feet on High Places. Allegories about living our lives with others and not in solitude.Solitude is a wonderful place but if we stay too long we become self-centered, afraid to reach out to others. Another author who gives a good perspective on life is Henri Nouwen and his books Out of SolitudeOut of Solitude: Three Meditations on the Christian Lifeand Reaching OutReaching Out."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"More than any other work in his oeuvre, Carl Jung's biography, 'Memories, Dreams, Reflections' (1961) takes the reader inside the mind of the eminent Swiss psychologist. Jung was both a self-admitted gnostic and an introvert, and this very personal account of his life, which he was completing at the time of his death, is correspondingly subjective in tone.Jung had a difficult but remarkable childhood, to which he devotes a substantial portion of the text. Both blessed and plagued by heretical visions which he was unprepared to understand or interpret (among them: God defecating on a cathedral; an enormous cyclopean phallus enthroned in a subterranean chamber), Jung also found himself unable to seek advice from his father, a country parson suffering from a crisis of faith, or his mother, whom Jung believed to have a weird and \\"uncanny\\" \\"second personality\\" which only emerged at night. In time, the awkward young Carl came to believe that he had a guiding \\"second personality\\" of his own, which he perceived to belong to a mature and intellectually accomplished man of 18th century Europe (as an adult, Jung would adopt another \\"psychic being,\\" whom he called \\"Philemon,\\" as his personal \\"daimon,\\" mentor, and guide). Already tending temperamentally towards remove from others, these experiences only acerbated Jung's boyhood sense of rural backwardness, loneliness, and social isolation.Due to both its subjective nature and the enormous scope of Jung's experiences and speculative beliefs, 'Memories, Dreams, Reflections' is the sort of book that hardline scientists and skeptics may scoff at, especially since Jung is largely concerned with discovering the liminal crossroads where objective truth, physical law, spirituality, and human psychology converge. Throughout his life, he also placed a tremendous value on the meaning of personal and collective dreams, both those he considered merely informational as well as those he considered prophetic and of a collective nature.Throughout the volume, anecdotes abound of seances, extrasensory perception, automatic writing, \\"poltergeist\\" phenomena, \\"meaningful coincidences,\\" alchemy, visitations from the dead, unidentified flying objects (which Jung, who never claimed to actually glimpse one, did not believe to be vehicles from other planets, though he didn't absolutely rule out the possibility), alternate dimensions, the Holy Grail, and, in one bizarre episode, a seemingly endless parade of merry-making phantom boys who pass by his lakeside home in the dead of night. Though Jung interprets this particular \\"haunting\\" in terms of local history, it's remarkable that he, who believes \\"the mythic side of man is given short shrift nowadays,\\" doesn't consider the trooping fairies of Celtic and Germanic folklore as any equally likely explanation.In another incident, he and companion, while traveling in Italy, spend hours admiring the interior of a cathedral, only to discover later that the mosaics they found so unforgettably beautiful did not exist, and never had existed.As unlikely a collection of first or secondhand experiences as the anecdotes may represent, Jung never allows his narrative to lose its tight focus or relate these incidences to his larger theme: the nature, development, and evolution of human consciousness. However, in genuine gnostic fashion, he is quick to remind his readership that human perception is always ultimately subjective, and that, while \\"facts\\" certainly exist, no man can claim to know what the absolute truth is about any facet of reality.'Memories, Dreams, Reflections,' which was completed from notes after Jung's death by associate Aniela Jaffe, does not pretend to be a work of science (and, appropriately, is not an official volume in Jung's Collected Works), and is in fact far more concerned with ethics, spirituality, faith, and consciousness. One of the book's greatest achievements is its narrative power, which never flags, no matter how potentially obtuse the point is that its author is attempting to make. Throughout, Jung's tone is also uniformly humble and sincere, and his conviction in his beliefs, electrifying.Jung's ultimate message for mankind and mankind's future is clear: \\"Man's task...is to become conscious of the contents that press upward from the unconscious. As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.\\""},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I think Carl Jung was very ahead of his time and he was in sense an explorer like Columbus, except that his territory was the vast space of his own interior. My understanding of Jung is that he took his own explorations to the brink of psychosis in the service of understanding himself and the psyche. Whether you are a Jung fan or not, it has certainly been my experience that he has a lot of insight and wisdom to share with respect to the nature of the psyche.This book is basically an autobiography and it is very dense reading. Jung was highly educated in a variety of fields and without some basic understanding of philosophy, major literary figures and mythology, it may be a difficult reading. However, if taken slowly, it is truly manageable and you will discover many gems.I agree with some of the other excellent reviews that suggest that this volume presents Jung the legend more than being an objective account of his life. However, it offers a lot of insight into his thinking, major influences, etc. It is a fascinating story in itself.I think this book is most useful and interesting to people who already know a lot about Jung. It is not the best introduction to Jung. If you want a good introduction, I would suggest Murray Stein's \\"Jung's Map of the Soul.\\" Another concise introduction in Jung's own words is Aion. I would read one or both of these first before tackling this volume."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I enjoyed this (simply from the standpoint of its being a very well-written autobiography). Though I do not pretend to be an authority on psychology myself - I find something in Jung that is almost more spiritual than scientific. Of course, Jung will not be readily excepted in modern circles for his lack of empirical evidence - but that is not what concerns me - he is a fascinating figure and writer. All I know is there will always be something in life and science that is inexplicable - and this is what makes people like Freud and Jung live on forever - they are so willing to search for what is unknown."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"MDR is one of the few titles by Jung which is meant for general readership. Most of his works (his titles in the 20-volume Bollingen series) are very technical and, admittedly, soporific at times.Be that as it may I cannot emphasize enough how important the ideas and discoveries of Jung are. Had he lived two or even five centuries ago his ideas would be just as cogent to us today, or perhaps even more so, in the face of ongoing and seemingly interminable political-military crises that overwhelm us, in a time when we have enough technology to obliterate entire nations via remote control.Indeed Jung resurrects such ancient ideas as soul, psyche, daimon, gods but he contextualizes them anew. No longer are deities entities that live in the firmament above, but rather they are our projections of the psychological goings-on deep within us. And here Jung strikes at the heart of all our problems (and opportunities) for Jung always circles around and orbits the phenomenon of the unconscious, from whence our consciousness is born and in which it is and will forever be rooted.In my opinion, in MDR, Jung shares his most crucial ideas in the last three chapters, namely, \\"On Life After Death,\\" \\"Late Thoughts,\\" and \\"Retrospect.\\" Always Jung is dedicated to reality and the truth. He does not acquiesce to the tastes and sensibilities of his readers. For instance in \\"Late Thoughts\\" he underscores the point that the \\"recognition of the reality of evil necessarily relativizes the good, and the evil likewise, converting both into halves of a paradoxical whole.\\" And on the last page of the last chapter he both muses and avers: \\"The world into which we are born is brutal and cruel, and at the same time of divine beauty. Which element we think outweighs the other, whether meaninglessness or meaning, is a matter of temperament... Probably, as in all metaphysical questions, both are true: Life is--or has--meaning and meaninglessness.\\" These are very somber perhaps even depressing revelations, but for Jung the only way we can rise above our neuroses is to acknowledge such painful truths.I have perhaps quoted more from this work of Jung's than from his other titles. Not only is it easier to digest, but since it was written just 4 years before his death I believe it contains some of his best thoughts, thoughts congealed and shared when he had reached the peak of his mountain, thoughts from a very, very wise old man."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Being 16 years old, i get a lot of strange looks from friends when i pull out this book and get absorbed in it. They can't fathom why i would find it so interesting. Well, for one, Jung's childhood experiences coincide with my own to a startling degree. I have had to keep myself from yelling out in public when reading this book and coming across something that i also experienced. Being something of a budding philosopher, i came across many ideas in the chapters to follow that coincide with my own formulated theories. I've never encountered such a beautifully written work in my life before, or a more touching one. Jung's description of the balance of his own psyche has aided me greatly in finding firm footing for my own wandering mind. This book entertains, teaches, and imparts invaluable wisdom to the reader. I wish that he were alive today, and i would do everything in my power to thank him for his impact on my life. If you like psychology, philosophy, or anything of sort, read this. If you're looking for answers to psychic questions, read this. If you've never cared for psychology, read this... it might change your mind. Jung is a genius and possesses rare insight into the matters that concern everyone."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is not a typical biography. Rather than the usual record one might expect about an individuals life, that is, chronological time, events of significance, famous personages met and their influence, etc, Jung records momentous aspects about his inner life, his life long and extraordinary relationship with the unconscious. As he states from the beginning, this book is a reflection concerning his self-realisation of the unconscious and its manifestations. In old age, he realised that so-called outward memories, the temporal existence of the senses, had faded, and what remained were memories of his inner life, which manifested in dreams and visions. He found that he could only write his life in terms of a personal myth, because he believed 'autobiography', as a form of truthful expression, was at best, unreliable. Memory, in other words, cannot be trusted. Thus, Memories, Dreams and Reflections, is a personal 'story' about a man's journey of spiritual enlightenment and self-realisation, the process of the unconscious finding expression in the outer world.Jung's inner life was certainly extraordinary. From an early age, the sheer power of the unconscious made itself known to him in terrible visions. Jung must have been an unusually grounded child in order to withstand the psychic forces that pushed their way into his consciousness at such a young age. He survived these onslaughts, I believe, because he didn't resist them, but chose to grapple with the images, follow his instincts and, along with the violence of these images, came also a knowingness and feeling of safeness, that he was, even at a young age, following what he was meant to do. It is no wonder he became a psychiatrist, a \\"doctor of the soul\\" as he calls it; because by helping others through their personal journeys of realisation, he came to better understand his own.At the end of Jung's life he maintained that he was not a mystic, a wise man or a sage. He admits that he drank from the stream of knowledge and life, but was not the stream itself. But what is a mystic in the traditional sense of this term? A mystic is one who, through meditation, prayer or other means, achieves direct intuitive experience of the divine. A mystic experiences these 'other realities' and brings their experiences back, in some cases, to share with the rest of us. To the mystic these experiences are real. Taking this definition at face value, Memories, Dreams and Reflections is a record of one man's intuitive experience with the divine. Jung made it his life's mission to express these experiences in such a way as to make them real, and to then formulate them into a psychological method, in the hope of helping others lost and searching for meaning in their lives. Jung was most assuredly a mystic. His writings tell us that there is something greater than ourselves within us, and our task is to grapple and understand this power, that he has chosen to call the unconscious; and by better understanding this greater part of ourselves, we can become more human.This is a wonderful story about the inner life of a man, a mystic and original thinker."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is a book that I read with intense interest, I walked around the house, this book in hand.C.G.

It was fascinating to read about his boyhood, his adolescence, his days as a student, his time as a doctor (most all of his adult life) and his travels. And the best part was the insights he shared about his inner life.Perhaps the biggest surprise in reading this book was the extent to which I identified with him. As a child I had a rich imagination and sometimes thought that I was some kind of an odd-wad. And like Jung, not only did I have trouble with algebra when I was in junior high, I also, like Jung, had thought it was a plot! It was nice to find out that a highly intelligent person like Jung had experienced many just-like-it-only-different events as I had.The biggest thing I appreciate about Carl Jung is his attitude towards the individual. I think he has one of the best treatments of individualism that I've read. The \\"individuating\\" process he outlines will make us better members of the community. Like Jung, I have always felt that the community is only as healthy as the individuals in it.I continue to learn about his approach to dreams and to learn new insights from this book.

You will be impressed by not only the genius of this man, but captivated by the story of his life. This book should a must read for anyone interested in unravelling some of the mysteries of the psyche."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"When I first started reading this book, I was highly nave as to what my possible reactions could be. I never realized that this book would spark an internal flame within me, causing me to yearn for more knowledge and a broader insight into many subjects. It even lead me to come to many realizations about myself and my actions that I could never explain, but turned out to be so true and conclusive.The extremely difficult vocabulary content did not discourage me one bit, it just made my curiosity grow. Jung amazed me with the beauty of his language choice and writing style and further astonished me with this extensive knowledge on so many various subjects and interesting way of interpreting them. Jung constantly referred to literary works and ideas of other authors and always stressed his references. This was perfect because this was the first book that I've ever willingly read from cover to cover in the psychology field, and it gave me an idea of other books like this one that I could read on topics that I liked and could hand-pick.The book was most interesting knowing that it was written in autobiography-style and at the end of Jung's life, thus giving myself (the reader) his life-experienced and life-proven philosophies. It was a very difficult read but it was well worth it. I could honestly say that sometimes I just couldn't put it down; and no other book has been able to do that for me."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Several key ideas in this work grab my attention and lead me to believe that this is a fine starting point for understanding Jung, both his life and his thought:* The Collective Unconscious: Jung's notion that we are being \\"carried along,\\" sustained and directed by this deep, dark well of unconscious archetypal meaning and energy that seeks to make itself known and become integrated into our conscious life. Here's the alpha and omega.* The Persona: The self we manifest publically is not the whole story but a necessary \\"mask\\" that helps us get by in the world, the ideal image we have of ourselves. We latch onto these social identities to define us, but as a part of the \\"collective psyche\\" they do not distinguish us in any significant way. Jung's struggling awareness of the \\"split\\" between his two personalities, \\"No. 1\\" and \\"No. 2,\\" led to this concept.* The Shadow: There lives within us another side of our personality that is filled with all those aspects of ourselves we hide away, both from ourselves or others, as unacceptable. The shadow has a \\"dark side,\\" which is the stuff we find morally reprehensible, but it also has a \\"bright side\\" containing our unembraced potentialities. Daryl Sharp describes the shadow as a \\"hodgepodge of repressed desires and uncivilized impulses.\\" It serves our wholeness by nagging and ambushing the persona (ideal self) with a larger sense of our humanity.* The Affirmation of Wholeness over Dualism: Given the primary role of the collective unconscious and how it seeks to integrate the persona and the shadow, we are to be wary of all one-sided emphases in terms of personal growth.* The Nature of God as Light and Dark: Jung came to see God as embodying both light and shadow as well. His dream very early in life of God defecating on the church jolted him into a kind of \\"blasphemy\\" that was both horrifying and redeeming. He eventually came to see God as embodying the wholeness and synthesis of opposites that every person needs.* The Desire to Ground Psychology Historically: Jung could have easily become just another crackpot esoteric with all his mystical visions, dreams and overwhelming intuition. Yet he struggled long and hard to substantiate his subjective experiences, to verify their occurrence and meaning in the \\"outer world\\" cross-culturally and give \\"reality\\" its due.I am completely captivated by Jung's thoughts about Christianity and how this \\"myth\\" needs to grow and develop or it will die on the vine. I am convinced as a pastor that the Church's sense of faith needs more of an \\"experiential\\" focus than a \\"dogmatic\\" one. Jung was not afraid to open himself to the awesome mystery of the Other, even if it meant moving into the unknown and sacrificing what he held most dear. I'm convinced that Jung offers an invitation into the \\"larger life\\" of God, one that values the questions and trusts both the presence and absence of God as necessary to our wholeness.Reading this autobiography energizes me to move beyond dabbling with Jung, to seek a deeper understanding and integration of his insights. I intend to be more forthright with encouraging others to listen to their dreams and to \\"own\\" their shadow. In particular, given my largely evangelical tradition, I'm eager to broaden out the spiritual direction conversation beyond the usual obsession with persona tinkering. I hope to help others open up to and trust the terrifying richness swelling up from the collective unconscious. This work has prompted me to pursue other works by James Hollis, Jeremy Taylor, Daryl Sharp, June Singer, and David Tacey."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This fabulous memoir goes out of print and then, sometimes, re-emerges in a later edition.

I gave the most recent edition as a gift to an erudite friend, because I read the book thirty years ago and still recall how deeply affected I was by the book.

It is extremely readable and deeply rich with wisdom. This book is a summation of Jung's personal thoughts and insights about the different phases of his psychological work and life completed towards the end of his life.Jung discusses psychiatry as a relatively new science and that his belief that psychology is all about psychic energy. Because of this awareness, Jung believed that peoples' drives are energetic processes and the unconscious itself is a psychic process. He describes his own first-hand observance with the paranormal and because of that experience why he believed there are events that overstep space, time and the process of cause and effect.As an avid Dreamworker myself, I loved how Jung discusses the importance of giving shape to our secret inner expressions, creative energies or archetypes that emerge from the unconscious especially through dreams. In this book, Jung relates experiencing archetypes within is a process the individual goes through that is similar to an ancient alchemical process.I think many readers will find his description of the process of disorientation and loss of footing from a strong and rigid ego-based life to a Self or soul based-life through the process of individuation and working with the unconscious is a natural process as a huge relief through understanding the process better.Personally, I found his book exceptional and as someone interested in dreamwork and Jungian psychology this book was an important foundational reading for my own future work in this field. Anyone who struggles with established expectations in terms of vocation will enjoy reading about how Jung said that varied subjects actually corresponds to out natural inner dichotomy. Anyone interested in ancestor work will enjoy reading about his validation of the importance of that work to bring inner harmony within a person. One of the most important phrases in the book I found and need to continue to ponder myself in doing inner psychological work was the idea that \\"questions and demands which destiny required of me did not come from the outside.\\"Jamieson HaverkampfAuthor of Mom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed Parent and current Dream Group Leader student at The Haden InstituteMom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed ParentMom Minus Dad: The Essential Resource Guide for Busy Adults with a Newly Widowed Parent"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss and former disciple of the great Sigmund Freud, was always at a loss to talk about his personal life and this book is a rare exception in this regard, although not being recognised by Jung as pertainning to his bibliography.

Despite being recorded in its greatest parts and then transcribed Aniela Jaffe, the book transports the reader in the true atmosphere of Jung's school years, the years he spent at the University, his feuds with his father and the difficult relationship with his mother, his breaking-up with Freud, the interpretation of the 2 personnas of his mother, and so on.The book gets increasing intensity and the account is even dreadful/scary when Jung reports the discovery he made about the power behind anima entities, where the unconscious of man is part woman , and a very powerful one in this regard, to the point of totally anihilating one's self if not taken control of.THis is a necessary reading to anyone interested in the origin and development of psychanalisys in the voice of one of his founders."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is far and away one of the best autobiographies I have ever read.

If I hadn't known that he was married with five children I would have assumed he was a complete hermit. Loving relationships seem to have meant nothing to this man.

Having seen various elements of this popular hagiography dismantled by mordant &amp; unrelenting Jungophobes like Richard Noll, I would only stress what I consider the lasting value &amp; glowing inspiration for modern ( Western ) (wo)man in search of her/his soul. I'll post my review in a half-humorous form of a fragment of a dialogue, the now extinct form venerated by Plato, Galileo or Bruno.Q. What, then, is the message of Jung's life, that,what William James had described as ordeal of consciousness ?A. The goal of Jungian individuation is expansion &amp; integration of the psychic contents (&quot;soul&quot;) within the field of awareness, the ego being the center of conscious life. The grand finale would be fusion, coniunctio, of the &quot;soul&quot; ( psyche ) and &quot;Spirit&quot; ( pneuma/Self ), with ego retaining its &quot;privileged&quot; position as the center of the conscious life.Q. So is this expansion and integration something one is aware of when it is happening or when it has happened ?A. Well, that's a tricky subject. I'll try to give some hints a few outspoken Jungians like Marie Louise von Franz, and Jung himself have adumbrated. Of course, the entire spiritual &quot;enterprise&quot; is based on the Western Hermetic/Gnostic tradition, from Corpus Hermeticum to alchemists's &quot;opera&quot;. In short, you got a growth of inner ( and outer life ) on various levels of consciousness ( altered states, dreams, hypnagogic dreams, guided imagination, prayer, conscious ponderings, listening your inner daemon/voice, ordeals of emotional &amp; family life,....). The goal is &quot;individuated&quot; man/woman: that is, someone who lives an authentic life ( Shakespearean &quot;to thine own self be true&quot; ), not an onedimensional spiritual saintly prototype nor a conformistic ego- centered mediocre. I suppose the ultimate ideal would be someone like Goethe or Plato- a multidimensional, creative individuum with strong sense of &quot;I&quot;, yet in deep contact/fusion with the divine wellspring within- in sum, ideal of the &quot;Renaissance man&quot;.Q. Was Jung able to achieve the &quot;fusion&quot; in his own life?A. From what is described in his spiritual autobiography- yes.

JungArguably the greatest autobiography of the century, Memories, Dreams, Reflections is a man's attempt to reconcile his own inner life with the inadequate rubrics of his time: intellectual, philosophical, and psychological. Jung had the courage to disown Freud's idea that the unconscious was merely a cause of mayhem for the ego. Rather the self, the archetype of wholeness, both guides the ego to its highest fulfillment and presents it with demons in the form of dreams and fantasies. Ideas we take for granted today originate here: The idea that there is a symbolic language that connects all minds which he dubbed the collective unconscious. That men have an inner feminine life and vice versa. The valuation of all religions and philosophies, east and west, as food for the soul. Yet Jung is no dreamer. He was able to draw on Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, as well as non traditional sources, to make his points. His intellectual achievement is gargantuan, being that he is a 19th century character trained by traditional medicine, and bred by Swiss Christianity.I urge anyone who is unsatisfied with popular psychology, religion, and culture to read this book. It is a common inclusion in philosophy of religion classes and is still read in psychology schools. It is especially good for young people just coming to grips with their spirituality, and for the elderly searching for a sense of meaning in their lives.

He says: \\"The relation between conscious and unconscious is compensatory. This is the best proven rule of dream interpretation\\" (Collected Works, Vol. 16). The examination of Jung's dream interpretations reveals that what he calls \\"lopsidedness\\" is a harmful mistake, or a harmful mental/behavioral failure, and \\"compensation\\" means the correction of the mistake, or the termination of the mental/behavioral failure.As I explained elsewhere, the compensation of the lopsidedness in the conscious attitude by the unconscious is only a particular manifestation of the general truth that all functions of the mind, or all of its \\"topographical parts\\" in Freud's words, complement each other and constitute an integrated system, in contradiction with Freud's theory of conflict. In fact, Jung's theory was produced as a reaction to Freud's conflict theory. Consequently, we can equally say that consciousness sometimes compensates the lopsidedness in the unconscious attitude. Besides, it is most natural to expect such cooperation to work even when it is not possible to talk about any lopsidedness in the conscious or unconscious attitude. I described this cooperation in much detail elsewhere in my chapter on cerebral lateralization.Again as I explained elsewhere, Jung's conception of the function of dreams is basically correct and constitutes a very fruitful idea. But he did not apply this idea adequately to dream interpretation, apparently because he did not express it clearly and used instead obscure ideas like lopsidedness and compensation. His major mistake was to assume that every dream presented the compensated state of the lopsidedness, or the corrected state of the mistake.Jung could be able to produce a correct theory of dreams if he tried to answer the following questions: (a) What is the content of lopsidedness in general but clear terms? (b) How does the conscious attitude become lopsided and why it cannot correct its lopsidedness itself? (c) What makes the unconscious fit to compensate the lopsidedness of the conscious attitude? (d) In what measure the unconscious succeeds or fails in doing the compensation work, and why? (e) Most importantly, how does the unconscious do the job of compensation, or the correction of the harmful mistake? It is evident that in the absence of especially the answer to the last question, it is not possible to discover all the thoughts expressed by a dream.As I explained elsewhere, a complete dream contains three types of thought: (a) the presentation of the lopsidedeness, or the mistake, which is treated by the dream; (b) the explanation of the cause of the mistake, or failure, which is often in the form of the external attribution of the failure; and (c) the correction of the mistake, or the termination of the failure. A complete dream begins either with thought (a) or (b) and ends with thought (c). Thoughts (b) and/or (c) may be missing in a dream or may be implicit in another part of the dream, but thought (a) is always present in explicit or implicit form because it is the reason why the dream is produced. In reality, this understanding of dreams is implied by Jung's compensation idea, because the fact that the unconscious can compensate the lopsidedness in the conscious attitude means that the unconscious is rational enough to do that, and the above three types of thought are the ones produced consciously and rationally when dealing with failures in the waking state.Jung was not able to see these facts, because he could not free himself sufficiently from Freud's influence. Just as Freud interpreted everything in a dream as meaning wish fulfillment, Jung interpreted every dream as presenting the compensated state of the lopsided that it treated. In reality, a dream may present the lopsidedness instead of its compensated state, as exemplified below.Jung's dream about his patient (p. 133): In his dream, Jung looks up at his female patient who is \\"sitting on a kind of balustrade,\\" \\"on the highest tower\\" of a castle \\"at the top of a steep hill;\\" he bends his head back too far to see her properly and wakes up with a crick in the back of his neck.Jung's interpretation based on the compensation hypothesis was this: \\"If in the dream I had to look up at the patient in this fashion, in reality I had probably been looking down on her.\\" So, he assumed that the dream was telling him not to look down on her. This interpretation was based on the assumption that the dream scene represented what Jung had to do in real life, which means the solution of his problem, or the compensation of the lopsidedness in his conscious attitude. This interpretation contradicts the fact that Jung hurt himself in the dream by looking up at his patient and also by the fact that he considered his patient in real life \\"a highly intelligent woman.\\" These contradictions can be eliminated by assuming that the dream scene represented the mistake that Jung was making in real life, or his problem, not its solution as he assumed. So, the correct message of the dream appears to be this: \\"You are making a mistake and hurting your interests by overestimating your patient.\\" The implied advise was to stop overestimating her, which is the exact opposite of what Jung thought the dream was advising him. This interpretation is supported not only by the pain that Jung felt in the back of his neck at the end of the dream and his waking state evaluation of his patient as a highly intelligent woman but also by the fact that he was unable to realize progress in the therapy of his patient, evidently because he considered her a highly intelligent woman. This dream shows that the compensation hypothesis can cause a wrong interpretation even when the subject matter of a dream is approximately recognized, which is not always the case, and that therefore this hypothesis may also say nothing about the meaning of a dream. In such cases, Jung introduced obscure ideas in the interpretations, such as mandala, archetype, and collective unconscious, without explaining why these appear in the dream and what they precisely mean in relation to the dreamer's life. In fact, many of Jung's ideas are found \\"mystical.\\" In opposition to this, Freud's interpretations are always clear and detailed but always wrong basically. But despite this fact, Freud's dream theory is more popular than Jung's, because it is found plausible due to the fact that it is produced by likening dreams to daydreams which mean wish fulfillment as everyone knows.Jung's understanding of dreams needs to be corrected, or completed, also concerning the language of dreams. He criticized Freud's idea of dream symbolism saying that what Freud meant when he said \\"symbol\\" was \\"sign,\\" and that a symbol was something more complex than a sign. Today the widely accepted view is that dream language is concrete-analogic, or concrete-metaphoric. In reality, most of Freud's dream symbols involved analogies, but many other writers abused the concept of dream symbolism and produced largely invalid dictionaries of dream symbols. Not only dream language but also dream cognition is concrete-analogic and therefore cannot use abstractions and logic. This is a consequence of the accepted view that dream thoughts are produced by the right brain which operates using concrete analogies instead of abstractions, speech, and logic. The verbal metaphors that are used in the waking state are also used in dreams in concrete pictorial form, because the source of both the waking state analogies, or metaphors, and dream analogies appear to be the right brain. Because of this, dictionaries of dream symbols can contain correct entries, but even the most common analogies can carry special meanings when used in dreams in relation to the dreamer's life experiences. Many otherwise correct dream interpretations by Jung and his followers are somewhat flawed because of they twisted the meanings of dream analogies in various ways. An example is below.A man dreamed that as he came out of a meeting he put on somebody else's hat. Jung could say nothing about the relation of this dream to the dreamer's life experiences and claimed only that the hat represented the Mandela, which, according to him, is a concept present in every human mind. The analogic interpretation of this dream can be that the dreamer had easily accepted, or was in the habit of easily accepting, other people's ideas and views. This would be the presentation of a lopsidedness in his conscious attitude.Jung was aware of the insufficiency of his theory and said: \\"There are still boundless opportunities for pioneer work in this field\\" (Collected Works, Vol. 16). Nevertheless, he and his followers produced many correct and nearly correct dream interpretations. Jung's readers can use his compensation theory better then he did by keeping in view the facts mentioned above and reading my books.Jung's compensation theory can be seen as the solution of the problem of dream interpretation, and thereby of the problem of dream function, if the process by which compensation is realized and the analogic cognition and language of dreams are taken into consideration, both as explained above.Cognitive-Behavioral Cybernetics of Symptoms, Dreams, Lateralization: Theory, Interpretation, TherapyTheory Construction and Testing in Physics and Psychology"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"If you're going to purchase one book about the Swiss psychologist C. G. Jung, this is it. Jung takes the reader on a journey through an ambivalently painful and inspired life, and shares a mine of accumulated learning and insight along the way. Jung is a multifaceted person. The age-old quest for meaning through self-knowledge isn't new to him. The account reveals how thoroughly Jung acts as a bridge between the ancient and modern, esoteric and scientific traditions. But above all, it's Jung's sincerity that places this highly readable book at the top of our list."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"\\"Memories, Dreams, Reflections\\" (MDR) is often regarded as Carl Gustav Jung's autobiography. In reality, Jung only wrote a few chapters, and even these were edited by his secretary Aniela Jaff&eacute;, the real mover and shaker behind MDR. The rest of the book is Jaff&eacute;'s creation. Apparently, Jung never saw the finished manuscript and MDR wasn't published until after his death. The full story is told in \\"Jung stripped bare\\" by Sonu Shamdasani.Despite this, MDR is nevertheless of considerable interest. Regardless of whether it reflects the \\"real\\" Jung or not, it certainly shows us the Jung of the Jungians. This is how most Jung fans *want* Jung to be, and what draws them to Jungianism in the first place.Personally, I found the following chapters interesting: \\"Visions\\", \\"On life after death\\" and \\"Late thoughts\\". Jung describes a near-death experience, discusses the possibility of reincarnation, and explains his views on good and evil. Of course, there is a lot of interesting (and frankly bizarre) material in the rest of the book, as well. Jung had strange visions of an anti-Christian and phallic nature already as a child, and as an adult he met a spirit-being named Philemon, who became his guru. Philemon was a bearded man with two horns and the wings of a kingfisher. (If you ever see him again, please call NBC News!) Jung also tells the famous story of how his house in Switzerland was haunted by the souls of dead crusaders, and how Jung calmed them down by writing \\"Seven sermons to the dead\\".Theologically, pardon the expression, Jung seems to have been a pantheist or impersonal panentheist. His view of God was bipolar: evil is part of God. There is also a strong streak of antinomianism: God prods people to do evil deeds so they can experience his grace, everyone must confront \\"the shadow\\", etc. This is the least sympathetic part of Jung's message. Overall, his worldview is pantheistic, animistic and Gnosticizing. Only Jung's scientific pretensions stopped him from sounding like another version of Rudolf Steiner or Madame Blavatsky. (The Theosophical Society Adyar have published a book called \\"The Gnostic Jung\\". Hardly a co-incidence.)At least this is how C.G. Jung comes across in MDR. And whether we like it or not, this is the \\"archetypal\\" Jung, the Jung of the Gospels, so to speak, in contrast to \\"the historical Jung\\", who may or may not have been somebody else entirely. MDR gives us the culture icon, the spiritual sage preaching to an increasingly secular age in which Man has lost his Soul.Or something. ;-)"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"This is a potentially seminal (meaning here life-changing) book for anyone that has embarked himself/herself on a spiritual quest. Dr. Carl Gustav Jung was a trained psychiatrist whose unusual insights and mental/spiritual experiences slowly made him drift away from that profession into, mainly, the field of psychology. He was a daring thinker and a honest scientist. In this particular book, he goes back to selected events of all kind, in order to guide the reader into, not only his life story, but into his apprenticeship, so to say, as a mental-spiritual-cultural alchemist and facilitator, not only for his generation and country (Switzerland), but for all humankind wherever they happen to physically abide. Reading this marvelous book I found myself nodding approvingly at the explanations he gave to the dreams, insights, ideas and events that befell on him and which, very often, left him baffled. I did relate to Jung at more than one level. By the way, this is not a dry treatise, but, a lively and very well crafted literary achievement by its author. Five shining stars forthis book."},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"It\`s extremly interesting to have Jung\`s point of view on his own life.

It\`s a look into de deepest of his being, the motor of his work and of his life. A sublime experience!"},{"Title":"Memories, Dreams, Reflections","review":"I love this book because it goes beyond just personality catagorizations and static psychology formulas to show Jung's understanding of the complexity of the phenomenon that is the human being and how much larger our existence is than just the material or mental worlds. Although he was a true empirical scientist of his time, he also was quite aware and affected by spiritual and psychic experiences and mysterious energetic forces that, to me, validates a universal intelligence that is not well acknowledged in Western philosophy. In fact his empirical process led him to not be able to dismiss his experiences because he could not disprove them, and he seemed singularly self-possessed and courageous in this way. He was prepared to delve into the greater forces at work that affect the psyche, beyond just what has been experienced and suppressed. It is a fascinating and deeply thoughtful and insightful book, but it will take a flexible and open mind to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Berlin Story of a Battle April-May 1945","review":"&quot;As for the ridiculous hundred million Slavs... Surely I have a right to remove millions of an inferior race ............&quot; (Adolf Hitler) &quot;Kill, Red Army men, kill! No Fascist is innocent, be he alive, be he as yet unborn. Kill!&quot; (Ilya Ehrenburg) On April 27, 1945, Andrew Tully arrived in Berlin. As the war-correspondent for the Boston &quot;Traveler&quot;, he was one of the first three Americans to enter the battle-torn city. He stayed for three days as guest of a Russian artillery battalion, during which he accumulated hundreds of notes and impressions. For the next seventeen years, Tully gathered the eye-witness statements, war diaries, letters, and historical information which forms the basis of his book. Until the publication of Cornelius Ryan's &quot;The Last Battle&quot;, Tully's was the definitive work on the fall of Berlin. The progression of the Allied armies toward Berlin and the growing chaos in the Reich are vividly chronicled. Tully captures the atmosphere of desperation in Hitler's bunker, and the ramifications of the Fuhrer's descent into insanity for the people of Berlin. Because the personal stories of ordinary individuals -- German civilians, housewives, Hitler Youth, SS, Mohnke Girls, nurses, Red Army soldiers -- are interwoven into the historical account, the book sometimes reads more like an exciting novel than a documentary. Tully's presentation has a distinctly Soviet-sympathetic slant. He refers to the War as a German - Russian conflict, and most of the sixteen pages of photos come from the Soviet archive. He focuses on the massive Russian losses during the push westward and the attack on Berlin. As General Bradley had warned Eisenhower, a battle waged in Berlin from street to street, house to house, would cost over 100,000 casualties, &quot;a pretty stiff price to pay... especially when we've got to fall back and let the other fellow take over.&quot; The American forces stopped at the Elbe five days before the Russian offensive began on the Oder. And the Red Army took over 102,000 casualties in the first wave of fighting. Tully unflinchingly details the savagery of the second wave of the Red Army, the occupation by the brutal Cossacks and barbarous Mongols, the riot of looting and raping once the city had fallen. However, this depravity is &quot;balanced&quot; by German civilians' accounts of astonishing cruelty by the SS toward their own people and the testimonies of Tully's Russian contributors about the suffering of their families under the German invaders. It is this human dimension that makes this book great. It is long out-of-print, but definitely worth finding and reading."},{"Title":"School of the sun","review":"Matute's subject matter is the coming of age of a young girl during the troublesome times of the Spanish Civil War. The war remains at a distance, percolating by drops into the story through the reactions of the adults who surround Matia and her cousin, Borja. Spanish cultural patterns and insights make for colorful and interesting reading. Matute's style of writing is uniquely different: lonely, stark, and intensely detailed. The story is bizarre at times, almost surrealistic. Camus-like images of the sun and light and glare evoke the excruciating realities of existentialism. Images are strong and not always pleasant. Tender moments are tender indeed, but the undertoe of isolation, cold-hearted authority, and prejudice pulls the reader into a world poignantly desolate, foreign, and ultimately, cruel."},{"Title":"Stats Player Profiles 1998","review":"The stats for pitching and batting are everything you could ask for, but I don't understand why there is absolutely nothing on fielding.

However this book makes a valuable contribution to the restoration of this aspect of Irish History. Meticulously researched and logically set out, it is an uncomplicated yet thorough summary of all the Irish winners of Britain's highest military award. Whatever the merits or otherwise of Irishmen fighting Russians, Boers Afghans and Zulus, the Irishmen who won their 'Gongs' after volunteering to fight against the rampant German aggressions of 1914-1918 and 1939-1945 are above reproach. They are Ireland's forgotten heroes."},{"Title":"The Lively Shadow: Living with the Death of a Child","review":"This is a serious book, but, in no sense, a depressing one. It is an extraordinary guide for all of us who know grief in our lives, and for all of us--no one escapes it if they live any kind of life at all--who are going to be in contact with others experiencing grief.You will come away from this book with hope, not melancholy. You will learn about handling grief, which is part of life, and, maybe, you will even learn how to be something more than just an emotional sounding board for those around you during the immediate aftermath of tragedy.In recent days, the husband of someone I didn't know very well was killed in an accident. Murray's book helped me to better handle hearing from this woman elaborate details about the wonderful life and the tragic death, and to be more adequately prepared for the sudden--often unexpected--expressions of fury. By the way, you aren't going to find those elaborate details in Murray's book, and certainly not the fury.I heartily recommend this book to all of us who have known grief, and to all of us who will know it in the future, and, just as important, to all of us who have known and will know people in grief."},{"Title":"The Lively Shadow: Living with the Death of a Child","review":"When my grandson died suddenly, my daughter and I had read many, many books to assist us through our grief.

There is always a substantial body of unexplained and mystifying information in human existence, and this is often of a nature that withstands the sharpness of the attacks, at explaining it, by the current sceptics or &quot;experts&quot; of the age. The result is that it then passes on into folklore or legend, which in no way affects the character or appeal of such information. This holds true whether the age is of high technology, as at present, or that of the horse and cart--which is still extant in many parts of the world.

I'm going to list a number of them and then write a bit in conclusion.1. It deals with many of the 'Beats' rather than focusing, as is typical, on Kerouac and Ginsberg and forgetting the rest of them. It provides an illuminating portrait of Burroughs (who is definately a key figure), Neal Cassidy (who is also), and alot of the girls, etc. who were around them. 2. It provides reading lists, etc. of what they were reading. This is HUGE if you want to understand the bitterness/despair that is found in Burroughs and Ginsberg... as well as insight into how they interpretted their life and times (i.e. because they read these books, they in a dialogic sense would interpret things along such-and-such lines.... as a psychologist would interpret a 'vision of God' one way and a believer a second.... 3. Lots of minutia/trivia that is just fun.It's a really good book and more stimulating than one would expect from a book that is in the shape of a square. It would not suffice as a literary biography of any of the authors contained in the 'movement' nor could it supplant any social history book. But, it suppliments them and is fun to read: sort of an academic version of 'Seventeen' at points. I really love this book. I'd definately recommend this book to anyone who wants to become first among their band of friends if all their friends want to do is read a little bit of 'On the Road' and 'Howl' (and then think they know about this time period...."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Beat Generation: Visionaries, Rebels, and Hipsters, 1944-1960 (Circles of the Twentieth Century)","review":"This is by far the best book about the Beats that I have read to date. I really enjoyed the entire book. Its a quick read, has fun anecdotes, quotes and definitions printed in the margins of every page, and delivers a tremendous amount of information about the Beat Generation. I was impressed by the amount of history covered for the main Beat characters, Kerouac, Ginsberg, Carr, and Burroughs. I especially enjoyed the in depth looks at their first meetings with one another and the focus on what each one was reading during the early years. The aforementioned writers are definitely the focus of this book, but there is also a decent amount of time dedicated to minor characters involved in the generation.You really can't go wrong with this book, rather this will be your first introduction to the Beats or your a veteran of Beat lore, you will definitely gain something from reading this text. This book also includes an awesome year to year run down of important events in the Beat movement shown in correlation with important social and political events of the time.

It isn't just about the birth, it spans the whole genration, and the aftermath."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Beat Generation: Visionaries, Rebels, and Hipsters, 1944-1960 (Circles of the Twentieth Century)","review":"Steven Watson does an admirable job of bringing together the various strands of Beat history through an engaging, storyteller-like style. Though he doesn't cover much new ground, his treatment of the Beat Women, Black Mountain Poets and the San Francisco Renaissance will be particularly helpful for those who are just beginning to explore the ancillary figures of the Beat movement. However, anyone already familiar with the lives of Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Kerouac will find nothing revelatory here.One point of concern is Watson's often overzealous descriptions of Beat sexuality. While sexual liberalism was certainly a significant tenet of Beat existence, it was not, in my estimation, the raison d'etre for Ginsberg, Burroughs, Kerouac, etc. It could be argued that Neil Cassady illuminated the sexual experience for core Beats, but his contribution as an iconic figure should not be devalued by presenting him as merely the sexual driving force of the Beats. Moreover, Watons implies that Ginsberg's homosexuality was the primary facet of his literary development. This is more than debatable. Certainly, Ginsberg's supernatural visions of Blake and his relationship with his mother served a much more profound purpose.Though Watson should be commended for his thoroughness, the result at times is an overemphasis on the sexual side of the Beats. In Watson's book, this serves to lessen the importance of the Beats' dramatic contributions to literature and poetry."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Beat Generation: Visionaries, Rebels, and Hipsters, 1944-1960 (Circles of the Twentieth Century)","review":"There are few literary movements in American history that have been as influential as that of the Beat Generation. Together they expressed discontent with life in postwar America and decried the literary traditions of their age. Their subjects were their very own lives, particularly their relationships, their travels, and their experimentation and use of mind-altering chemicals, all of which was in defiance of the social norms of their times.In this book, Steven Watson chronicles the formative years of the movement, from their initial encounters in 1940s New York to the publication of Burroughs's novel \\"Naked Lunch.\\" In this, Watson follows an outline of the history of the Beats once articulated by Allen Ginsberg, starting with how they came together as a group and then moving on to describe the writing of their key works, their struggles against censorship, and their eventual success and notoriety. While his focus is primarily on the major figures - Ginsberg, Kerouac, Burroughs, Neal Cassady, and Herbert Huncke - and their influences on one another, his scope is wide-ranging, and includes examinations of the San Francisco Renaissance, the avant-garde Black Mountain College, and the subsequent commercialization of the Beats by the end of the 1950s.Watson describes all of this in a brisk and informative narrative. Well supplemented with illustrations, the margins are peppered with quotes, definitions of Beat terminology, and lists of people, books, and traits that define the movement. Together it makes for an invaluable guidebook to the Beats; while no substitute for the writings themselves, it is an excellent resource for understanding the origins and development of the Beat movement."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Beat Generation: Visionaries, Rebels, and Hipsters, 1944-1960 (Circles of the Twentieth Century)","review":"This is the raw,un-sissified, un-sanitized, non-blessed by the smooth,fat inheritors story.

It's the story of how Mr. Britling makes it through World War One; although I should point out that he never once leaves England nor even, so far as I can remember, his study.Look, I really liked this book, and I wish I could give it a higher rating; and Wells is a good enough writer to ensure that the book has some good things in it (Mr. Britling's \\"affair\\" with a theatrically emotional woman is hilarious); but in all fairness I must say that (a) Not all that much happens - I know Mr. Britling has a son at the front, but the resulting tension isn't enough to build a novel out of, and (b) There's something a touch self-indulgent about Mr. Britling's armchair angst, and so as a result (c) Wells sometimes misses the point of his own fable. But if anyone has any desire at all to read this book, I say, give in to it."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"I'm a huge H.G Wells fan. On this one he steps outside the science fiction genre and gives us a compelling look into the mind of a man as he and his nation are pulled into war. It's actually very similar to the process I've seen the American psyche going through since 9-11, previously opposed to war, then whole-heartedly engaged, then questioning it.I think this book would be a good choice for history buffs, since it does such an excellent job of showing us how things were during World War I and what the mood was like during that time.Wells himself followed a similar course to his character. His leaned philosophically in the direction of pacifism, but when the First World War began he supported it at first, then after a while he gravitated back to his more pacifistic views.This is an excellent book and I really enjoyed reading. Wells was a wonderful writer and very talented at telling a great story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"I got this book as a gift from my brother. I have always loved H.G. Wells' books, and though this one is not in the same genre that I'm used to, I really loved it. It's sad and brilliant and sometimes hilarious. The message is deep and timely. Even though it's about a different war, the sentiment is still the same. What war does to the psyches of individuals and nations does not change. It unites us for a time only to eventually leave us feeling dirty. H.G. Wells shows us this process works in this excellent book. I really enjoyed reading it, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"I've always appreciated these Klutz books and find this one good at addressing my timing problems. I haven't gotten too far into the book yet - my progress is slow - but I feel it has well lived up to its reputation and my expectations so far."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"This is a surprisingly powerful novel, but not one with aliens or fantastic machines or representations of utopian futures, which are the things for which H.G. Wells is most noted. This is not that kind of book. There isn't a driving plot that requires resolution. It falls firmly into the \`literary' genre, exploring how people react to events that threaten to change their view of the world. The event, of course, is World War I, and the story is a personal and very human account of the war's first years, not from one of the combatants, but from a father who provides a broader yet still intimate perspective. When it was published in 1916, it would be considered contemporary fiction. Now, it might be seen as historical fiction.The first quarter of the book sets a scene of tranquil Essex in 1914, relatively untainted by the hustle and bustle of nearby London or by the changes going on throughout the rest of the world. The main character, Mr. Britling, is a fairly well known writer of essays and articles. He is an optimist. He believes in reason and in humanity's ability to exercise good judgment. His worldview is about to be challenged. (I got the distinct impression that much of Mr. Britling was an autobiographical representation of Mr. Wells.)As fiction, this book humanizes the experience of WWI in a way that history cannot. It shows the initial disbelief, denial, outrage, grief, and attempts at rationalization that Mr. Britling experiences. It comments on politics, ideology, religion, and the stupidity and waste of war from the perspective of a person detached enough to observe it rationally while involved enough to experience it emotionally. It's a powerful combination. It stimulates the readers' minds as well as their feelings.I won't summarize the story. Others have done that. If you wish, you can view the Wikipedia entry. One overriding theme of the book is how the characters perform mental gymnastics to adjust the reality of the war with their understanding of the world. Mr. Britling observes that the war is incompatible with the idea of God promoted by the Church, so he imagines a different one, which still allows him to retain his optimism about humanity. In this way, he carries on. He sees it through.I can't honestly recommend this book for everyone, but I would suggest it to fans of H.G. Wells and those with an interest in WWI. I enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"This novel was published in 1916, right in the middle of WWI, when that conflict seemed interminable. Thus, its appearance was timely, and it still serves as an authentic portrait of how the war on the home front affects a middle-class, well-educated family and its father, a writer who, while basically patriotic, feels himself to be tolerant, pacific, and reasonable. The Britling family even employs a German tutor, Heinrich, for their son. Yet Heinrich must leave as war gathers; he does so damning conflict and nationalists. This is where the book serves as history: while many did not think Germany would actually go to war, it was likewise expected. Germany's rising military power would eventually collide with others. Mr. Britling blames Germany nonetheless for lack of self-control, of disrupting the balance, of not playing the game. Perhaps forgotten is the fact that Germany's invasion of Belgium pushed some Flemish to flee to England as refugees. The Britlings even put a family up, with believable though containable culture shock. There are Zeppelin raids, food rationing, everyone doing their bit and, finally, the news that Hugh, the Britling son, has been killed on the Western Front. It is in how Mr. Britling tries to come to terms with this that the book strenghtens, as he(Mr. Britling is inclined to pontificate)declaims his belief in a fallible, flexible God who is in everyone, everywhere, giving meaning to life and death -- an unusual turn for Wells, a lifelong atheist. The book's conclusion sees Mr. Britling writing to the family of Heinrich, killed in Russia, responding to their request for him to send them their son's fiddle, left in England. This letter, and the emotions and thoughts he expresses in it, helps him find a kind of peace. Mr. Britling has thus seen it through."},{"Title":"Mr. Britling sees it through","review":"\\"Mr. Britling Sees It Through\\" was written while World War I was still raging. For the first 200 pages of this 450-page work, I was won over by some of the most muscular prose I had ever read. It was beautifully-written, lucid, poetic. After that 200-page mark, though, it sinks into vicious anti-German WWI-era propaganda. \\"Kill the Kaiser,\\" \\"the Dirty Huns,\\" etc.History courses around the world study what we now know to be Allied lies about Germany to get America into the war. For instance, we NOW know that the Germans weren't \\"crucifying Belgians,\\" nor bayonetting babies for practice, nor \\"making soap out of human corpses\\". So successful was this line of propaganda that many of its best gems were recycled for the second World War a generation later [and still survive as urban legends today, among the uneducated]. But the truth is: We now know exactly what British authors and operatives came up with the propaganda, what authorities authorized it and who aided in its dissemination.Furthermore, we now know [what they didn't at the time] that H.G. Wells was hired to be on the staff of the very first official board of the British Ministry of Propaganda. He was a hireling of the government to spread what he knew were lies in order to persuade peace-loving men to murder in the name of their leaders' agendas.For that Wells can never be forgiven.If he was an artist before 1916 [and \\"Mr. Britling Sees It Through\\"], he was the worst sort of political hack and moral reprobate afterward--filling his novels with intentional lies and phony atrocities in order to stir murderous, irrational blood-lust to advance British Imperialist goals."},{"Title":"Praying the Scriptural Rosary","review":"This Scriptural Rosary is a great tool especially for teaching junior high and high school students about praying the rosary. I used this scriptural rosary with my students (a decade at a time) and they all really like it and are really able to see the beauty of the rosary through the scriptural references and meditations. Some have even requested their own copies."},{"Title":"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Basketball Legends)","review":"This was a very short but interesting book on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I did not know how involved he was in academics before. He has proven that being smart does not block your chances for being a great athlete. Although Kareem has been retired from basketball since 1989, all athletes should study his star performances. He is a perfect role model for athletes of any sport. Naturally, all basketball player should study his life story by reading this book."},{"Title":"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Basketball Legends)","review":"Upper Elementary and Middle School Librarians: Assist Muslim students in feeling \\"included\\" by adding the Chelsea House biographies, as well as those of other basketball legends and role models from this publisher's series, to your library's shelves. 5th to 8th grades."},{"Title":"AIDS and HIV-Related Diseases: An Educational Guide for Professionals and the Public","review":"This book really helped me with my report.

The most interesting sections of the book are those dealing with historical developments - although the viewing of Heian Period sexuality through the lens of 'The Tale of Genji' has been done many times before, and there is really nothing new here. The book is neither here nor there, neither serious historical analysis, nor exhaustive chronicle of modern (commercial) sex in Japan, which is - by many estimates - the single largest industry in the country.Bornoff's discussion of modern Japan seems oddly dated, perhaps domonstrating how quickly things change in the ten years since the book was written. One also gets the impression that much of the 'research' for Pink Samurai must have been done as long ago as the 1970's. The porn stars who are seriously discussed as icons for contemporary erotic mores have long since vanished into obscurity, as have all of the TV programs mentioned. The book is also light on its handling of Japan's serious problems with school-girl prostitution &amp; child pornography. Already prevalent in the 1980's, by the late 1990's things were so out of hand that new legislation penalizing the practices was finally introduced, though the 'cult' has still not died out. From the scant page or two the subject merits in Pink Samurai, it is clear that Bornoff's interests lie elsewhere - probably the 'strip' theatres which get far more attention than their minor presence in the fabric of modern Japan would seem to warrant.This book would benefit from a thorough updating."},{"Title":"Pink Samurai: The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan","review":"This book was informative and entertaining with one strange flaw. According to the author, it seems some Japanese base everything on sex, that everyone is having sex everywhere all of the time, and that little sex dolls can be purchased everywhere. Reminded me of a famous anthropologist's scandal where the &quot;locals&quot; decided to have a bit of fun with the researcher. While sex in Japan is looked at in a more realistic sense (People understand that some people have sex, and that it's not abnormal), I couldn't quite agree with the author's notions that, come o-matsuri time, couples are enjoying quick trysts under the o-mikoshi or behind the jinja.True, there are sexual references in many (unexpected to the non-Japanese) places: children's manga that make the nude body seem to be anything from nothing out of the ordinary, to embarrassments to be blushed over. Public fliers and posters do show nude bodies, as do regular prime-time TV shows (this is without HBO and Cinemax).The fact is, sexuality is seen differently in the different cultures. Using this book to study the wonderful diversity of people on this planet is great; but using this book as a travel guide when going to Japan might gain the wielder a bit of disappointment. This book covers quite a few areas of Japanese social life.Keep in mind, though, that this book is starting to get a bit out of date. However, it's still fun to read as long as you don't take everything seriously."},{"Title":"Pink Samurai: The Pursuit and Politics of Sex in Japan","review":"It's really very difficult to both rate this text and to explain inside the 'character limit' just where this book excelled and where for the most part it went off-course. One would imagine that for a 698 page book to ultimately end up with only three stars would be pretty hard indeed, but such are the errors that this is a pretty generous mark. Please don't confuse 'Quantity' with 'Quality'.As an educator, living and working in Japan for the better part of the last decade I guess the easiest way to approach the appraisal of this work, is to view it as though it had been handed in from one of my students, so with that in mind I shall add my comments:1) What is your point? what are you trying to convey to the reader?2) How are the personal, family-related narratives related to the overall text? If you wish to introduce a personal thread that's fine, but continue it throughout the work, don't simply pick it up at the beginning and for a few pages at the end.3) How much of what you say is subjective and how much objective? You need to make it clear to the reader which is which, and where the line is drawn.4) You need to re-work the chapters, make clearer divisions and re-think the order, it's very incoherent in places, lacks flow and continuity, appears erratic. Has this been edited?5) Some of your Japanese is incorrectly translated, you need to check the translations you used, or if the common-usage has altered you need to re-issue the book. Without those editions the book reads as though you are lacking in knowledge of the Japanese language and thus weakens your credibility.6) There is too much focus on ancient 'fertility rites' and not enough on bringing the text up-to-date.7) There is not enough focus on homosexuality, a few pages at the end seems like an afterthought. Homosexuality is a major part of the Japanese sexual identity and has been throughout history.8) Over-use of the words 'August' and 'Zenith' are noticeable, please find alternatives.9) You cannot dismiss the Way of the Samurai as you have done so quickly. On what evidence did you base that they seldom took out their swords?10) When you use a Japanese word in italics you need to clearly indicate the meaning immediately after in parenthesis. You seem to be using several systems to incorporate Japanese loan-words and this is confusing to the reader with little or no prior knowledge of Japan, Japanese or Japanese culture. Again if you clarify your target audience you can edit this mistake accordingly.Ultimately not a bad effort, good illustrations and insights at points, though lacking in other areas. Please re-think your title and your point and then edit the text with that goal in mind. Please see me."},{"Title":"Kings English","review":"If you liked &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage,&quot; you will love &quot;The King's English.&quot;For three generations, a single book dominated the market as the authoritative reference in matters of grammar, style, and usage in the English language: &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; by H.W. Fowler, first published in 1926, now in its third edition (published 1996). Twenty years earlier, however, Fowler and his younger brother F.G. (their given names were Henry Watson and Francis George) had collaborated on a precursor, &quot;The King's English,&quot; first published in 1906 (and which went into its third edition a quarter century later, a few years after the first edition of &quot;A Dictionary&quot; appeared).This book is every bit as charming and graceful as the later &quot;Dictionary&quot; and, while this earlier work covers fewer topics than &quot;Dictionary,&quot; it treats the ones that it does cover with as much thoroughness and skill as &quot;Dictionary&quot;--in some cases with more thoroughness, since the book is structured as part essay, part textbook, and can thus afford more examples and exercises than &quot;Dictionary.&quot; The book begins by laying out five &quot;general principles&quot; worthy of Strunk and White (whose masterpiece &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; did not appear until half a century later): &quot;Prefer the familiar word to the far-fetched. Prefer the concrete word to the abstract. Prefer the single word to the circumlocution. Prefer the short word to the long. Prefer the Saxon word to the Romance.&quot;The Fowlers expand upon those five &quot;principles,&quot; and also treat vocabulary, syntax, punctuation, and other such technical matters in great depth. But amidst these technical chapters they also include a lengthy chapter on &quot;airs and graces,&quot; in which they advise the reader about imbuing writing with art.The Fowlers write with every bit as much elegance, flair, and humor as they advise their readers to use, and their mastery of their subject is unsurpassed. &quot;The King's English&quot; has stood the test of time and, today, a century after its initial publication, it still stands the Fowler brothers with Strunk and White from half a century ago and Bryan Garner of today in the first rank of authors about style and usage in the English language."},{"Title":"Kings English","review":"A classic well worth reading by writers and students. It is purposefully a bit academic so I rated it a 4 not a 5. It was a 5 for me."},{"Title":"Kings English","review":"amazon claims this is a facsimile of the 1906 first edition. It is not.

Since I do work with the original document I feared that it might only be a printed version of the online document, but I was delighted to discover that this is not the case, the book really is an expanded and up to date version of the recommended best practices based on real work network engineering experience.The book is well written (typos and a few mistakes here and there) but the essence, the meat of it all are the detailed Cisco related commands and the usefull information that is provided. Saves a lot of time versus searching mailing lists, Cisco's web site and other ressources."},{"Title":"Cisco ISP Essentials (Cisco Press Networking Technology)","review":"Finally....a book from Cisco press that is suited to the real world rather than the whiteboard or certification mill.This book is by far the best Cisco press book I have come across and is an end-to-end guide of ISP best-practices...in IOS!Probably not anything earth-shattering or unavailable elsewhere, but an excellent assembly of network engineering info for the service provider.Very high ROI on this one for those of us in the industry."},{"Title":"Cisco ISP Essentials (Cisco Press Networking Technology)","review":"What I love about this book is both the way the authors explain complex technologies simply and also (and more importantly for me) add a very real-world/practical slant to everything.

Offering a wealth of detailed technical information at the expert level, configuration diagrams, examples, and much, much, more, Cisco ISP Essentials is an indispensable and recommended guide, serving the Cisco using community as a much-needed supplement to the often confusing documentation of the Cisco IOS Software itself."},{"Title":"Cisco ISP Essentials (Cisco Press Networking Technology)","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewers. Reading this book is an enjoyment.Better yet, this book has both to-the-point explaination _and_ example on all topics.I would say, if you wanted to learn tricks to doing things, this is for you. Don't forget this book concludes with full examples/templates showing how people configure their ISP core and edge routers/switches."},{"Title":"Cisco ISP Essentials (Cisco Press Networking Technology)","review":"Cisco ISP Essentials is the ideal book for those responsible for ISP networks, whether big or small. The authors mix in practical examples, along with industry standard methods to describe ideal network setups.The book follows a logical step by step look at ISP networks, first by examining basic router setup and maintenance. Here topics such as memory and backup issues are discussed. The wonderful thing about this book is that it covers in detail many books simply leave out and unnecessary. There are detailed examples of the Network Time Protocol and configuration management. Along with the how, is the very important why for the various techniques.In the routing protocols section, most of the space is dedicated to BGP, as would be expected in a book dealing with ISP networks. The authors did not forget about internal protocols and laid a foundation for the rest of the book. There is in depth coverage of BGP setup, and the various features and setting to further enhance your network based on its requirements. Examples are provided to show actual running configurations proving the practices out.Security is a hot topic right now, and it seems to not receive as much time in its chapter of the book. What you will find however, is the constant minding of security issues throughout the rest of the book. Securing routers and routing protocols is followed by discussions on ACL's and network filters. Every area of the book touches aspects of security at some point.The fifth chapter is entitled Operational Practices, and takes the detailed ideas presented so far, and applies them to actual situations seen on ISP networks. The chapter starts with design ideas, and follows with discussions of ISP services such as DNS, Mail, and News. A detailed discussion of IPv4 addressing covers the basic structure of addressing history. There is a detailed example of an allocation plan for an ISP's needs, as well as any customers. It shows the steps to plan for the present as well as future growth in your network.There follows an extensive survey of external routing topics. A few examples for interior protocols are given, but the main topic is exterior protocols. Scaling route protocols is discussed for both interior and exterior protocols. This talk leads in to peering practices involving BGP. Multi-homing is the last topic covered, and is done in great detail. The authors describe the various options available for stub networks, single and multiple ISP connections, as well as load sharing designs.Here again security and the management tasks talked about in earlier chapters are placed into the ISP network and their use described. Tools and sample configurations follow in appendices to wrap up the discussion on best practices.Overall, the detailed examples and well thought out explanations of the various practices will serve your ISP for a long time."},{"Title":"Cisco ISP Essentials (Cisco Press Networking Technology)","review":"Good work and a must have for people dealing with networks daily."},{"Title":"March to Quebec","review":"I got this book through Amazon's out-of-print book service after reading Kenneth Roberts books Arundel and Rabble in Arms. March to Quebec is history as a primary source, and it is amazing. The volume consists of the journals of then Colonel Benedict Arnold and several of the patriots who accompanied him on his ill-fated march through the Wilderness of Maine during a sneak attack on quebec. The idea, which Arnold and his mentor General Washington cooked up, was to take Quebec and add it as a 14 colony/state. There was much adventure and intrigue. Some famous names invloved on the March are Nathaniel Green, Daniel Morgan, Dearborn, and even a young Aaron Burr. These journals leap off the page and are probably the best journals available outside those of a genration later, Lewis &amp; Clark. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"History of Lee County Texas","review":"This book is a must have for anyone researching in the Central Texas area. Contents include early history of the county, along with maps, photographs, biographies and personal narratives which help define the rich history of this area. The only flaw is an incomplete index. From the famous to the infamous, the flamboyant to the ordinary hardworking citizen...these are the early settlers of Texas. Of particular note is a reprint taken from the Galveston newspaper detailing the exploits of Wild Bill Longley, an outlaw that saw three trips to the gallows, two of which he survived. Another narrative &quot;Yegua, Land of the Noose&quot; paints a picture of early days on the wild prairies that contrast sharply with the small slow paced towns of today. A nice addition to the bookshelf of any Texas historian."},{"Title":"Decision Making in Anesthesiology: An Algorithmic Approach, 3e","review":"I've used this book on the run to clinical sites, and for keyword type presentations.I have the usual suspects on my book shelf,..

In the compact approach to Parables in the Gospels, his chief aim is to focus upon the meaning and use of parables... &quot;inherited from Jewish tradition, to understand them in the contexts of the books in which they occur.&quot;From references to Old Testament prophets who used figurative means to make their historical points, such as, Samuel to David, Ezekiel and Hosea to their generations, he moves into the New Testament. From the Synoptic Gospel Parables of Jesus, he slips into John's Parables of Light, Shepherd, Fig tree and the Vine. Next he wanders into the Apocrypha Books of I and II Esdras, Tobit and Ecclesiaticus. Most of his comments from these unique sources come in the chapter on Luke. He uses 50 pages for his discussion of Lucan parables over against fewer pages for those of Matthew and Mark.Thomas Long's approach in his &quot;Preaching the Parables&quot; at Emory-Candler School of Theology is to combine Drury's text alongside those of Father John Donahue and A. J. Hultgren. I discovered that Donahue initiates my interest in the Parable at hand - then Professor Drury continues to develop it without footnotes and fewer references. Following them, I am directed to Hultgren who combines both of their resources, focusing upon Jeremias, Dodd, Julicher, Bultmann and Crossan.Overall, I am deeply indebted to John Drury for developing my late interest in becoming a student of Jesus' Parables!

How can I rate a human being's horrific traumatic experiences when I live safely in my home in the U.S.? This is certainly not a book for someone wanting to be entertained, unless you are a sociopath. If you have a sensitive, soft heart, as I do, please be forewarned. It brought me down, down, down, emotionally as I read it, and I wasn't even able to get through the entire book - the atrocities described are unthinkable, angering, and heart-wrenching. However, it opened my eyes to what I never knew existed, and has set me on a path to do whatever I can to help the people of North Korea.If you want your eyes to be opened and do not want to stick your head in the sand regarding the realities of the world, then this book is for you.

In this case that is a good thing. We all need to learn about what happens in North Korea. These are the worst human rights violations in the world. The fact that was even more shocking is the fact that you can lose your right to be a human. That fact alone should really make us see the picture.There is a reason she lived to tell about it. She shouldn't be alive but God made it happen.Yes this picture does give graphic depictions of torture but that is what it is and should really make us all think.If she can I would love to see her write another book.

Soon Ok Lee's relatively short, but intense book provides unbelievably harrowing details of daily life in a North Korean prison, from frostbite and starvation to whippings and witnessing executions. These details leave the reader wondering how on earth she survived, even the first few months, let alone the six years! The writing is clear and easy to understand and seems to be an honest portrayal by a very strong and determined woman.A note on the book's Christianity: like many who escape North Korea, Soon Ok Lee converted to Christianity when she left North Korea, so the book is published by \\"Living Sacrifice Book Company\\" and has many references to Christianity. But for those who might find it difficult to read a Christian testimony in which a higher power is credited with all things good, but none of the bad, Soon Ok Lee's story does not make so many mentions of god that it detracts from the rest of her incredible story. This is not to insult Christians, but for a non-Christian there was nothing on the Amazon page telling me that I would be buying a book from the Living Sacrifice Book Company with a preface by the US director of the \\"Voice of the Martyrs\\"."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"This is not an easy read book, but a very moving true story.

I rejoiced when I read of true Christians giving their lives for fellow believers and cried when I realized the punishment they received while nearly unbelievable and disgusting is only a portion of what is to come for the Christians of today who allow the goodness of society to lull them into just a talk and not a real walk with the Lord.

To think in this day and age there are still so many of them. They want to control the thoughts you think and I am amazed that anyone has the will to keep going in the conditions this dear lady had to live in while in prison. This environment creates distrust and betrayal among people because they live in fear all the time. As witnessed by this book and life under Communism, etc.She was a dedicated Communist and had a responsibile position but it all fell apart and through her experiences she saw the light and how truly awful the leadership of the country is. I'm glad she found the Lord and that she is with her family now. It is truly a spiritual miracle. We should all pray for North Korea and these awful countries where the leadership wants to not only control your actions, but your very thinking.Are we lucky here in the good old U.S.A.? We are truly blessed, so let's not let it get away from us by electing those who want to drag us into a socialistic society and take the very freedoms we were founded on. Hope this doesn't offend anyone but we are living in a time when things can go downhill pretty fast without the right kind of leadership.

Many of the people imprisoned were there because of depraved party bosses. The depravity and debasement of a society that punishes those who love God should sear the conscious of everyone. This book should be read by every one who helps shape policy. My prayer is for Korean reunification minus the godless communism. When states or leaders become \\"gods\\" that is when the most heinous depravities begin. As our own nation marches toward taking God out of the schools and out of national life and hedonism and materialism replace our spiritual ideals this book should be a warning that any nation can fall and be degraded. This book is a graphic portrayal of a communist gulag.

It is a very fast read and is mostly a series of horrific anecdotes; it concludes with the author adopting Christianity (which somehow seems to provide divine justification and compensation in the author's eyes for her years of misery). I *DO* acknowledge and understand the very real and *incredible* suffering of 100,000's of North Korean prisoners but this book seems rife with what can only be characterized as exaggeration and embellishment. Situations that are described are often reduced to stereotypical morality plays: the author endures trials that would fell a titan, surviving them with horrible and permanent bodily injuries that frequently seem to vanish by the next chapter. She cites knocked out teeth, numerous experiences of being partially paralyzed and lamed by injurious punishments, and apparently countless episodes of being knocked unconscious, but seems to repeatedly recuperate totally. The book's pencil sketches of the author during her imprisonment generally portray a spry visage that is inconsistent with the text. I have NO doubts that countless innocent victims DO suffer and die in North Korean prisons but the cause of exposing this situation and bringing that government to justice is not promoted by embellishment that can't help but call into question the credibility of the underlying situation. I say as kindly as I can that I can't help but wonder if such exaggeration isn't somehow cultural -- the curious can find laughably extreme rhetoric in the stories posted by the offical North Korean news agency (...); their own words speak terrifying volumes. I generally liked this book, but the reader is advised to bring a skeptical eye for the author's specific tales while at the same time hopefully absorbing the underlying tragic saga that is today's North Korea."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"This book was the most heart-wrenching book that I have ever read.

She was able to travel some in her job as a procurer of goods. However, when one official requested more than his share, Soon Ok told him no, making an enemy for life, and an enemy that cost her the life she had known.Set up on false charges, she was sent to prison camp. She was told at the gate to forget that she was human if she was to have any hope of survival. Her story is graphic in its details and shocking at the total lack of value given to human lives in North Korea.Singled out for some of the worse treatment in the prison were people of one group: Christians. The so called &quot;heaven people&quot; (for it was illegal to mention God) were treated even worse than the general prison population. Soon Ok couldn't understand why these people refused to deny their God and save their lives. She was even more surprised that these believers would willingly take the punishment of others on themselves, sometimes even to the point of giving their lives for another prisoner.Miraculously, Soon Ok survived the prison. She was released and returned home only to find that her husband had disappeared. With her son, she determined that she could no longer live in a country that promised equality for all people and then treated so many as &quot;tailless animals.&quot;This narrative goes quickly, but will stay with the reader, haunting with its descriptions and with the thought of what is still going on in North Korea.May it drive us to prayer for those still under the boot of oppression in North Korea."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"This book is amazing. The prison camp conditions and treatment of the prisoners described are something that is so difficult for the human mind to comprehend.

If anything, things have gotten worse -- and there has been no outcry from the rest of the world.

Soon Ok Li's pain was exquisite and the scars she carries with her must be excruciating reminders of life... But as I am reading more and more of the NK stories, what amazes me most is the strengh, courage and compassion that that reign supreme in these brave souls that risk everything and lose everything, just for a chance...This was an amazing book of an unthinkable life and I thank her for writing so frankly about her experiences, helping the world to learn a little more about the people in a country and we really don't know."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"The purpose of this novel is not only to reveal the atrocities that occur in the prison camps in North Korea, but also to explain the mentality of the North Koreans that enforce these crimes.The author explains that because all organized religion is banned in North Korea, the cult of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il takes the place of religion. The North Koreans have no concept of God, and instead, they worship a man and consider his state policies to be the divine word: \\"...Several books of anecdotes illustrating the infinite wisdom and love for the people of the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung ... are like books of stories about Jesus ... Obviously it aims at binding the hearts of the people to their leader to obtain their unquestioning loyalty and obedience and unite them in a common faith.

This reclusive regime thought it could keep its political prisons secret to the world.

Neither her memoir nor The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag by Kang Chol-Hwan and Pierre Rigoulot should have been written since the North Korean government never would have expected these former prisoners to flee the country.Lee was the supervisor of a material distribution centre, and spent six years in a labour camp on trumped-up charges for not satisfying the greed of one of her officials. She was following the party line and was a devoted Communist working for the Great Leader Kim Il Sung, and would not stoop to grease the palms of anyone, including her superiors. She had access to goods and luxuries and refused to use her position to provide an official with such items. The official took revenge on Lee and in October 1986, she was summoned outside for a supposed meeting. Without any warning whatsoever, Lee was shoved into a car, forced onto a train and transported to a labour camp where she would remain for six years. She had nothing with her but the clothes on her back.The tailless animals in the title refer to herself and her fellow prisoners, who were subjected to the most unimaginable torture and who had to live and work in conditions that would be unfit for any animal. Kang Chol-Hwan, the boy prisoner in The Aquariums of Pyongyang did not have to suffer the years of torture as Lee, yet he wrote about it from the perspective of a witness. Lee writes about it as a genuine victim, and there were moments in her memoir where I felt as if I could not read on, as her words of pain and suffering were unbearable for my eyes to pass over. She was disfigured from various tortures and her photo on the back of the book reveals a smile now off-centre and partially paralyzed.Lee writes about some women prisoners who were assigned the worst jobs, such as cleaning the immense feces tank. These women were sent to the labour camp since they were \\"superstition believers\\", and Lee was surprised that even though they were subject to the worst torture and given the worst work assignments, these women never complained and always sustained themselves. Lee discovered that these \\"superstition believers\\" were in fact Christians who were being punished by the North, a state which has no religion other than the worship and praise of its Great and Dear Leaders. Lee learned that these women drew their strength from the Bible and from the love of Christ.Eyes of the Tailless Animals ends with the sudden news Lee receives of her release. One day, the prison's emergency bell rang. When the bell rings, all prisoners must gather outside and listen for names that are called out: names of prisoners who will be publicly executed. Soon Ok Lee hears her own name:\\"My heart dropped. I couldn't understand what I had done wrong to deserve a public execution.\\"At that moment the guards lead her to a place in front of everyone, and instead of hearing her death sentence, she hears:\\"Soon Ok Lee has faithfully worked for Kim Il Sung, so we decided to reward her work. She will be returned to society. I am telling all of you: If you work as hard as she did, you can also go back home.\\"Lee notices the Christian women in the front row. The Christians always stood in the front because blood from prisoners shot by the firing squad would splash onto them. This time, though, once the news of Lee's release was read out, the Christians raised their heads to praise God.When Lee is released, she is reunited with her son but never sees her husband again. As Kang Chol-Hwan describes in The Aquariums of Pyongyang, spouses of prisoners were forced to divorce their imprisoned partners and never to see them again. Lee's son, Dong Chel, however, informs his mother that government officials took his father away. After Lee and her son escape to China and two years later find themselves in South Korea, they discover that her husband was taken to \\"a certain prison in North Korea. I later learned that he was no longer at that prison. I am pretty sure that he is no longer living. He was a good teacher who was innocent. It was only because of me that he went to prison.\\"Lee discovers the word of God and converts to Christianity, and draws strength from prayer. She was saved from her living Hell by the power of God:\\"God brought me out of that hell to use me to proclaim the tragedy of those who live in that horror. I continually pray for the reunification of Korea and that God will protect the prisoners until that day.\\"Lee travels to churches all over the world, sharing her story and her belief that:\\"I have been healed with the love of God and His comfort. I no longer dream dreadful dreams. I am free.\\""},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"While printed by a Christian publishing house, Soon Ok Lee does not devote much space to her conversion to Christianity. I would like to know more about her rationalization of religion after growing up atheist.The book describes Soon Ok Lee's horrible life in North Korea's gulags. Born to a well-to-do family and given a good job, she is falsely imprisoned. She tells the horror stories that she and her fellow citizen-inmates went through. It's unfortunate that her story is consistent with other memoirs of North Korean citizens, because it shows the reality of the world's most isolated country."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"This book offers a rare glimpse into the secret hell that is the North Korean prison system. The book is about a government worker named Soon Ok Lee who was arrested on false charges. She spent about a year at an interrogation center and another five years at a prison before being released early for being a model prisoner. She then escaped to China before finally landing at South Korea.The book goes into great detail regarding the types of torture the guards practiced and the squalid \\"living\\" conditions of the camps. She also offers numerous accounts of how many prisoners were mistreated, sometimes so horribly that they died. This is all compelling to read.The book doesn't waste much time getting into the main story, and it keeps your attention throughout the whole book. The book is only about 150 pages long with a few black and white sketches of some of the conditions and actions she observed in the prisons. This is what avid readers would call \\"a page-turner.\\"By the end of the book, I admired Ms. Lee for her courage and resolve and hope that by purchasing this book, I am able to aid in her mission of rescuing the North Korean people.Having said all this, this book is not without flaws.First of all, some of the chapters are notoriously short. Some are literally three or four pages long. Other chapters don't seem to fit with the rest of the book or may be better off being placed elsewhere. These short chapters disrupt the flow of the book.Second, there is very little discussion of her escape with her son from North Korea. Perhaps Ms. Lee deliberately left this information out in order to protect the people who helped her defect. Little information is given about her life in China and how she had to avoid the North Korean police who were looking for her. This lack of information makes the final 30 pages or so of the book seem rushed.On a related note, there was not much discussion of the culture shock she experienced when she arrived in South Korea. This was a missed opportunity to better understand the gulf that exists between North and South Koreans regarding technology and culture.Also, even though the book contains a few illustrations, the images of Ms. Lee seem inconsistent with the text. In other words, there may be an image of a woman wearing normal clothes and shoes who is tied up while the text talks about having to wear nasty and tatteredclothes and being whipped and burned before being tied up. This is a bit distracting.Finally, as has been noted in other reviews, this book was published by a Christian publishing company. That's fine. For readers who are interested in or concerned about this, the book does not really begin to reference God heavily until perhaps the final 40 pages. If you are a nonbeliever, you may find it a bit hokey that an \\"invisible hand\\" guided her to the address of an associate in China whom she had not contacted for more than 10 years. If you are a believer, you may totally understand this. My point in mentioning this is that the book seems to transition from primarily describing prison life to becoming a testimony of how a woman found God and how she wants to spread God's teachings to other North Koreans. This is not really a weakness of the book, but the book's title makes no references to this.All in all, this is an interesting and important book. I wish it were a bit longer and went into a bit more detail, especially towards the end. But these are relatively minor issues. I strongly recommend this book, but I would advise people to monitor its price carefully. I purchased it new on Amazon for $10. At the time of this review, I see it being advertised for $35 new. At that price, I would not recommend it at all, especially given its lack of length."},{"Title":"Eyes of the Tailless Animals: Prison Memoirs of a North Korean Woman","review":"North Korea's prison system is the most brutal in the world.

It is the book I would teach out of for such a course. For specialty areas, I would choose a different text. Courses designed for engineers or health science majors should emphasize the techniques that are most commonly used in their discipline and the examples and applications in their discipline should be emphasized. With that said, there are still many introductory courses at universities that would be well served with this as the text.I am reviewing the first edition published in 1995. Apparently a second edition has just recently been published. As Moore says in his introduction the text is written as \\"an introduction to statistics for students in two-year and four-year colleges and universities that emphasizes working with data and statistical ideas.\\" He is true to his word. He follows the guidelines of the professional societies (ASA and MAA) which recommend emphasis on statistical thinking, more data and concepts,less theory and fewer recipes in teaching introductory statistics. They also emphasize active learning in the classroom. This book does all three but is more formal than his first book which presented and emphasized concepts very well but was not structured like a traditional course. Although the text can be used for active learning, it does not go all the way toward the currently popular approach of an activity-based course as has been initiated by Velleman and more recently by Moore himself in his activity based text \\"The Active Practice of Statistics.\\"Instructors of introductory statistics courses would be well advised to use one of Moore's text or the other text \\"Statistics\\" by Freedman et al."},{"Title":"The Basic Practice of Statistics","review":"In comparison with other statistics books, I found this one to be lacking.

Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Mowgli was raised by a pack of wolves and is taught the laws of life in the jungle. His closest friends were Baloo, (the bear) and Bagheera (sleek black panther). Mowgli learns how to speak to the animals his childhood seems pleasant. Shere Khan is a dangerous tiger that is seeking revenge on Mowgli. Shere Khan is the enemy and is feared among all of the animals in the jungle. Mowgli was taught there was a certain place in the jungle that he was forbidden to go to. Bagheera and Baloo are trying to teach Mowgli the Laws of the Jungle for his own good. They are having a difficult time with him because he is small and young. Bagheera is more concerned with Mowgli being on his own because he has not learned how to kill his own food. And they are worried that Shere Khan will come after Mowgli and try to kill him. Riki-tiki-tavi is a mongoose, a hunter, and a great fighter. Riki-tiki fought anything that came in his way, but when Nag and Nagaina (the cobra couple) approached him it was different. Rikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose's eyes grow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a little kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But Nag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass.I really enjoyed reading The Jungle Book. Kippling had a great imagination, especially since Mowgli could talk to animals. I thought the characters were shown though their actions throughout the book. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I have to say, I like Disney's version of Mowgli's story better.

As for the tale of Riki-Tiki-Tovi, I liked some parts of it, but as a kid especially, I didn't like all the snakes in it. Tumi of the Elephants is a bit strange but Her Majesty's Servants is much better. Being interested in armies, I found it to be fascinating as well as funny. Perhaps if you are not interested in armies you would not find it to be so good, but if you like to wonder what animals would say if they could talk then you still might. In fact, the whole book is primarily on talking animals, so if you like reading about that, this is the book for you! Even if you don't, you should probably still read it, it's being a classic.

Real life is illustrated here, not white washed Hollywood stories where nothing really dies but the interaction between predator and prey is ever present.Kipling in today's world is not something allowed in schools, more the pity. His writings make most of what kids today have to read insipid. I only hope other parents/grandparents will allow their offspring the chance to see life how it was and often is today..."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"It is a fine book. The virtues that it teaches are what make it a wonderful read for children. It is a morality play disguised as a child's fantasy. A young boy is taught the value of family, loyalty, courage and honor. I'd highly recommend it for any child."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I'd recommend this book for any child. Just as Aesop used the animals in his fables to teach leasons. Kipling very deftly teaches the virtues of family, loyalty, mercy, courage, sacrifice and honor using the interactions between the man cub and the jungle creatures."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This book about the jungle and the animal's way of living is one of my favourite, the story makes you reflect about nature and how we, as human, are different yet very much alike animals.

I so loved Mowgli, and his adventures in the jungles of India. I originally disliked the Walt Disney version, as I believed that Mowgli lost all of his dignity, and honour, in it. I was also stirred by Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, the mongoose, and his epic battle with a pair of King Cobra's. And who could forget little Toomai of the Elephants!

Great choice!"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JQU7JO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgIt is impossible to guess or to tell from Kipling's fragmentary autobiography, SOMETHING OF MYSELF, whether he completely made up the short stories in THE JUNGLE BOOK or whether he based them on folktales he heard as a child in India. My guess is that it's about fifty-fifty. What I'm certain of is that they are worth reading, and they will remain worth reading.However, I prefer the edition in which all the Mowgli stories are in one book and all the other stories are in a second book. The stories not involving Mowgli have no particular order in which they should be read, whereas the Mowgli stories should be read in order, with no other stories between them.When I was five years old, my grandfather died. Among the things he left us was a complete set of Kipling. Where we lived there was no library, and my parents could afford very few books, though they managed to get us the old red Childcraft (it was new then) and Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories. But the main result was that from the time I was five until my mother gave the books to a library when I was twelve, I read Kipling constantly. The Jungle Books were among my favorites, even more so than the Just-So Stories. I think all children should be exposed to these stories, and I despise the Disney version which makes the dignified Baloo a clown.I love these books."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is a beautiful edition of the wonderful childhood classic. I gave it to my twelve-year-old grandson, and he is enjoying it very much. The book is so much better than the movie! I love the way Kipling talks with his reader.

If you haven't read this book before you will get confused with the setup of the book on the kindle, especially when you go from chapter to chapter, for example: the author starts the second chapter \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\" with a poem, the title of the chapter is inserted as though it were part of the story in the first chapter and the poem is formatted like a text without commas or dashes to separate lines.The Story: I re-read this book after about 10 years and was pretty disappointed. The story really wasn't that well written. I feel like the story was very jumpy and did not flow from one idea, sentence or chapter very well. It's interesting to read in comparison to the fluffy Disney adaptation but that is really all I found this useful for. I appreciate that the author continually noted man's follies through the book by making Mowgli extremely hard headed and naive through his youth while commenting on the childish nature of humans in general. If this book was intended as a child's tale when it was written I think it is now out of it's era and the disney version is more up to par. This book may be good for a teen but may be too adult for anyone under 10, both linguistically and thematically. I find as a more advanced reader it is just not what I am looking for in a good book."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go.

Kipling's original Jungle Book is full of amazing stories of the life of Mowgli as he grows up in the jungle with his animal friends, Baloo (the bear), Bagheera (the panther), and Kaa (the python). Mowgli, whose name means frog, was raised by a family of wolves who teach him the way of the jungle. This is a great set of stories that will be enjoyable by kids and adults alike.

It is a fabulous book."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"The Jungle Book is one I had to read because of the many references to it in many books by myriad authors. It is said to be incomplete in this version. If you have not read it that will not bother you. Like me you can buy the full book. I will."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"There were some things I didn't like in the Jungle Book and that was that some people discrimanted at Mowgli because he was a human and not an animal. For example, the big elephants always didn't like Mowgli because he was a human but the little elephant always stayed his friend no matter what. I like the part that the little elephant was his friend but what about the others. His friends see whats on the inside and not what's on the outside.Also we see how the bad guy wants to get the good guy. But it's not only in Jungle Book it's always. This book shows the ignorance of people towards animals. We see how different things show new things in life. For example, you can't be plain and boring all the time, you have to try new things in life to explore. But it's not only about life but also other things.It's sad to notice that sometimes in life, people take advantage of you and in the Jungle Book that is clearly stated. You can see the love between animals and humans and that is what I think is the most important part of the book. The monkeys say thier Mowgli's friend but they aren't there when he needs them only the bear, Baloo is. And I think kids should be read this book becuase, It shows that if you try anything can be overcame. I loved this book, it was one of the most exciting and interesting books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This book was many short stories in it; most of the stories are about Mowgli and a few of them are about other animals and their adventures. My favorite one was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.Since this book is mostly about Mowgli, I should say something about it. Mowgli is a boy who was adopted by wolves and grew up to live with them all his life. He can speak their language and they love him. But Mowgli has one enemy, a lame tiger named Shere Kan. The Mother wolf had saved Mowgli from the evil tiger so Shere Kan hates him. Of course, there's a battle at the end. It is a pretty interesting story or, more like, pretty interesting stories.My favorite story, like I said before, was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi. Rikki, the mongoose who is washed out by a heavy rain and is found by a human boy named Teddy. Rikki is cared for and soon becomes healthy and fit again. One day, Rikki goes out to the large and rather uncultivated garden when he hears two birds chirping sadly. Rikki asks what had happened and one of the birds, named Darzee, tells him that one of their eggs had fallen out and was eaten by the black cobra Nag. At that moment, Nag comes out and tries to kill Rikki by making him pay attention to him while Nagfs wife, Nagaina, creeps up on Rikki. At the last moment, Rikki notices that Nagaina is behind him and he runs away.After that incident, Rikki vows to kill the two evil cobras. One day, Rikki overhears Nag and Nagaina discussing on how to kill him. They plan to break into the house, kill the humans with their deadly bite, and then, kill Rikki. Rikki quickly runs back to the house and waits till nightfall. Soon, he hears a drainpipe rattling and sees Nagfs hooded head creeping towards him with Nagaina right behind him. Rikki hides and waits till Nag comes out. When Nag turns his head towards the beds, Rikki pounces and bites Nagfs head. Rikki is nearly killed then, but the master of the house, Teddyfs father, wakes up from all the noise and shoots Nag.Nagaina, seeing all this, slinks back to her nest. While Rikki regains his strength, he finds out that Nagaina has eggs in her nest and starts searching for her with the aid of Darzeefs wife. When Rikki finds her, Darzeefs wife pretends that her wing is broken and hops around Nagaina. Nagaina moves to kill Darzeefs wife when Rikki runs from behind and takes one of the eggs away. Nagaina turns and tries to strike out at Rikki but Rikki breaks all of the eggs but keeps only one egg unbroken. Rikki threatens Nagaina to get away and Nagaina obeys him. As soon as Nagaina moved away, Rikki breaks the last of the eggs. Rikki and Nagaina battle, both finally falling into Nag and Nagainafs hole.Will Rikki win? Will he survive Nagaina's terrible strenght? If Nagaina wins and is still alive, would she marry again with another black cobra and lay eggs? You'll have to read the book to find out.....This story was sooo fun and exciting. That is mainly my reason for liking this story better than the others. But I'm not saying that the other stories are not fun. Those other stories were really interesting, especially &quot;The White Seal&quot;. This is a book you have to read!"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"The Jungle Book is the Jewel in the Crown of Kiplings prodigious career. For those few who have trouble reading it (ie - &quot;Huh?&quot; and the child who said it was like reading cardboard...)Try this: Get the unabridged audiocassette version. Kiplings rich use of language is something that must be heard - if not in the minds ear, perhaps hearing it out loud would be of use.

Children and animals are permanent companions and The Jungle Book is as fresh in the 21st century as it was in the 19th. From a human child reared in the jungle by animals to a domesticated animal who saves his people, the book brings both joy and understanding.

One is the classic tale of Riki Tiki Tavi which was a nice surprise! The others include a story about a white seal, another told from the POV of a man who can secretly understand animals' speech, and another alternately told from an elephant's perspective, then from a small boy's.

It is a very special addition to anyone's collection."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"If your only experience with Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book is through the Disney version put that completely out of your head. Besides the title of the book and the name and species of the animals the two have almost nothing in common. Disney took the very kernel of the story and then bled the heart and soul out of it. At least they didn't give Mowgli a cute but endearing sidekick.The Jungle Book is the story of a young Indian boy raised from infancy by the animals of the Asian jungle. The concept shares similarities with Tarzan of the Apes but preceded the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic by nearly 20 years. They differ in that Tarzan was fully an adult and not able to hold full conversations with the animals. Mowgli is capable of having sophisticated discussions with his panther friend Bagheera and bear Baloo about the laws of the Jungle. Kipling doesn't shy away from violence as this is the jungle but even the human characters see more than a few deaths. In the one scene in the Disney version that actually semi relates to the book Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log (monkeys). In the movie he's rescued by Bagheera and Baloo who bop the Monkey's and send them scampering on their way. In the book Bagheera, Baloo and Kaa the python (yes, in the book Mowgli and Kaa are good friends) slaughter the monkeys. At the end of the fight Kaa utilizes his hypnotic powers, influencing the Monkey's into walking straight into his gapping mouth. It's a rather horrifying scene and the only time where he uses this hypnotic talent.The Jungle Books is a classic that lives up to the name classic. Kipling has a wonderful poetic style that seems to be lost on today's writers. Only about half the stories concern Mowgli but almost all feature conversations between animals. These aren't technically talking animals since they cannot communicate with humans other than Mowgli but they can communicate amongst themselves. In one short story that I particularly enjoyed various domesticated animals in the British military discuss their roles, trying to promote their own importance while diminishing others. Some stories take place outside of India including several in the arctic. The Jungle Books also contains the story of Rikki-Tikki-Tavi which was animated by Chuck Jones. Kipling excels at setting moods and creating compelling dialogue. Mowgli's stories both begin and end the collection of short stories and by the end of the book I was saddened to leave his jungle home. The Jungle Books is classified as for young adults but the beauty and sophistication of the writing would keep just about any adult satisfied. Just make sure you get the actual Kipling book and not a watered down adaptation."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Enjoyable book from at time when Empire was romantically displayed.

Now, as a mother I read it to my daughter and it brought me to tears. The lessons taught by the jungle folk are not only beautiful but very essential, it teaches of love and compassion for all living things and how we as humans have always seen animals as inferior even though their souls, laws, and values are quite superior to our own. Just as I believe every child should grow up around animals I also think every child should read the jungle book, for, until you have loved an animal, a part of your soul remains asleep within you."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"THis was a great book.

I had purchased one of Calla Editions' classics (Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination)to satisfy my impulse to revisit some of my other childhood reading, and when I saw this edition of Jungle Book among Calla's newer publications, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't. Rikki didn't disappoint my memory of him(though the story seemed a lot shorter with the passage of years). What knocked me out are the incredible color plates by two Edwardian-era brothers--Edward and Maurice Detmold. A little Googling informed me that they'd worked together for a relatively short time before one committed suicide in his twenties; the other followed suit later on. What tragedies! The Detmolds' artistry is stunning. Mowgli is depicted as he always should have been--nude and without shame among his animal protectors, and Mowgli's antagonists--Sher Kan the tiger and Kaa the python are sinister in the Detmolds' potrayal of them. Calla has elected to run some of the color plates across two pages, which adds to their impact. Somebody at Calla must love the look of fine, old hardcover books, because they're making them available at prices within reach--and with the look and feel of the originals."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I grew up reading and re-reading theses stories. I never found a compilation of the Mowgli stories I liked though, at least not an affordable one.This one gave me not only Mowgli but Rikki-tikki-tavi. All with excellent illustrations that add but do not intrude on the stories.This is a classic that should be on every bookshelf."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"The Jungle BookWhen we say \\"The Jungle Book\\" most of us invariably think of Disney's films, both animated and live action, that have become the norm for Rudyard Kipling's immortal children's stories. While the Disney interpretation is fun and enchanting, it makes a dramatic departure from the actual stories and takes considerable creative license in telling just a part of the Kipling stories. Even what we get from Disney falls considerably short of the applicable parts of Kipling's original that Disney used. What? Kaa, the snake, as Mowgli's friend and powerful ally? What? A deeper story of Mowgli's experience as a wolf and his relationships with Mother wolf and Father wolf? Oh yes, much, much more.Kipling's original masterpiece also includes several other wonderful chapters about the continuing adventures of Mowgli and also adds the marvelous tale of \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" the heroic mongoose whose battles with wicked cobras in an Indian garden easily matches Mowgli's showdowns with Shere Khan.The book also includes the tale of \\"The White Seal.\\" This short chapter of \\"The Jungle Book(s)\\" provides a wonderful commentary, in the form of animal parable, on human society, competition, male ego and human pride. Our hero, Kotick, the white seal, through his fearless explorations and his willingness to fight for a dream, changes the minds of his parents, his peers and his society for the better. The invitation to each of us is very clear to find and free the white seal that exists in all of us.Don't get balled up in the notion that \\"The Jungle Book\\" is just for kids. A look beneath Kipling's wonderful prose reveals, like most great children's classics, that the author is using the unintimidating forum of children's literature to speak to kids of all ages with the hope that somehow we'll all finally get it.Buy the book, read it, read it to the kids you know and learn the lesson.Douglas McAllister"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is a beautifully designed book and the quality is excellent. Dover seems to have corrected the earlier problem they had with a few of the books in this series, where the text quality was faded and inconsistent in spots. This book has sharp and consistent text and photographs."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"If you were to ask anyone to describe \\"The Jungle Book\\", they would probably take their cue from the widely knownDisney film, and say that it was about a young boy who was raised by wolves in the jungle, mentored by a bear and a panther, and who eventually kills a dangerous tiger. In this they'd be right, but they'd only be describing the first three chapters.The rest of the book is a series of unrelated short-stories about other animals, and which are not necessarily set in the jungle either. I was surprised at this, as although I knew that Disney had extensively reshaped the story, I had no idea that Mowgli's story was such a comparatively small part of the book. To my knowledge, Rudyard Kipling's characters have also featured in an anime series and alive-action film, and in both cases there has been no indication that the source material involved anything other than a boy called Mowgli and his adventures growing up in the jungle.Though I had known that Disney had extensively reworked Kipling's book (as Disney is always accustomed to do with its film adaptations) it was surprising to find out the real scope and beauty of the original collection of stories, and just how deeply the film had permeated public awareness of what the story involved. Here Mowgli's story doesn't end when he rejoins the man-village, Kaa the snake is not an enemy but an ally, Shere Khan is not defeated with fire, but with a well-strategized buffalo stampede, and there are no vultures that sound like The Beatles (though you probably had that figured out on your own). If there's one thing that especially stands out, it's that Mowgli in this story is much more likeable and intelligent than the loathsome little brat of the film.After Mowgli's father is killed in the jungle, he is raised by a wolf-pack as one of their own, called \\"the frog\\" on account of his gangly limbs, and tutored by Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther in the ways of the Jungle Law: the fair but sometimes harsh edicts that make up life among the animals. Having escaped captivity at an early age, Bagheera in particular is serious about Mowgli's education, hoping that when he finally returns to his own people, he can take knowledge of the Jungle Law with him to teach his fellow man.Yet Mowgli is not easily accepted by either beast or man. Not only are the young wolves threatened by their inability to look him in the eye, but Shere Khan the tiger considers Mowgli his rightful prey. Likewise, the men and women of the village find the boy disconcerting in his habits and strange upbringing, making Mowgli quite a tragic figure in his inability to find a true home among either animals or mankind.The first three chapters of \\"The Jungle Book\\" revolve around Mowgli's story: his upbringing in the first chapter and defeat of Shere Khan in the third, leaving the second (rather oddly, considering it's out of chronological order) to deal with his kidnapping at the hands of the Bandar-log: the Monkey People. Kipling is wonderful at capturing the mystery and atmosphere of the jungle, as well as the fundamental character traits of the animals (the thoughtless monkeys, the malevolent jackal, the wise panther, the complex wolf-pack dynamics). He introduces concepts such as the Jungle Law and the Red Flower, the animal etiquette used in the sharing of hunting grounds and the way in which they address each other, and each species' unique customs and idioms. It's all fascinating stuff, carefully strewn throughout the story to provide a rich background to the world that Mowgli inhabits.The stories that follow are not quite as memorable, but still hold up well, and a couple have been published separately as their own books (\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" and \\"Toomai of the Elephants.\\")\\"The White Seal\\" involves the birth of a strange white seal called Kotick who - after witnessing the mass slaughter of his fellows at the hands of sealers - takes it upon himself to traverse the seas in search of a safe beach that has not been discovered by man. It takes several years and a visitation with the mysterious sea-cows before he can finally return to his people and tell them of his discoveries. It's at this point that a certain sense of values dissonance kicks in. Does Kotick convince his fellow seals to follow him to the promised land through his strong leadership and rousing speeches? No, he beats them all to a bloody pulp and insists on them following him once they've all been defeated.Outside of Mowgli's chapters, \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is probably the most famous of Kipling's short stories. A mongoose is adopted into the home of an English family living in the jungles of Sugauli cantonment, where it soon learns that a cobra and its mate are planning to kill the little boy in the attempt to drive the family away and reclaim the bungalow for themselves. Aided by other animals in the house and garden, Rikki-Tikki-Tavi prepares to defend his home and family against the snakes with a series of ambushes, tricks and his instinctive fighting abilities. This is definitely the most appealing of the stand-alone stories.\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" concerns a young Indian boy who works with his father in the rounding-up and breaking-in of elephants for the Indian government. Having grown up among them, he has no fear of the elephants that he can control with simple words and hand gestures. Though his father prefers camp life, it is Toomai's greatest ambition to go hunting for the elephants in the jungle, though he is told that this will only occur when he \\"sees the elephants dance\\" (that is, never).But one night Kala Nag and the other trained elephants are acting strangely, and when several manage to break free of their pickets, Toomai climbs aboard Kala and is taken to mysterious clearing where elephants from miles around have indeed come to dance...In many ways \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" feels like the odd one out in this collection. More for adults than children (who may find it rather incomprehensible) Kipling provides a first-person narrative account of a British soldier who eavesdrops on a number of animals in service to the army. As each one tries to explain, justify and comprehend their roles in the service of mankind, the listener is struck by the differences between each one, and their understanding of the world they inhabit.Up until this story, Kipling has managed to steer surprisingly clear of imperialism and unfortunate implications; here however, there is mention of \\"savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Asia\\" and \\"a wild king of a very wild country,\\" as well as ending the story on a note of British superiority over the disorganization of its colonies. For these reasons, \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" doesn't hold up as well as the other stories.As well as the seven short-stories, the book also contains several poems, songs and chants, usually said to be performed by the animals themselves.Just as many readers are unaware thatLittle Womenis composed of two books (Little Women and Good Wives) and that most of Alice's famous adventures took place in the sequelBehind The Looking Glass, it's a relatively little known fact that there was a sequel to the Jungle Book. Known simply asThe Second Jungle Book, Kipling includes several more Mowgli adventures in it, as well as other stand-alone stories and poems. Many editions of \\"The Jungle Book\\" combine both the first and second book into one volume, though it's difficult to tell which is which considering Amazon.com has grouped all the reviews together, regardless of what edition is being discussed. It's hard to know exactly what you'll be getting when you make the order, so keep in mind that it's easy to miss out on the sequel. There is also the risk of buying an abridged version that cuts out stories or tampers with Kipling's use of language (his use of the archaic terms \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" in discussions among the animals), so please be careful in deciding which edition to purchase.All in all, \\"The Jungle Book\\" is still a rich and intriguing read, with only a few dated passages. At the very least, it's worth reading in order to get an understanding of the source material as it was before Disney put its stamp on it."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"It's a very good book, and as far as I can tell it's very close to the original which was apparently a problem with some of the other printings."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is amazing. It really is worth your time. I am 14 and I am forced to read &#34;Classic Literature&#34; by my dad. In my opinion, reading classic literature is a chore. This book is definatly an exception. I had a hard time putting this book down.. It is enticing, exciting, insightful and a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"The Jungle Books (parts 1 and 2) are wonderful novels that focus primarily on the exploits, adventures, and maturation of an orphaned boy named Mowgli. Mowgli is raised in the jungle by the animals and is educated in the laws and ways of the various jungle dwellers. Loyalty, trust, honor, honesty, and courage are but a few of the values championed in these books. The Jungle Books also remind us that childhood doesn't last forever, and eventually we all must leave it behind to assume greater responsibility in the world. As Kaa the Python said in the book &quot;Having cast the skin, we may not creep into it afresh.&quot; These novels are pure magic."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"The delightful tales in The Jungle Book can and should be enjoyed by young and old. Mowgli, a human child in India, is rescued by wolves and raised by them with wolf brothers and sisters by wolf parents, after an evil lame tiger chased away his human parents. The tiger who not only kills humans wants to control the wolf pact. He tells the wolves insistently that Mowgli belongs to him. Mowgli has many adventures among the wolves and later among humans. Once, for instance, he was captured when he was ten or eleven years old by monkeys, who are portrayed as stupid forgetful creatures in the book. He is saved during a lengthy battle by Bagheera the black panther who loves him and by Baloo the bear that is his instructor, as well as the python Kaa who respects him. Mowgli leaves the jungle and goes to live in the human village. He thinks that people act and think strangely, speak foolishly, and believe that they can change things, which Mowgli knows cannot be changed. These are just some of Mowgli's many adventures. The book also contains exploits by many different animals, such as the story of the white seal that saves other seals from being killed by men for their skins, the mongoose who rescues a family from husband and wife cobras, and a boy who sees elephants dance."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Everyone knows this is one of the most amazing books of all time, so I'm not going to waste your time by reviewing the stories. They're amazing. We know. What I do think is worth noting is that this cover is beautifully designed and the size and shape of the book itself are really subtle and pleasing. Maybe I'm just a weirdo but give me a square or nearly-square paperback any day. It's just more comfortable to hold. Okay, I AM a weirdo. It's fine. For the price you can't beat it. Wish they did a Puffin Classic of The Second Jungle Book."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"against the advice of my peers in 6th grade, i read this book. immediatly i fell in love with this book, and ever since, have recomended it to those who are looking for a good story."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"i saw the jungle book when i was a kid and expected the book to be all about the advenures of a little boy in the jungle. but this book is so much more. and the poetry is just beautiful. my favorite story is rikki tikki tavvi."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This review focuses on the audio production of the first Jungle Book as read by Flo Gibson. I've read many of these stories to my daughter, so I know the difficulty of catching Kipling's rhythm and phrasing. Flo Gibson does an excellent job, with clear diction, well paced delivery and competent \\"acting\\" of the various characters. She pronounces the character's names as attributed to Kipling in the notes of my faithful Penguin edition. Even then, my 10 year old daughter had difficulty with some of the phrasing, and we paused the CD's as we drove across the country to discuss and clarify. However, I attribute this difficulty to the richness of Kipling's text, which my daughter is not used to - yet.In short, Flo Gibson uses her talents to deliver Kipling's wonderful stories. I recommend this unabridged audio edition."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Each one of my two wonderful late husbands had the highest moral character and had highly successful careers.

It was one of the first books I read when I graduated to chapter books and even today it remains a favorite. I liked it then, as I like it now, because unlike so many modern children's books it doesn't water down the story or dumb down the plotline. I felt as if I wasn't being talked down to like in so many other children's/young adult books and to me that was important. It's somewhat misanthropic (when Mowgli is thrown out of the village) but I think it does have more redeeming values then most. I am proud to have a copy of these stories sitting eloquently on a book shelf where no other Children's/Young Adult books keep it company. I think even if you're an adult, if you've never read this book it's a must! The Disney movie made loosely, extremely loosely, on Mowgli's adventures always makes me want to scream. It's horribly tepid and completely butchered but I guess that's where I learned movies rarely live up to the grandness of books."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I recently bought this book while browsing a bookstore. For the past two weeks my 4-year old son and I have sat snuggled up reading one or two chapters at bedtime (we're on our second time through now). Although I read to him daily, this is the first \\"chapter book\\" that I've read to him. He has been fully engaged and followed the story, asking questions about the jungle, and learning words he's never heard before. He's asked questions about Mowgli and Baloo during breakfast and played like a panther at preschool. The drawings are simple and I think having one picture for every page of text has been helpful in holding his attention.While I love this book, it is very condensed from the original and lacks the vivid descriptions and insight to the characters that the original provides. But that is also part of why I purchased this version... my son isn't old enough to understand much of Kipling's old English grammar and complex thought. In a few years, when my son is older, I'll read the original with him but for now, this is perfect for his attention span and level of understanding."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"To my grandsons to read it.

Alas, Dover hasn't manufactured paperbacks that way in years, but this clothbound edition looks every bit as durable as it is beautiful. Many will find it an attractive alternative to the Borzoi Book (Everyman's Library) published by Knopf; the paper is finer, and the illustrations (by the Detmold brothers) are reproduced in full color. This book is not, however, a facsimile reprint of the Macmillan edition of 1908. As the publisher's note explains, the plates have been \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" From these remarks one gathers that the illustrations are larger here than in the 1908 edition, some of them spread across two pages. Unfortunately, the binding (unlike that of the Knopf edition) is too firm for the open book to lie flat, so several of these two-page presentations (notably that of Kaa on pages 64-65) are spoiled by the heavy fold down the center. Moreover, in spite of the \\"elegant new type design and many additional decorative elements,\\" it is annoying to find Kipling's verses centered line by line instead of systematically indented according to their rhyme schemes. One final note: the text appears to be that of the first American edition, not the more established English edition."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Am vazut in copilarie filmul de desene animate, pe urma am citit carte tradusa in limba romana, si acum ma bucur citind cartea in limba engleza.

It is about an Indian infant called Mowgli who is lost in the jungle, but then was placed in a wolf family. He grows up in the jungle therefore having no manners or any sense of human life. The Jungle Book show how friends can always be mad but then they come around. And they will always be there for you no matter what, if not then they aren't true friends. There is great ambition in Mowgli.His story is great for all ages. A lot of the characters are explained in detail and you grow to actually love the animals. I think all kids should have read the book rather than see the movie becuase the book is much better.Some of the values showed in this book are loyalty, trust honor, and courage. This book is valued by many children and it should be read to them as young kids to also expand their imagination. I think that this book was better than a lot of the books that Kipling has written before like &quot;Rikki-tikki-tavi&quot; or &quot;Kim&quot;.

I would recommend this book for older people such as high shcoolers, or people going to collage. This book has content that might be harder for younger children, so I wouldnt recommend it for them. But for the older people, I think you should read this book."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I looked foward to reading the Jungle Book, after reading Kim and seeing how well Kipling wrote. And in the Jungle Book I found absolutely nothing, besides what I venture to mention, that slights my opinion of the quality of Rudyard Kipling's writing. I felt that in this book Kiplng was trying to exercise a mode of writing that was supposed to be at an elementary level, and therefor more suitable for children. I claim the same excuse for the length of the book. Yet I feel that Kipling's mode was not the best that could have been chosen. Instead, the book seemed to have a choppy quality, let me explain myself by saying that one chapter was used on a small event in Mowgli's life, and then several years were skipped, so the contents of the next chapter forced you to use an element of brain power for comprehension. I do not know the reader's, nor the general public's, feelings toward this use of brain power, I only know mine, which are that this usage distracts my from the story, and slightly takes me away from the spell any good book ought to have. I do not for one minute say that any of the contents of the book, extracting to the very singular word, were not put down without great thought, creativity, and originality, which all together produce a degree of brilliance. That degree, however, may alter, and I feel that although the brilliance is most definately there, it is not at it's utmost level. I find no fault of that with the author, except that of Kipling's trying to overtake a goal so difficult even he, with all his brilliance, was not able to peform to allow it to be rated as high as five stars. I do, though, sincerely applaud Rudyard Kipling's, original and, absolutely, in every possible way, amazing work, although I feel it to contain too many small faults to call it equal to its extroadinary reputation. I place the fault of it's too high reputaton sincerely upon those who read the book without knowlegde of it beforehand."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"What a joy it was to read this again on my Kindle, thanks for making it available for free! It was so much fun to read as I have now seen the DVD a million times, thanks to my daughter."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"\\"The Jungle Book\\" is a collection of stories (or fables) and songs/poems by Rudyard Kipling, and was originally published in 1894. The book consists of 7 short stories, separated by seven poems. The first three stories involve Mowgli, but the other four stories are not part of that series, nor do they all take place in the same jungle or any jungle at all. What these stories do have in common is the anthropomorphizing of animals as characters in these stories. As with all fables, these stories impart a moral message to the reader.\\"Mowgli's Brothers\\" is the first story in the book and was originally published in January of 1894 in \\"St. Nicholas Magazine\\". The story is about Mowgli being adopted by the wolf family which then raises him. With Shere Khan hunting in their area of the jungle, the Father Wolf (Akela) and the mother (Raksha) find and take in a human baby. At the wolf council, Baloo speaks for the cub, and Bagheera buys his life with a fresh kill. As time passes, Shere Khan turns most of the wolves against Mowgli, and they plot to overthrow Akela as the leader. Mowgli is then sent away from the wolves, vowing to return with Shere Khan's hide. This story is followed by the \\"Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack\\".\\"Kaa's Hunting\\" is a short study from March-April of 1894. It takes place sometime during the period covered in \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", though it isn't mentioned in that story. It is a story about Mowgli's abduction by monkees, a.k.a the Bandar-log. Baloo and Bagheera, rescue Mowgli with the aid of Kaa. This story is followed by the \\"Road Song of the Bandar-Log\\".\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" was a short story published in February of 1894 in magazines before being published in this collection. This covers the confrontation between Mowgli and Shere Khan. Mowgli has been kicked out of the jungle and has been adopted by a couple who believe he is Nathoo, the child that they lost. Mowgli tries to fit in, but he alienates himself from the others because he doesn't accept their misconceptions about the jungle. Shere Khan returns and is plotting to kill Mowgli, but he is warned by one of his wolf friends (Grey Brother) whom he goes to visit regularly. Mowgli comes up with a plan to kill Shere Khan, but when successful he gets into an argument with Buldeo, the hunger. Buldeo tries to take Shere Khan's skin, but Mowgli refuses to give it to him, so Buldeo turns the entire village against him and Mowgli finds himself an outcast of both the jungle and the village. This story is followed by \\"Mowgli's Song\\".\\"The White Seal\\" is a short story published in August of 1893. The story is about Kotick, a rare white-furred seal who spends his life searching for a home where seals will not be hunted by humans. He is isolated from the other seals by his goal, but he finally discovers a place that the Sea Cows know which is free from man. This story is followed by \\"Lukannon\\".\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" is a story from November of 1893. In this story an English family save a young mongoose (Rikki Tikki) who becomes their pet. Rikki Tikki first saves the families young boy Teddy from a dust brown snakeling. Rikki Tikki takes to patrolling the house while the family sleeps, and it is during this that he is warned by Chuchundra that there are two cobras (Nag and Nagaina) that are planning to kill the family. Rikki Tikki first takes on Nag, waking the father who kills Nag. Nagaina then swears vengeance, but Rikki Tikki gets help from Darzee (a tailor bird) and locates Nagainaj's nest and then uses the eggs to distract Nagaina to save Teddy again. This story is followed by \\"Darzee's Chant\\".\\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" is a short story from the December of 1893. In this story little Toomai is told that he cannot be an elephant handler unless he sees the dance of the elephants. When the great elephant Kala Nag hears the call of the elephant from far off in the jungle, he goes to find the elephants, taking little Toomai with him. This story is followed y \\"Shiv and the Grasshopper\\".\\"Her Majesty's Servants\\" was originally published in March of 1894. This story is about the various animals used to support Her Majesty's armed forces in India. The animals discuss their roles in the army, each taking pride in the function they perform. This is followed by \\"Parade-Song of the Camp Animals\\" which closes out the book.This is a good collection of short stories, though there is a definite variability in the quality, and of course they don't all take place in the jungle. Rudyard Kipling wrote poems, short stories, and novels. Having lived in India, England, and the United States, and also spent a fair amount of time in South Africa. He drew on the rich cultural history that he enjoyed to create some wonderful tales. He remains one of the best known writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \\"The Jungle Book\\" is one of his best known works, though most know it through films which do not accurately represent the stories within. It blends his short fiction with some of his poems, but I find it a bit too uneven to give it five-stars."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is the book to get-- Kipling's original. It's got the Mowgli stories, Rikki Tikki and more. It's light on illustrations but you can find supplementary illustrations online. This edition is small, complete, and highly portable."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I can't begin to count how many times I've read this book from one end to the other--still less the times I've dipped in just to reread a favorite tale over. It may be Kipling's defining juvenile book, in part because it's written for a slightly older audience thanJust So Stories, with more violence and a more mature level of language (the Mowgli stories particularly feature dialogue written in \\"the vernacular,\\" a rather formal kind of speech used by native speakers in India).Most of the 15 stories are set in the Subcontinet, where Kipling was born and to which he returned as a man; the rest (\\"The White Seal,\\" \\"Quiquern\\") take place in the Far North. Eight feature Mowgli (Hindi for \\"frog\\"), a gypsy child whose parents were frightened off by Shere Khan, the lame tiger, leaving him to be rescued and adopted by a pair of wolves. He is raised in the jungle (\\"Mowgli's Brothers,\\" \\"Kaa's Hunting,\\" \\"How Fear Came\\"), learning its laws and speaking the languages of its creatures, until at the age of 10 he is caught up in a sort of palace coup engineered by the tiger and forced to leave his pack. He stays among humans for four months, kills Shere Khan (\\"Tiger! Tiger!\\"), is driven out by the villagers and ultimately pays them back in spades (\\"Letting in the Jungle\\"), then returns to the wolves, has various further adventures (\\"The King's Ankus\\"), and ultimately saves the pack from invading dholes (\\"Red Dog\\") before his human instincts at last him force him back to his own kind (\\"The Spring Running,\\" which invaribaly makes me tear up). (If you want to find out what happened to him afterward, read \\"In the Rukh,\\" which can be found inMany Inventions..) Featuring such creatures as Mother and Father Wolf, Gray Brother (the oldest of their pups), Baghera the Black Panther, Baloo the brown bear, Kaa the Rock Python, Hathi the elephant, Chil the kite, and Akela, the Lone Wolf who leads Mowgli's pack for years, these stories are about as far from the Disney version as anything you can imagine, and to my mind far superior. (I wish some studio would take them up as Harry Potter was, and do them accurately: the animatronics and CGI that gave us such caracters as the ice-bears inThe Golden Compass (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)and the farm animals inMist: The Tale of a Sheepdog PuppyandBabe (Widescreen Special Edition)would bring them to life as never before.)\\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" tells the story of a young mongoose taken into a human home and how he fights a pair of cobras in the garden. \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" features Little Toomai, whose forebears for three generations have been the mahouts of Kala Nag, the great work elephant, and how his friendship with the pachyderm leads him to see \\"the sight that never man saw,\\" the elephants' dance. \\"The Miracle of Purun Baghat\\" is about a high-ranking native official who forsakes position and honors to become a mendicant holy man, and how he saves a tiny hill village from a catastrophic landslide. In \\"The Undertakers,\\" a man-eating crocodile, a jackal, and an adjutant-stork discuss the vagaries of humanity on a sandbar. \\"Her Majesty's Servants,\\" a story particularly suitable for reading in a multicultural society like that of the U.S., eavesdrops on the conversation between a troop-horse, two mules, a baggage-camel, and a pair of gun-bullocks on the night before a great troop review. In \\"The White Seal,\\" Kotick, a fur-seal born snow-white, sets out on a quest to find a place where his kind will be safe from human fur-hunters. \\"Quiquern\\" tells of a young Inuit hunter and how he and his dog save his people in a time of starvation.These stories should probably be read aloud first, since their rather formal language will make them difficult for the younger independent reader to follow, particularly in these days of dumbed-down readers (although the homeschooled may not have as much trouble). Kids of 11 or 12 should be able to read them alone. Despite Kipling's occasional imperialistic chauvinism (hardly unique to him in that time and place), he had a real knowledge of India, its creatures, and its people, and he loved them all, with an intensity that comes through in every tale; and his language, as well as his characters', often approaches the poetic (he was, after all, a noted and prolific poet aswell as a fictioneer). No English-speaking child should reach his teens without coming to know the book."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is a classic tale of course, the thing I like about this copy is the quality for the price.

If you are looking for the Disney version of the book ,you won't find it here, but this is alot better!"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"No this is not your Disney movie - Kipling wrote a fantastic series of short stories, only a few of which include Mowgli. Baloo is not a lazy idiot, Kaa is not a bad guy, SherKahn is killed rather then run off, the wolves are not always the noble good guys... this is VERY different then our cotton candy Disney film. And so much more enjoyable for it.Also included are the tales of Rikki Tikki Tavi, the Elephant Dance, and the White Seal. I would have to say that my favorite is Rikki Tikki Tavi, he's just so loveable and wonderful. There is a sense of magic in Kiplings animals, every reader will find themselves dreaming of being raised by wolves and taught the law of the jungle by Baloo.I know that this was written as a children's book - but I have a hard time believing that my 11 year old son would be able to read and enjoy it, the beauty of the language will be lost on many of the younger readers who are used to the forward speaking newer YA books. But I would assume that by middle school they should be able to fully enjoy it."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Though Walt Disney and Enid Blyton are my fav picks for children, The Jungle Book is a nicer read. Mowgli is just a loving character and as an Indian version of the Jungle Book is a fav among kids in Hindi, this is a sure pick for all children. Rudyard Kipling takes kids for a ride to an adventure with thrills and fantasies - it all depends on the taste and choice of read. However, I recommend this book as this is fun read and kids in my library too, love to read and watch The Jungle Book.

All one has to do is read the original Pinocchio, Peter Pan, or, supposedly, Bambi, to berate them for destroying classics. I probably should be bothered as well by their Jungle Book, except that I think that it was one of the cases where the marriage of animation, story and music achieves more than the original. Without the source material, it would be nothing, of course, but the wonderful songs (who can forget \\"Bare Necessities,\\" \\"Trust in Me,\\" or \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\"?) and the structure that turned Kipling's short tales into a two-hour movie create a gestalt that I'm not sure Kipling's tales do by themselves. This is probably sacrilege to the ears of the true Kipling fan, but I'm nothing if not opinionated.The stories that make up the Jungle Book aren't solely about Mowgli, though, and it's the others, especially \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,\\" that make this a definate must have."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This book was good because it had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.

Definitely aspects of this book have aged; Kipling was steeped in the age of the Great British Empire, especially the Raj (India). However in some ways that can be interesting as it provides an unintended glimpse at how attitudes and points of view have changed i.e. Kipling's unconsciously blithe racism which often comes across as patronisingly affectionate. Kipling was, after all, a product of his age. Much of the story telling is truly calssic, beautifully written and a great read (especially the Mowgli stories)."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Got this book for my stepdaughter, i consider it a classic, so i want her to start reading an collecting this type of books... a must have in my opinion!"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is a very amazing book anyone who hasnt already should definantly read it.

Of course this is a great story, but the original Kipling version is very hard to understand for younger readers (or listeners in this case). I found myself having to go back and explain each paragraph or page to make sure my son (who is fairly bright) was following along. For an adult to read for her/his self, I am sure it would be great.

When you read the book it makes you feel like you're there too. I like the way Rudyard Kipling has the animals talk. The main character in the story is a boy named Mowgli. Mowgli was abandoned by his mother and father and raised by wolves. I thinkMowgli is the perfect character for the story because he is brave, smart, and kind.The part I disliked the most in the story is when they keep going to the council rock. I thought it was boring. I liked the excitement in the book and the cliff hangers. Once I picked up the book I couldn't set it down again. I definitely recommend this book to anybody who is in for a challenge!"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"kipling is great of course, but part of the story is missing, the chapters run together, and there is no table of contents"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Since he wrote these stories during the several years he spent in Brattleboro, VT, we of the North Country have a particular affinity for Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Books. The most familiar are the Mowgli tales, basis for the very good Disney movie. Mowgli is an Indian infant who is lost in the jungle after Shere Khan (the tiger) kills his family. Bagheera (the black panther) places him with a wolf family that has a newborn litter. Mowgli's new &quot;parents&quot; and Bagheera and Baloo (the brown bear) sponsor him for membership in the Wolf Pack and, much to Shere Khan's chagrin, he is admitted. Mowgli is raised according to Jungle Law, but all the while Shere Khan is plotting his revenge and ingratiating himself with the younger wolves. Eventually, he leads a rebellion against Akela, the pack's aging leader and attacks Mowgli, who beats him away with a burning firebrand. In these and the several other Mowgli stories--there are some prequels--Kipling strikes a nice balance between anthropomorphizing the animals and understanding Mowgli's natural superiority.Also appearing in this collection is a story I've loved since I first saw the Classic Cartoon version--Rikki Tikki Tavi. It tells the story of an intrepid young mongoose and his life or death battle to protect an Indian villa from a couple of particularly unpleasant cobras. Rikki Tikki Tavi has always seemed to me to be one of the great heroes in all of literature.These are great stories for young and old. For folks who worry about Kipling's potentially imperialist, racist or racialist overtones (see review), rest assured, these tales are free of such themes. They offer an excellent opportunity to introduce kids to the work of a true master storyteller.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I have never seen The Jungle Book movie, I just wanted to understand a bit of what might have captured the imagination of people 100 years ago (and how they might have written stories). The Jungle Book is not a happy story about people bopping around in the jungle, it is about life and death and honour and character and discipline in a pitiless world. Because it is written in a dense style by Rudyard Kipling almost 120 years ago, it is not easy to follow, but it does tell in eight chapters and eight poems interesting tales of the deep jungle. First of all it tells the tale of Mowgli, how he's rescued from Shere Khan the tiger by Mother Wolf, and championed by Akela, and then it goes into his education, his abduction by the lawless monkey tribes, his confrontation with the Jungle council, his re-emergence into human society, and his final revenge on Shere Khan. The story continues on The Jungle Book 2, but we also have non-Mowgli stories: the amazing tale of Riki-Tiki-Tavi (which I saw once on TV as a non-Mowgli Jungle Book animation), as well as a really wonderful story of a white seal trying to save his seal-mates from perpetual exploitation and hunting from the nearby Russian communities.Some of the stories are not so great - I didn't really understand the point of \\"Toomai of the Elephants\\" or \\"Her Majesty's Servants\\", but on the whole it was a great, if somewhat incomprehensible, book."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Free is good but some quality control would have been nice.As it is, chapters and even complete stories flow over in each other without any non-literal clue."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"The Jungle Book is a classic we all know, however Robert Ingpen's illustrations bring this book alive.

The way Kipling shows the struggle of this young boy in the jungle is amazing. He fails to leave out any detail and throughout the whole story your totally caught up in it without one point of boredom. I recommend this to any parent looking for a good book to read to their children or to have their kids read. Kipling is a great author and after doing a report on him and reading some of his other works I recommend those as well, especially A White Man's Burden. If your looking for books by a author who mixes fiction with truth, action and adventure with tales that bring in more serious aspects Kipling is the author for you."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is such a great book.

The stories are a wonderful length for read alouds. The Jungle Book is, of course, a classic and not in need of a review; however, if your only exposure to the Jungle Book is Disney, please give this a try. I wanted to commend Sterling Publishers on making a quality, affordable edition of this and other classics. The paper quality was nice, not thin or translucent. The font is also pleasant--not to small or cramped. I know this may seem faint praise, but so many classics collections are very poorly executed. The price is also very agreeable--only slightly more than a paperback."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"My favorite books from childhood have always been Milne's \\"The World of Pooh\\" and Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book\\". Over the years I have purchased many copies of each as presents. Both can be difficult to find in versions unaltered from the original. I have found this to be particularly true in the case of The Jungle Book. Some folks just don't seem to get that Kipling had a pretty good handle on what he was doing. One does not tamper with a Masterpiece.This version is the real thing. It reads word for word the same as the tattered, 40-year-old copy that I first read when I was eight years old. Add illustrations by Robert Ingpen that faithfully capture the emotion of the story and you have a real winner. For those who appreciate The Jungle Book as it was BEFORE it was adulterated by Mr. Disney and friends, this is a very worthy effort."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I bought this book to read with my 9 year-old son. We have the Disney books and movies at home but since he is an avid reader and I love Rudyard Kipling I thought it was time to find him the real deal and this book is it. I like everything about it, the font type, the illustrations, and the writing is, well... Rudyard Kipling. Beautiful, rich, provocative language that unleashes a child's imagination. My son and I devoured it in a few nights and after we were done it led to a really deep discussion on the differences with the Disney's version. It was a welcomed reminder that we can understimate both our children's capacity to digest the classics and their appeal to them."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"This is undoubtedly a beautiful book, but it should definitely be noted that it only contains the first half of Mowgli's story (i.e., through Shere Khan chapter only) - the text seems unabridged that far, but parts of both Jungle Books are missing - which I for one was misled about from other review(s)."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Legends are made from legends.

They are all of superior quality in terms of binding, paper, as well as illustrations. The book is larger than a regular hardcover, and this particular title \\"The Jungle Book\\" weighs about two pounds. This 2010 Calla edition is a republication of the edition originally published by Macmillan and Co. in 1908. The paper is of heavy stock, one can literally feel the heft of each page! The color of the paper is ivory (or something close to it), and it is bound in pearl linen. The font used is Kennerley Old Style and Michelangelo, and apart from decorative borders on the pages, the highlight of this book is the 16 color plates, some in two-page spreads by twin brother artists Edward and Maurice Detmold.According to the information provided within the book, these illustrations are \\"reproduced from an extremely scarce, original portfolio of watercolors, and have never before appeared on this scale in book form.\\" I believe it! They are truly beautiful and exquisite, and incredibly detailed, almost life-like. There is one illustration featuring an unclothed Mowgli standing alongside the Lone Wolf, and the rich earthy tones in the picture are brilliantly depicted. There's another illustration (two-page spread) titled The \\"Council Rock\\" which has a magnificent Bagheera and I swear the glint in his eye appears very real!The depiction of Kaa the Python is also stunning.

I am reading the ORIGINALtext JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now),and he's not once indicated that the language puzzleshim.

These stories are great reads, enjoyable by all ages.Fans of the movie will find a more complex work here -- not \\"darker,\\" but more ambiguous; the three stories from this collection that have generally been adapted into other media, and that most readers think of when they think of \\"The Jungle Book\\", focus on outcast human infant, Mowgli, who is abandoned as an infant in the jungle and raised by wolves, and primarily tell the story of his search for a \\"place\\" within the wolf pack, the Jungle, and the human world, and his outsider status in all three realms. Perhaps because they focus almost entirely on the Indian jungle, or perhaps because they're aimed at children, these stories are also largely free of the undertone (overtone?) of imperialism that runs through much of Kipling's work for adults.It has, of course, been massively influential on later writers, from Edgar Rice Burrough's _Tarzan_ to Neil Gaiman's _The Graveyard Book_. The various morals contained within the \\"Mowgli\\" stories were also taken as a motivational book within the Scouting movement (reading this helped me understand why I had to memorize \\"Akela\\" when I was a cub scout).While only three stories in this collection focus on Mowgli, Kipling did write a second collection, \\"The Second Jungle Book,\\" which is almost entirely comprised of Mowgli stories, and which I would highly recommend if you like these tales. If you want to read more of Kipling's work for adults, I'd recommend either \\"The Man Who Would be King\\" or the short story collection \\"Plain Tales from the Hills,\\" both of which should be available for free online.As to formatting of this kindle edition: there are blocks of Kipling's poetry in between the stories, some of which was difficult to read as the formatting had not carried over well to this Kindle edition. Not a critical issue, but Kipling's poetry is excellent and the formatting errors were annoying."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts. I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.The Classic Starts version of the Jungle Book and other stories is the most complex in language and sentence structure. It's not as easy for a beginning reader to read as Stepping Stones or Great Illustrated Classics, but offers a much better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure.With these paraphrased versions, there is always the dilemma one faces: whether to wait until the genuine, original story is accessible or risk turning the reader off with a poor paraphrase that lacks the vibrancy of the real thing, but possibly gain the enjoyment of a classic gem much earlier than the original text would afford. In the case of the Jungle Book in particular, you also have the movie. I imagine it would be hard to follow the real story after the movie. I'm glad my kids will have heard Kiplings version before Disney's.Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read. We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood. Since I am reading them aloud, we've forgone the simplest versions which are perhaps a bit too butchered to really stand out as the excellent stories the originals gained a reputation for. I feel that the Classic Starts are rich enough that they easily match original versions of simpler tales like The Little House on the Prarie or Charlotte's Web.So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island. Then we're on to The Odyssey, Moby Dick and Tom Sawyer. Move over Pippi Longstockings and Amelia Bedelia! Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary, the Little House series, Milne's Pooh, and Horrible Harry, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.) The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible."},{"Title":"The jungle book","review":"Legends are made from legends.

Winans is an absolute delight. The three tributes to the late Bob Kaufman are fitting elegies to one of Americas most overlooked poets. (Although A.D. himself is also on that list of neglected poets.) A.D. is one of those poets that really gets down to the nitty gritty of the matter. He is a poet of the soil as opposed to a lot of poets who are floating on clouds of delusion and never actually saying anything. This collection, which is a tribute to his home city of San Francisco, is a tasty collection that stirs a desire to make another trip out to Frisco. The poems about North Beach and the Mission bring those areas to life. He has lived a lot of life on these streets and it comes out in his verse. A great poet poeticizing a great city.

He discovered that the art of oil painting 1) is relatively easy for a hobbyist to cultivate and 2) enriches the painter by giving him new eyes, letting him see even everyday things in a new way, and presents challenges to be studied carefully and then painted.He describes how he was unsure of the first stroke until a friend walked up, grabbed his brush, and slathered a large blob of paint on the blank canvas. That move freed him.Churchill writes that once you start painting, things like the light on water in different temperatures, the changing cloud strata, and the hidden tones in rocks can preoccupy you for hours as you try to get exactly the right variations of pigment and brush stroke.He concludes as he began, by commenting how refreshing this hobby is, and he recommends oil as the most forgiving medium for beginners. It really is a surprising discovery of a little book for anyone interested in personal development.As Churchill writes, \\"Whether you feel that your soul is pleased by the conception of contemplation of harmonies, or that your mind is stimulated by the aspect of magnificent problems, or whether you are content to find fun in trying to observe and depict the jolly things you see, the vistas of possibility are limited only by the shortness of life. Every day you may make progress. Every step may be fruitful. Yet there will stretch out before you an ever-lengthening, ever-ascending, ever improving path. You know you will never get to the end of the journey. But this, so far from discouraging, only adds to the joy and glory of the climb.\\""},{"Title":"Painting as a Pastime","review":"Written by Churchill himself, this book gives the reader a view through the writer's eyes the reason he chose painting and of the paintings themselves. A rather short book, 32 pages of text and 16 pages of art, is quite informative in the life of Churchill and his view of life around him."},{"Title":"Painting as a Pastime","review":"I thought this was a delightful essay by Churchill that even those who do not like him will enjoy.And, if you like painting and paintings, you will find this layman's views interesting and entertaing.A GREAT read!"},{"Title":"Painting as a Pastime","review":"I have had this book in my collection for quite a number of years now and give it a periodic read. It is a very short book; a small essay really, of only 32 pages. It can be, if the reader so desires, read in a very short time. Let me say right now though that this is not the sort of work that you want to rip through. No, it is a book that is best read in a slow and contemplative manner with each sentence; indeed, each word and word combination read and savored and then reread again and again.My reasons for delighting in this work and reading it many times are rather personal. I love art and I love painting. I am not good at it, am not very skilled despite years of work, and all of my paintings are stashed in various closets and cubby holes around the house. This does not matter though. Secondly, I am of the strong and personal opinion that Sir Winston S. Churchill, whose talents in so many areas are legendary, is one of the true masters of the English Language. More about this later.This little essay is about so much more than painting as a pastime though. In the 32 pages that Churchill had to work with, he not only addresses his primary subject, but also that of reading, art appreciation, travel, the French, and adds in scads of good advice as to how to be a happier and more productive person.Hidden in this little gem, the author discusses read and makes some surprising remarks such as that it his belief that young men and women should not read all that many good books when they are young, but rather wait until they have more experience in life and have lived a bit.Churchill advises that a man, or woman, should have at least three hobbies they participate in, each having absolutely nothing to do with what they do to earn their bread.Of course the main thrust and focus in on painting; oil painting to be precise. I find his attitude and advice to be absolutely inspirational. I dare say that anyone reading this work will want to run out and purchase a set of oils and begin at once. I know that each time I get discouraged about my personal work, a reading of this little book puts be back on track almost instantly...it cures painter's block!The book includes 18 color reproductions of some of Churchill's paintings which are rather delightful. I must say that among his many, many other accomplishments that he was not half bad as an amateur painter! But that being said, he was not good to the point that you would not feel deep in your heart that \\"hey, I do better work than that!\\" I like that.Do yourself a favor and find a copy of this one...you will not be sorry.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Painting as a Pastime","review":"Written by Sir Winston Churchill after leaving government service. This small book is his answer to retirement. The book is a mixture of text and color plates showing a collection of Churchill's paintings."},{"Title":"Painting as a Pastime","review":"This is an enlightening, instructive and enchanting read. More an essay than a book, at 33 pages it is quickly devoured and can be revisited countless times to uncover more layers of meaning and charm. In a simple but profound way, Winston Churchill has left us an empowering legacy, encouraging everyone, painter or not, to view the world and its wonders in a deeper way. It is interesting to reflect on what painting meant for Churchill at the time he wrote this classic. Originally published in a collection of articles in the early 1930s, Painting as a Pastime would have been written at the lowest ebb of Churchill's long life. Great, but not yet truly great, Churchill in the 1930s was a political outcast, at odds with the establishment and most of the British nation which he was to return to lead so courageously and memorably within a decade. Painting then must have been a huge solace for his battered ego. That and writing were probably what truly sustained him.Churchill was an acknowledged master of the English language by this time, and could not have written more elegantly than in this short volume. It is a true delight to read. He can be a little pompous such as when he extols the delights of reading in another language although history records his French spoken loudly and enthusiastically was actually pretty poor. And given his struggles at school, he could hardly have claimed mastery of any other language he may have been exposed to in the classroom. The reader is more than willing to forgive the odd flash of arrogance because along with this he reveals another softer, more spiritual side of his personality. For that alone it is well worth the read."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],E={key:0},D={key:1};function j(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(m,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",E,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const L=u(S,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-04d1569d"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/1.md","filePath":"drive/1.md"}'),q={name:"drive/1.md"},P=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{W as __pageData,P as default};
