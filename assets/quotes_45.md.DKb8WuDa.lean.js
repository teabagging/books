They are expressions of emotion that allow Tita to &quot;create&quot;. The passionate and magical foods she makes is one of the freedoms she is allowed by her mother. They are also applied as a historical tool. The memories and stories are passed from generation to generation through the recipes. I realize the story offers much more than recipes but I want to know you will feel the power, magic and art of cooking through this novel"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This story captured my imagination from the first chapter with its detail of costume, country and delectable food. Descriptions of recipes,eating and cooking whetted my appetite for more than just dessert. I could feel the heat from the intenseness of the Mexican sun as well as experiencing the hatred for her mother who would never allow her a life of her own. This book comes to mind @ the top of my list when ever anyone asks me to recommend a book"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This novel has an interesting flavor and perspective, being translated from the Mexicanbestseller. The blending of recipes at the beginning of each chapter, and the plotdevelopments relating to those recipes reflect the tight integration of cuisine into theshowcased family's life. Also captivating is Esquivel's seamless blending of realistic insight intoher protagonist's thoughts with segues into moments of outright fantasy at the high point ofthe novel. The novel is beautifully written with a wonderful atmosphere. The story ofunrequited love tugs a bit at your heartstrings, but didn't pull me over the top, maybe becauseI personally couldn't relate as much to the decisions made by the characters. The story workson many other levels besides the romance aspect, however, and should offer a goodsoft-hearted read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"\\"Like water for chocolate\\" is not a voluminous novel, but it is memorable. Laura Esquivel managed to connect the magical realism (in an easy form, I admit, but nevertheless very reminiscent of Marquez, Allende or Llosa) with the style of tasty books by Peter Mayle (Provencal series) or Lily Prior (\\"La Cucina\\" - a class worse than \\"Like water for chocolate\\").The story of Tita, the youngest of the three daughters and therefore committed to the traditional Mexican fate of the spinster caring for her mother until the mother dies, is told in chapters, each of which starts with a recipe. Tita is fascinated by cooking and spends most of her time in the kitchen, and her culinary excellence causes Pedro to fall in love with her. The love is doomed, however, because of Tita's mother, who wants to execute her traditional right. The lives of all the sisters are depicted, their fates interchanging and seemingly improbable, but interwoven with Mexican history and elements of magic. This novel takes the reader and it is impossible to get out of its grip before it ends... And the exotic recipes, full of tasty ingredients and causing unexpected events - are, in addition, delicious."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Overall, I think my expectations were a bit too high for this book and it didn't quite measure up. That being said, I still really enjoyed it and some parts I downright adored! I loved the fact that Tita's emotions came through in her cooking and manifested in those who ate her food (reminds me a bit of Garden Spells). However, some of the mystical elements were a bit too out there for me. The term \\"magical realism\\" is too tame for this novel - it is better described as more of a family myth.Tita was an emotional and endearing protagonist so you can't help but cheer for throughout the book. She, Nacha and John are very loveable characters (although I happen to quite like the fiery Gertrudis as well); whereas, Rosaura and Mami are quite horrific villains. I'm sure that the reader is supposed to like Pedro as well, but I just didn't care for him at all. He seemed short-sighted, egocentric, and at times a bit bratty (I have no idea what Tita saw in him).While I loved some of these characters...none of them were quite three-dimensional for me. So, if you are strictly a character-driven reader, this book is probably not for you. Recommended to fans of foodie fiction and to those who like magical elements in their reading."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I devoured Laura Esquirel's novel Like Water for Chocolate--a love song to food. Mouth watering and spell binding, this novel worked it's magic on me and I just could not put it down.Tita is the youngest daughter and according to tradition, must stay with and care for her abusive mother. Fighting against her fate, Tita falls madly in love with Pedro. She will spend her life yearning for this futile relationship.The reader gets to know Tita in the kitchen. The smells, tastes, and textures of food are her world. With a touch of mysticism, unknown even to herself, Tita infuses the foods she creates with her strong emotions and infects those who eat of her food with overwhelming feelings.A lovely and quirky novel about the power of love, Esquirel introduces the reader to compelling characters who fight against the odds to determine their own destinies. This sensuous novel was simply entrancing."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I just read \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" for twelfth grade English. I think that the author's writing style is very beautiful and descriptive but I really did not like how flat and undeveloped the characters are. All the characters are either described as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" with no deeper characterization. The author doesn't really give the characters any real personalities or describe what they are thinking. But Tita's and Pedro's \\"love\\" was really what made me dislike this novel. I kept asking myself why Tita and Pedro were in love. The author describes the strong physical/chemical attraction they felt for one another but she never had them have an actual conversation in the entire book. They just long for one another, make-out, and have sex without ever having talked to one another? How can I care about Tita's and Pedro's love when their relationship is so black and white. Plus, Pedro and Tita are described as the victims of her mother's cruelty (preventing them from getting married) and as the \\"good guys\\" but they're actually pretty awful characters. They never seemed to care who their love hurt (e.g. Tita's sister - who should not have married Tita's love but did she really deserved to get married to a man who didn't even want to touch her, had a baby who didn't recognize her as his mom, have the baby die, and then die a slow and painful death from an embarrassing disease?) which doesn't make their love so pure in my book. All and all would have been a great novel if the characters weren't so one-dimensional."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like many close families, the De La Garza family does a lot of things by tradition. In this family, Mama Elena is the head of the family. In this family, it is a tradition that the youngest daughter, who is Tita (the main character), is to stay unmarried in order to take care of her mother until the day she, Mama Elena dies. This causes Tita to not be able to be with the man that she loves, Pedro. But instead, Mama Elena tells Pedro that the closest that he will get to being with Tita, is marrying Tita's sister Rosaura. So Pedro and Rosaura get married. In this book, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, Tita was born in a kitchen and actually has a weird connection to cooking. Tita cooks a lot, and however she feels when she is cooking rubs off on whoever eats her food. When Rosaura was getting married to Pedro, Tita was very sad. While cooking the cake for their wedding, Tita starts to cry and some of her tears fall into the cake. Everyone who ate the cake began to mourn immediately.

May 17, 2001Not long ago my English class and I read a very interesting book full of magical realism and characters which came alive in every chapter. This book was writing by Laura Esquivel a great Mexican author. The title of the book is Like Water for Chocolate. This book was translated from Spanish to English. It&#8217;s Spanish title is Aqua para Chocolate. When reading this book it kept me and the class interested at all times, we would comment to our teacher Mrs. Lenhard that this book wasn&#8217;t like any other book we had read before. Every in class including I would make comments about the characters, the magical realism used and the situation. My favorite character was Geltrudis. She was my favorite character Because she loved Tita and she had a strong demanding character like her mother. Geltrudis shroud this by becoming general in the war and running away with a soldier. Tita the main character of the book seems to have great bad luck that seems it&#8217;s never going away and what makes her keep going is the love she gives and receives from Pedro. Predo got married to Tita&#8217;s older sister Rosaura just to be close to Tita which her mom didn&#8217;t allow her to marry since she was the youngest and was suppose to take care of her mother till she dies. It&#8217;s tradition. I recommend this book to anyone that likes Magical realimc. If your life is tragical end is miserable but you have love you would survive. This book is a wonder full book to read and share with someone else. If you love cooking or food in this book recipes are given and you can even prepare them yourself.

It gives a person background information on the Mexican traditions and helpful love and romance tips. I believe this book has helped me accomplish love interests more freely and easily. I have suggested this book to my school library and to my friends. I started reading this book to my guy friends and even they wanted to read it. I could not say anything bad about this book. There are some things I disagree with, but it only makes the book better. What makes me like this book so much is the fact that Tita reminds me of me in a weird way.

Each chapter starts with a recipe and the meals' instructions while working in the story of Tita. Tita is the youngest of three sisters and by tradition bound to never marry, but to care for her mother into old age. She grows up in the kitchen where she develops a magical relationship with the food she prepares. Whatever emotion Tita is experiencing while preparing the meals transfers to anyone who consumes them. This produces interesting results when she is forced to prepare the dishes for her eldest sister's wedding, who by luck of her birth order is to marry Tita's true love.This is a short, easy to read, mystical romance told by Tita's grand niece who continues the tradition of her cooking. The entire novel is told as if you were a guest in the kitchen listening to a story as a meal is being prepared. This novel was also made into a popular movie.

The author expresses greatly how a tradition kept two people apart however, in the end the tradition was destroyed.The absurd Mexican tradition says youngest daughter cannot marry but instead she will have to stay home and take care of her mother until death. Mama Elena's cruel and strict mother did not exclude her daughter Tita from his tradition. However, Tita and Pedro express their love to each other in most unusual way.

I think that Laura Esquivel did a great job when writting this book because she uses a lot of symbolism and a mixture of fantasy. Laura uses many things in Mexican tradition to put this book together. For example, the author reviews this story with two lovers that couldint be together because of their family tradition. When this couple is trying to communicate the girl in this case uses recipes to express her love to the love of her life. Their love increased throughout the book. But in order for you to find out if this couple has the opportunity to love each other freely without the family tradition coming between them then you would have to read this book, also you will enjoy the delicious recipies.

Is when Pedro gave Tita roses that were pink and Mama Elena told Tita to throw the roses away, something or some one told Tita told her to put it on to her recipe so Tita press the roses to her breast and blood came out because she pocket her self and the roses torn red because of blood, Tita put her roses torn red because of the blood, Tita put her roses in her recipe that was Quail in Rose Petal Sauce when Tita finish cooking, she surfs the food when every body finish eating their meal they felt sad, because Tita's love for Pedro when with the roses.Another reason why is when Gertrudis was taking a shower with cold water and her nephew would pop up and hit will come out of her body and the water will start to get hot and the little house she was taking a shower cot on fire because of the love she was taking out for the Guererroor soldier.I think that this book or story is about Laura Esquivel life or this story is relate to her life story, so I rate this book giving it 5 stars and it is a good book I recommend this book to every body. ..."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate was a very interesting book. The main character in the book, Tita, always had some sort of drama in her life. There was always drama within her family. It either had to do with her mother, her sister, or her brother in law. The drama within their lives is what kept me wanting to read on. Tita also struggled with her love life. She wanted someone that she couldn't be with because her mother didn't approve of the relationship. Her mother's disapproval only made her want to be with him even more. I thought that the mother was one of the meanest mother's ever. She treated Tita as if she was not even her daughter. Just another maid or something. I don't even think that Tita liked her mother because of the cruel things she would say. Tita's other sister, Gertrudis also disliked Mama Elena. She disliked her enough to run away with a man. A man that she didn't even know. A complete stranger that came on horseback and just took her away. This book was one of the best books I've read in a while. The structure of the book was easy to understand and the chapters were broken down into months. The time span of the book was within a couple of years so you didn't really have to remember many things to really understand it. The story line was understandable and I wouldn't change anything in the book. Everything in the book seems to fit. There were some sad moments in this book, but all in all it was very good. I strongly recommend you read this book, especially if you like reading romantic stories. This was one book that I really enjoyed and I hope that you enjoy it too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Hands down one of my all-time favorite books....but skip the movie, it's rather lame. I've never read any of the author's other books, but I find the imagery in this one to be spectacular. It's rare that you find a book where it is obvious that so much labor and love was put into it's crafting. The end result - sheer brilliance. If only all books could be as wonderful as this one. The characters are beautifully developed, the writing is on top of its game and the style is perfecto. I only wish that every book I picked up was as a great a read as this one. It was sad for me to reach the end of something so enjoyable to read. This should be on everyone's must read list."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"\`Like Water For Chocolate' is a story that will literally fill all your senses to overflowing, Espquirel's writing is so lyrical and animated that you can smell the sizzling sausages on the grill and taste Tita's pain as she watches life pass her by. It is a story of unquenched appetites and unrequited love, with over-the-top fantasy and a dash of mysticism.This is the story of the De La Garza family; Mama Elena and her daughters, Rosaura, Gertrudis, and Tita. Being the youngest daughter, it is Tita's lot in life to remain unmarried and care for her mother until the day she dies. Tita's father died two days after her birth, leaving Mama Elena alone to run the ranch.Tita was raised in the kitchen by the family cook, Nacha, and developed a relationship with food that left her being a superb cook, so she spends most of her time in the kitchens with Nacha.But as Tita matures, young Pedro Muzquiz falls hopelessly in love with her only to be denied her hand in marriage because she is the youngest and has a duty to Mama Elena. Mama instead offers Pedro Tita's sister Rosaura, so Pedro marries Rosaura just so he can remain near Tita.Tita's skills in the kitchen overflow into fantastical proportions; the wedding cake she bakes for her sister's wedding contained her tears as she prepared it, leaving everyone who eats it filled with a longing so poignant they become physically ill. And Tita's Quail In Rose Petal Sauce so potent with her desire for Pedro that it infects her sister Gertrudis, who runs off naked from the house to be swept up by a soldier on horseback and carried away.At the beginning of each chapter is a month in which the story takes place, and a recipe that Tita will prepare. This makes the tale both fun and intriguing, and leaves you wondering what kind of passion Tita will stir up next, and who it will be served to. You will be turning pages rapidly, waiting for the tale's conclusion, and wondering if Tita will ever escape the iron hand of Mama Elena and find an outlet for all of her pent up desires.This is an extremely well written book, a wonderful tale of unbridled passion, and appetites that go beyond the norm. Definitely worth full price. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate was a wonderful and exciting book about a young woman named Tita in love with a man she can not marry (Pedro).

It is written in the magical-realism genre but this particular book is more magical than realism. I wouldn't say that I disliked this book but at the same time I didn't really like it either. If you enjoy magical-realism then you should probably try reading this book. It is an easy read and has a fairly good plot but if you aren't into this genre then I would recommend finding another book to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I am Diana from Walla Walla High School and I read Like Water for Chocolate in my senior english class as part of our literature circles. Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in the family. Tita struggles to pursue true love and claim her independence. Tita's love, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to ask for Tita's hand in marriage. Since Tita is the youngest daughter she is forbidden by tradition and her mother, Mama Elena, to marry anyone. Pedro marries Tita's oldest sister, Rosaura to be close to Tita.This is a wonderful story that I enjoyed very much. I enjoyed the way Laura Esquivel put conflicts between Tita and her mother because it really shows the way the Hispanic culture is when it comes to marriage in a family that has a strong tradition.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read books of love and desire."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I first found out about &quot; Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, while chanel surfing and I came across an interesting- looking film. After seeing it, the story stuck in my head for a whole week until I decided to sign out the book from the library. After I started reading I just couldn't stop! The plot was so absurd I just needed to find out what happened next! Some people find that the recipes and supernatural events were annoying, but they just made the story more complete! You can't help but connect with the characters, they're all so interesting and each one plays an important role in the story.

It's a classic."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"A Love StoryI have read this book for my World Literature class and I liked it . The book that I read was Like Water For Chocolate. I like this novel because of the format and how Laura Esquivel expresses herself through magical realism. It gives the reader a sense of imagination and creativity. This book interested me a lot that I had to finish it on my own. That is something that I never do. The best part is the cooking recipes because I like to cook. My favorite recipe was the stuffed peppers because that is my favorite dish. When I finished reading that book I couldn't resist to see the movie. At first I thought that the myth of being the only child was not true and now that I read this book it showed me that it is true. I couldn't imagine the sadness of the girl when she wanted to get married and her mother wouldn't let her. It sounds kind of sad and maybe any girl that had to go through that felt traumatized. In my opinion any girl that wants to get married should get married without anybody saying anything to them. The book had a good, interesting plot and it made it fun for me to read. I hope they do the second part to this book. The last words that the narrator said were, \\"She will stay alive as long as her recipes are being cooked.\\" This left me with a thought of my grandmother and her recipes. She would like someone to keep her recipes alive. I recommend people to read this book and after you do you'll find yourself recommending it to others. I know that I will recommend this book to somebody that I love and will understand the feeling that I had for this story."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a novel.

Pedro should be a special person. Because Tita is beautiful girl, she is smart, she like working, especially cooking. What is special for him? why the smart girl loves the coward man so much?

Laura Esquivel has outdone herself with this mouth-watering, heart-wrenching novel of forbidden love and its power over all. Don't read this piece on an empty stomach or with an empty bed, else you'll be frustrated with the passionate cravings her words induce. Since she was married to the director of the movie under the same title, it follows the story line almost to the letter. Highly suggest reading and watching both, in English AND Spanish."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Well, I read it because it was required by ESL advanced reading teacher.

I will remember this book not only because it is my first English novel, but also my reading teacher, she is so beautiful, feminine and womanly, I was attracted by her. :)"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I first became aware of Like Water for Chocolate when the movie became a selection on my cable company's free movie menu. The description of the movie seemed interesting and I watched it, even though it was Spanish with English subtitles.Like Water for Chocolate takes place on a large ranch during the Mexican Revolution (think Pancho Villa) and concerns the life of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter of the clan. Due to the shock of hearing that her husband has died, Mama Elena (the matriarch of the De La Garza family) gives birth to Tita prematurely. However, Mama Elena is unable to breastfeed Tita and so she falls under the care of Nacha, the ranch cook, who nourishes her with teas and broths in lieu of milk, and teaches her the lessons of life in a way only the kitchen can.The fact that Mama Elena is unable to care for her daughter is ironic in that as the youngest daughter, Tita is bound by family tradition to never marry or have children in order for her to take care of her mother until the day Mama Elena dies. Mama Elena firmly believes in her family's traditions and takes a special delight in ensuring that both recipes and the rules of proper society are followed to the letter. She rules her family with an iron fist and frequently abuses her disobedient daughter both verbally and physically.When Pedro comes to ask for Tita's hand in marriage, Mama Elena refuses citing the harsh family tradition. In order to remain close to Tita, Pedro decides to marry Tita's older sister Rosaura instead. Forbidden from being near the man that she loves, Tita expresses her desires and pleases him in the only way that she can...through her recipes.The story takes on an almost surreal quality as Tita's thoughts and emotions while preparing meals seem to imbue the food with magic that has a profound effect on the hearts and minds of those who consume her dishes. In one instance, Tita is forced to prepare all the food for her sister's wedding banquet. Mama Elena tells her that she must do this and show no emotion,\\" not one tear.\\" However the wise and sympathetic Nacha allows her to cry, knowing that Tita must release her pain over her lost love. Unfortunately, Tita's tears fall into the cake batter and when the guests take their first bite of the cake they become overwhelmed by the memories and heartaches of their own lost loves. In addition, they also become violently ill leading Mama Elena to believe that Tita put an emetic in the cake to purposefully make everyone sick out of spite. Mama Elena beats Tita so badly that she has to stay in bed for a week to recover.In another incidence, Pedro gives Tita a bouquet of roses the petals of which she uses to make a sauce for roasted quail. Tita's passion and desire for Pedro pours into the sauce and when it is consumed by her eldest sister Gertrudis she becomes enflamed with passion. So much so that when she attempts to cool her passions in the outdoor shower the water evaporates before it touches her skin, and the wooden shower itself burst into flames. Ultimately, Gertrudis runs naked from the shower and is swept away by a revolutionary drawn by the powerful scent of roses emanating from her.Throughout the story Mama Elena does everything that she can to keep Tita and Pedro apart. Similar to her own birth, Tita becomes the primary caregiver for her sister's son, Roberto, after her sister is unable to care for him to due to a difficult birth and Rosaura's inability to breastfeed. Sensing that Roberto is drawing Pedro and Tita closer, Mama Elena sends Pedro, Rosaura and Roberto away to live with distant relatives. Unfortunately, Roberto dies and Tita blames Mama Elena.Tita becomes even more rebellious and locks herself away in the dovecote and refuses to come down or even speak. Mama Elena, believing her daughter has gone insane, arranges for a doctor to come to the ranch and take Tita to a mental hospital. The doctor, John Brown, takes Tita to his own home instead where he allows Tita to heal in her own time and in her own way. During her recovery, Tita is visited by the spirit of Dr. Brown's grandmother, Kikapu, a wise Indian herbalist, who offers her a delicious tea and establishes non-verbal communication with her. It is here that Tita gets her first taste of freedom and finally gets the opportunity to decide for herself what she wants to do with her own life.Dr. Brown falls in love with Tita and then she must decide if she loves him enough to marry him, if her heart still belongs to Pedro, or if her destiny is to deny herself love all together in order to take care of her mother. Along the way the spirit of both Nacha and Kikapu is there to guide and support her.As the title states, Like Water for Chocolate includes recipes, romances, and remedies. Each chapter begins with a recipe as Tita expertly prepares the dish in question. Some of the recipes explore the traditions behind the meals. In addition, the healing power of soups, teas, and even barks are discussed and even a little bit of science and medicine is included. At only 256 pages, Like Water for Chocolate is a quick read and can be completed in only a few hours, however it is a story that stays with you long after the last page is read, the book is closed, and returned to the shelf."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Part fractured fairy tale, part sensuous love story.

Every Spanish instructor I had would show this movie to the class at one point in the semester. When I heard the squeaky cartwheels of the TV / VCR cart come rolling down the hallway, I would groan, \\"No! Not 'Like Water for Chocolate'...AGAIN!\\"However, this story eventually became one of my very favorites. Laura Esquivel describes her characters by weaving symbolism and imagery with down to earth realities of revolutionary Mexico and the staunchly imposed rules of a traditional upper-class Mexican family. This is a passionate tale. However, unlike your average romance novel, there are no cookie-cutter love scenes, perfect heroines or predictable male love interests. This book is uniquely written in a style and voice that I have never come across before.It did not matter to me if some of the details seemed \\"unrealistic\\". When the heroine, Tita stays up at night thinking about her forbidden love for Pedro, she crochets a blanket which becomes at least a mile long. The length of the blanket is not as important as how Tita felt while making it. Such details describe not only Tita, but also all of the people in this book. By the end of this novel, you are left with the feeling that you knew each and every one of the characters."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"My mother loves this book.

It is a novel that appeals to all of the five human senses, which makes you want to read the story from beginning to end without putting it down.The author, Laura Esquivel, now lives in Mexico. She was originally a screenwriter. Her screenplay &quot;Chido One&quot; is the film version of &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; which is also very excellent. In 1994, this book won the prestigious ABBY award, which is given by the American Booksellers Association to the book the members of the association enjoyed the most.What makes this book great is that you not only get to read an exciting story, but you also learn how to cook. At the beginning of every chapter there is a new recipe to be made. All of the ingredients are listed and the preparation is given along with the story. Since this book is written in monthly installments, there are exactly twelve recipes; one for each month.This book is filled with magical realism. Almost everything in the story is symbolic and full of emotion, especially the food. My mother always told me that, &quot;the food comes out better when you're happy.&quot; &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; portrays this saying, but with so much more. Not only happiness, but anger, love, passion, lust, and depression goes into the food, which cause the people who eat it to do some crazy things.Like I said before, this book appeals to all of the five senses. Everything is told in such detail that you can easily imagine yourself being in the story. You can imagine yourself being there with the characters, seeing what they see, hearing what they hear, feeling what they feel, smelling what they smell, and tasting every piece of food that they eat.

Gregor is human. He is enslaved he is suffering we understand that. Esquivel crafts tita as too cocky to admit her humanity. Esquivel fails in communicating her story to me because i am not anything completely and neither is anyone else.

Esquivel reminds me of the principal in the breakfast clubGODDAMNIT DONT MAKE ME QUOTE THE BREAKFAST CLUB!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This is possibly the worst novel I have ever read. Laura Esquivel engages in shameless egotism via the character of Tita. No other character has any depth. They are simply supporting cast for the Woes of Tita: Mama Elena beats Tita and won't allow her to marry the man who loves her. Tita is then forced to cook for her sister's wedding to the same man. Tita loses her marbles and ends up in a barn attic naked and covered in bird droppings. She is rescued by Dr John Brown who is supposed to take her to the looney bin but instead takes her to his home where she sees the ghost of his Kickapoo grandmother, \\"Morning Light.\\" John Brown is a stereotype for the sensitive American male. Morning Light is a racist stereotype of Native American earth-momma medicine women. Mama Elena is just recycled cheap bio junk a la Mommy, Dearest. The only point of this novel seems to have been for a spoiled, selfish, middle aged woman to indulge herself in juvenile fantasies about self martyrdom. The worst part of it is that after pages of torturous reading, Tita doesn't get to experience the big O which she has foolishly waited more than twenty years to experience. A good \\"literary\\" dinner party with guests from the ages would have Laura Esquivel seated between Georges Bataille and the Marquis de Sade, where at the end Vladimir Nabovok slaps her after drinking too much.If you like good writing avoid this novel at all costs.

I thought it was THAT bad. The characters are weakly developed-- they show little depth and intelligence. It's also poorly written or translated. It's emotional and gushy-- would be OK with the balance of depth and intelligence, but that is lacking. If you want good writing try Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude. LWFC is possibly a good children's book? Possibly teenagers might find value in it. but I wouldn't want my kids acting like the characters. It seems like a book for crazy women. I think Danielle Steele can write better than this. If romance is your thing try Wuthering Heights or Madame Bovary. I even liked Bridges of Madison County, but this book is awful aand doesn't even deserve one star."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Let me sum it up for you: the novel is terrible. It is not a well-written novel by any means. The recipes are superfluous. There are recipes in the beginning of each chapter, and although I believe this could have been pulled off, the author does not do a good job of making anything interesting. Instead of melting the recipes into the story, the author forces them in - not only in the beginning of each chapter, but also in the middle of the story.The story itself is tedious beyond belief. After reading this book, I found myself not caring for any of the characters. The characters are downright vapid, imbecilic, nonsensical, and plain ANNOYING. Albeit it was plain that Tita was in love with Pedro, I absolutely could not see why. Pedro was nothing but a lustful man lacking any morals or virtue. He married Tita's sister (Rosaura) to be near to Tita, fathered children with Rosaura, raped Tita, and became extremely jealous to a violent extent when Tita became engaged to a decent young man. Do these characters lack utter sense? They seem unable to think for themselves. The author describes the rape as \\"love.\\" This book does not give any mind to decency; instead, the author attempts to get away with everything just because Pedro and Tita \\"love\\" each other.Many impractical events also occur. Although I'm a great fan of fantasy, the events that occur have absolutely no meaning or relevance to the story. The events were quite plainly and simply dropped down without reason.I do not understand why this book has been praised so much. It's one of the worst novels I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book reads as though written by someone with a fifth grade education, at best. I found that the writing did not flow, made no sense at all, and placed all of the emphasis in the wrong places. Where there should have been ANY character development, there were uninteresting, tedious descriptions about food. The placement of &quot;magical&quot; events did not even fit in with the story. In all, this book was a waste of time and paper and if anything, it deserves 1 star because someone would have to try REALLY hard to make something that BAD!!!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The story proceeds to take all the happiness away from the main character and it gets worse and worse as you go deeper and deeper into the story. Her love interest says he loves her and marries her sister. But it doesn't stop him from getting the sister pregnant twice. Everyone seems to have a tragic ending love story that ends with death. It's not magical or fairy tale it's just bad and keeps getting worse for every character you hope might be happy."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book was recommended to me because I am a great fan of G.G. Marquez and I.Allende. They are both amazing authors whose styles are magical realism. When I started reading this book I really wanted to like it but I guess I couldn't help comparing it to Marquez's works and ended up really disappointed. It is more magic than realism. It is as appropriate to place this book in magical realism section as it is appropriate to place Dan Brown's books in history text books section.Overall I don't recommend this book to readers that are looking for the enjoyment that G.G. Marquez's books can provide. I don't mean to offend anyone who liked this book and I truly don't know if I would have liked this book had my expectations not been so high."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This is weird because I love magical realism and I totally ate up food-centered stories like Isak Dinesin's Babette's Feast and Italo Calvino's Under the Jaguar Sun. But some of the effects of the magical realism in this book are physically repulsive to the point where it turned me off not only the food but also the underlying story.Tita is forbidden by her mother from marrying her true love Pedro and her emotions come out in the foods she prepares. Her sister Rosaura (who their mother marries to Pedro) is the main recipient of Tita's emotions. Rosaura barfs uncontrollably after eating a wedding cake Tita prepared while crying over the loss of Pedro. Later on Rosaura ends up dying horribly by Tita's cooking.While Tita is unhappy because of her mother's cruelty and because she can't marry Pedro, Rosaura is miserable too, mainly due to Tita's cooking and the fact Pedro doesn't care for her (you get the feeling that he is physically repulsed by her). The effects of Tita's cooking on her are pretty repulsive. The one person you'd wish Tita would poison is her mother but she dies without Tita's help. Most everyone is miserable except for Getrudis, Tita's other sister, who runs off.Particularly unsatisfying was the way the author treated the marriage of Pedro and Rosaura. I felt like she handled it basically without handling it. The tricky question of how Pedro would handle their wedding night was magically solved by Rosaura getting sick. They did have sex and two children and lived some time alone away from the family but the author glossed over that. The book couldn't go into too much detail but that marriage was the prime source of Tita's unhappiness.I actually suspected that the author used the physical effects of Tita's cooking on Rosaura to make it clear to the reader that Rosaura never had a chance of taking Tita's lover but if so, that's a poor use of magical realism whose appeal is usually to show you new possibilities - not to repulse you. I haven't read much of Spanish magical realism though so that may be common. Its not a treatment that I particularly enjoy reading.Tita's conquest was short-lived; the consolation of breaking the family tradition that had kept Tita from marrying Pedro seemed too little too late especially considering the number of bodies that had to die to break it.Overall the effect was depressing and uninspiring."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Recipes begin each of the chapters in this utterly charming book that centers much of the time around life in the kitchen of a traditional Mexican family. Tita, the daughter who has been destined to remain single so she can continue caring for her aging parents, falls in love and must watch as her lover marries her sister, Rosaura. Tita pours her heart and her loving into cooking as the years go by, and with each new creation she reflects and embodies the frustrations of a generation of Mexican women whose options in life to find personal happiness are limited by gender-based traditions. The conclusion is incendiary, apocryphal, and somehow hopeful for the future."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"&quot;Like water for chocolate&quot; is an exciting, mystical, sensual and magical adventure formed by two people madly in love and devoted to each other through love, passion and romance. &quot;Like water for chocolate&quot; is the first novel written by a Mexican author Laura Esquivel who has since gone on and written other various novels such as &quot;House of spirits&quot; which maintains a focus on magical realism.

The message Laura Esquivel gives, is that nothing is more powerful than love. It keeps the reader interested because you always want to know what happens in the next month, and what recipe she makes. Again, her recipes are very important in this story. For instance, earlier in the story Pedro gives Tita some roses. Mama Elena told Tita she must get rid of them, but instead, she uses them in her recipe. She makes \\"Quail in Rose Petal Sauce,\\" Since the roses are given to Tita with love from Pedro, the family then eats the delicious bird and everyone begins to feel hot and they feel a strong feeling between all of them. Gertrudis (middle sister) even has an orgasm at the dinner table, and was so hot that she spontaneously combusts and catches on fire.

If you enjoy soap operas and twisted love triangles then this book is for you. It was a very good book that kept my interest the entire time. The author, Laura Esquivel, gives the book an interesting form structure. The book is written with twelve chapters and each month of the year is one chapter. However, the book lasts over several years of time. This is just one element of surprise that is thrown in throughout the entire book. It is an unpredictable love story that deals with the love and emotions that people experience, while also throwing in a mystical twist in a few places. Tita, the main character, finds love with another man, however, the family tradition forces her to try and abolish her love so that she can take care of her mother until death. Love is not an easy thing to stop for any of us and Tita realizes this even when the man of her dreams marries her sister. As she is forced to contain her feelings she inadvertently pours them into her cooking causing others to feel the same emotions, from sadness to the burning desire of lust. There are many of wild turns in this book and perhaps the wildest is the end but it is a great read and one that I would suggest to anyone who enjoys a sense of magical-realism."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"the De La Garza ranch is run by Mama Elena.

Unfortunately her situations gets worst. Tita falls in love with Pedro and she is doomed knowing that she can't marry him. Pedro Asked Mama Elena for Tita's hands in marriage and was denied but was offered the hands of Rosaura, Tita's older sister instead. Pedro willingly accepted this offer as way to get closer to his true love Tita. Tita De La Garza has always been an out going kid. She had a special talent and a love for food.

Unfortunately Tita gets trapped in a devastating situation where she must choose between a doctor who is madly in love with her and weather she should wait until the day she can marry Pedro. Her choice is revealed at the end of the story. This book is very interesting to me not only because of the story it self but how the book was written. Cooking recipes are metaphorically woven on every introduction paragraph of each chapter and directions for cooking were clearly stated. I also enjoyed the writing of Laura Equivel and how she expresses her tone in a melodramatic and yet earthy tone bringing the reader back in past of the characters. Not only did I learn good cooking instructions but I also learned some Mexican Traditions.

Laura Esquivel has managed to grab my emotions and taste buds (with a recipe at the begging of each chapter), throughout the whole story. This magical story of love is set in the early 19th century in Mexico, during the revolution. It tells the story of how the De La Garza family live, but particularly focuses on Tita De La Garza. Tita is the youngest of three daughters, and because of this, she is destined to live her mothers cruel family tradition- to care for her mother until she dies. The tradition forbids Tita of love and marriage, which is the only thing holding her back when she falls in love with a young man called Pedro. Tita and Pedro fall in love, but when he asks her mother for Tita's hand in marriage, Mama Elena fiercely rejects advising Pedro to marry her older daughter- Rosaura. As this is the only way Pedro is able to get close to Tita, he marries Rosaura not for love but in desperation. Tita was not raised by her mother, but in the kitchen with the servants. With this upbringing Tita develops a great talent in cooking. Tita cooked all the meals in the house, which keeps her sane throughout her Mothers harsh treatment. Food becomes Tita's way of expressing her emotions, including her forbidden love for Pedro. The story turns magical through Tita's cooking. Whatever emotion she is feeling when she is cooking a meal leads people who were eating the meal to experience her emotions, whether it is love, anger, or pain as she longs for Pedro's love. Tita and Pedro have to circle each other in their passion while living under the same roof. Mama Elena does everything in her power to keep them as far apart as possible, leaving Tita defeated and lonely. Finally Tita's emotions and frustration lead her to standing up to her Mother, turning their lives up-side-down. Tita leaves the ranch and soon becomes engaged to the local doctor, John. An unforeseen tragedy brings Tita back to the family home, reuniting her with Pedro and Rosaura, who she will never forgive for marrying the love of her life. The story goes on from here resulting in further tragedy, bad luck and true love. LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE teaches the rules of true love and the extreme one will go to follow their heart to have it.

It is a story about recipes, romances, and home remedies. Each time that a new chapter started there is a recipe or a home remedy. There is also the explanation of how to cook it. The story talks about the Mexican history that belongs to a young woman who gets in love, but couldn't get married because of her family tradition. The tradition was that the youngest daughter couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. So the time was going on, and the boy that she loved got married with her sister and had a baby, but still she was seeing him because they were living on the same house. There, he told her that he loved her, but that he got married with her sister to be near her. There were also sometimes when she had to take care of the baby. She loved him because he was the son from the men she loved. So when he died, she almost went crazy. Affortunatelly, there was a doctor who loved her, and helped her on everything he could. They were knowing each other and he asked her to marry him. She accepted him, but when he was traveling, she had sex with her sister's husband. There she thought that she was pregnant, but in reality it wasn't true. I think that it is very sad and difficult to be living with the boy that you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommended this book to people who like to read romantic histories and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I recently read this book Like Water for Chocolate for my World Literature class and right off the bat remembered that I read it before. Like Water for Chocolate is a high school level book and that was about the time I initially read it. At first I did not find it interesting but it soon captured my attention. I enjoyed this novel about love, sex, war, and romance. It is a Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one. The story is of the Mexican history of a young woman who was in love, but couldn't get married because of the family tradition. There are 12 chapters and each time that a new chapter started, with a recipe, the explanation of how to cook it and the experience of the family. The youngest daughter, named Tita, couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. Tita was in love but the time was going on and the boy that she loved got married to her sister and stayed near because they were living in the same house. Her sister had a baby but sometimes Tita had to take care of the baby. She loved the baby because he was the son from the man that she loved. The changes that happened in the life of the people in this family make a very interesting story. It is enjoyable reading to see what happens with each sister . I think that it is very difficult to be living with the men you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic history and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love. The ending has a surprise that may not please the reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This novel encompasses all aspects that were rare in American Literature at the time. Fantasy, romanticism, and exaggeration are all incorporated into the novel to attract diverse readers. The novel may seem a little bizarre at first due to the embellisments but it is made clear early on that they are vital to the story as a whole. It's through these embellisments that the true emotions of the characters are revealed. The novel is an allegory for it is based on two different levels. The deeper level of the novel is a little harder to understand for it is hidden by all sorts of meaningless details. However, once that barrier is broken down, and all the symbolism is understood, the book is very enjoyable. We personally admired the extent of development of Tita's character. Her strength and courage to stand up to Mama Elena has inspired us to stand up for what we believe in as well. This novel requires a second reading to assure that all hidden meanings are discovered. If you're looking for a light summer reading book, this is definitely not the book for you. However, if you enjoy a book which entails some sort of thought process, this is the perfect book for you. As a bonus you will receive some delicious recipes!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"For my english class this year we had to pick a book to read with a group of people.

Magical realism is the combination of the real with the magical, or putting a magical twist on otherwise ordinary events. While this may appeal to some enthusiastic readers, it only served to confuse me and ruin what I thought were perfectly enjoyable scenes. The book would be moving right along, completely normal, when all of a sudden something impossibly outlandish would occur. Even though I did not appreciate these exaggerations, the main idea of the story was appealing. The very end did somewhat disappoint me, though I will not reveal what occurs. If magical realism appeals to you, then I encourage you to try this book. Unfortunately, it just did not work for me."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I would recommend Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel because Laura has a great way of telling her story. This novel is filled with love, hate, remedies, and recipes. The story of two lovers, Pedro and Tita, are told on a monthly base with the story being told with a specific recipe. The recipe tells the story of the love Tita and Pedro share and still have for one another. The recipes also aggresses the anger that Tita has towards her mother, Mama Elena, who had the idea of Pedro marrying Rosaura, and her anger towards Pedro because he took the offer. You see Tita is required to follow the old Mexican tradition that the youngest daughter is to take care of her mother until the day she dies and is to not marry. Tita, being the youngest daughter, had to follow this tradition and is not able to marry Pedro. Pedro wanted to be closer to Tita so he took the offer and married Rosaura.Laura Esquivel has a unique way of writing. She brings out the best of her with the ideas and her sense of creativity. Her creativity makes you think twice about what you are reading about. She has this way of writing where you can see and picture exactly what she is trying to tell the readers. The recipes of love in the story personify the actions the characters make giving the novel a unique perception.Others should defiantly read Like Water for Chocolate because it gives us a different view on life and love itself. Love is a strong feeling that we all have at some point or another so reading this novel would really help those that don't really understand love and how strong it is. Nothing and no one in this world can break that connection that two people have."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"laura esquivel knows passion to its very bone. it is aphrodisiac in a sense because it pushes you to a whirlwind of flavors and the enchanment of the plant properties. you can almost taste the skin of a petal or smell the spices. and as the blood slowly walks down the stairs, you know you have truly known the pains of a broken heart.excellent! excellent! excellent! i miss it so much because there is not many whose talent for passion writing pushes up to wuthering heights!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; is a very enjoyable read, although there are some parts of the story that alienated me. The fantasy scenes were a bit too unbelievable, at least for my Yankee self, and parts of the story seemed a bit too contrived. Esquivel did a good job of keeping the reader interested in the story and incorporating the recipes into the plot for the most part but there was a little too much emphasis on food and people's relation to it. Reading this was a pleasant experience but nothing really astounding."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The receipts weren't my main interest in reading the book, and I found them nice to read, but difficult to put into practice. I've read better books of this kind (and I can't stop mentioning Isabel Allende's &quot;Afrodita&quot; which is a genuine art-piece) but it was a good read and full of optimism (after all!).

Laura Esquivel uses a literary technique unfamiliar to most average readers. She takes the reader on a mystical tour of imagination beyond the realm of ordinary literary fiction.

The story kept my interest, both novel and film versions, and is just about the perfect size for a book, roughly 250 pages. From a male perspective, I was a bit uninterested in the love tibulations and entangled complications between the two secret lovers. Just run off together! Overall, however, this a story that can be enjoyed by anybody, despite ... and cultural background. I recommend this as well as other novel of the Latin genre, by far, the most interesting literature in the world."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I read &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; for a book report in school and really liked it. It is about a mexican girl, named Tita, and her family who lived in Mexico. In the begining of the book Tita fell in love with a young man named Pedro. The only problem was Tita's mother did not want her to get married because the tradition back then in Mexico was the youngest daughter would never marry or have children,k but take care of their mother until she died. Tita didn't like this tradition and wanted to marry Pedro. In order to be close to Tita Pedro married her older sister Rosura. Tita didn't understand at first, but then Pedro explained it to her. Pedro has two children with Rosura and moves to Texas. This pluse her abusive mother drove Tita to insanity. Her mother sent her to live with Docter John who took care of her and made her better. They fell in love and wanted to live together forever. Although there was an acident at the farm and Tita returned with John to help her mother and friends. There she met up with Pedro again and had a problem of who she wanted to be with and love.Tita was a great cook and main cook of her familie's farm. she had learned from the woman who raised her when she was younge. Tita was a younge girl when the book started and probably around fourty when it ended. she lived in Mexico with her family. They were pretty well off and had no men in charge (her father died after she was born). The book never said when this book took place or exactly were.This book is a romance book. The author, Laura Esquivel did great writing this book. She described things very well and made the book interesting. I think this book would be good for adults and maybe teens to read. I think this because Laura describes nudity well.Over all I did like this book. I didn't think the discription of nudity was nice to read. Other than that I could not set the book down and read it in one day. it was great at the end wondering who Tita would choose so I suggest you get this book if you want to know who she chose and more that I left out."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Although far from being deep, this amusing little story is part tall-tale, part harlequin romance, part recipe book. There are 12 chapters, each one a &quot;monthly installment&quot; (the book's story does not follow the monthly pacing; it's written like a magazine serial), each month featuring a different Mexican recipe around which the whole chapter circulates. I found it to be an ingenius way to format a story, although it does arouse the appetite while reading! Be prepared to spend some time in the kitchen...The story itself centers on Tita, the youngest daughter doomed never to be allowed to marry, and on her many suitors, and the aphrodisiatic food she prepares.

Rosaura hated her sister for the simple fact that Pedro and Tita was embarrassing her with their closeness when Pedro got burned. Tita hated the traditions that was in her family because she felt it was not fare. The youngest child had to care for the mother until she died. That's not what she hated most, she hated that she could not marry because of this tradition. And the person she loved dearly was forced to marry her sister.

I couldn't put the book down during the beginning of the novel. I really liked the passion the main character, Tita, has for her cooking and even more important, for her lover Pedro. It was that unrequited love that reeled me in. I could not stand Mama Elena, Tita's mother, who wouldn't let her daughter do anything that she didn't approve of. I could relate Tita's feelings to how I feel towards my parents sometimes. Nacha, the old cook on the ranch where Tita lives with her mother and sisters is truly beautiful. She was my favorite character in the book.However, I started to get annoyed with the recipes in the middle of the story as it distracted from the flow of the reading. I eventually stopped reading them. I got discusted with Tita's ongoing love toward Pedro. I could sympathsize with her if no one else would love her, but Dr. John loved her and he was so much more nicer and caring to Tita than Pedro, and he wasn't married to Tita's sister. I hated how the book put so much fantasy into the story-it was totally unreal and that took away from the beauty of the love story. I also hated how the ending was-after all the people in her way die, she goes back to Pedro instead of marrying poor John where she could've been happier.

Yes, spending time glued to the floor of the kitchen while being subservient and situations changing in life not because you take a stand against them but because you have a nervous breakdown and are sent away is totally forward feminism. The book is based on absolute characters with rigid qualities set into place. The main character is a woman who thinks and speaks of nothing but love and cooking. Not to mention, all of these things are going on and people often forget how young she is (17) throughout the course of the novel. Her love is thus compounded in its childishness by that fact, not to mention the sacrifice this \\"strong woman\\" makes for a stifled young man who eventually takes advantage of her. Magic realism can be done right and it's done wrong in this book. It might make for a good visual in a movie but every scene (even the magical ones) were just painful to read. There's a point when the main character's sister, so overcome by lust and passion (oh passion's a word regurgitated over and over in this story, too!) that she has the power to drive a man to gallop on his horse over to her ranch, pick her up and proceed to have sex with her, on horseback, as they ride across a field. At that point, I realized I was reading a Mexican version of Twilight or a screenplay for a soap opera.My college lit. professor assigned this as the first book outside of our standard anthology and I am shocked that this is the kind of book she chose."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This a heart-wrenching and compelling novel in which we learn about the main character, Tita's life through chapters represented by the twelve months of the year.

Esquirel uses the recipes to express the inner thoughts and feelings of all the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this \\"easy-read\\" novel and would recommend it to anyone. Each relationship created in this novel touched me in a different way, Esquirel makes it easy to relate to at least one of the characters... it's hard not to hate Mama Elena! For example, she was the reason why Tita and Pedro had to suppress their inner love for one another, and clearly expressed her ideas to Tita telling her own daughter she thought she was a waste of life!

The first attractive man is Dr.John who always takes full responsibility for treating a patient. For example, when Mama Elena said: &quot;Doctor, won't it be too much trouble for you to come here twice a day until my daughter is out of danger?&quot;. Dr.John answered: &quot;Certainly not! First, it's my duty, and second it's a pleasure to visit your lovely home.&quot; (page 74). Another example is that Dr.John is a patient and lovely man when he cures for Tita; &quot;Tita would never be able to thank him enough. In a madhouse she might have become truly insane. But here, with John's warmth toward her in word and manner, she felt better each day.&quot; (page 108). The second attractive man is Juan, Gertrudis' husband. Juan has a talent for music; for instance, &quot;Juan impressed all the guest with the wonderful way he played the guitar, the harmonica, and the accordion.&quot; (page 179). He is also a courageous and good husband. After &quot;Gertrudis gave birth to a mulatto baby.

The setting to this novel is taken place in Mexico and sets off the beginning of a new chapter with a traditional recipe of their family. This book is about a twisted love story between Pedro, whom the man Tita is in love with, and her sister and mother. Pedro and his father arrive at Tita's house asking her mother for permission for her hand of marriage. Tita's mother refuses because it is traditonal that the youngest daughter stays home to take care of the mother until she dies. Tita's mother insists that he marries her older sister Rosaura. He accepts, but the only reason why he did this, was to get close with Tita. Pedro and Rosaura later have two children, with one dying. Tita's mother suspects something is going on between her and Pedro, and forces them to move out of state. Years later, Mama Elena is not doing so well and is dying slowly. Pedro and Rosaura come back to the ranch and Tita's love for Pedro just grows. When Tita was really having hard times and going through some emotional stages that she could not handle, the cook, NAcha, helped her out and made her stronger. Tita and Pedro often snuck around to see each other and spend time together. They would often go into that special room and make love.

Maybe it is the way it was done a long time ago, but I have never heard of someone marrying somone's sister to be closer to them. It may also be the fact that I am a guy but to me this book was just boring."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Jennifer Reynolds\\"Like Water for Chocolate\\"This story is interesting and great to read on spare time. It in some ways explained reality and other ways fantasy. It describes how sometimes family traditions, have a rebellious one who refuses to follow it. In \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", Tita is the rebellious one. The reason that she is rebellious because, she wants to marry her love and the tradition is that the youngest daughter never marries, but cares for her mother. Mama Elena does everything in her power to change Tita's rebellious attitude. Sometimes this power over Tita worked and other times it didn't work at all.This book describes how falling in lore can be blind and make you do crazy things. Gertriudis was in love with a rebel, well the leader of the rebels and she runs off with him. Just like Mama Elena did in the past, but came back shortly. After Tita knew how it felt to be in love, so she lied on Gertrudis's behalf. Gertrudis didn't return for a long time after.Tita and Pedro share a love like fire. There love is so powerful that it couldn't keep them from each other. Tita did everything she could to get near Pedro, as Pedro did towards her. They found themselves sneaking behind Tita's families back. They also found themselves locking lips and other such crazy things, behind Mama Elena and Rosaura. Their love grew and stayed, it never faded. John Brown's love for Tita kept him in competition with Pedro. John was no match for Pedro through. Pedro was Tita's first love and only real love.I feel that I can relate to this book in ways. I mostly relate to Tita. I snuck behind my family's back to date guys that I really liked. The reason being is my family Is really strict. We have no family tradition like Tita's, which is the difference between us. I have gone through a few similar experiences and I guess that's why I really enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The book Like Water for Chocolate has a style of fiction that I've never read before. The magical realism was interesting and fun to read because it was so far fetched and random. The book was an easy read because it lacked difficult structure and vocabulary. Like Water for Chocolate is the kind of book that you won't put down because the plot is so fast-paced and eventful. Although the magical realism was new and somewhat intriguing, it wasn't my favorite genre, and overall, I didn't love the book. The entire story is based on the main character's emotions coming out through the food she prepares. One example of this is when Tita is crying while making the wedding cake and everyone who eats it gets sick. I'd recommend reading this book if you're interested in these kinds of strange occurrences where anything can and will happen. I only gave this book two stars because it was too unrealistic for my liking. Like Water for Chocolate is also very racy, so if you aren?t into that kind of sexual detail, this book's not for you."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I adored the movie and went out the very next day to find the book, hoping for a deeper perspective on the characters. I was disappointed and surprised to find that it was quite exactly like the screenplay. That makes the screenplay extraordinarily excellent, I suppose, rather than compromising the quality of the book, but if you've already seen the movie, I wouldn't hope for much more in the book. If you haven't seen the movie, by all means read the book: it's sexy, spirited, sensual and moving. *THEN,* for SURE go rent the movie.

It was very good book it was talking about family tradition, theme, or food about some people were life in Mexico before two handrad years. Also it talked about real love in that time it was so different then the love now .The hero was the author's great aunt. Her name was Tita De la garza. Her mother was Mama Elena. Tita was the youngest daughter. Her father died two days after she was born.The tradition in her family said the youngest daughter is supposed to take care of her mother until the day she died .Tita was in love with one man his name was Pedro, but Tita can not marry him that her family tradition said. Mama Elena said Pedro can marry Tita oldest sister. her name was Rosaura and they live with Tita at the same house ,that was too much for Tita .Tita cooked and cleaned for every body in the ranch. Her mother treated Tita so bad .After a few years Tita thought she loved anther man his name was Dr Brown, Dr Brown wanted to marry Tita. Before they celebrated their wedding Tita lose her virginity .then she knew the truth that she was not in love with him. Tita still loved Pedro and her mother died and her sister Rosaura too, so she had chance to marry her love after twenty two years.

I couldn't have imagined a more unsatisfactory ending."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I fell in love with this book. Try as I might, I couldn't put it down until the last page was read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate was a truly meaningful book expressing love as being mixed emotions and heartbreaking. It really brought my outlook of love to a higher aspect and I got to look at it much differently than I did before. It was unusual yet very interesting how the author mixed love, Mexican cooking and Mexican culture together to be able to look at life through the main character's, Tita De La Garza's, eyes. I also enjoyed how each chapter was its own little story that, in the end, told a huge story. Every chapter was unpredictable and that kept me tied to the book wanting to read more. It brought me through the ups and downs of all kinds of emotions and made me crave more. The metaphors were very beautifully written, catching little things to trigger my imagination and develop a true sense of the unusual traditions. Through Tita's adventures and disappointments with her mother and sisters and the love of her life Pedro, it taught me a whole new, unknown world of love and hatred and what its like to have true disappointment and unfair outcomes. Her mother, Mama Elena, has forced on her generations of traditions by not letting her start a life with Pedro. Her mother believes since Tita is the youngest of her three daughters, that she has to take care of her until the day she dies and instead of Tita being able to marry Pedro, Tita's older sister Rosaura marries him. Pedro's real plan is to marry Rosaura to become closer to Tita and to keep their relationship of burning passion a secret. Mama Elena and her cold heart make attempts to separate them but she should know how difficult a journey it is to try and separate two young people in love. She believes she has a close eye on everything they do and has tabs on where they are at all times but there are some things she just can't stop. At times during the book, I thought to myself about how Tita could possibly live with her mother being so cruel and insensitive to her feelings. As I would think about this, I concluded that Tita was a very strong and brave young lady to have to go through life with heartbreak after heartbreak. Since Tita couldn't have her own family she lived and served as a mother to her nieces and nephews and treated them like they were her own. This just made her long for her own family even more. Throughout the book Titas love for Pedro and her hatred for her mother rise and fall. Since Tita was literally &quot;born in the kitchen&quot;, she has a passion for cooking and preparing meals. In the beginning of every chapter, it starts off as Tita preparing a meal and somehow, through magic and mystery, her emotions while preparing the meals affect the person eating them. This then slides in with the mysterious happenings of every event. This book really focuses on relationships between people in love, on sisters, and on friends. Tita looks up towards her oldest sister Gertrudis, who is not afraid to rebel against her mother and to do things for her self, for help and support. The cooks and helpers on the ranch such as Nacha and Chencha really help Tita through all the drama she experiences and always is pushing her to do what she feel is right. As you read on, its ties you into more and more of Tita and Pedro's love affair and the torn emotions and traditions Tita has to survive by. The two have to sneak around and make sure no one is keeping track of them, which makes the book adventurous and suspenseful. A lot of jealousy and burning hatred arise in the book between all the characters causing major conflict in the outcomes. Like Water For Chocolate can bring people from laughing to crying to sadness all in a matter of a couple of pages, it really knows how to play with your emotions just like love did with Titas emotions. In the book, it mainly focused on Tita but as you read on in the stories, every one of the characters had been through the same thing as she had. Everyone had a love of their life and what brought Tita down was that everyone got to experience their love as they had wished, even if they were hurt in the end, while she just got to watch.Most people are not into the whole love story idea and don't care for love stories but this book also gives a lot of useful and interesting aspects to the unique Mexican culture. I saw how different the Mexican culture was back then and their interesting traditions. What I also enjoyed was how this kind of took me away from the rest of reality and challenged my thoughts of &quot;is this real, or this just simple fantasy?&quot; It got me to think and brought be into a new world where anything could be real, it all depends on if you have the true sense of imagination.I would recommend this book to people who enjoy learning of foreign cultures and like to read love stories. This book is for a mature reader who can handle reading of the mysteries of love and for people who have a good imagination and can be challenged with the thoughts of reality and fantasy. Overall I enjoyed Like Water For Chocolate very much and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This novel is sure to awaken all the senses! A deliciously woven story of culture and tradition, served over a bed of marvelous family recipes and garnished with the passion that only forbidden love can produce. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is the story of three generations of Mexican women striving to secure a place of peace and happiness within a family immersed in traditions that are based more on sacrifice than nurturance. In the novel, we are introduced to the De La Graza family, headed by Mama Elena. Mama Elena rules her family with an iron claw. Uncompromising and unwilling to yield to anything that breaks tradition or the perception that her family is the model of refinement.Tita, the youngest daughter, falls madly in love with Pedro, a man she is not allowed to marry. The customs of the family requires the youngest daughter to never wed. Instead, she is to take care of her mother until either of them dies. When Pedro comes to Mama Elena to ask for her permission to marry Tita, he is denied. Rosaura is offered instead; being the older sister and available for marriage. Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura as a way to stay close to Tita. Rosaura, being the obedient daughter, marries Pedro without consideration of the effect her marriage would have on Tita.Gertrudis, a third sister, is the first to break free of Mama Elena's rule. Tita prepares a meal using roses pedals from a bouquet she received from Pedro (after he's married Rosaura). The roses re-ignite Tita's desires for Pedro. Mama Elena disapproves of Pedro's gift and demands that Tita destroy it. Instead, Tita uses the roses in a recipe. Stained with blood from the tight embrace with which Tita cradled them, she makes a sauce that will be served over quail at a dinner party. As the guest eat the quail in rose petal sauce, they are overwhelmed with desire, clutched by lust and longing. Tita and Pedro appear to be the source of the powerful passion. The chemistry between them flows through Gertrudis, filling her with passion so hot, so intense that she is unable to contain it. Neither cool air nor cold shower can extinguish the fire within her. Fleeing from a useless cold shower, Gertrudis runs naked through an open field in an effort to escape the fire of desire. She is swept away by a soldier on horseback who had fallen madly in love after capturing a single glance of her in the village plaza. This is but one example of how Esquirel blends the elements of food and passion to produce a splendid novel.My only regret is that I can't read Spanish. On more than one occasion I felt there was something missing in the English translation of the novel. In her native language, I'm sure the author is able to express more fully the delightfully sensuous and deliciously romantic sentiments that the translators were not able to capture in English. A very solid and fun novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate captured my interest, and my taste buds, from the very first page on. The novel is the fascinating story of a Mexican girl, Tita, whose mother, Mama Elena, forbids her to marry her lover, Pedro, due to a cruel family custom. Food thus becomes Tita's connection to the outside world. Tita uses the food dishes that she prepares for her family as ways of expressing both her different emotions and, most importantly, her profound love for Pedro. Esquivel's technique of writing the novel in monthly installments, incorporating recipes at the beginning of each chapter into the text of each chapter makes the novel even more interesting to read. This unique characteristic ties the story of Tita together on a higher level, and also is my favorite aspect of the novel. In addition, the novel is a good example of magic realism. Throughout the entire novel, common events are often portrayed in an unreal, strange manner. Such is the case when Tita realizes that she is not pregnant and also when Tita meets with Dr. Brown's dead grandmother. Esquivel therefore effectively uses magic realism to convey to the reader the emotions and passion so central to the novel. I highly recommend Like Water for Chocolate to all A.P. students. Not only is it an excellent story, but it also is an example of a type of literature that most high school students are not normally exposed to in high school. The novel's South American origin, and also its incorporation of magic realism, makes it extremely different from any other novel that my class read this past year. Like Water For Chocolate would therefore be a good book to add to the AP curriculum next year if only for the contrast that it would subsequently provide to the other works that are already permanently etched in the course."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is an appetising tale of two forbidden lovers struggling to overcome nasty tradition by sharing their love for each other through Mexican cuisine. Much like a Mexican style twisted version of Romeo and Juliet. Laura Esquivel sets the scene during the revolution in Piedras Niegras, a typical town of northern Mexico. She writes her first novel in metaphorical monthly instalments, of rich traditional Mexican recipes designed to illustrate the passion of food, sex, magic and love entwined in a love story for the daring readers. Tita De La Garza, the youngest of the 3 daughters is condemned to a lifetime of dedicated hard work looking after her mother until she dies. The love she shares with Pedro is strong enough to send them crazy with the thought of not being able to live a life together. As much as Pedro would love to run away with Tita and forget about the farcical Mexican tradition, morals, ethics and respect stand in their way. Pedro's final plan to marry Tita's sister Rosaura to be closer to her causes bitterness, jealousy, shame and emotional stress amongst the two families. Esquivel combines the essential ingredients of humour, jealousy, passion, love and hate in a truly alluring novel. She tells the story as if you are living in the house and keeps you wondering what might become of the forbidden lovers. Mama Elena will make you hate her, Gertrudis will make you giddy, Rosaura will make you feel sorry for her and Tita and Pedro will make you feel warmth inside you as they have. I strongly recommend you taste Like Water for Chocolate and indulge on this appetising story which is truly food for thought."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"If you're interested in a romance, cookbook, and drama-filled novel, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; by Laura Esquivel is the book for you. This novel is about Tita, a young Mexican girl who is in love with Pedro, but is banned from marrying him simply because of a Mexican family tradition in which the youngest in the family cannot marry for she has to take care of the mother. Pedro thought that the only way they could be together was by marrying Tita's sister Rosaura. Heartbroken over the news, Tita believed that she could never love another. Does she find another love? You'll have to read this book to find out. I really enjoyed this book because once I started reading, I didn't want to put the book down. I gave the book a rate of 5 stars because it kept me captivated, wondering what would happen next, not to mention the recipes and remedies. There were times when I was very frustrated and wanted to yell at Mama Elena, Tita's mom because she was so mean to Tita. She wouldn't even let her have a simple conversation with Pedro without watching their every move. I was mainly fascinated by the way Tita handled things and still got what she wanted. I also enjoy reading romance novels for the fact that they have a more profound impact on me emotionally. Laura Esquivel does a good job of clearly explaining what was going on and describing everything in detail. It allowed the reader to picture exactly what was going on and feel the emotions of each character. With the diction she utilizes, the book is easy to read. There are a few native words and phrases throughout the story, but there are clues in the text that can help you figure out what a word means if you don't know. I came across a couple of these, but figured out what they meant by the text around it. So, for a romance, drama-filled cookbook novel, you have to read &quot;Like Water for Chocolate.&quot;"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"One of the most amazing books I have read. Tita is the youngest daugher in her family, and as such, according to her family's tradition, she is doomed never to marry and to care for her tyrannical mother for the rest of her mother's life. When she finds Pedro, the love of her life, she can't have him. He marries Tita's sister, just to be near Tita. The only way for Tita to express her love to Pedro is through her cooking. Tita has a magical way with food. Whatever emotions Tita is feeling while cooking will be transferred to all those who eat the food. The obstacles that Tita and Pedro must overcome are daunting, and yet they still persevere.This book inspired me to see the movie, which was also excellent (though I recommend reading the book first. It makes it easier to understand some of the symbolism).This book will make you believe in true love!

Tita is in love with Pedro had he with her, but when he asks for her hand in marriage, Mama Elena refuses, telling him her youngest daughter must remain single and unencumbered in order to care for her. When Mama Elena offers Pedro, Rosaura, Tita's older sister instead, Pedro gladly accepts, thinking his marriage will keep him close to Tita. Tita, meanwhile, becomes the family cook, having learned the art from the spinster Nacha. Tita however, adds a little magic to her recipes and her food is filled with her emotions--love, frustration, longing, betrayal. What's more, these emotions affect the people who eat the food as profoundly as does the food itself. The task of baking Rosaura's and Pedro's wedding cake falls to Tita. As she bakes, her tears fall in the batter and fill all at the wedding with longing for loves lost or unfulfilled. Does Tita ever find fulfillment in love? On the one hand, yes. On the other, no. Esquivel has spun a deceptively simple fantasy into a very readable book. I applaud her clear, straightforward prose. She obviously knows a really supurb story needs no gimmicks! On the negative side, the characters, especially Pedro, are rather weak and undeveloped. The surprising, surreal ending seems out of place and a little too abrupt. And while I realize Tita's cooking is symbolic, there are far too many recipes in the novel. Although interesting in themselves, the recipes soon become cumbersone and detract from the magic of the story. Although not perfect, Like Water for Chocolate is a wonderful book. A spellbinding mix of sadness, humor, earthiness and the supernatural that you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Unlike other girls, I seldom read love stories. Most of the time, detective fictions and horror stories attract me. However, interestingly, I read the whole book of Like Water For Chocolate, which describes a love story of a Mexican girl, Tita. The reason that I keep reading this book is not just that this is my homework but also that I find this story is more than a common love story.Through out the story, I find that there are many mysterious plots, which really interest me. Because of the background of Tita's family, the behaviors and conversations of the characters are traditional and sometimes are unbelievable for a modern people. For example, the tradition that Tita cannot marry since she is the last daughter of her strict mother, Mama Elena. This is the most significant point of the story and the author tells us at the very beginning. When I read this, I am so surprised and wonder how a girl can live if she cannot marry but deeply fall in love with a man, Pedro! What shot me more is that, Pedro marry Tita's sister Rosaura in order to get closed to Tita. I'm angry when I read this because if I am Tita, my heart really will be broken completely because of my lover's stupid but moving behavior. Though it's annoying, because of this, I keep reading and reading to get to know that what is going on.Also, I notice that the author likes arranging many sudden death of the characters in the story, which sometimes makes me feel that it's like a detective and horror story than a love story! The death of Tita's best friend, Chencha, Tita's nephew, Roberto, Tita's mother, Mama Elena and Tita's oldest sister and enemy , Rosaura. Each death seems to make a huge change to Tita's life. When Chencha dies, Tita becomes lonely and she has to charge the whole business of the kitchen. When Roberto dies, Tita gets crazy and leaves home to stay with John, who falls in love with Tita and tells her the meaning of true love. When Mama Elena dies, Tita gets her freedom to marry and Pedro gets almost crazy, finally he takes Tita's virginity. In the end of story, Rosaura dies so Tita and Pedro can really express their love in open. There are countless accidents through out the whole story. As a reader, I hardly have time to breathe and relax for a moment because it's to excited and nervous to get to know the development of the story.The final paragraph is the climax of the story, in spite of this, I feel strange to read a happy ending like this. On the first night that Tita and Pedro get together, they experience love so intense that both are led to a tunnel that will carry them to afterlife, in other words, die! How strange to feel happy about this. Especially, when Tita wants to return to life and she finds Pedro has already died, what she does is to eat up all the candles to light her love. Although finally, she meets Pedro again but for me, it's too unbelievable and even beyond controlled. Personally, I cannot accept a story ends like this but I won't deny that it's really a love story that filled with mystery.In the last few sentences, the author introduces herself and her identities surprises me again! What I can say is that this story abounds with surprises! It's not the common love story that we used to reading. I'm sure that after reading this book, you'll feel as surprised as I do! Even more!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The title of the book offers a fitting and versatile metaphor for the book.

The blending of recipes at the beginningof each chapter, and the plot developments relating to thoserecipes reflect the tight integration of cuisine into theshowcased family's life. Also captivating is Esquivel'sseamless blending of realistic insight into her protagonist'sthoughts with segues into moments of outright fantasy at thehigh point of the novel. The novel is beautifully writtenwith a wonderful atmosphere. The story of unrequited love tugsa bit at your heartstrings, but didn't pull me over the top,maybe because I personally couldn't relate as much to thedecisions made by the characters. The story works on manyother levels besides the romance aspect, however, and shouldoffer a good soft-hearted read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Laura Esquivel's \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is a dreamy, gauzy tale, a celebration of life that ends in ecstatic death. The prose is matter-of-fact and often instructive, as when Esquivel writes directions for cooking traditional dishes or making home remedies at a Mexican ranch over 100 years ago. This is interspersed with slang expressions that jar, seeming too contemporary for the setting.At one level, the book seems almost a parody of itself and the reader could laugh out loud at the transposition of inexplicable, allegorical happenings and the prosaic description of cooking and ordinary days.One another level, the reader is swept away by dream-like images, a \\"wishing makes it so\\" reality in which feeling, and thinking, can affect people and events. (Note: Coleridge's \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" must be heavily applied!)The lead character, Tita, is brought vividly to life; the reader knows her in full. The other characters are much more sketchily depicted, especially Tita's love, Pedro, who remains a cipher. Pedro is magnetically drawn to Tita by sexual desire; Esquivel doesn't give the reader any other basis for their relationship.In the end, sex and death bind Tita and Pedro together in erotic euphoria. Romantic readers will relish this book. Others may find it strange and at times, even unintentionally funny."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I picked this book up for free at an orchard, they have a great book give away system. I had heard of this before but never read it. It was okay, but I'm sure I'll never read it again. The story is about 3 sisters and their mom on a ranch is Mexico. The older sister marries the younger one's love, and the story takes off. The problem is, I didn't connect with any of these characters. They story would have grim reality, then fantasy in the next paragraph. I can undrestand why some people would enjoy this, but it's not my thing. I think this is one of those books that you'll love or hate. If you love this book, you'll be shaking your head and wondering what's wrong with me that I didn't like it.

Then again, it had been the my first contact with a book so unique ... the first novel to talk about the \\"magical\\" power of food, a combination which is now much more common thanks to writers and books like Joanne Harris' wonderful \`Chocolat', Lily Prior's \`La Cucina', Anthony Capella's \`Food of Love', and Isabel Allende's \`Aphrodite' and many others. In fact many of my favourite books fall into what has now become a genre in its own right.\`Like Water for Chocolate' may have lost some of it's uniqueness over the years but much of its magic and power is still there - even for a reader that's become much more jaded over the years.

It is well-told, rich in symbolism, beautiful, transports you to another culture, another time, has strong women characters,... there is so much to love in this classic! Esquivel begins each chapter with one of Nacha's authentic recipes. Nacha, the indigenous cook and caretaker, teaches and nurtures Tita. Each recipe ties to important events in Tita's sad and tragic life. The mystical and erotic experience through cooking, the frustrating love triangle, and the Mexican Revolution as the backdrop make this one of my favorite books I have ever read!

Great romance."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"A lovely book for the romantic at heart. Love story set in Mexico which follows the life of the main character. There are recipes at the beginning of each chapter and the chapter then reads on from the cooking of the dish to the background of what is going on. The serving of the dish has reprecussions on the eater as the emotion and circumstances that our heroine is going through while cooking is reflected in the eater. She portrays and transfers her emotions through her cooking.It is a wonderfully colourful, at times tearful, a rollercoaster of emotions, but well worth the read.I saw the film first which is one of my all time favourites, but would recommend, like in case of most films created from books, read the book first and let your own imagination evolve and then see someone's else interpretation in the film.Would highly recommend it, especially if you enjoyed films/books such as \\"The Making of an American Quilt\\", \\"The Joy Luck Club\\", \\"Eat, Drink, Man, Woman\\"."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Although \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is, outwardly, the doomed love story of Tita and Pedro, it is really a story of the power of women in a family. The story takes place in a Mexican border town around the year 1910. Even though Tita and Pedro are two young people very desperately in love, when Pedro asks for permission to marry Tita, her widowed, dictatorial mother, Mama Elena, denies it. The way she sees things, it is the duty of her youngest daughter to carry on the family tradition and care for her...until the day she dies. And, the youngest daughter just happens to be...Tita. Mama Elena does have another plan in mind, however, and she suggests that Pedro marry her less marriageable, oldest daughter, Rosaura, instead. Pedro accepts, but he has reasons that don't involve love...at least not love for Rosaura.Brokenhearted, Tita proceeds to channel all of her passion and energy into her cooking instead. Thinking of Pedro and knowing he will be her one and only love, Tita weeps into Pedro's and Rosaura's wedding cake as she prepares the batter. This has very unusual consequences...when the guests eat the cake, they all beging to weep, overcome with nostalgia and sadness at the thought of their first love. Even the hard-hearted Mama Elena is not unaffected.The book is narrated by Tita's grand-niece (who seems to be Esquivel, herself), who has inherited Tita's beautiful, old book of handwritten recipes and her extraordinary talent for cooking. While some of the recipes that Tita prepares are contained in \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" I wouldn't attempt them. Without Tita's magic, they simply don't work, but they are very interesting. The thrust of this story, however, remains on Tita and her love for Pedro. And on Tita's cooking.Unable to love Pedro outwardly, Tita continues to channel all of her love into her cooking. When Pedro gives her a dozen roses as a sign of his continuing love for her, Tita is ordered to throw them away. Rather than do that, however, she prepares quail with rose petal sauce. The dish turns out to be a powerful aphrodisiac; the effects on Tita's sister, Gertrudis, are extraordinary and actually change the entire course of her life.Legends abound in this book and one of the most powerful says that if anyone experiences the height of emotion and love, a door to eternity will open, for just a second, allowing them to walk through. This legend will come to have the most powerful influence of all.Since this book seems to be made up old family stories, traditions and legends, it has a nostalgic feel to it as well as being a powerful love story. And, despite this being a love story, the emphasis is on the six women characters; men hover at the periphery of this book and their personalities are not highly developed.Of course, things do not proceed smoothly for Pedro and Rosaura, but then they do not proceed smoothly for Pedro and Tita, either. Or do they? Given the book's ending, I found it difficult to decide. But the book did end in a very fitting manner and one that was very satisfying.The title of the book is particularly apt. In Mexico, hot chocolate is very strong and is made with water rather than with milk. The water is brought to a boil and then the chocolate is spooned into it (there is one scene in the book in which hot chocolate is made). A person in the throes of romantic excitement is said to be in a state \\"like water for chocolate.\\"In \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" almost everyone seems to be in this heightened state, at least part of the time. And the catalyst is always the passionate Tita, who pours her life and herself into her cooking, creating food so filled with magic that it can make people laugh or cry or literally catch fire with desire.\\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" inspired the appearance of many \\"food oriented\\" books, but none of them even came close to catching the magic and the passion of this one. This is an entertaining book and one that is quite unique. It should be very enjoyable reading for anyone."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"It's a pity such a horrible book has received such good critics. I think what happens on it is somewhat ludicrous. The psychology of the characters is completely unbelievable; they do things one could never have expected from them and yet you can guess the plot before having finished the first chapter. It's boring, it tells you too much about cooking and nothing interesting happens on it. Isabel Allende's novel, The house of the spirits, is in a way similar to this book, but it has nothing to do with it because hers is really great, the characters are well-made and the plot is fascinating."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"this book is too graphic. and the begining is so confusing. there's too many characters. and does the author reallly expect us to, after reading this stupid book, make a friggin quail in rose petal sauce. first of all i don't believe in eating animals that represent pets and second of all, i don't eat flowers. and do we really want to hear about her nipples hardening in the cold shower. no not really. and lastly i don't think this book is worth ten dollars and while borrowing this piece of trash, i lost it while taking the stupid STAR test and i now owe my teacher ten dollars, or a new book. and another thing: why would any sane woman let a dirty pigeon poop all over her, or eat candles and blow up with her boy friend stupid people."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I did not like this book at all.

First, the characters were cardboard and not at all developed. Second, the story was TOLD rather than dramtized in scenes. Third, the characters were weak and ineffectual. None of them was striving toward something. Each just accepted his or her lot in life and refused to do a thing to try to change it. Fourth, while I didn't mind the recipes and the symbolism of the cooking, I did mind the way the narrative was interrupted to insert silly instructions for made-up concoctions of food.

(...)I found myself hating Mama Elena for being so unfair and uncaring of her daughter Tita (and Rosaura, I mean, who asked her?). However, the ridiculous turn the narrative took into such a fantastical world was just toooooo much. It became totally surreal as Tita's feelings became cooked into her meals, affecting the characters who partook of her food in strange and downright weird ways. I began to despise Tita for her ongoing obsession with Pedro and her treatment of poor Dr. John, who loved her so much (more than Pedro I think) and wasn't married to her sister either. Pedro and Tita's \\"love\\" became more routine and something that they wanted more to spite her mother than the actual love they felt. (...) I just couldn't take her anymore. I had to force myself to finish, which I promptly regretted because I hated the ending the most."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I eagerly picked this up at the library after reading so many good reviews. I love literature written about Latin heroines, so I was quite disappointed to find this novel just didn't measure up.Although I love the integration of the recipes and the magical qualities into the story, it became extremely tacky and really just absurd by the 2nd half of the book. The characters, attractively quirky in the beginning, became stranger and stranger until I felt like I was going to strangle the main character, Tita. Her longing over a pathetic man, the strange sickness that the sister posessed (gross!), and the evil mother continuing to haunt her as a ghost were just the beginning.The ending ruined the book for good, though. It was so hasty that I became really confused as to what was going on. And the last couple pages were so terrible I was laughing at the story by the time I finished!I give it 3 stars for the good beginning, the fascinating Mexican recipes, and the magical quality it possesses at times.

It is a monthly novel, which is full of romance, emotions, family traditions and recipes. It is about a girl named Tita who can't marry her love (Pedro) because she has to follow the family tradition: as the youngest daughter, she must take care of her mother until she dies. The whole novel is about how Tita suffered when she was separated from her love, and how she faced problems when her love (Pedro) got married to her sister (Rosaura), just to stay close to Tita. Mama Elena was an obstacle in Tita's life, she never let her stay near to Pedro. Novel explains how Tita faced these problem. I would recommend this novel to students for three reason.It was a well written novel and everything happened in the novel was related to food, which is the first reason why I would recommend students to read this novel. It shows the importance of food in people's life. It shows how love can be expressed by cooking. The author made this point very clear when Pedro brought flowers for Tita, which were really important to her. Tita had a very good skill of cooking which she used to show how much the flowers meant to her. She cooked the flowers (given by Pedro) with the quail to gave it importance, instead of throwing it away, when they dry. So, the author showed that cooking has its own specialties that people can use to express their love. I want students to read this book, so they get to know: food is as good to express love, as to eat.Second reason why I want students to read this book is that I want them to know the importance of love. This novel shows how much love is important. It really explains the role that love and a second person plays in our lives. It gives very specific examples of how we need another person to light up our matches inside us, which means we need someone to love, to laugh, so we can enjoy our life. It's a novel which really explains the meaning of love, which I am sure everyone would like to know about because everyone wants to be loved. So, I want students to read this book, so they get to know the importance of love in their life.Third reasons is that this novel is full of mixed traditions: fair and unfair. Tita can't marry and has to live with her mother until she dies, which Tita think is an unfair tradition. Tita makes certain food at certain occasions, which she enjoys the best, and which also is a tradition. She thinks it's a fair tradition. We all have our family traditions that we follow, which sometimes we are disagree to. This novel explains very well the meaning of family traditions, and how it effects our lives. it shows how traditions can effect the decisions that we make, and I am sure we all have suffered through it.Finally, this book is full of recipes, romances, and home remedies, and main purpose of the book is to show how love can effect someone's life. I really want students to read this book, so they get to know and feel, what role love, food, and traditions play in our lives. I want them to know love is important and the ways people express their love and the ways they follow to get their love. If you never read a book before, start with this one. It's not only words, it express every single emotion clearly."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate written by Laura Esquivel is a novel about a girl named Tita whose fate as the youngest of three sisters, dictated by family tradition, is to remain single so that she could take care of her mother (Mama Elena) during her old age until she passes. Tita is the cook at the ranch in Mexico along with the head cook, Nacha. In the beginning of this novel, Tita admires a man of the name of Pedro. Pedro asks Tita's hand in marriage, however Mama Elena forbids Tita to marry her true love because of the tradition. Mama Elena suggests Pedro to marry her eldest daughter Rosaura. Pedro accepts thinking that would be a way for him to be close with his true love, Tita. This novel has conflicts filled with passion, deception, anger, as well as pure love. This novel shows us how one girl struggles to change her fate or the fate of her future generations.One of the reasons why I would recommend this book is because there is a lot of food recipes that are at the beginning of each chapter (or month) and within the novel. It gives the readers something to value, besides the joy of this book. The recipes also give metaphors (examples of Tita's emotions) of what Tita is feeling during this novel. Sometimes it doesn't show what Tita is feeling directly, but if you read where food is present, it provides Tita's emotions metaphorically. Some examples of food she prepares are: turkey mole with almonds, quail with rose pedals, etc., and she also gives some house hold remedies also. This novel deals with Tita having to deal with seeing her sister and the one she loves along with an offspring that Pedro and Rosaura cherish. This has probably happened in real life, probably in a different country. An example of a metaphor would be when Tita was going to cook a quail; she first had to catch it and then kill it. &quot;She realized that you cant be weak when it comes to killing or it causes more sorrow.&quot; This is a metaphor because it relates to how she feels and how she should deal with it. This quote is saying if she doesn't become strong she would be moping around in sorrow. It also shows that if she doesn't try harder &quot;killing the quail&quot;, she would be in a lot of sorrow.Another Reason why I would recommend this novel is because of the conflicts of the love triangle between Tita, Pedro, and John, whom is later introduced in the book. Eventually, Tita has to choose between marrying a doctor (John), or marrying her first true love Pedro. I like this particular part of this novel because it gives us a feeling that you just want to know, and you end up just reading and reading until you find out what happens."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate written by Laura Esquivel is a novel about a girl named Tita whose fate as the youngest of three sisters, dictated by family tradition, is to remain single so that she could take care of her mother (Mama Elena) during her old age until she passes.

Starting each section with a Mexican recipe, the novel uses food as the most important symbolism to express the emotion of Tita, the heroine of the novel. Being the youngest daughter of the family, Tita longed her entire life to marry her soul mate, Pedro, but she was heavily fettered by family tradition, which did not allow her to marry and expected her to take care of her Mama until her Mama dies. Under total control of her Mama, cooking was Tita's only outlet to express herself. The specific details of each recipe are woven through the narrative as transitions in plots and carrier of Tita's various emotion. With such unique writing style, Laura Esquivel vividly reveals the conflict between romance of true love and the powerful yet unreasonable tradition. Despite being a classic romance-tragedy novel, the book is also a great feminist work that tells a story of the self-growth of Tita. Setting the backdrop in the Mexican Revolution, Laura Esquivel provides a revolutionary atmosphere throughout the novel. As the plot progresses, the submissive Tita, who initially could only express herself through cooking, was eventually able to actualize her feelings and secure her rights to pursuit sweet dreams. Fantastical as it is, the book is actually easy to read. I strongly recommend the book to teenagers, especially girls, as it gives a strong sense of self-discovery and potential of women to stand up."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"An execellent read.

You will long to be around family and appreciate the effect that food has throughout the course of life. I am 100% in agreement with the theme of how you feel when you cook will determine exactly how the food tastes. The characters are so warm and the short chapters each have a burst of delight like small sparks. A short book that will keep you entertained and make you feel full after you are done reading. Definitely a book to give to your mother/sister/cousin/best friend. The recipes are also tempting to try (though I'm not sure if i could get all of the ingredients. You will feel like you just left your parents house...in a great way! The stories are told well and are a little far fetched, but if you read carefully you will find the moral in each chapter...there's a greater message than the story itself. Short, sweet, simple and insightful.

Long story short:Really good novel.If you have the time to ready it at your own pace, then its a good book to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I rather enjoyed this book, as a fun way to practice my Spanish. But I have no idea why anybody thinks it's capital-L-Literature.Like Water for Chocolate is a total soap opera, complete with several love triangles, fights over babies, embarrassing diseases and people having sex on horseback while galloping across a field. (Really!) I won't come down too hard on it for this, because Esquivel is in control of it; the resemblance to a telenovela is clearly intentional. It's also a novel about cooking, divided up into twelve chapters by month (although it's unclear why, as the novel covers far more than one year and events tend not to take place in the month corresponding to the chapter in which they appear). Each chapter begins with a recipe, each one crucial to the story, where the protagonist is able to express herself and exert control over her world primarily through her cooking.Overall, this book is guilty pleasure reading--the writing is simple even in the original Spanish (although still much better than the awful English translation), the characters archetypical, and although it's set during the Mexican Revolution, we learn almost nothing about the time period, which mostly serves as a backdrop for the parallel rebellion against authority in the De la Garza household. There is some humor, which foodies in particular will appreciate: \\"Just let me take this off the burner, and then you can go right back to crying, okay?\\" says one character in an emotional moment. The magic realism feels a bit awkward, but is at least consistent, and the idea of an oppressed woman rebelling through her cooking--which often has magical properties--explains some of the attention from literary critics.But most readers will be more interested in the romance, which caters to a particular taste. I suspect this book is popular in large part because of current trends in fictional romances: these days we like to see reasons for our protagonists' falling in love, we want to be shown that they're compatible, we want their sexual relationships to be characterized by mutual respect and clear consent. I include myself in that \\"we,\\" while understanding that for many, that just isn't very romantic. Maybe you like love at first sight, that strikes like lightning and has just as much logic behind it; maybe you like sex scenes that look like rape, but aren't, because the woman actually wants it. If you are that kind of reader, you'll likely enjoy the romance here much more than I did. (Although, taste aside, the main love interest still has no positive qualities, except perhaps for consistency. He's jealous and whiny and has no courage, common sense or strength of character.)Overall, this is a fairly entertaining book, especially if you are a foodie and/or want to read a Mexican soap opera. The positive response from literary types still baffles me, though."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I read this book as a selection for our book club. It was fun for everyone to bring a chocolate item for our snack as we discussed. The book is an older one, but informative of this time period and Mexican folklore. I gave it a 3-star rating because some of it was just too unbelievable. For example, the main male character marrying his girlfriend's sister just to be near his girlfriend after the mother does not approve of their relationship."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I love this book.It will become quite obvious once I am through with this review.I feel in love with this novel in my 9th grade high school English class.I had never been introduced to \\"magic realism\\" or been given the opportunity to read a more \\"modern\\" read that wasn't a \\"classic\\" and mandatory like \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"The novel's multi-genre structure is one that appeals to readers who love both literature, romance and the culinary arts.Tita, the protagonist in the novel (although not the narrator) is obligated to cook for her family and unfortunately forced to take care of her overbearing and emotionally abusive mother. Her mother, Mama Elena, forbids Tita from marrying her \\"true\\" love Pedro despite her intense and passionate love for him.The character's in this novel are not only well-developed, they're also relatable and quite interesting and different from one another. Each and every character has admirable aspects of their personalities and not-so-admirable ones as well.To read this novel, it is somewhat important to understand the historical context in which the novel is unraveling; it would help to have some knowledge on the Mexican Revolution and the impact it had on Mexico at the time.There are recipes as an introduction to each chapter; recipes that speak of the tradition in Mexican cuisine and serve as interesting anecdotes leading into the new chapter.Overall, I admire the overall effect the intertwining genres and characters have on me, as a reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"One of the most beautiful books I have read in years.

It had been recommended to me in a foodie forum, and while it was somwhat about food, the rest of it was a very weird tale of love.Tita is born in the kitchen, amongst the smell of onions which causes her to cry immediately. She is the youngest of three daughters, born to a controlling mother. As the youngest, she is informed that she will never marry and must take care of her mother until she dies.When she falls in love with Pedro her mother seeks to destroy their love and instead has Pedro marry her oldest daughter. During the reception at the wedding, everyone is sick from the food that is infused with Tita's tears. This is not the only time her food would have such a strong reaction on someone, however. She also prepares another dish, that makes her middle sister flame with so much desire she burns down the shower house and runs away naked with a army captain. This causes the mother to of course, for pride, disinherit the middle daughter.As the years pass Pedro and his wife have two kids. Both Tita becomes attached too but is grievously torn away from them at the spite of her mother. When she goes crazy after hearing about the death of one, she is rescued by Doctor John Brown who falls in love with her. With plans to marry she returns to her mother's house to care for her after a bandit attack. Her mother dies and even though Tita thinks she might be free, the return of Pedro and her sister proves that she is not.She is torn between marrying John or being with her true love Pedro. And what of Pedro's little daughter who she cares so much about. She cannot think of leaving her either. It will be a tough decision that ultimately comes to a shocking ending.This book, since it is a Foodie book, contains 12 recipes. All seem to be of Spanish descent and feature a lot of nuts. If you have nut allergies, this isn't the book for you, at least to make things out of. The chapters are all labeled by the months of the year, which was strange to me because rather than covering a year, this book covers 23 years.I wasn't very happy with the ending. With all the hardship that Tita had to face in her life, the ending just didn't seem fair to me. I also thought that the author did a horrible job on the character of Pedro. I couldn't figure out what redeeming qualities he had that would make Tita love him so. I thought he was a wretch. The rest of the characters were wonderfully done though. You could hate the mother, appreciate the middle sister and Tita's other helpers, find pity for the older sister, and smile at the goodness of Dr. John.Esquivel's writing is very easy to read. This book is in the third person and mainly focuses on Tita. The recipes ingredient lists are easy to read but as far as the preparation goes, its interspersed with the story so one would have to use the book to write it out before hand before trying to make any of them. Some of the recipes look easy, the rest look like they could take the better part of the day to make. There's even a recipe for homemade matches!Overall while I liked the incorporation of food into this novel, I wasn't as pleased with the novel itself. The story was depressing and some of the characters were hard to connect to. It isn't one I'd read again.Like Water For ChocolateCopyright 1992246 pages"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Torta fritta is the name of a fried dumpling made in Emiglia Romagna, Italy. Served hot from the kitchen they're hollow, so you can stuff a tasty treat in there and have a delicious little warm sandwich. The book is like this food because it's unusual, sometimes hot, always warm, simple, and delicious. Inside, however, it's empty.As the youngest daughter, Tita is forced to remain single and take care of her cruel mother who marries Tita's love, Pedro, to her older sister. They reside in the family home where Tita, raised in the kitchen by the family cook, carries on the ancient family recipes. She's pretty much a house slave, so she expresses her love, frustration, and anger in the food she makes, all with great care. I can see why the book was so popular in Mexico. It's a romantic fun read. I bet half the women in the country read it.The \\"magical realism\\" that I enjoy so much wasn't elaborate or beyond the grasp of the average reader, so the book was very accessible. The story is ultimately predictable, but with some fun twists and turns. Including the recipies was very clever, and I found myself wondering how they'd be made.

The conflicts presented in this story are very elementary and complex at the same time.If you like the idea of love and drama, this book is perfect for you then. Honestly I didn't expect to like this book, but in the end the story taught me a lot.The story is about a girl who lives by a family tradition that ties Tita( the main character) to her mother until the day the mother dies.

The novel is about the story of Tita who, as the youngest daughter of the tyrannical Mama Elena, is oppressed by a family tradition that forbids her to leave her mother as long as she lives. The man of Tita's dreams, Pedro, marries her sister Rosaura when the matriarchal Mama Elena refuses to give her blessing of matrimony between Tita and Pedro. Upon the marriage between Pedro and Rosaura begins a life-long feud filled with jealousy, deception, passion, and, ultimately, love. Like Water for Chocolate is narrated by Tita's grand-niece who interweaves the recipes of her great-aunt with her legendary story. This novel incorporated with humor, sorrow, magic, and true love, represents an originally eccentric fairytale story.The story of Tita has the basic fairytale style in which an obstacle prevents her from following her dream. Her evil and oppressive mother forbids her to marry her love while her sister \\"steals\\" that very love from her. Mama Elena is depicted as an spiteful and dictatorial mother who has no compassion for her daughter Tita. Mama Elena imposes on Tita the family tradition that she must serve her mother until her death. Restricted by this unfortunate fate, Tita is not able to fulfill her ambitions. Even though Rosaura is not a formidable sister, she is caught in her mother's scheme to marry Tita's love, Pedro. Hence, Mama Elena and Rosaura's character serve to represent the impediment in Tita's life.Each chapter of the novel begins with a recipe that relates or reflects the highlight of the particular chapter. Tita perceives her duty to cook for the family as a privilege she cherishes. Tita has no right in the household of Mama Elena; however, cooking serves as means of expressing her conflicting emotions. Tita's emotions, sorrow, anger or happiness, emerge out in her cooking. For instance, as Tita is preparing her sister and Pedro's wedding meal, she weeps absorbed by a heart ache and grief. When the guests start eating the meal she made, they all start to remember lamenting moments in their lives and begin to weep to ruin her sister's wedding. Tita's cooking has magical effect on those that consume her meal by causing them to experience the emotions she is enduring. While the recipes in each chapter depict the rich culture of Mexico, they by enlarge, serve to metaphorically represent Tita's state of mind.Esquirel's use of magical realism in the novel contributes to the fairytale aspect of the story. The final scene of the novel represents the most eccentrically magical and romantic moment in the story. Tita and Pedro are finally together after her sister's death. As they are lying in bed in state of bliss, Pedro dies. Upon realization of his death, Tita she begins to eat a box of candles one by one. As she chews, she lies next to Pedro's dead body and thinks of all the fondest and brightest memories she had with him, which causes their bodies to set in flames. As their bodies burn in the flames, Tita and Pedro's soul join and lives on forever. This uniquely romantic ending interweaved with magical realism finalizes Esquirel fairytale."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"her best book. it is so romantic!

I highly recommend this novel to everyone."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate With Like Water For Chocolate, Laura Esquivel has written a novel about a Mexican love story that charms the palate and the heart. It is a novel written in monthly installments with a combination of romances and recipes. The story opens during the Mexican Revolution with the main character Tita not even born yet. While onions are chopped in the kitchen, even Tita, still in Mama Elena's womb, cries. Tita is raised in the kitchen. The smells and the different tastes are her life. There isn't anything that Tita doesn't eat, except onions. The onions make her cry. Tita is the youngest of Mama Elena's three daughters. Rosaura is the oldest, and Gertrudis in the middle. Tita is brilliant in the kitchen. As a baby they have to put food in whatever room of the house that she was in, or she will cry. Tita meets Pedro at a dinner reception and they fall in love instantly. Pedro asks for her hand in marriage but is denied. An old tradition in Tita's family says that the youngest daughter will never marry because she has to take care of her mother until her death. Pedro then marries Rosaura, Tita's sister, but only to be close to Tita. His love for her only grows stronger. Tita prepares the wedding cake. She cries in the batter because she thinks that Pedro doesn't love her. At the wedding reception, the strangest thing happens. Everyone who eats the cake begins to cry over their lost loves. Then everyone begins to vomit after they finish crying. Pedro and Rosaura have a child that Tita loves like her own. His name is Roberto. A few months later Roberto dies and Tita can't take it. She an American Dr. John, and runs away with him to the United States. Dr. John falls in love with Tita but she won't marry him because she still loves Pedro. While in the U.S., she gets terrible news. Little Roberto dies of malnutrition. But not only that, also her mother gets killed by some white soldiers. After all the bad news, Tita finally gets some good news. Pedro and Rosaura have another child. This time they have a girl. The time passes, but Pedro and Tita's love only grows stronger. After many years of digestive problems, Rosaura dies in the lingering odor of her own gas. Then many years after Rosaura's death, her daughter marries John's son. Finally Tita and Pedro can be together. Pedro and Tita make passionate love, but in the sheer moment of Pedro's ecstacy, Pedro's heart suddenly stops and he dies. Tita can't bear the pain of losing Pedro, so she kills herself by eating a box of matches. Laura Esquivel presents a wonderfully written, Mexican Romeo &amp; Juliet. They are like Romeo &amp; Juliet because Mama Elena, Tita's mother, doesn't not allow them to be together. Also in the end, Tita takes her own life because of Pedro. She writes the book in monthly installments, with a different recipe each month. This format that she chooses, in my opinion, is very good. It keeps the reader interested because you always want to know what happens in the next month, and what recipe she makes. Her recipes are very important in the story. She uses food as an interpreter of the characters' feelings. For instance, earlier in the story Pedro gives Tita some roses. Mama Elena told Tita she must get rid of them, but instead, she uses them in her recipe. She makes Quail in Rose Petal Sauce. Since the roses are given to Tita with love from Pedro, when they eat the delicious bird everyone begins to feel hot and they feel a strong feeling between all of them. Gertrudis even has an orgasm at the dinner table, and was so hot that she spontaneously combusts and catches on fire. She has to run to the shower. She shows how peoples' emotions are more powerful than anything. The message that I think she gives, is that nothing is more powerful than love. That love can make people sick, make them cry, and make them smile. Laura Esquivel shows that love can push people to the edge of life. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been in love, or knows someone in love. It is a wonderful story of love, sex, and war in Revolutionary Mexico. It's like the De La Garza family has their own revolution in their home. They have a revolution of love."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book was a fantastic book filled with awesome detail and alluring scenes.

The tale itself will no doubt change the way you feel about true love and family traditions. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is a realistic yet magical novel, set during the Revolution during the early 20th century. It deals with the forbidden love of two people, Tita and Pedro, as a result of strong family traditions enforced by Tita's mother, Mama Elena. In desperation to see Tita a decision is made on Pedro's behalf. However, it is entirely up to you, on whether you agree or disagree with Pedro's final decision. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; was written by Laura Esquivel and was her first novel. However, the novel was previously published as &quot;Like Water For Hot Chocolate.&quot; As a result of Laura's wide use of descriptive words people, places and events can be created so vividly, successfully forming clear images of the time and style that the novel reflects. Reasonably short, interesting and raunchy chapters mark the end and beginning of a new month. This is also represented with the addition of a single traditional Mexican recipe, at the start of each month, over a twelve month period. All of the characters in this novel are realistically believable and it is very easy to understand and relate to the amount of pain that one of the most likeable characters, Tita experiences. The selfishness and bitterness of certain characters, however, does encourage you to take a dislike to them and be repulsed by their attitudes and actions. All in all, &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is a very emotional novel, which is quite easy to follow. However, due to the author having dealing with love in a less obvious way, commonly through traditional recipe's, some readers may find the novel slightly confusing. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is a touching and appealing novel, that is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate is an enchanting, wondrous novel set to capture the heart of the reader.

A spicy encounter of a condemned love affair that even destiny would keep these two lovers apart. The story is set in the turn of the century in Mexico. It is a compelling tale of a family of females growing up when family tradition, wondrous romance and sensational remedies and recipes are passed on. The novel uses customary recipes in a diary format and a dash of magical realism to tell an account of a forbidden love that will touch the reader and make them want to laugh and to cry. The story of Tita and Pedro is made out to be a true tale. The characters seem real and the story seems true. It is an account of a life experience that I think everyone can relate too. It is a story about wanting something that you can't have. One of the reasons that Tita and Pedro are isolated from one another is because of Tita's Mother Mama Elena's family tradition. The tradition of the youngest daughter not marring because they are to look after their mother to death. However, Tita is determined to end the dreadful tradition. Mama Elena, Tita's evil mother, refuses to let Tita marry Pedro because of the Family Tradition. However, she offers Tita's spiteful elder sister Rosaura for him and he accepts. The deceitful deeds of this family, the helpful hint in the kitchen from Nacha and Chencha and a tad of support from her strong willed sister Gertrudis helped her to spice up the kitchen and find love again. This book is an account of a life that comes down to making a decision between a man that loves her and she can have or waiting for the one she desires. If you are one who leaves everything up to fate and destiny and enjoy a touch of love and romance, this novel will catch your attention by the raunchy yet enchanting magical encounters. It is a novel not to be missed because of the succulent and juicy last chapter where all is revealed.

I found that the way the chapters were separated, by months, was extremely interesting because there was a new recipe every month and it perfectly tied together the entire story. After reading the first couple of chapters I was a bit confused about who Tita was and how she fitted into the family. The magical realism throughout the book makes you think to yourself, \\"did that really happen,\\" or is Tita exaggerating. I found that this was the best part of the book. There were examples of this at least twice during each chapter. For example, Tita had tried to regain warmth because she had lost the ability to share her life with the man she loved. She quilted a quilt to try to regain this warmth and sense of security, but the quilt ended up being just a gigantic quilt. Because Tita was the youngest daughter in the family, it was her responsibility to keep her mother company and tend to her in her in her old age. This is why she and the man she loved couldn't be together. Not being of any Spanish back round at all, this story brought a lot of their traditions to light, not only for me, but for all non-Hispanics in my class as well. After reading the book, we watched the movie, which made my understanding much clearer. I suggest that people read this book twice to catch all the interesting detail that Laura Esquirel puts in each recipe and chapter.

The novel begins around 1910, the time of the Mexican revolution. The story follows the life of the main character, Tita de la Garza, from birth to death as she struggles to gain her own independence, discover her true self and win the love of her life. Tita is the youngest daughter of three girls and due to the family tradition that states that the youngest daughter must care for her mother until she dies, she alone is responsible to care for her tyrannical mother on their small ranch for the rest of her days and doomed to never marry or have children. Tita is affected by this terrible tradition when the love of her life, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to ranch to ask for her hand in marriage and is denied by the cruel Mama Elena. He is offered Tita's sister Rosaura instead and he accepts, with the thought that if he marries Rosaura, he will at least be able to live in the same house as Tita, even though he won't be able to openly show his love for her. The novel progresses from this point in monthly installments, each entitled with a recipe that precedes the chapter. The entire structure of the novel is dependent on these recipes because the main episodes of each chapter involve the preparation and consumption of the dishes that these recipes create. Esquivel creates characters that are very easy to get attached to and scenes that are very memorable throughout the course of the novel. John Brown, the kind and gentle doctor, is Tita's savior in the story and Esquivel warms the reader's heart with his endless compassion and loving nature. Also, the scene in which the heat from Tita's sister's body ignites the outside shower and sends her running naked and terrified into the arms of a revolutionary soldier who scoops her up onto his horse to make passionate love to her, leaves the reader laughing and also astonished at the surprising events. Esquivel uses this \\"magical realism\\" throughout the novel to create an intriquing plot that the reader just can't tear away from. Tita's strength and struggles in life make her a character that you can relate to and someone who you will remember from literature forever. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is an excellent novel for anyone who likes reading about other cultures and anyone who appreciates a good romance novel without the cheesy and sappy nature of so many other love stories.

A marriage between the two is forbidden because of Tita's fate to be Mama Elena's care taker until she passes on, which follows the family tradition of the youngest daughter. The love never dies between the two even after the arranged marriage between Rosaura, Tita's sister, and Pedro. This became an obstacle as well as a strategy for Pedro to be closer to Tita.

Tita assumes the responsibility of cook on her mother's ranch and Tita's has a special gift; she is able to translate her emotions into her food. Those that indulge in her dishes share in her rage, lust, and pain.I found \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" to be a quick, entertaining read, but I was disappointed in the lack of substance to the novel. Perhaps I was expecting more of a social commentary on Mexican society during the Mexican Revolution. But I also felt cheated because Esquivel chooses not to give more of a history of each of the characters. The novel spans a thirty year period, yet, we as the reader, are left with only snippets of Tita's life, her struggles with her mother, sisters, and Pedro, leaving us to wonder how she ended up at certain points in her life. The characters seemed too one - dimensional and flat, by the end of the novel, I barely had an understanding as to why certain characters behaved in certain ways, nor did I feel much of a resolution at the end.

It's equally beautiful and poetic in both languages. Like Water for Chocolate is the story of a woman named Tita who is denied the pleasure of marrying the man she loves because of a family tradition that says the youngest daughter must dedicate her life to caring for her mother. Tita's mother is so cruel that she not only forbids Tita from marrying her lover, but also convinces him to marry Tita's older sister. He agrees because he knows it is the only way he can be close to Tita. Throughout the book, Tita pours her various emotions into her cooking, which has powerful and mysterious effects on those who eat it. Rather than making the story seem unreal, these magical events make the emotions of the novel more powerful and real to the reader. This novel is far more than a love story.

CONGRATULATIONS TO LAURA ESQUIVEL, THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Growing up in a Mexican family has taught me many different things throughout the years, whether they were harsh life lessons or simple instructions on how to make tamales or tortillas. I have also learned how we behave as individuals and how we behave socially. The men tend to be controlling yet passionate and romantic, while the women tend to be quiet and reserved yet jealous and tender. We follow strict Catholic traditions, but at the same time we maintain our own superstitions (Curanderas for example). Perhaps that's what had me mysteriously drawn to this book. I felt that I could relate to the author, the characters, and maybe the story in general because of my background. Not to mention the fact that I also enjoy romantic tragedies.Set during the Mexican Revolution, Tita de la Garza lives with her mother, Mama Elena, and two older sisters, Rosaura and Gertrudis, on a ranch near the Mexico - US border. Tita meets and falls deeply in love with the charming Pedro Muzquiz, although the de la Garza family tradition insists that Tita, being the youngest, remains unmarried and care for her mother until her death. Pedro, who feels the same affection for Tita, agrees to marry her older sister Rosaura in order to remain close to her. Heartbroken, Tita puts all her emotions and intensity into her cooking, and all who eat it feel the same emotions with the same amount of passion. This newly discovered power that Tita uses to express herself freely, in spite of being oppressed by her tyrannical mother, allows her and Pedro to embark on a secret love affair.The two most important and rather obvious themes are food/Tita's cooking, and family tradition. It is because of the family tradition that Tita is forbidden to be with Pedro, and she expresses her feelings and desires to break the bonds of the tradition that has kept her and Pedro apart through her cooking. She uses her cooking as a form of art full of uncontrollable passion and lust, causing her sister Gertrudis to run off with a soldier in the Mexican Revolution (pg. 27) and her lover Pedro to express the same feelings (pg.26): \\"for when [he] tasted his first mouthful he couldn't help but close his eyes in voluptuous delight exclaiming: \`It is a dish for the gods!'\\"This clearly shows that everyone who consumed Tita's food, especially her lover Pedro, was immediately affected by it.Like Water for Chocolate has received mostly positive reviews from all over the world. The San Francisco Chronicle raved about the novel, calling it \\"a tall-tale, fairy-tale, soap-opera romance, Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one, Like Water for Chocolate is one tasty entree from first-time novelist Laura Esquivel.\\" The Washington Post also gave Esquivel thumbs up and admired the novel stating that it \\"portrays the fantastical as everyday.\\"Personally, I agree with the critics that Like Water for Chocolate is a book like no other. It's hard to find authors like Esquivel who can use such profound ingenuity to convey romance and love as more than just sex and your typical lust-filled soap opera plots. By incorporating Mexican culture and food into the novel, Esquivel makes the reader feel closer to the characters, feel sympathy for Rosaura, hate Mama Elena, and root for Tita, and ignites a passion inside the reader the same way Tita does when others relish her cooking. I would not recommend this as a \\"feel good\\" book, as the ending may leave the reader unsatisfied; however if you enjoy romance novels and are entertained by magical realism, Like Water for Chocolate is a must read.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book is a story is about a young girl that is in love with this young man.

Rosaura said that Tita was trying to ruin her wedding night by making her sick.I really like the way that the author describes everything so good. Like when Tita was making dinner, how she was cutting the chilies, and the sound that the meat made when it touched the hot pan. I also liked the setting that the author had. Some thing that I would change would be the ending. But I had to read it two times to get it.

Tita is the youngest daughter of Mama Elena, and according to tradition Tita is forbidden from marrying her sweetheart, Pedro, because she is destined to take care of her mother until the day she dies. As a result Tita is relegated to a lonely life, with only her beloved recipes as an outlet for her emotions; and what happens in Tita's kitchen is magical. For instance, when Mama Elena decides to marry Pedro to Tita's older sister, Tita is ordered to make the couple's wedding cake as punishment for daring to hope for love. Tita obeys, but can't stop herself from weeping as she makes the icing, working her tears into the meringue. As a result, when the cake is served to the wedding guests each person is suddenly overcome with an intense longing, for all the loves they've lost in their lives, for all the opportunities missed and sacrifices made. Mama Elena is convinced that Tita has vengefully poisoned the cake, but in reality Tita's emotions have inadvertently become tied to the dishes she creates in her kitchen. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is filled with uncanny scenes and succulent recipes, all of which are narrated in the deft, enchanting voice of Tita's great-niece, who learned of her aunt's recipes by discovering her handwritten cookbook.

She was born in the kitchen and has great culinary skills that are incorporated throughout the book (so prepare to be hungry). From a young age, Tita's great beauty is noticed by a gentleman suitor, Pedro who will do anything to marry her because he is so madly in love. When Tita's mother states she cannot marry, Pedro instead marries Tita's sister in order to stay close to Tita. Tita's mother is always on guard to prevent any chance encouters, while Rosasia her sister silently grieves because her husband does not want but Tita in his life. Through the story, the mother shows herself as vengeful of her situation since she cannot control her three girls- one rides away with a guerilla, Tita is constantly mournful for Pedro and in the end is taken in by another suitor, and Rosario is constantly depressed because her husband does not love her. The story evolves around the daughters growing up and moving on with their lives through heartache. The one I feel most pity for is Rosaria since she did not ask to be married to Pedro and throughout she can see that he does not nor ever did love her. I do not want to give an ending to the story since you must read this book. The real gift of Esquivel's story is that she surprises you along the way and teaches you things throughout. I love the commentaries from Dr. Brown on love igniting and the way that Tita's grand niece reflects back on the great loves of her family with such sincerity. The book made my cry and want to find true love. The recipes and food made me hungry, and the story was so beautiful that I ran out and bought the movie. I received my copy from a friend on Valentine's Day and it was a perfect gift.

While I was disappointed with some of Tita's decisions, I felt that Esquivel remained true to her character's personality and desires; she portrayed emotion using original descriptions and comparisons, often related to food (i.e. falling in love is compared to dough being dipped in hot oil).

This romantic fiction uses realistic details to describe the all of the food and people that are found at the De la Garza ranch.With over two million copies in print, I would call Like Water for Chocolate an amazing and outstanding book. This is a great book for someone who enjoys love stories. You may also want to read it if you want to learn some home remedies or culinary skills. Since part of this book is a Mexican cookbook, it really sets itself apart from other love stories. Though in those love stories, there is usually a torn or restricted love between two characters as it is in Like Water for Chocolate. With every new monthly recipe, Esquivel also gives new home remedies packed with a lot of detail. You really have to pay attention to the story and what is going on to understand it, otherwise the ending will confuse you.With all of the passionate love going on, junior high students would best not read this book. It is a little too mature and should be read by high school students or adults.I have enjoyed this book a lot. There are some sections in the book where you can stop reading and take a break. Otherwise, this book is hard to put down. It can be a good page-turner.The ending may be somewhat disappointing and confusing, but the beginning really brings you into the story, and for that I give this book four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquivel (Translated by Carol Christensen and Thomas ChristensenFebruary 5, 2005A book that has become a classic, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquivel is the star-crossed romance between Tita and Pedro. They are torn apart due to a \\"tradition\\" held in Tita's family that the youngest daughter is destined to live out her life taking care of her mother. Tita and Pedro have already declared their love for each other, but Mama Elena has other plans. Instead, Pedro marries an older sister, Rosaura, who he does not love at all, but he feels this is the closest he will ever get to his beloved Tita.Each chapter begins with a Mexican recipe, and the chapters themselves are written as if for a cookbook, except in-between the instructions on how to make \\"mole\\", or how to cook Quail in Rose Petal sauce, Tita's story is told, narrated by an unnamed grandniece. It is the sad, yet sometimes humorous story of Tita's life, and how she is frustrated living as the youngest daughter in the house of De La Garza. Tita's father has been long deceased, and Mama Elena is the head of the household. She rules with a heavy hand and all live in fear of her. Tita, however, is the rebellious child, and is often beaten and punished for the simplest of things. Her biggest punishment is when Mama Elena declares that Tita will not be allowed to marry her love, Pedro, and instead Tita watches her sister take her place.Her emotions are somehow transmitted to her cooking. By this time of her life, Tita is relegated to head cook, and she is good at it. But the pain and unhappiness she feels is now tasted in her cooking. At her sister's wedding, the guests become sick because of how Tita feels as she cooks the banquet feast. This is but one example where Tita's cooking seems to become more than just a meal, sending her own emotions into the food that she is cooking. I loved this element of magical realism, and I'm finding that the more I read books by Hispanic authors, the more sure I will be that I will encounter it.As many books written by Latin American authors, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE spans many years, and although it is quite a short book, it does tell the story of two lives that are forever linked through love.

Tita as the main character is likeable as she is an interesting, lively character with extreme talent for cooking. Tita deserves a lot of sympathy in the story as she is the victim. One of Tita's two sisters, Rosaura, is the quiet , shy type. She became a bother to the plot , she was placed in a bad situation but she is not an evil person.Gertrudis, Tita's other sister is a free spirited soul who rebels against all restrictions. Gertrudis brings an element of shock or surprise to the story which makes her likeable. The male lead and love interest of Tita, Pedro is highly passionate but acts at times submissive as he is not strong enough to stop circumstances. The villain of the story is arguably Mama Elena.

All the elements of a soap opera and much more. Like Water For Chocolate is a deceptively simple book - a love story set in Mexico, combined with recipes, related in unadorned, uncomplicated language.

As the youngest daughter, Tita's place in life is to care for her elderly mother, Mama Elena. Tita's forbidden to marry her love, and instead, Mama Elena offers her older daughter to Pedro. He accepts, not out of love, but out of the desire to remain physically close to Tita. Heartbroken, Tita is forced to bake the wedding cake. Her cooking is done with such passion and despair, that the wedding guests are overcome with sadness as they taste the cake. From this, Tita discovers that her baking has strange effects on those who partake of it. Interwoven throughout the narrative are the recipes, which provide an ongoing description on the characters and their culture. This book has more spice than a pot of chile! Finally, there is the food itself that Tita creates as head cook on the family ranch, food so vibrant and sensual, infused with her feelings of longing, frustration, rebellion, or love. This book triggers all the senses and gives readers a newfound appreciation of real home-made cooking. The combination of all these elements, with a good measure of the supernatural thrown in, makes for an earthy, quirky book, sad and funny, passionate, and direct, told by Tita's grand-niece who follows in her footsteps, using her cookbook and continuing a tradition quite different from the one her great-grandmother tried to impose.The forbidden love between Tita and Pedro just makes for more of an exciting plot.

It is a novel centering on the protagonist, Tita and her struggles with her mother, Mama Elena. Their struggle represents the struggle between liberal ideas and traditional thinking. Tita, being the youngest daughter in the family must, according to family traditions, devote her whole life in caring for her mother. However, being in love with Pedro, Tita resents this tradition. When Pedro comes and askes Mama Elena for Tita's hand in marraige Mama Elena gives him, Rosaura, Tita's sister instead. Pedro agrees to this arrangement because it gives him the chance to be with Tita. However, this arrangement only adds to Tita's suffering, as you could imagine. Throughout the course of the novel Tita must come into terms with her own individuality and her love for Pedro and battle against Mama Elena's strict traditional beliefs and dominating ways.As hinted in the title, food is a major focus for the novel. Tita's world is based on food, and her life mostly takes place in the kitchen, where she was born and raised. Under Mama Elena's ruling, Tita cannot express herself. Food and cooking gives her the only chance to do so. This is where the magic realism comes into play. Food acts as a transmiter for Tita's emotions. Whoever eats her food will feel whatever she was feeling while preparing it.All in all, Like Water for Chocolate is a wonderful read. It is fast paced and generally simple to read and understand. I recommend it to mostly anyone, however, there are a lot of explicit scenes exchanged between Pedro and Tita, so anyone opposed to those sort of stuff should steer clear."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I recently read this book Like Water for Chocolate for my World Literature class and right off the bat remembered that I read it before. Like Water for Chocolate is a high school level book and that was about the time I initially read it. At first I did not find it interesting but it soon captured my attention. I enjoyed this novel about love, sex, war, and romance. It is a Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one. The story is of the Mexican history of a young woman who was in love, but couldn't get married because of the family tradition. There are 12 chapters and each time that a new chapter started, with a recipe, the explanation of how to cook it and the experience of the family. The youngest daughter, named Tita, couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. Tita was in love but the time was going on and the boy that she loved got married to her sister and stayed near because they were living in the same house. Her sister had a baby but sometimes Tita had to take care of the baby. She loved the baby because he was the son from the man that she loved. The changes that happened in the life of the people in this family make a very interesting story. It is enjoyable reading to see what happens with each sister . I think that it is very difficult to be living with the men you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic history and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love.

The book tells a tale of denied romance between two star-crossed people and the recipies that unite them metaphysically and spiritually. The descriptions in the book heighten the senses. It even has a classic protagonist and villain that most peope seem to enjoy in books. This is a recipe book, a story and a piece of Mexican culture. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a creative story intermixed with romance, sex, war and homemade recipes. When Tita De la Garza's hopes of marrying her one true love, Pedro, are crushed by her obligation to take care of her mother, Mama Elena, for the rest of her life, her heartfelt emotions become inbedded in the delicious meals she cooks for her family and friends. Everyone who eats her meals experiences the same love, anger or sorrow that Tita felt while cooking her meals. Tita's forbidden love with Pedro begins the many challenges the De la Garza family faces. Each separate character struggles to overcome the challenges and betrayls of marriage, the bindings of tradition, and the search for one's inner self. Each month presents a new, unpredictable story accompanied by a De la Garza family recipe for dinner, love, and common ailments such as burns and bad breath. Through each separate story and character, Esquivel effectibely conveys the importance of following one's heart in order to achieve happiness. Tita follows her mother's wishes rather than her own and remains despondent for the greater part of her life. Each character's personal struggle exemplifies the innermost desires and passions felt in all of us. The conquering of these struggles to reach our desires often comes from breaking traditions, breaking bonds, and breaking hearts. Esquivel uses clever fictious element sto exaggerate the feelings of each character, such as when Gertrudis, Tita's sister, rides off naked with a revolutionary soldier and doesn't return for years. her exaggerations allow the reader to experience the personal feelings of each character, observing their challenges and prediciong their dicisions. Esquivel's novel is simple and enjoyable to read. although it's a romance story filled with inrealistic events, predictin the outcome of Tita and Pedro's struggle for their love allows the reader to become involved in each character's life. The fiction elements, however incredible unrealistic, exaggerate the innermost feelings that each character experiences. the reader can actually feel the resentment and hatred that Tita has for Mama Elena, tha passion that Gertrudis feels when she runs away with her long awaited soldier and the torture Pedro endures while trying to stay close to Tita. the fact that Tita's guests experience her feelings through their food, adds a creative element to the novel. although it's highly improbable, Tita's feelings become magnigied since they are felt by numerous people rather than a single person. At the outset of Esquivel's novel, the Dela Garza's recipes and preparations seem out of place. But the further one reads into the book, it becomes apparent how important the recipes are and the creative touch they add. All feelings and events in Like Water for Chocolate are related to food. When Tita feels lonely, she relates her situation to the last pepper will remain untouched becuase no one wants to feel selfish, taking it for themselves. Like Water for Chocolate stresses the importance of following your heart and discovering your inner self. it's impossible to discover happiness if it's the happiness that someone else in life. Esquivel wrote about the importance of choosing your own paths, even if they aren't necessarily the best ones. It's unavoidable to discover the right choices in life without making wrong ones first. The surprising final chapter of Esquivel's novel brings a sense of conclusion to the problems that the characters deal with throughout the entire book. the closing chapter explicates the realization that in order to achieve happiness, traditions and hearts sometimes have to be broken. as a bystander to the character's lives, it's obvious which choices they should make to find the utmost happiness and resolution. But it was the anticipation of discovering which choices they would make for themselves that make the novel intriguing."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This is a story filled with the sort of simplicity and symbolism of legends and fairy tales. And, like water for making chocolate, it boils violently - with passion!In both book and movie, this is a tale of the tortures of repressed emotion. The youngest daughter of a cold, powerful, and autocratic mother, Tita learns (only after she has fallen in love!) that she is forbidden to marry because she is designated to care for her mother in her old age. Rejected as a baby by her mother, Tita grew up in the kitchen, nurtured by the loving cook. Blocked at every turn from acting on her emotions, Tita magically transmits her frustrated and repressed feelings through her food.The food is stunning and complex, and adds yet another level of sensuous symbolism. With either the book or the amazingly faithful movie, you will be swept into romantic allegory."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"In my all life I read many interesting books .The ends of those books were happy endings.

I already tried one. It was delicious."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate is a novel about a Mexican tradition long time ago in the Revolution time. It taught us how a bad tradition can destroy the life of the different characters from this story. Mama Elena is a strict and rude person but she had a reason to be like this because she had a hard childhood. I think her parents taught her strict rules in life, If Mama Elena had realized her love with Jose Trevino, she would not have been frustrated and she would have undestood Tita. Tita was a sweet girl but she was insecure and weak character because she did not fight for her love. She was a good cook and good person. Pedro was a weak man because he decided to get married to Rosaura than elope with Tita. Anyway all of characters of this story are very interesting and this novel teach us that never let leave the opportunity to be happy, life is one time ONLY."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a book that does the job of three stories in one - it is a fantasy, a recipe book, and a romance novel, all rolled up into one package. Quite unlike any novel I've read before, Like Water for Chocolate is a book that took some getting used to - I did not like the writing style at first. The format was strange, and the method of writing was somewhat confusing to follow. Esquival's narration skipped back and forth from recipe to present time to past - all without any warning or explanation. As I continued reading, it became easier for me to decipher the flow of time, but my confusion still lingered throughout the chapters.My biggest qualm about the novel was the month of December. Even after reading (and in some cases, re-reading parts of) the closing chapter, I am not sure if I fully understand the ending. However, I did enjoy reading this book, and if I were not a vegetarian, I would be tempted to try some of the recipes! Despite the organizational issues, the actual plot of the story was interesting and engaging. I found myself racing through each chapter, eager to learn what would happen next. The dynamic of star-crossed lovers who stay near each other by the man marrying the main character's sister is a dramatization I have never read before, and it was a fascinating twist. Overall, I would give Esquival's first novel three out of five stars... it was entertaining, but the confusing narration detracted from the storyline."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I originally picked up this book for an English paper. Its usually not a book I would pick up on my own. But to tell the truth I loved it!I could kind of relate to this book with my Mexican background. I say kind of because I was born here in the US while my parents were born in Mexico. And, of course, I hear my mom and aunts talking about their lives back in Mexico and how much they worked at such a young age.This book is full of tragedy, having that Tita, the youngest of the family, is forbidden to marry beacause of an old Mexican tradition. But you cant tell your heart what to do. And so she fell in love with Pedro. However, they cant ever be together. After multiple tragedies, and after 22 years they can finally be together. \\"Love never dies,\\" this book really showed that.But something I really liked was that at the beginning of every chapter there is a recipe. I thought that was cool :) This book was a really good story about an impossible love that, in the end, conquers all."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chooclate by Laura Esquivel peaked my intrest because of the many days that I sit in my study hall and watch my teacher's students study it. The story takes place on a ranch on the Mexican border in the 19th century. Mama Elena is the widowed mother of 3 daughters, Tita, Rosaura, Gertrudis. Tita, the youngest daughter is the main character of the story. Tita is oppressed by her mother and will be forever until her mother dies.This would be okay, if Tita wasn't in love with a young man named Pedro. Mama Elena refuses to let Tita marry Pedro, but instead allows him to marry Rosaura. Which he does to get closer to Tita. I don't want to give away most of the story, I will allow you to read it for yourself. Although I am not the type for love stories, Like Water For Chocolate stands out. It almost reminds me of one of my favorite books, House of Spirits. I believe that the writing styleof Like Water For Chocolate is what kept me reading. The way the story is structured, with the recipes and month by month calendar as the plot thickened. The book has it all, love, hate, drama, sex, pain. The reader feels all the emotions along with the characters. The combined affects of the writing style, magical realism and just the plot itself makes this book a good read. I recommend it for all readers."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I like a book that grabs me immediately, or by the end of the first chapter, so I struggled to get started, but once I got there, I was hooked."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"read this years ago before the movie came out. glad the movie did it justice. so happy you have it for the kindle!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This novel innovates in many ways. It is highly structured, each chapter being set in a given month. Each is introduced with a recipe for a dish that plays a role or another in the story's development. Though realistic overall, the plot sometimes snaps in the world of dreams with ghosts appearing or volcanoes erupting. All this creates a series of surprises and makes the book very enjoyable.In addition, set in early 20th century Mexico, it provides insights to the mentality and way of life that prevailed in the area at that time.The work is thus at once light and substantial and is warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"okk so the book itself is wonderful, but there is some higlighting done inside that is somewhat distracting but overall i loved the price and everything about this book"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I am shocked by the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. It's such a simple, yet beautiful and visual novel that I can't believe it doesn't resonate with all its readers. The text is written in a style called magical realism and even those who are not familiar with the genre or Gabriel Garcia Marquez will be able to access the exaggerated, fantastic elements and the metaphors that are rampant. The story itself is very simple- full of graphic passion, love, culture and family. It's set against the Mexican Revolution in the early 1900s on a Mexican ranch. I don't know too much about the war but it doesn't detract from the plot, as Esquivel paints such vivid pictures of her setting. The characters are traditional to magical realism stories (vague and often unlikable) and the bothersome ending is typical of this genre- usually there are no clear lessons. The beautiful thing about this book is it can reach all readers- it's either a love story about people and food or a much deeper romance fueled by metaphors."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"There is a great deal to like about this book. It is a wonderful story about how tradition collides with change. I particularly liked the aspects of magical realism that really help this book take off."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"What was so intriguing about the book when I first picked it up is that the cover reads (at least my edition of it) \\"a novel in monthly installments with recipes, romances, and home remedies\\". The plot revolves around the character Tita who is the youngest of three daughters. Due to this, her family tradition dictates that she must never marry but instead has to take care of her mother until her mother dies. Unfortunately, she falls in love with a boy named Pedro whom she knows she will never marry. In addition, she is her mother's least favorite daughter and the one on whom her mother takes out her anger. The only place that Tita can find solace is in the kitchen where the housekeeper (her surrogate mother) showers her in love and guidance in cooking. As Tita faces more tragedies (her sister marries Pedro, her mentor dies, etc.), she escapes through her cooking. Magically, when people eat her food they experience the emotions that she was feeling when she made the food. On nights when she is sad, everyone at the table begins weeping. Other nights she is filled with love and lust, and that is passed on to those who eat her food. At first, Tita doesn't understand her power but she soon is able to harness it and use it to speak for her when she is unable to speak for herself.My satisfaction with this book fluctuated. At times I found the recipes at the beginning of each chapter to be intriguing and endearing, while at others I thought they were annoying and kitschy. I thought that Tita's ability to affect others through her food was an excellent character trait and certainly carried me through the novel. However, there was no one in the novel that I actually liked and wasn't emotionally invested in the story or the characters. I think that it is worth reading because the technique is interesting and something that few others have tackled. However, I won't be re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This story is a wonderous romantic story between two young lovers but torn apart by the laws of tradition.

The mysterious happenings that occur to Tita (the main character) are the best parts, from her magic food and strange attachment to her sister-in-laws children. However, the book lacks feeling and surprise. The plot is predicatable, as are the characters. Another downfall is the deaths of the characters who need to be eliminated. This happens when it is needed most- an unrealistic convience. A book worth looking into if you're one for predictable Mexican soap-operas."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"&quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; became a huge partof my life when I first read it.

But I'm sorry to tell them that this is not and should NOT be taken as representative of good Latin American literature (much as there is). Unfortunately, the corny and bad movie had good timing, just when the &quot;latino&quot; exotism became hot. And there you have Americans and Europeans thinking this is a good product of Mexican culture, ignoring really good writers and philosophers who don't talk about corny (I have to use this word repeatedly, since it accurately portrays the book) &quot;erotic&quot; recipes. The plot is well known thanks to the movie. It reads like a bad imitation of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's style, without the mastery at writing. If you want to read a good mix of food and erotism, try for instance &quot;Under the jaguar sun&quot;, by Italo Calvino, a short story set in Oaxaca, Mexico. Or read good Latin American writers, not this fake and utterly failed exploitation of exotism for easy bucks."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Laura Esquirel has proven to be an exceptional writer after reading this book. This book is of nothing I have ever read before. Some of the scenes truely baffle me. For instance, at the beginning it says Tita, one of the main characters, was washed into the world by her own tears. The labor was brought on early becausae her mother was peeling onions in the kitchen which made her cry. Another aspect about this book is that at the beginning of each chapter it gives you a recipe. I have never even heard of the recipes in this book before. It tells you how to make each one at the beginning of each chapter which leads into the story. So basically this book is based on a kitchen and cooking with the lives of three daughters, a mother, and a cook and how love can hurt so much. If you like romance books I'm sure you are going to love Like Water for Chocolate."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Before I read this book, I had heard nothing but favorable reports of it. I was saddened upon reaching the end to find that such reviews of its quality had been very greatly exaggerated.Before I tear into the story itself, I should point out that my disgust with the novel is not completely the fault of the author; the translation by Christiensen and Christiensen was greatly at fault as well. Their use of English was clumsy and simple, and whenever they had the opportunity to use a cliche one can be sure that they took advantage of the chance to do so. Thanks to their inept attempt at translation the novel read more like a soap opera written by a sixth-grader than a masterpiece of narration.However, poor translation cannot excuse all of this novel's myriad faults. The integration of the recipes with the storyline detracted from the plot, and the injections of household advice seemed more like afterthoughts than anything that would flow out of a natural conversation. One almost gets the impression that Esquirel collected all the snippets of advice she could find for running a house and threw a simplistic plot over it all so that people would find the book interesting.There is also a dearth of likeable characters in the book. By the time I got to the final page there wasn't a single character I didn't want to throttle, as each and every person portrayed in the book demonstrated a fundamental lack of common sense. Pedro constantly acts like a vain chauvanist, considering only his needs and barely giving Tita any thought at all. He even rapes her at one point in the book, yet as the narrative puts it he &quot;throwing himself upon her, caused her to lose her virginity and learn of true love.&quot; (p158) Does this sound like true love? No.This brings me to the issue of feminism. First, I do not consider myself a feminist--I'm a typical middle-class white male literature major, hardly in a position to campaign for the issue. One of the praises I heard most frequently for this book was that it was a very feminist novel which encouraged the liberation of women. Indeed, reading some of these reviews I can see that it's a prevelant notion, whether the reviewer liked the novel or not. Unfortunately I cannot see how this could possibly encourage anything but feminine subservience--the female characters talk of nothing except men and who they'll marry, do nothing but meekly serve their husbands (or possibly Mama Elena), and Tita--the main protagonist, of all people!--spends her days in the kitchen cooking for the household and throwing herself at the feet of Pedro, whom nobody in their right mind could love.This book is the only novel I have ever thrown across the room in utter disgust. The beginning is weak, the plot is almost nonexistant, the ending throws women's liberation back by five decades, the recipes and other advice distract from the main narrative, and the portrayal of the characters is such that I was actually glad when each one met his or her respective end because it was one less annoyance. The translation was horrible, so it is possible this book comes across better in the original Spanish. Somehow, though, I sincerely doubt it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I could barely get through this book.

Nevertheless, it was good. I should probably start looking for these romance/recipe novels more often. The novel's basically a mythological story about the passionate Tita who, unable to marry the one she loves, expresses her passion through her food. There are some hilarious moments and some really romantic ones. And Tita's definitely a character worth falling in love with. She's one that will drive you crazy (if I were female, I would never go for Pedro, but that's just me), but that really just makes the novel better. This is definitely a great novel for a light afternoon read. And I'm going to try some of the recipes, too.

When reading it at first, it seemed like a good book-- definitely an easy read. As the book picks up, however, it becomes totally obvious that these women feel worthless without a man. All of the women's problems in the novel have to do with men or lack thereof. Tita is spineless as a protagonist, and Pedro is just as spineless as her love interest. Also, the novel is supposedly set in the Mexican Revolution, yet there are, at most, three or four references to this in the entire book. They say how there is starvation going on, yet Tita's family has enough food that she is constantly cooking.

Just when I thought it had hit rock bottom, it sunk a little lower. Yet, I kept praying that if the book had to be bad, at least it could be so bad its funny. Sadly, it didn't get there. It just left me depressed that the our expectations have sunk so low that a book this bad could be a bestseller.What was so horrible about this book? Mostly the characters were pathetic, and the supernatural elements came off like a cheesy plot device. I thought the relationship between the mother and daughter (the book is so bad the characters' names have left my head) could've been interesting, but it never developed. I couldn't see why what's-his-name was such a prize that the heroine had to pine over him. And the recipes didn't make the book more interesting, they distracted from the story.

The story is of Tita, the youngest of three daughters, who is raised at the side of the family's chef and therefore learns the art (and secrets) of good cooking. Tita falls in love with Pedro, a neighbor, but is forbidden from marrying him - family tradition holds that the youngest must never marry in order to care for her mother until she dies. In order to remain near Tita, Pedro marries Tita's older sister, Rosuara. Tita's emotions - her love, frustration, bitterness and joy - are literally shared through the food she prepares as the love she and Pedro share never dies.Each chapter begins with a recipe, the details of its preparation intertwined with a story related to Tita's quest to be united with Pedro. The connection between food - its textures, flavours, concoctions and ingredients - with love, sex, longing and passion work well and make for a sensual read, a device I really enjoyed. There is an element of the fantastic as well, as Esquivel freely and liberally exaggerates and plays with events and characters, much as a good cook improvises from the written recipe.A very enjoyable read - recommended."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Atmospheric, magical and sensual, Like Water for Chocolate is the story of Tita's loves and family on a ranch in Mexico.

I gave it back to her when we graduated from college, but I still wanted to read it, so I bought a copy. It didn't sit around for too long this time; I read it in a day.Tita grew up in the kitchen, surrounded by her love of food. She is overjoyed when she falls in love with a man, until she learns that as the youngest daughter, she is intended to stay home and take care of her mother - forever. This little book, which is told in twelve chapters, each a different month of the year, with a recipe for each one, is another endearing exercise in magical realism from a Latin American storyteller.The reader knows straight away that Tita will never be married. This gives the entire story a bittersweet feel; we know her relationships aren't going to succeed before they even happen. Regardless, I did find it charming. Tita is lovely and I grew to care for her very quickly. Her family is very peculiar and all members have strictly defined personalities. At first, it seems Mama Elena is a stereotypically horrible mother, but later on we learn that there is more to her story, too.The magical realism adds a special dimension to the story. I hadn't expected it going in to the book. As I've mentioned before, I read most books without knowing anything about them because I largely read from recommendations and generally avoid reviews or even reading the back cover. The supernatural aspects make it clear that this isn't real life, but they don't take away from the universal romantic experiences that Tita endures.The format is interesting. This book is certainly a novel, but the fact that it is split into twelve equal chapters means that it's easier to break down if you don't have much time to read. I haven't tried any of the recipes and I'm not sure that I will, particularly given that the instructions are spread throughout each chapter and are potentially hard to follow when in a hurry. If you were reading for a book club, however, it might be fun to have a small party around the book and have each member try a different recipe. At least, that's what I would do.I would recommend this book, I think; it's a light read, but at the same time heartfelt and moving."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"A delightful little book, Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate is almost a modern-day fairy tale. Told in monthly installments, the novel is simultaneously story and cookbook, filled with both recipes and home remedies and as well as the story of Tita, our heroine, who was born, raised and taught in the kitchen, and who has the amazing ability to cook her emotions into her marvelous recipes. Tita's story is one of longing, love and the need to be her own person; to escape the tyrannical presence of her mother and create her own life with the man she loves. It's a relatively fast read, but enjoyable all the same."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"If you enjoyed Allende's The House of the Spirits, then this is the right book for you! Much like Allende's novel, Like Water for Chocolate combines the ordinary and the supernatural in the portrayal of two young, Latino lovers living in the midst of civil war. However, Esquivel's work remains unique though her use of food in not only emphasizing her pride in the Mexican culture, but also in expressing the strong conflicting emotions that are deep within the hearts of the characters. Through the use of magical realism and the motif of food, Esquivel depicts a love story that explores the classic theme of what happens to a dream deterred.Every chapter of the novel begins with a recipe, which serves to accentuate how the life of a traditional Mexican family is centered on the kitchen. Thus it is no surprise that the main character is no other than the youngest daughter and head chef, Tita, who is characterized as a talented young girl whose spirit is constantly broken by her mother's incessant upbraiding. Tita's lifelong pain is symbolized through the motif of onions, which appear throughout the novel during times of deep sorrow and heavy weeping. Esquivel's use of food as a motif is further evidenced by Tita's culinary masterpieces--such as the rose dish that causes its consumers to be afflicted with erotic obsession. Overall, Esquivel's originality is derived from her ability to mix the elements of cooking, erotica, and the magical realism in creating a novel that demonstrates the consequences of emotional repression. I personally recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for a love story chock-full of Hispanic culture, garnished with elements of the supernatural."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Get ready to be engulfed in the mouth-watering aroma of delicious Mexican dishes and a tale of romance, mystique, and an all-consuming passion. Laura Esquivel's beautiful novel, Like Water for Chocolate, is a combination of simple prose and the charm of magic realism that makes it a delightful and fascinating read.The novel encompasses the life of Tita de la Garza, the third daughter of Elena, from her unusual birth to the spectacular event of her death. Intertwining with Tita's story are monthly recipes that are served during the course of her life and have had significant impacts on Tita and the people around her. The dominance of food throughout the novel is further embellished by Esquivel's use of magical realism. Taking a role itself, the appearance of food or the ingredients that are used to prepare food instigate a myriad of events in the story. Tita's birth is explained as being triggered by her cries within Elena's womb due to chopped onion, and the dishes that Tita prepares carry a magical power that could induce tears or passion once consumed, such as the \\"Chabela Wedding Cake\\" and \\"Quail in Rose Petal Sauce.\\"Thwarted of the chance to marry her only love, Pedro Muzquiz, Tita transfers her emotions into food and allows her cooking to express the concealed feelings she has for him. Just as strong as her passion is for food, Tita's and Pedro's ardor for each other surpasses all boundaries of time and familial obligations. The fierce passion of their love is so powerful that it magically ignites them at the final climactic moment of their joining, causing a great fire and ultimately concluding Tita's life.Overall, Like Water for Chocolate is a sumptuous and sensual tale that will evoke a sense of longing in the reader's heart and appetite."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Chocolate in the tummy, title or story improves the experience.This book is on my stack of all time favorites-some of the dramatic images will amuse you and stay with you-for years."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The characters in this book are in a trance when they eat--just like you will be as you read.

I knew that this was a story of romance, that somehow involved cooking, but knew nothing more. So it was much to my delight that the book turned out to be a complete revelation.The way Laura Esquivel describes Tita's love of Pedro and her passion for food, almost makes you want to grab the nearest man, and rush headfirst into the kitchen. And even though this book was originally published in Spanish, the language used in the English translation is rich and textured. You can feel the heat, hear the sounds of the kitchen, and smell the sauce bubbling on the stove, as our heroine (Tita) pours all her blood, sweat and tears into each dish.Like Water For Chocolate is tragically sweet, but incredibly satisfying. Tita's gentle strength resonates throughout the story. And instead of feeling sorry for her, you can only admire this young woman, who is doing the best she can, with the circumstances that she's been given.Zara Stevens (Author - Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories)Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Laura Esquivel's novel is much better when read in Spanish.

Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in a family living in Mexico. Through the twelve chapters, each is marked with monthly installments, and features different recipes each month. In each chapter we learn of Tita's struggle to pursue true love and claim her independence. The main episodes of each chapter generally involves the preparation or consumption of the dishes that these recipes yield. In the book, Tita's heart is broken by Pedro, the man she loves, when he is forbidden to marry Tita because she is destined to take care of her mother, but instead Pedro takes her sister's, Rosaura, hand in marriage. He later claims he does it to be close to Tita. They express their love and affection towards each other in secret. Meanwhile, Rosaura and Pedro give birth to two children, one in which dies when they are forced to move away after Mama Elena senses something between Tita and Pedro. After the return of Rosaura and Pedro to the family ranch to mourn Mama Elena's death, Tita's love for Pedro only grows.

However, his plan has major flaws, and slowly begins to take its toll. Even though events prevent Pedro and Tita getting close to one another, it is fate that steps in and brings them together. The novel is a wonderful example of 'magical realism', a genre that has particularly flourished in South America. Through the recipes preceding each chapter, we see and 'alchemical' reaction affecting all those who consume the given culinary delight. The food plays such an important part of Tita's development from a child to a woman and it is through cooking and her recipes that she is able to mature and deal with her emotions, which play an important part in her cooking and also throughout the book.

It's a love story that is set at the turn of the century in Piedras Negras a small town in Mexico. Esquivel has written a funny, raunchy and romantic tale, which was the best seller in Mexico for over a year. Tita was brought up with all the wonderful smell of home remedies and recipes from the kitchen. While growing up, she spent most of her time in the kitchen with her best friend Nacha the family maid, learning how to cook. Tita was inspired by the love she had for Pedro, and was able to show great strength when he agrees to marry her older sister Rosaura, because of Mama Elena's family traditions, and in order to be close to the one that he loved Tita. Tita is the youngest daughter of the De La Garza family, therefore she is unable to marry, as she is responsible to look after her mother until the day she dies. This was a family tradition that had not been broken, a tradition that Tita dose not agree with, but does she keep the family tradition going in respect for her mother? This book gives the reader a good example of what life was like in the twentieth century in Mexico. This book is written a little different to other novels as each chapter in written in monthly instalments.

It is an amazing book about family traditions, magic, and romance. One of the main traditions is that the youngest born girl has to take care of the mom until she dies. Well, in this book Tita was the youngest born girl who had to take care of Mama Elena. Mama Elena made Tita do everything. She learned how to cook and clean when she was very young. Everything she knew was because of her best friend, Nacha, who was the family's maid. The chapters in this book are organized by months, January through December, also every chapter has its own recipe. It tells you the ingredients and then how to make it. Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro. Pedro is also in love with Tita but can not marry her because of her having to take care of Mama Elena. Pedro loved Tita so much that he decided to marry her oldest sister, Rosaura, just so he could be close to her. Pedro would always compliment Tita on the way she cooked. Mama Elena did not like the way they would act toward each other so she sent Pedro and Rosaura to live in Texas. Tita hated her mother because of what she had done to her. This book is the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone that loves to laugh and read about romance. I am glad that we had to read it in my English class. I rate this book on a scale of one to five a five because of how different it is and it deals with a Mexican family's tradition. I also feel that this book is a lot better to understand it if you watch the movie after you read it. I feel everyone should read this book and watch the movie."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"...underlying &quot;erotic&quot; motives could not keep me interested throughout the whole book. I value author's creative writing style and I value this book as a good piece of magical realism, but....It lacks telling a truly interesting story. It is only interesting, if you want to know something about Mexican household life, told, again, from a MAGICAL perspective; otherwise, there is nothing &quot;magical&quot; about this book, otherwise, it is just that: a &quot;recipe book in monthly installments&quot;. Plus, endless cooking and recipes just irritated my stomach, so I did not find it romantic at all (as it is supposed to be). Then, again, TASTES DIFFER (no pan intended), but MAKE SURE that you either HAVE A FULL FRIDGE or that you are (luckily) skinny.

The recipes are NOT just thrown in- they represent life itself and the steps we must go through; however, life must be more than just &quot;going through the motions&quot;- to truely make these recipes invigorating to the tongue, Tita poured her soul in as well. Likewise, we need to jump into life and infuse our souls, or we are simply existing and not LIVING.

By using recipes and remedies, Esquivel is able to portray the life of young gilr in love, and the effects that her family had on her quest of marrying her true love.The only part of the book that would need work would be the theme development.

What drew me to this book was the title. What kept me reading it was the enticing manner in which it was written. This book has every thing any reader could ask for: a forbidden romance, an over-bearing mother, hidden secrets (some revealed at the very end, it should keep you reading!), and a sibling rivalry so strong only death could possibly end it. I loved the way Esquivel combined recipes and food with the story. I also liked the way she wrote the novel in &quot;monthly installments.&quot; When I reached December, I gave a little frown because I knew the story would be over soon, then gave a little smile, because that's where all the secrets and mysteries lie.

If Pedro truly loved Tita, he could surely have waited until Mama Elena was dead in order to marry Tita. After all, children do, as a rule, outlive their parents. Pedro comes across as an opportunist. He marries Rosaura because, as the eldest, she will inherit the ranch. Is it normal in Mexican society, for the groom to move in with the bride's family? If it is, then Pedro surely knew he would have it made -- possession of the ranch, as well as of Tita. It is interesting that he does not rape Tita until it looks like she might leave the ranch to marry another man. Then he shows his selfishness by ruining her chances of marriage, in a culture which surely prized virgin brides. There were two other aspects of the book which intrigued me. One was the comment, when Tita was raped by Pedro, that she had now discovered what love was all about. One may certainly draw one's own conclusions about love between men and women. The other was the description of Gertrudis having nymphomaniacal tendencies, and a sense of rhythm, because her natural father was mulatto. Would a North-American best-selling author have been able to get away with making that kind of racist allusion? One also wonders, is Trevino a very common name in Mexico, or was Sergeant Trevino Gertrudis' half-brother? One trusts she never had sex with him."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocalate was a very interesting story of forbidden love.

I also enjoyed the recipies and hope to try them."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"There was an important message to this story; how some traditions are ment to be passed on ( the mouth-watering recipies), and how some just have to fade away.

Who could read this and not ache for Tita and Pedro?"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"\\"Like water for chocolate\\" is not a voluminous novel, but it is memorable. Laura Esquivel managed to connect the magical realism (in an easy form, I admit, but nevertheless very reminiscent of Marquez, Allende or Llosa) with the style of tasty books by Peter Mayle (Provencal series) or Lily Prior (\\"La Cucina\\" - a class worse than \\"Like water for chocolate\\").The story of Tita, the youngest of the three daughters and therefore committed to the traditional Mexican fate of the spinster caring for her mother until the mother dies, is told in chapters, each of which starts with a recipe. Tita is fascinated by cooking and spends most of her time in the kitchen, and her culinary excellence causes Pedro to fall in love with her. The love is doomed, however, because of Tita's mother, who wants to execute her traditional right. The lives of all the sisters are depicted, their fates interchanging and seemingly improbable, but interwoven with Mexican history and elements of magic. This novel takes the reader and it is impossible to get out of its grip before it ends... And the exotic recipes, full of tasty ingredients and causing unexpected events - are, in addition, delicious."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Few times does an author create something completely unique; Laura Esquivel has accomplished just that. Her themes of passion, familial insubordination, dictatorial governance, and romance are not new to literature. But communicating those themes through family life on the ranch of northern Mexico using magical realism and monthly recipes as metaphors is truly pioneering.Tita is a suppressed daughter of Mama Elena, head of a Mexican ranch at the time of the Mexican Revolution. Tita was denied the consent of her mother to marry her true love, Pedro, who decided to wed Tita's older sister to be close to Tita. It is a recipe for disaster. What ensues is how Tita progresses and finds happiness under her mother's masterdom.Food becomes the central metaphor in Like Water for Chocolate, as a life sustainer and a passion stimulant. Tita expresses herself through the food she prepares, obtaining a degree of creativity and professionalism that is obtained only through generations of tradition; she becomes the family nurturer, feeding babies, the sickly and the healthy. Food is the way that this matriarchal Mexican ranch family sustains their culture and tradition.The political allegory is also significant, mapping what the key personalities are under a stifling dictatorship. Mama Elena maintains her power with the force of her own personality: personalismo. When that doesn't work, she cites tradition and \\"respectability.\\" The third line of power is fear and castigation. Past political dictators have used all of these leadership tactics to maintain their regency. All of the characters have interesting allegorical places: Rosaura the ideological conformist, is a weak personality who carries on the traditions set by her mother without realizing why she is doing them. Gertrudis plays the rebel and Pedro the selfish conformist. Pedro abides by his mother-in-law's rules but tries to maximize his own happiness without contributing to the happiness of others. Marrying the sister of the woman he loves is a solution of someone who cannot think outside the box. He only marries Rosaura because Mama Elena suggests it-the marriage is within the rules. If he were a true free-thinker, he would run away and liberate Tita at the beginning.By setting the novel against the Mexican Revolution, Esquivel shows how a family and a country can change its dogmatic and unproductive traditions. Just as the country overthrows its leadership, the De La Garza family overthrows Mama Elena and changes how it functions. The daughters of the De La Garza revolution decide just how they want to live after Mama Elena is gone.The magical realism in Like Water for Chocolate makes the novel fun to read. From seeing ghosts to Gertrudis bursting the shower into flames, the novel becomes more of a tall-tale than a historical novel. These magical phenomena accentuate the humanity of the characters-using the magical elements to put the characters in positions where their true emotions can be seen. Overall, magical realism is an excellent technique in a well-written book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This review refers to the Audio Cassette edition(Bantam Doubleday Dell) of \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\"....\\"Like Water For Chocolate\\" by Laura Esquivel, is a delicious romantic fantasy that will leave you ravenous for both more of the story and for some traditional Mexican dishes as well. The author cleverly interweaves the recipes and the loving preparation used, that mark the holidays, the significant moments and the passing of time in the life of the De La Garza family, in particular the love of two star-crossed lovers Tita and Pedro.Tita is the youngest of three sisters. It is the family tradition that the youngest daughter has the duty to care for her mother until she dies. Tita may never marry or strike out on her own until this day. In Tita's case, this presents double trouble. First, her mother, Mama Elena, is not the most pleasant person to care for. She is a tough task master, and will not stray from this tradition in the least. It also means that Tita may never be united with Pedro, the man she shares a deep and passionate love with.Yareli Arizmendi's reading is spellbinding. You can almost taste and smell the delights coming from Tita's kitchen as we follow her through the years, and she becomes the all important head chef for the family. The recipes themselves seem to hold the secrets of life and love in this wonderful journey through Tita's life and dreams.This audio edition(ISBN 0-553-47255-0) is an abridgement(approved by the author) and runs about a little over 5 hours. (four 2 sided tapes). I could not find an unabridged version, but I must say that I enjoyed this one immensely. The tapes are a good quality, the recordings are very clear.The story is magical. It's like a beautiful and more adult update of \\"Cinderella\\"....Enjoy...Laurie"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate combines a mystical tale of family legend and lost love with intriguing recipes and stories of Tita's life and love. Laura Esquivel tells the story of Tita through the narrator, Tita's great-niece, and by choosing to divide the chapters into monthly increments, each with a recipe that corresponds to that chapter, she created a book that was not only easy to read, but very hard to put down. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys tales of family, love, growing up, and learning to be your own person while still remaining a part of your past and your heritage. The book was very entertaining and both avid readers and the inexperienced, young and old, male and female would find it a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The writer takes you into a both harsh and warm family life in Mexico with restrictions upon females and secret relationships,the literature first appears as exagerated,but then persuades the reader with the whole idea just to accept that some people have once believed that,say,the youngest daughter of a family should never marry and take care of her mother until her death.The way the book ends,is unexpectable and charming.onthewhole if you're looking for a book with new ideas and lifestyles I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This novel brought forth an odd perspective of the affect food and family can have on all of our lives.

Tita's cooking is so powerful it affects the emotions of all the people who eat it. The love triangle between Tita, Pedro, and her sister kept me flipping each page rapidly.

Basically its about Tita-the youngest daughter of three. Who by family tradition is forced to take care of her mother (mama Elena) until she has die, and forget her true love (Pedro). Pedro then marries Tita's oldest sister (Rosaura) so that he can be next to Tita. The only thing that keeps her strong is her talent. She was born with the talent for cooking. Which is one of the reasons why every chapter starts off with a recipe. She based all her emotions in her cooking.The one thing I disliked about this novel would have to be how it goes on and on about the recipes. I like how every chapter starts off with a recipe, but maybe if it was a little shorter I would read the whole thing through. Most of the time I would just read the first sentences and then just skip to the rest of the chapter. Another thing I disliked would be the Rosaura, she plays the character of Tita's sister. She's so greedy, she knows that Tita loves pedro and still she decides to marry him. Not even thinking how her sister feels.The character that made me want to keep reading this book and that caught my eye was Tita. Despite her family tradition and knowing that she would probably never marry, she still remained strong. Also when she wasn't taking of her mom she would spend most of the time in the kitchen. She devoted herself to the kitchen. She struggled a lot with her mom but it all turned out for the best at the end.

But all in all it is a great book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Admittedly, I have a big gushy soft spot for magic-realism. Books like &#34;100 Years of Solitude&#34; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and &#34;House of the Spirits&#34; by Isabel Allende really spark that little fire in my heart. I thought this book would be another little treasure to add to this list, but alas...There are a few issues to blame for this. First of all, Esquivel's writing is just average, which cannot be blamed on a loss of finesse during English translation. The prose is lacking poetry, the fantastical scenes seem forced and scripted, and the characters are one-dimensional, even stereotypical. Not even the protagonist, Tita, is very likeable - she comes across as slow, submissive, and naive. When she is forced to cook for the wedding of her immature and needy love, Pedro, to her terrible and nasty sister, she goes crazy and has to be sent away to the care of Dr. Brown, who nurtures her back to health. Dr. Brown genuinely cares for Tita and even asks her hand in marriage. Of course Tita can't seem to get over childish Pedro, and ends up returning to her subservient life with her evil mother and sister.Which leads me to the next issue - the feminist praise for this book is has me a bit perplexed. The message seems to be that, as a female, I am to escape martyrdom by killing all evil female adversaries with my cooking, thus freeing myself from their tyranny (like Tita). Or, conversely, I should ride off naked on a horse while humping the man who is capturing me, then proceed to become a soldier (or better yet - a General!) and travel the world living a bloody and violent life (like Tita's sister). There is something appealing about both of these options - sweet sweet revenge, or complete badass rebel. By the end of the story I was excited for Tita - she had defeated her foes, ascended up the ranks of her household, and seemed to be maturing. At one point I even exclaimed &#34;She's going to marry Dr. Brown!&#34; and rejoiced for her triumph. But alas... the most brutal disappointment, she chooses Pedro. Seriously?The magical scenes did float my boat a bit, with their sexy eroticism and imaginative far-fetched weirdness. Many of the scenes were rich in detail and the tastes and aromas of the culture and the land. Perhaps some of my positive sentiment is overflow from my love of other, better, magical realism books. The recipes were an interesting addition, and I'd love to cook one or two of them. Overall, if you are new to this genre, I do not recommend starting with this book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Good book but a little far fetched...

I enjoyed reading about Tita and her struggles with her family. Tita is the youngest of three daughters and by tradition is forbiden to marry. She is supposed to take care of her mother until she dies. The magical realism of this book keeps you wanting to know more. I personaly don't enjoy reading very much and I found my self taking the time to sit down and read whenever I had a chance, because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Some of the things that happen in the book are a bit farfetched, but that is what keeps the book interesting.

I read this book in my senior English class and thought it was definitely a one-of-a-kind book! There is no other book like it! Esquivel adds romance and supernatural splendor to her own native culture and creates a new sensational book.This book is about a young Hispanic girl named Tita who is in love with a boy named Pedro. Her widowed mother is very strict about their cultural customs. She forbids her daughter Tita from getting married. In Mexico, the youngest daughter has to stay and take care of her mother until the day the mother dies. Tita's trials and tribulations include baking her sister's wedding cake and watching the love of her life, Pedro, and her older sister living a life together.

In my English class I was assigned to read a book for a lit. circle. I chose &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot;. I really enjoyed this book and loved the magical realism the author chose to use in this book. I thought that for the most part the book was well written. The only part that I didn't like was how the author didn't make it clear whether you had just read about one year, or 30 years. Over-all I thought it was an excellent book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to use their imagination. However this book is mostly for females."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate is a story written from the perspective of the main character, Tita's, grand-neice. It is a fairly well written story filled with many magical-realism scenes. For example one classic example is when one of Tita's sisters, Gertrudis takes a shower and because of the extreme heat of her body the shower shed actually catches on fire. Unfortuneately I found the book to drag on in some spots, but overall it was fairly interesting idea for the story.

An old fashioned, un- put downable page turner, and must read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Majority of the books I have read in High School was either boring or too long in length. &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; caught my attention with romance, passion, and excitement. It's a Mexican love story involving traditional family cooking recipes which is used symbolically for love. Pedro and Tita were deeply in love but struggles to make it come true. Interference from an evil mother who did not approve their marriage kept a distance between them. Pedro decides to marry Titas sister in order to stay close to Tita. With mother under suspicion of their secret love, Tita and Pedro do not suceed in revealing their love until the end of the story. I expected this book to be boring but I was impressed by it because I voluntarily finished the book. Love is presented in many ways in this story which played a big role in making this a great book to read. I recommend this book to High School teachers to let their students read this book instead of giving them books like, &quot;Brave New World&quot; which will not get their full attention."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"My name is Claudia Lieva and I had read the book \\"Like Water For Chocolate in Mrs.Lenhardt class. The book of water for chocolate to me was a well writing, because was a book that had fun went you read Ed and the characters were good they were the kind of people from long time ago, but still the book is very interesting and it give you a reason to read it. I red it because is not a book like the others authors the reason that I red it was because the family were so different. The family from today they are so hard to understand because now we don't even see that, like Mama Elena saying that the last daughter is not going to get marry because she has to take care of her into she died, to me was so bad because in my family I am the last daughter and I wouldn't like to hear my mom saying that I has to take care of her until she died.The family has to be together always and the mother was not a good mother and Tita was the kind of daugther that always was listened to her mother, so she didn't have no life."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"In my 12th grade English class we had to read Like Water For Chocolate. It is an amazing book about family traditions, magic, and romance. One of the main traditions is that the youngest born girl has to take care of the mom until she dies. Well, in this book Tita was the youngest born girl who had to take care of Mama Elena. Mama Elena made Tita do everything. She learned how to cook and clean when she was very young. Everything she knew was because of her best friend, Nacha, who was the family's maid. The chapters in this book are organized by months, January through December, also every chapter has its own recipe. It tells you the ingredients and then how to make it. Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro. Pedro is also in love with Tita but can not marry her because of her having to take care of Mama Elena. Pedro loved Tita so much that he decided to marry her oldest sister, Rosaura, just so he could be close to her. Pedro would always compliment Tita on the way she cooked. Mama Elena did not like the way they would act toward each other so she sent Pedro and Rosaura to live in Texas. Tita hated her mother because of what she had done to her. This book is the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone that loves to laugh and read about romance. I am glad that we had to read it in my English class. I rate this book on a scale of one to five a five because of how different it is and it deals with a Mexican family's tradition. I also feel that this book is a lot better to understand it if you watch the movie after you read it. I feel everyone should read this book and watch the movie."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I recently read this for my Modren Lit class. This book is a middle school to a high school level. Some people might think that this book is for girl. I think it is for both man and woman because man can learn how to cook.For woman they can get recipes.In the book there is a close relationship between Tian and Nacha the cook. There relationship is like mother and daughter. There relationship is so close because Tita was born in the kitchen. Tita spend all the time in the kitchen. That is why Tita and Nacha had a close relationship.Also in the book there is a tradition that mother makes her follow. That tradition goes that the youngest chidren has to take care of there mother intel she dies.

I don't know why the mother would force her youngest daughter to take care of her. Why must the young female be punished for being the youngest? Why must she be turned into a slave and have her life ruined just to take care of her ungrateful mother? The mother who ruined three lives, Tita, Pedro, and Rosaura. Mama Elena ruined Tita's life just because she was the youngest. She had to cook, clean, give her baths, and do whatever she said. Also by not letting her marry Pedro the love of her life. Pedro's life was ruined because even though he loved Tita he married her sister, Rosaura, just to be close to Tita. Mama Elena ruined Rosaura's life by forcing her to marry Pedro who she knew did not love her. That caused Rosaura great pain because she knew that the one he loved was Tita. I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to everyone who wants to have a good laugh with Tita's recipes and her wacky sisters who are very unique.

This novel is simply a fiesta of voluptuousity, engaging the senses and sense memories in the finest Proustian manner. Esquivel is a potent stylist whose characters drawn from life, wondrously push the bounds of credulity, redefining not only those boundaries, but life itself.

The daughter intended to protest the mother's ruling. Also the beginning of the story was wonderful especially showing strong love between the daughter and her lover.The negative thing is the author uses a lot of imagination at the end of the story and it's impossible to believe it is real. Maybe she preferred to do that for reason to show the readers how a big love ends with a big sacrifice from the daughter.In general, all characters of the story played a good role.

It is meant to be read, as if in a book club, in monthly installments as she offers recipes for home-cooked meals in old Spanish style, as well as home remedies. Esquivel has written a jewel of a novel. It is deeply aesthetic, romantic, melancholic, well written, poetic. Esquivel's novel is essentially about the pleasure and pain of love, the exquisite feast of blissful emotions when two people are as much in love as Pedro and Tita. But there is also the pain of parting, the unfulfillable romance that is forced to be kept a secret due to the tightly constructed society rules and expectations. In a sense, it is very European in that respect, at times similar to something that Henry James would have written and set in England or France and not a turn of the century Mexican town.Tita De La Graza comes from a distinguished and well-known family, of a widowed mother who cherishes her daughters. Since Tita is the youngest, she must accept her tragic fate and not marry in order to take care of her aging mother. Rosaura, the eldest daughter, joyfully accepts Pedro's proposal of marriage. But Pedro hides a secret. He is in love with Tita. A hopeless and forbidden romance ensues. But it is not long before Tita's mother discovers the love affair. Scandal erupts and in the midst of all the romantic storm, Tita and Pedro declare their undying love and care less about the uptight Spanish Catholic society surrounding them.As good romantic fiction as it is a recipe book, Laura Esquivel is sure to delight readers of all backgrounds, not just Mexican, provided they are lovers of love, hopeless romantics and have an apetite for love. As always, the central symbol of love is chocolate, long favored as an aphrodisiac, and the comparison between falling in love and tasting good, rich food in a sumptuous feast. This book is a must have for readers of romance novels with literary strength. Look also for the 1992 film."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book, Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel, was so out of this world, it was like nothing I have ever read before. I could not think of anything I read to possibly compare it to. It is a story that will be loved by all because it has something for everyone. It is a fantasy fairy-tale, a soap opera, and a Mexican cookbook all rolled into this one piece of literature. You really don't know what to expect next because it's so unpredictable. It will make you laugh and cry and even wonder about the tales told. It was so rich in detail and the description the author uses appeals to the sense of taste, which is rare in other books because they usually describe sight, sound and touch. But not this book. It was very bizarre because it was a new culture to me and the way the author described the food and preparation and taste was exotic. The way the main characters were portrayed was very intimate, and you could almost get inside their heads and feel their feelings and desires.The formant of this book it set up in such a unique way. There are 12 chapters, one for each month in a year and before the chapter starts there is an ingredient list for a new dish for that month. At the beginning of every chapter it goes into detail about how to prepare this new and sinfully delicious dish. It made the book a little more interesting and adding a little \\"flavor\\" if you will.This is story of a young girl named Tita, at the turn of the century in Mexico, who is struggling with her love of a man named Pedro and the hate of her strict, cruel, unloving mother, Mama Elena, who treats poor Tita like a slave in her own house. The way Mama Elena is described is like the typical evil step mom in Cinderella, though she is her real mother, and you feel hatred towards her for being so cold. It's almost as if she has no feelings at all, which has a significant twist at the ending. Tita suffers through the normal things a teenage girl would go through, but also so many things that are difficult that people should not have to go through in their lifetime. Like when Tita's evil mother forbids Tita to marry her love, Pedro, and instead has Tita's older sister, Rosaura, marry Pedro. Tita's relationship with Rosaura is pretty much nonexistent from that point on which creates a lot of drama later on in the story. And if it couldn't get any worse, Tita is forced to prepare the wedding cake and attend the ceremony without shedding one tear, under Mama Elena's merciless orders And what's even more painful for Tita is that Pedro and Rosaura live in the same house as Tita, which is unbearable for her to see them together. However, not all is lost for Tita's love life. There is a point in the story when Tita must choose between two of her lovers that will decide the rest of her life. Tita even suffers the death of loved ones, which leaves empty holes and scars in her heart. A lot of conflict happens in the story, which keeps it fresh and alive, and never boring or dull. It has everything: love, hate, desire, death, marriage, cooking, grief, and joy. It was just full of raw emotions.There is so much hate, and yet so much love between all the characters. Tita is madly in love with Pedro and feels comfort in her sister Gertrudis, yet feels hate and anger towards Mama Elena and Rosaura. All these mixed feelings that Tita feels, she puts into her cooking because she spends almost all of her time creating meals and recipes in the kitchen. Whatever she feels while making a dish, whoever eats it is enchanted by it and the mood that Tita is in is the mood of the eaters. It's so strange how the author created mysticism and spells through the food Tita makes. You can't help but wonder whether this could really happen because it just seems so realistic, though it's all fantasy. I was even tempted to try one of the recipes myself that were given in the book. Especially Cream Fritters (in the month of October) because the way Gertrudis loves them so much made me want to taste them. The whole plot is based around Tita's cooking and how it affects her and the people around her. Her dish called Quail in rose petal sauce completely turns her sister Gertrudis's life around.Women and girls would like this book especially because the main character is a girl. It gets inside her head and tells her thoughts, which we could all relate to. Like all the anger she feels inside that Mama Elena has caused, I'm sure all the readers are feeling the same thing as they get deeper and deeper into her character.But people of all age and gender should read this book, not just women because as I said before, there really is something for everyone. Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop because with every page you pick deeper and deeper into the plot of the story. It never, at any point, drags on and on like epic novels, so this book is a quick read, but well worth it. It's a new kind of book, one like you've never read before. It's unique and thought provoking and you will enjoy it because I know I did."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The book Like Water For Chocolate by Laura Esquivel was a very interesting book.

This struggling young girl named Tita who is living with her very strict, loveless mother and two older sisters has to serve her mother until she dies, because Tita was born the youngest and as the family tradition goes, the youngest must serve her mother. Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro, but cannot have him, since she was born to serve her mother. When Pedro marries her sister in an attempt to stay close to her, jealousy erupts. The only way for Tita and Pedro to share their love with each other without her mother, Mama Elena, or her sister, Rosaura catching them, is through Tita's cooking. Through Tita's food, she can carry feelings of love, sickness, and lust to the person who eats it. The whole story is how Tita and Pedro struggle to be together; and do they end up together at the end, well that is for you to decide after you've finished reading this book. This book is so in touch with your senses, especially with taste and smell. It's not only a tale of struggling love, but its a fantasy and cookbook, all in one. It shows so much insight into the Mexican culture and shows how love can bring two people together no matter how hard it is to get there. Through it all, you will come out of this book laughing, crying, and yearning for more. To think that cooking can be used as a link of communication between two young lovers, torn between the cold heart of a mother is amazing. But also to think that Tita, this girl who got overflowed with emotions and mixed feelings at so young could make it through, well that makes this story all the more inspiring. This book is good for people from all different genres, whether it is cooking you like, fantasy, love, or adventure, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I have read many books, but none of them come to being as good as this one.

The story is about a young girl named Tita De La Garza who is the youngest daughter of an all girl family, and because of this she has to keep the cruel family tradition, of looking after her mother, until the day she dies. Because of this tradition Tita is unable to marry her only true love Pedro.

Each chapter of the novel begins with a recipe explaining how it is prepared and the ingredients which are included. There was always an ingredient added that would introduce a different emotion into one of the characters and to the reader. Personally I quite enjoyed Laura Esquivel's book. Although in some places it became a bit confusing, I was still able pick up the story line. It was exciting and always kept me wanting to read on and find out what was going to happen next. I recommend that anyone reads this book, especially those around the age of 16 and those who like stories beyond reality.

It is full of rivalry, death, birth, marriage, and forgiveness. However, the main part of the story is based around justice, cultural traditions and forbidden love. The novel contains genres such as recipes, which start of each chapter, and the story is told through the eyes of Tita's niece's daughter. It is a story which contains real life events, average people, and real emotions. The story is set in Mexico, during the early 20th century, during the revolution. The main character, Tita, is daughter to a dead father and cruel, dominating mother, and sister to an unloyal sister and passionate, free-spirited woman. Tita was the youngest of 3 girls, and so it was her destiny to care for her mother until she died. When Tita fell victim to a forbidden love, she was forced to resist all temptations, as she could never marry. Tita had to watch her older sister, Rosaura, marry her own true love, Pedro. Tita was devastated by this, but was reassured by Pedro that he only married her sister to be closer to her, and his marriage to Rosaura was loveless. As Tita persisted to resist Pedro, she developed a great deal of emotions that could never be expressed. As a result, these emotions went into the food that she cooked. Tita had many obstacles in her life which seemed impossible to overcome. This novel contains many metaphors. It is cleverly written, and holds many creative thoughts, and well described emotions."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like water for chocolate is truly a book that has a big effect on the reader. No matter who you are, you will be moved by the rollercoaster of emotions that is this story. Set in Mexico at the turn of the century, this book brings people's old fashioned traditions and beleifs back to life. At times it causes the reader to cry, other times it causes frustation, but always keeps you wondering what will happen next. Like water for chocolate is the story of a girl in mexico at the turn of the century who lives with her widowed mother and two sisters. Tita is the youngest of the three so she is expected to remain by her mothers side and care for her. Complication arrises when Tita fall in love with Pedro and he asks her to marry him. Tita's mother denies him the opportuntity and offers him her oldest daughter Rosaura. He agrees in order to remain colse to Tita, however, Tita is not aware of this and suffers because of what she thinks is Pedro's betrayal. This book is filled with strong emotions that are triggered by different recipes. Everytime Tita feels a certain way she cooks a new recipe to go with her mood and whoever eats it is overcome by her emotions that go into her cooking. I really like the way this book is structured. Every chapter there is a new recipe and every chapter a new emotion is introduced to the reader. In addition to the interesting structure there is a wonderfull plot about womens' supposed inferiority next to men. Besides being a love story, it's a story of triumph. It's about a women who overcomes the barriers that are put in her way in order to be with the person she loves. Eventhough the book doesn't end halfway through their life and they don't live &quot;happily ever after&quot;, this makes it truer to life. However, eventhough this ending is hackneyed we still crave it and are disapointed when we don't get the happy ending we want. I know I was dissapointed with the ending of the book. Eventhough thats the way life really is we don't want to see it because it makes us reflect on our life. This book had a little of everything and it took us through a lot of situations which are unimaginable. It taught me that even a person might be thought to be inferior or not as worthy they can still make a difference. Women can still fight for what they want and obtain it. This book happens to be fiction but just because it isn't true that doesn't mean it didn't happen. We had and still have a lot of discrimination in our world and as a women it's good to read books that encourage women to learn that they can fight against what they don't think is fair wether its in the year 1900 or the year 2000."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Tita, the third daughter of Mama Elena, is born in the kitchen.

Esquivel wants people to realize that some things should come before out-dated traditions. Anyone who reads this book will identify with it, because everyone is or has been on that search for a true love. Of Pedro's search for true love, he whispers this to Tita at his wedding with Tita's sister. &quot;I'm sure I will be (very happy), since through this marriage I have gained what I really wanted; the chance to be near to you, the woman I really love . . .&quot;(38). However ironic and twisted, his love is true.Not only does Esquivel use traditional Mexican recipes to heighten the cultural atmosphere of the novel, she also uses magical realism. The magical realism weaves bits of culture into the novel, and also gives the reader a sense that anything wonderful and magical could really happen. After eating Tita's &quot;Quail in Rose Petal Sauce,&quot; a strange feeling comes over the family. Gertrudis, Tita's sister, is especially affected. &quot;The day they had quail, she had asked Tita to do the washing up for her. Gertrudis was really stricken; her whole body was dripping with sweat. Her sweat was pink, and it smelled like roses, a lovely strong smell&quot;(53). One realizes that nothing this bizarre or remarkable could really come over Gertrudis after she ate quail. Yet, that it did happen in this enchanting, Mexican world makes the novel more enjoyable to the reader.

Tita is tortured by her sister's decision to marry her one true love and by her demanding mother. Will she ever be free from her mother's totalitarian rule or will she have to keep her undying love and happiness a secret for life?This book was very moving and easy to get through. It comes with a recipe for every month; however, I thought the recipe's put the intensity of the book on hold for way too long. I found myself skipping over them, only interested in what was happening with Tita and her struggles for genuine happiness. The ending of the book was a bit dragged on and then suddenly it was over. Overall, this book was a great romantic, passionate, love story that shows how life offers many obstacles to experience and happiness is given to those who work hard for it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"A deceptively simple story that gets more and more powerful chapter by chapter, but ultimately suffers from lack of focus and direction. It was disappointing to settle for the ending in the book when I expected Tita to find a deeper and more meaningful solution to her problem than what she came up with.I cared greatly for Tita, her sisters (even Rosaura), and John. However, Pedro is a shallow character with no courage whatsoever. Why in the world would Tita, a woman of such depth and emotion, choose this vapid shadow of boy who absolutely never becomes a man? A woman who can influence people's emotions through food, have contact with the spirit world and face her dead mother's evil spirit has no need for Pedro! I can't see where Pedro has any sense of honor, or depth of love. He only has needs.All the themes of the book (John's influence, the effects of the food, the intrusion of the revolution, forbidden love, domineering customs and family) are wonderfully introduced but remain undeveloped. We are tantalized with the unspoken hint that Tita's kitchen skills helped her mother and Rosaura along their journey into the light...This could have been a much better book!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"There are all these awful reviews posted here about this book but its really not that bad. Is this book classic literature? To me, its not. It reads like a trashy romance novel instead of an AP Literature assignment. Is that a good thing? Its good in a sense that its an easy read but not so great when you&iexcl;re trying to find stylistic reading devices. I thought this book was too childish. The love triangle between Tita, Pedro and Rosaura was heart wrenching at first but then it became increasingly annoying. Tita is written to be such a sympathetic character, she is almost pathetic. Rosaura is written to be such a gross character, I almost feel sorry for her. And as for Pedro, he doesn&iexcl;t deserve either of them. Laura Esquivel writes Pedro as this wonderfully amazing guy that everyone should adore but quite frankly, he is a bit of a jerk. Tita&iexcl;s only real happiness, in my opinion, was with the doctor, John Brown but Pedro spoils it for her. These people are all petty, annoying and the scenarios are ridiculous. As the characters die one by one, you almost go &iexcl;good riddance.&iexcl;I don&iexcl;t hate this book. I thought it was okay. Not worth buying because I don&iexcl;t think its something you would want to read again and again but worth renting for some casual bedtime literature."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I will have to admit that I could not put the book down at first.

Otherwise, I would look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate is a clever little fairy tale about Tita, who was told by her mother during her adolescent years:\\"If he intends to as for your hand, tell him not to bother. He'll be wasting his time and mine too. You know perfectly well that being the youngest daughter means you have to take care of me until the day I die.\\"And so instead of wedding Tita, Pedro marries her elder sister Rosaura, while Tita care for her mother and family devoting her life to cooking. Maria Elena, Tita's mother clearly fits the role of evil step-mother, but is also representative for the tyrannical, authoritative adult it squelches the adolescent dreams.The book is lovely to read and I appreciated the organization of the books with chapters by the month of the year, each starting out with a recipe and story about the food. For foodies it is an entertaining read:\\"To get that number of eggs together, they preserved all the eggs laid by the best hens for several weeks. This preserving technique had been employed on the ranch since time immemorial to ensure a supply of this nourishing and indispensable food throughout the winter. The best time to preserve eggs is August or September. The eggs must be very fresh. Nacha preferred to use only eggs laid the same day. The eggs are placed in a cask containing sheep fodder, allowed to cool and then covered completely.\\"The magical realism style at times seems extreme, with chicken tornadoes and miraculous food and other such amazing feats.

New York, United State: Doubleday. 1992. 245 pages.The book Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel is about the universal topic of women's role in society. The topic was not stated directly in the book but was hidden in between the lines. Esquivel's reason for writing the book is to express her opinion of women's role in society and how women should also have the same freedom as men.A literary technique that Laura uses in the book is magical realism. She uses it to emphasize her main points regarding women's role. For example, in the beginning of the book, the narrator talks about how Tita, the main character, was born in a \\"wave of tears.\\" From then on, Tita knew her life would be full of sadness since tradition prohibits her from marrying. Esquivel uses magical realism to illustrate how society makes Tita's life sad. If Tita breaks tradition, society will look down on her. Magical realism is a great way to convince readers because it is meant to emphasize important themes in the book. Also, it shows people which parts of the story are worth analyzing.Another aspect worth praising about Like Water for Chocolate is how Laura Esquivel organizes the book. There are twelve chapters in the book representing the twelve months of the year. In each month Laura Esquivel introduces an authentic Mexican recipe and teaches readers how to prepare it. The reason the chapters are organized this way is to tell the audience how important cooking is to Tita. Moreover, it shows how Tita's role in society is confined to the kitchen, a traditional women domain in pre-revolutionary Mexico.Women's role in society is a topic written in many books. Therefore, this does not make the book Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel that unique. However, I would recommend this book to people who like reading romance novels because the book is full of drama regarding lost love, prohibited love, and unrequited love. Additionally, the techniques Laura Esquivel uses like magical realism makes the book very amusing, interesting, and new to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Shipped to me right away, only had to wait 5 days instead of the max of 14.

As someone that loves to cook and spends a lot of time in the kitchen, I would love to have Tita's gift. Can you imagine having your emotions come through in the food you cook? This aspect alone made the book unique.The romance/love triangle storyline did have kind of a soap opera feel to it, but was still interesting. It is in no way your typical love story. I know that the book is set in a different time and a different place, but the love story was a bit awkward. I had a lot of trouble liking Pedro even though his intentions were spelled out to us.

Tita was in love but the time was going on and the boy that she loved got married to her sister and stayed near because they were living in the same house. Her sister had a baby but sometimes Tita had to take care of the baby. She loved the baby because he was the son from the man that she loved. The changes that happened in the life of the people in this family make a very interesting story. It is enjoyable reading to see what happens with each sister . I think that it is very difficult to be living with the men you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic history and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love. The ending has a surprise that may not please the reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a soap opera type novel filled with love and above all- cooking. Although the storyline is interesting and one of suspense the novel lacks a deeper meaning. Tita, the main character, spends her whole life longing for love. However, when it knocks on her door she refuses. Thus, the vicious cycle of longing and waiting repeats itself. Instead of supporting the main character, feelings of irritation are stirred in the reader by Tita's inability to win the man of her dreams. Like water for Chocolate is a good beach book but that is the only place you should take this novel. For my fellow AP English students, I would not recommend this novel. It lacks the more serious themes and it leaves little to interpret. Nevertheless, Like Water for Chocolate is your best bet for an entertaining book to read with a tragic love story in the revolutionary Mexico."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book tells the story of a girl named Tita. Tita loves to cook, and the book is in monthly installments with recipes interspersed with the story of her life. Her boyfriend, Pedro, is set up to be married to her sister. Tita's mother won't let her get married because it is her destiny to take care of her mother until she dies, as she is the youngest girl, and that is the family tradition. The book follows her life - from when her sister Gertrudis ran away, to when Tita fell in love again. This bittersweet tale of love and loss is a short, easy book, and fun to read.This book was good, overall, but at times, confusing. For example, you can't tell how many years there are between chapters. The chapters are monthly, so I thought that a month had passed when, really, it had been three years! Also, at times, it seems like the book is trying too hard...like the ending. The ending was a tad bit weird."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I rate this book out of five, a four. The book compels a high density of rising and falling emotions. Many similes and metaphors explain these emotions while comparing them to food or different objects refering to how they feel. The book made me feel interested as each chapter or month passed. I gave it a five, but then changed my mind and gave it a four. The ending didn't tell me anything. I felt the author could've come up with something else besides the two main characters dying and us finding out who the narrator was."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel/ A customer review\\"A book of true love with troubled relationships between family members\\"I enjoyed reading the book Like Water For Chocolate. I believe anyone involved in a mixed up love quarrel will easily relate to this novel. I am convinced that Laura Esquivel did a well organization of the way the book is arranged together by every month, as the chapter with different cooking recipes that ties to the main characters' feelings and emotions. The relationship of the characters continuously move up and down. As Mama Elena tries to control her youngest daughter's life, the story makes you want to keep your eyes reading to the next page without wanting to put the 164 page novel down. As the book revolves around the main character Tita, the supporting characters each have a story of their own up their sleeves. This is full of drama and true love with a diminutive touch of comedy as Tita's sister is spotted riding naked on a horse. As this wonderful book moves along, the ending is quite surprising. The reader will never expect it to happen as it tends to be bring a laugh to your face. Like Water For Chocolate is definitely worth its price to spend a few dollars. I recommend this to anyone who is stuck between two lovers and interested in the relationship between family members that they should pick this up."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a magical, powerful novel that seemed to receive rave reviews. It demonstrates the power of a young woman's love, who bound by tradition must remain unmarried to care for her aging mother. This novel does an excellent job of portraying what it meant to be Mexican in that time period. Mamma Elena portrays an evil, selfish and controlling charictor. Padro, Tita's true love, comes off more to me as a weak unappealing character.Throughout the book he continually shies away, never voicing his opinion. Food seems to be the focus point of this story. Tita discovers her power to greatly influence people with her recipes. This is a disguise of her love for Pedro. This book carries a bit of a magical realism that some people may be able to relate to. You get to experience Tita's heartache and pain, loneliness and sorrow. Toward the end Padro, her true love comes back to her with the passion of ten thousand lost souls. As I read on I found my self more drawn and spellbound to this magical romance."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The novel, Like Water for Chocolate is a very romantic and interesting novel that will touch you right at home.

I have always felt, intuitively, that there was more to the Biblical accounts than just the surface explanation. A work as great and inspired as the Bible must lend itself to multiple interpretations/applications to withstand the changing tides of time. Troward presents an excellent launching pad to a deeper meaning, and he is not without support. See Galatians 4:24. I highly recommend &quot;Bible Mystery Bible Meaning&quot; to any seriously reflective individual."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"While reading this phenomenal text that was originally copyrighted in 1913, I looked up (as to the heavens) and thanked the author, Thomas Troward for this contribution not only to my own spiritual development, but to the fantastic meaning and understanding that any student of spiritual text will find to be extraordinarily enlightening.There is so much meaning in this book. So much that conveys what both Moses and Jesus taught. The meaning behind their words, and the meaning in our present day lives.I strongly recommend this book to anyone from any religion, as this book truly and clearly explains the \\"mystery\\" behind the \\"meaning\\" of the words in the bible.This is a serious book, that requires a dedicated mind, that is, a mind in love with the process of Truth and spiritual enlightenment.I would also really recommend this book to any ACIM (A Course in Miracles) student. It is an engaging, mind opening read, and after reading this book, I can say with all sincerity that you may walk away with a great deal more understanding of the meaning of the words that the Bible tries to convey than before you first picked it up.I have many books at the top of my list, and this is now one of them."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"This insightful work by the author ofThe Creative Process in the Individualis a rich elaboration on hisEdinburgh Lectures on Mental Science. Troward viewed the whole Bible as a commentary on the words \\"man is the image and likeness of God\\" and pursues this thread throughout. He also considered it as the book of emancipation of mankind for deliverance from sickness, sorrow, poverty, uncertainty and limitation.The Bible is not just a collection of fables or incomprehensible dogmas but a statement of universal laws. In chapter 1, The Creation, it is emphasized that God is One and man is made in His likeness. The creation narrative is explained as Spirit working on Itself - the Spirit of God upon the waters or psychic stuff of the cosmos, when the laws were set in motion, like the law of cause and effect. The Fall looks at the allegory of the two trees in the garden of the soul. The tree of life is the perception of spirit and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is mankind's habit of seeing 2 powers, i.e. considering evil as a subject of knowledge.The deluge is explained as psychic forces that overwhelmed mankind because of rampant occultism. Many ages later the Patriarchs appeared; this is a transition from allegory to history. Troward analyses the three syllables of the name Israel, with reference to Egyptian and Mesopotamian religion. These others had part of the truth but it was not in balance. The three elements of the name Israel represent three modes of one life, symbolizing wholeness. In the chapter The Mission of Moses, he explores the holy name I AM and its significance, that of Being in the Absolute. Moses' task was to build a nation based on the recognition of the principle of the One, the people of the I AM. This nation was to be the custodians of truth until the coming of Jesus Christ through whom all nations would come to the light. See alsoThe Irrevocable Callingby Daniel Juster in this regard.Chapter 5, The Mission of Jesus, considers the metaphor of the shepherd and the stone and the concepts of sacrifice and covenant. The universal cannot act on the plane of the particular except by becoming individualized upon that plane. Christ's was a voluntary sacrifice; he is the foundation and crowning stone and also the rock of our salvation. The next chapter covers the meaning and symbolism of Solomon's Temple with its two pillars called Yachin and Boaz, whilst chapter 7 examines the Name of the Lord as a source of strength and protection. The name is explored in its 4 Hebrew syllables Yod, Hey, Waw, Hey, letter by letter to derive at the logical meaning. The name of the first woman, Hawa in Hebrew, derives from the second syllable. In this chapter the author points out how Jesus used this verb and considers the meaning of the creation of the cosmos by the divine word.Chapter 8, The Devil, looks at the negative disintegrating force as a manifestation of the integrating power operating at a lower level. The negative power has its root in our denial of the affirmative. This section also deals with the law of attraction and the nature of disembodied spirits. The antidote to all these things is the right conception of God as the one and only Originating Power. The law of liberty is discussed next; the law of the Bible is the law of human individuality. We are individual centers for the expression of Spirit. To be ourselves, expressing life by the creative power of thought is the law of liberty that leads to perfect social harmony.In the Teaching of Jesus, Troward provides a connected idea of the general scope and purpose of the Master's teachings, by referring inter alia to the parables of the prodigal son and the talents. He explains that the law is not vindictive but causal, and reminds the reader of the words of Jesus in John 16: \\"The Father himself loves you\\". In short, the gist of it is: \\"You are a conscious individual expression of the One Universal Spirit; recognizing this truth will set you free; you must believe that That which is infinite finds a centre in you.\\" I was struck by the similarity of Geza Vermes' conclusions in his bookThe Authentic Gospel of Jesus.Chapters 11 and 12 are about sin and forgiveness. Sin is a statement of the law of correspondence, but Spirit desires to forgive. An essential quality of Spirit's self-recognition in its relation to the human race is its ability and willingness to forgive and heal. Further interesting topics in these chapters include the reasons why Jesus said \\"your sins are forgiven\\" in some of his healing miracles, as well as thoughts on specters, hauntings and ghosts. Chapter 13 deals with Divine Giving, the desire of God to give to us in fullness and why one must cultivate receptivity. In order to receive, the individual has to become an expectant receiver. The Bible is filled with promises and by the law of creative power God provides in a multitude of wonderful ways.The last chapter is titled The Spirit of Antichrist. Denial of God is the opposite of the principle of Sonship. Referring to St Paul in Thessalonians and Daniel 11 & 12, Troward explains God as the originating spirit Animus Dei and the Anima Mundi as the eternal feminine, receptive subconscious mind or the soul of nature through which He operates. The Anima Mundi is amenable to suggestion, and therein lies the danger. A certain class of people with a powerful leader will shape the neutral Anima to their own thought and volition in a principle of self-deification. Those with God in their hearts will also work so that Anima Mundi is knocked out of the equation, leaving only the opposing forces. And the greatest of that is Divine Personality, our Everlasting Father. This scenario is frightening but also comforting and reassuring. I have found Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning to be a most illuminating and thought-provoking work."},{"Title":"Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning","review":"T. Troward was a genius.

This one addresses the Bible from an enlightened perspective according to Metaphysics. The central theme according to Troward involves the liberation of mankind from the limited beliefs of fear, hatred, persecution, sin and condemnation and their consequential results, due to stubbornly held religious dogma and erroneous cultural indoctrination. The Right Honorable Judge Troward seeks to demonstrate the consistent parallel truth of infinitely expansive benevolence available through Divine Providence resulting from free-will according to our choice of God-consciousness: choice of belief in petty, fickle, mean god results in suffering, while choice of belief in God of Loving Excellence results in state of Grace, Blessedness and Paradise. While the preferred choice would seem self-evident, Troward observes the long Biblical account of erroneous allegiances to inverted truths. Covers old and new testament from what might be thought of as Jungian version of Adam and Eve, through the Ideal and symbolic interpretations of Moses and the New Israel and their continuity into the Redemption of Anthropos via the Christ, among other esoteric topics along the way.

The emphasis is on providing a representative image from all stages in the photographer's career (a long, diverse one in the case of Man Ray)so depth in the era the photographer did his most important work is sacrificed to chronological breadth.The reproductions are good, but not exceptional. Some of the images lacked the glow - the sense of captured light - seen in higher-end reproductions of the images. This slight deadening of the images was most apparent in Man Ray's wonderful solarized photos - images with a which when reproduced well seem to be lit from within.Art and photography books are perhaps the least suited for e-commerce as we know it today. Some of my favorite images were not in the Aperture books, and I would have been able to see this before buying by thumbing through the book at a traditional bookstore. Hopefully, as technology advances, Amazon will allow us to &quot;thumb through&quot; these books of images on-line, by being able to view all the images electronically before buying.All in all, this Aperture series is a good, inexpensive place to get started for someone who would like to see representative images of an artist with whom he or she is unfamiliar. They are not by any means comprehensive works, nor do they have the most beautiful reproductions of some of the mostmemorable images of this century. These books are, however, much less expensive than museum catalogs, have intelligent introductory essays, and are printed passably - they serve a valuable purpose in making the work of these photographers more accessible, and encouraging further exploration into an artist's work."},{"Title":"Man Ray (Aperture Masters of Photography)","review":"I bought this book expecting it to be a basic guide on Man Ray's work.

The town-continent-solar system-galaxy progression is really nifty, but a lot of the time, distance, and really big numbers are just too abstract.

Whymper details his Alps climbs in the 1860s with many first ascents including Mont Pelvoux in 1861, Barre des &Eacute;crins in 1864, Mont Dolent and Aiguille d'Argenti&egrave;re in 1864, and Grand Cornier, Pointe Whymper on the Grandes Jorasses, and Aiguille Verte in 1865. But Whymper will always be remembered for the first ascent of the Matterhorn on July 14, 1865.The Matterhorn was considered to be mountaineering's biggest challenge at the time, and Whymper met with failure again and again. Finally on his eighth attempt he finally succeeded, becoming the first man to reach the summit on July 14, 1865.On the descent, tragedy struck when four members of the party slipped and were killed, and only the breaking of the rope saved Whymper and the two remaining guides from the same fate. A controversy ensued as to whether the rope had actually been cut, but a formal investigation could not find any proof.The accident haunted Whymper: \\"Every night, do you understand, I see my comrades of the Matterhorn slipping on their backs, their arms outstretched, one after the other, in perfect order at equal distances - Croz the guide, first, then Hadow, then Hudson, and lastly Douglas. Yes, I shall always see them.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed the parts of the book dedicated to climbing and was struck by Whymper's adventurous spirit, and his dedication and perseverance. The book does drag on a bit in a few parts with chapters on the technical details about glaciers and railway tracks. The 130 illustrations, many woodcut by Whymper himself, bring the story to life, and are almost as good as photographs."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps,","review":"I bought the book due to my interest in the period it covers -- early Alpine mountaineering. Edward Whymper was an interesting guy, and certainly one of the foreign pioneers of mountain climbing (including the first climb of Matterhorn). I found him to be less inspiring as an author -- the book's pace is slow, punctuated by various tangential discussions, e.g. geology of glaciers.It failed to capture my imagination, as other more receint mountaineering books have done -- try Gaston Rebuffat, Walter Bonatti, Chris Bonnington instead."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps,","review":"Nice read when you like climbing stories but not much to learn from it. Entertaining."},{"Title":"Scrambles amongst the Alps,","review":"I found the book non-descriptal and factual. Written in a matter of fact English Literary form classic of that time period from a Chap. His knowledge is plentiful as he pours forth details of every sense on history of regions, region developement, ecology, geology...etc. But the going is very, very slow. It wasn't one of those books I pick up and read through in a matter of days. It took dedication days and I found it a bit depleting at times. I did rather enjoy his dry humor scattered throughout and his detailed outlook regarding natives of those areas of the time. Read if you're into history of mountaineering but have another book on the side to offset the pace."},{"Title":"Arizona (Portrait of America)","review":"This is a nicely illustrated little book (48 pages) targeting young readers. It is one in a 53-book series called, \\"Portrait of America,\\" published by Steck-Vaughn, covering each state plus Washington DC, Puerto Rico, and Pacific Islands.The book accomplishes what it probably was supposed to accomplish, that is, to provide a rough overview of Arizona, its history, its peoples, and its current status.The only thing that jumped out at me is on page 15, where Thompson writes, \\"Lawmen such as Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, and Bat Masterson came to town around 1881.\\"This may be a minor point that only Western buffs would note, but Doc Holliday was definitely not a \\"lawman.\\" Yes, he fought on the side of the Earps and was friends with Masterson, but he was never deputized, as far as I could find in his biographical materials.So what? Who cares? Well, it just seems like someone writing a history should be a little more attentive to detail. Sliding over this detail may give readers a totally wrong impression about Doc Holliday. Compared to Earp and Masterson, he was really just a tubercular dentist, fast with a gun and handy with a knife (he killed several men), who loved to gamble. A very interesting personage, but not a lawman.Anyway, that's the only part I can complain about. Otherwise, the little book was informative, and it made me want to avoid Arizona even more than I had before reading it (too hot, not enough water).

Arizona has a lot going for it, and this book will show you and your students what.The \\"Portrait of America\\" series is a great and easy to understand introduction for pre-teens to the 50 states and to the places and events that shaped the history of the United States. This \\"Arizona\\" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like \\"History\\", \\"Culture\\", \\"Economy\\" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. My only reservation is that the History section should have focused more attention on the ancient civilizations that flourished on the deserts over the centuries.This book, as well as the entire \\"Portrait of America\\" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"this book, written by a military scholar, will appeal to those seeking the tree to many branches; it gives excellent accounts of operations from the shadowy days of secret wartime missions, as well as up-to-date workings of the separate intelligence communities. With a comprehensive bibliography, the would-be intelligence analyst cannot go wrong choosing this book as their guide"},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"This book was originally assigned to me in college as part of a course on US Intelligence. It has stayed on my bookshelf ever since then. I've reread parts of it for fun, or when I needed to reference something.It's a great book that includes a least a small section on every major, and most minor intelligence operation or development of the century. Human Intelligence, technical, it doens't limit itself to one area. Obviously WW2 and the Cold War get the most attention, but there is plenty on various other conflicts and other parties.All the major subjects are covered, and there will be quite a few smaller incidents that I (and most likely you) had not heard of previously, or only new very little about.Richelsen has excellent credentials and is a great source, the book is very informative and accurate, as well as maintaining a factual and unbiased tone on a subject is very often not to unbiased. Despite it all this it remains a fun and enjoyable read, accessible to readers with a lot or very minimal previous knowledge of Intelligence work."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"An excellent composition of non-fiction information. It presents very good details about the foreign policy and current information. This book is a great read for the layman and the global security reader.Author of THE SHEQEL"},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"Good book, deals with a lot of sigint, more than I cared for but is very useful for basic knowledge."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"I am an avid reader of history, and especially of intelligence, spying, and military history. There are few books that I have started which I have not read to completion, but this was one of them. After about 150 pages, I realized that I wasn't enjoying the book, I wasn't learning much from it, and that I wasn't in a college course, so I could just stop reading. My criticisms, in no particular order:* While Kindles seem plagued by typos, this book sets a new standard. The errors actually begin to distract from the work, although they do provide some comedy relief. My favorite- a chapter that chronicles that famous WWI event, \\"The Battle of the Mame\\". I think it was a Lucille Ball movie.* A good portion of the book is a recitation of names, dates, places and events. Some of these are important, some should be footnotes to the footnotes.* Much of the information presented is devoid of any context. As an example, one section of the book describes in detail the intelligence efforts behind the Battle of Jutland. These efforts, however, make little sense unless you have a fairly detailed appreciation of the naval tactics and geographical context of Jutland. I suspect few readers have such details committed to memory, and must, like me, resort to an external source for background material.* The author makes sweeping statements, but does not back them up. For example, Richelson credits the Nazi intelligence services with a good portion of the credit for allowing Hitler's early successes in the Rhineland, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Probably true to some extent, but certainly an opinion that requires some argument and facts to support it.* In other cases, Richelson seems shy about taking a position. Richard Sorge, a Soviet spy, provided Stalin with information that was likely the reason that the Soviets were able to concentrate the vast majority of their armies against the Germans. Without too much imagination, you could make a case that this was one of the turning points in the European Theater. While Sorge's story is told, there is but brief mention of the consequences.So in summary I found the work to be mostly a collection of facts, with some opinions thrown in but not particularly well supported. As a narrative, it falls short as well, glancing over events whose details are truly interesting and important.I'd say skip it."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"The book is an excellent but very detailed account of the world of spies and Intelligence service. I can't put it down and can relate to the history, but the names, details and volume of facts are a little overwhelming."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"Interesting, in good condition, cool book, i like it there is a lot of Historical and special aspects. I needed it!"},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"This book was more like a text book that would be read on a college level. Like many books that we all dealt with in college it was interesting and boring throughout. I will not read it again as I do some books after a long period. Of course this is all IMHO."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"I have been a lover of mystery books and intelligence gathering almost since I learned to read. As both a literature buff and history buff, delving into the evolution of intelligence gathering (coupled with the ever-expanding technology) became almost a \\"must\\". The book is well balanced, delving into the different modalities and technology used in intelligence gathering coding, decoding, and transmission. It also features brief vignettes on particular spies who were superlative in their vocation as well as some who were not so spectacular, and some who just had amusing (or irritating) idiosynchracies that gave a smile now and then.It is, first and last, a HISTORY book -- and anyone who reads much history knows that it is very densely packed, and very slow reading. However the information one gleans about how technological advances which are not only applied to \\"improvement in living ease\\" but also in ever-more-difficult spying techniques will long be remembered.Taking the transmission of intelligence from private courier to telephone, to \\"Marconi wireless\\" to various kinds of wireless technology and \\"bugs\\" all had both strong and weak points which needed to be addressed.I gave it 4-stars because the reading is so dense and moves so slowly, and in order to follow one chain of events, other developments not used in this primary endeavor must be backtracked and introduced at a later time, so it does not lend itself to a strict chronlogy, but you find you are taking mini-backtracks exploring other methods as well.All in all, it is a very good book, but a book to be read a little bit at a time, so that there is time to \\"digest\\" it. Three Cheers to Jeffrey Richelson, who had the patience to untangle it, and present a masterful book!!"},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"I found this book very informative on the evolution of spies. However, post cold war, this book is sparse and rather curt in it's analysis which comes to an abrupt halt during the Clinton Administration.The book ends at about the 70% marker, with an additional 30% (100 pages) of references and citations. 434 pages for the book, 534 pages in all. I recommend it if you are interested in intelligence up to and during the cold war era.. but there is really nothing insightful after the 90's."},{"Title":"A Century of Spies: Intelligence in the Twentieth Century","review":"The book is very informative, and I am enjoying learning about the functions of intelligence personnel in recent times.And while I do suggest this book, it is sometimes difficult to read; very often, commas are missing - and this makes it difficult to follow along.Here's one example:\\"When Sorge arrived in Tokyo Stalin was still fearful of a Japanese attack.\\"Richelson, Jeffery T.

It's a good book."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"Dorothy Gilman has done it again. She is most well known for her Mrs. Pollifax series which I have never read but her stand alone mysteries are excellent. The Tightrope Walker is a wonderful novel - the characters are well drawn and the plot really pulls you in.This is the story of an introverted young woman, Amelia Jones, who finds a terrifying and mysterious note about a possible murder in a hurdy gurdy (those stand up music boxes that you usually see a monkey with a hat attached to...). This note intrigues her enough to try to find out who wrote it as well as the well being of the writer.This leads Amelia on a journey through time as well as place. Through this search Amelia meets many interesting people - from a stage actor in New York to a handwriting analyst in her home town of Trafton - Amelia sees it all and learns to love in the process. Tightrope Walker is also a story within a story as Amelia constantly refers back to her favorite childhood book, &quot;The Maze in the Heart of the Castle&quot; which I would love to read (much as dlch3@juno.com would).Will Amelia find out who the mysterious author of the note is and what ever became of her? You will have to read this wonderful book to find out and if you are lucky - you will discover a great writer along the way.If you like Tightrope Walker - you should also Read Gilman's &quot;Thale's Folly&quot; and &quot;The Clairvoyant Countess&quot; - they all show the same wonderful traits - fully drawn and intriguing characters who you want to get to know better and an interesting and well written plot that you wish would never end."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"In a story that seems right out of Dorothy Gilman's imagination, I found this story in a musty suitcase in my parents' attic at the age of 12. It was in a book of Readers' Digest Abridged books for 1979. Also included were 2 very excellent stories and one pretty good one (excellent: Hungry as the Sea, Flesh and Spirit; pretty good: The Passing Bells). I loved the story from the moment I read the opening words. This is an anomaly for me. Usually it takes me time to get into the rhythm and flow of just about any book I read (the only other notable exception is Like Water for Chocolate, which is positively delicious). This book grabbed me from the instant I started reading it and I couldn't put it down, literally, till the surprise ending.I especially love the characterization of Amelia. Here is this shy, rather mousy girl who doesn't seem like much of anything. Then suddenly she finds herself drawn into a mystery after finding a note from a woman who is sure she will be murdered soon. Quite the opposite of her portrayal at the beginning of the book, Amelia soon proves to readers and to herself that she is quite extraordinary. We realize she is resourceful, intuitive, and intelligent. In fact it is only from this investigation of a murder plot that Amelia really grows up from the stunted emotional state she has been living in since her mother's suicide. Plus reading the book in the true unabridged form is wonderful. I always felt that reading abridged books is a bit like eating dehydrated foods. You're made to think that you've lost nothing but the taste really suffers.So I'd recommend this book to anyone, mystery aficianado or not. It's gripping, intelligent, and actually funny. Now I'm sixteen and though I've outgrown a lot of other things..., I still love this book."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"This is tasty little mystery story. It lasts for a short 223 pages and yet it manages to pack in a surprising amount of character development and action between its covers.The heroine, Amelia Jones, is an endearing young woman taking her first real steps out into the world. Amelia impulsively purchases the Ebbtide Shop, a musty antique store stocked with junk and marvelous finds. She decides to put aside one item, a hurdy-gurdy (or hand organ box), as a furnishing for her upstairs apartment. When the hurdy-gurdy mysteriously stops playing music, Amelia opens the box and discovers a desperate note written on faded paper. The message begins with \\"They are going to kill me soon...\\" and ends with \\"...my name is Hannah.\\" Amelia believes that the note is likely genuine. When questions about Hannah's fate begin to consume her, Amelia ventures further out into the world on a quest to find out the truth. Along the way, she meets many interesting people and becomes involved in a variety of unusual circumstances. The plot is a charming mix of mysterious happenings and coming-of-age realizations that make the reader vitally interested in Amelia's story and how it intertwines with Hannah's.Though this book is shorter than I usually read, I highly recommend it. I think that it is particularly ideal for anyone wishing to read poolside or during their lunchbreak. The interesting storyline and clean writing style make it easy to pick up again after taking a nap or experiencing one of life's other interruptions."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"I love this book so much I bought a first editon copy.

Gilman's is the first Mrs. Pollifax novel, I think it's the Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"Although &quot;The Tightrope Walker&quot; succeeds very well as a straight mystery, the message it conveys is far beyond that. It tells the story of Amelia Jones, an introverted, somewhat sad young woman, who discovers an unsolved murder, and embarks upon a quest to discover what really happened.As Amelia searches for the truth, she meets some very interesting characters, and finds out some very poignant truths about herself. A wonderful story. I only wish that Ms. Gilman would write &quot;In the Land of the Golden Warriors&quot; to go along with &quot;The Maze in the Heart of the Castle.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"Gilman can write. Her protagonist, Amelia Jones, is a real person, with a history beyond the front cover of the book. That history is revealed slowly, in fact Amelia doesn't realise how much is revealed, during the course of the story; gradually the reader is drawn into her life as much as her search for a past murder, victim, and murderer(s), until knowing that Amelia is growing and maturing greatly is perhaps more important than knowing that the evil ones will be brought to justice. The only downside to the book is that there is a simply wonderful book &quot;The Maze in the Heart of the Castle&quot; central to both the plot and Amelia's character; i want to read that book, but Gilman invented it and its sequel without writing them. Very unfair of her, i thought."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"I loved this book, and with some effort I was able to track down a copy of &quot;A Maze in the Heart of the Castle&quot;. Yes, the book really does exist, and Dorothy Gilman did write it. It is now out of print, but most public libraries will have a copy, and it's worth the effort to track it down.

Dorothy Gilman is always a great read. Never disappoints."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"This story starts off from the first page and keeps you turning pages to the end. One of the great qualities of Gilman's writings is knowing how to pace the story and this is a good example of that. Amelia is likeable from the beginning. Quirky and imperfect but the kind of woman you want to sit to tea with. As the mystery unfolds, she develops into someone stronger as if she is traveling through the maze as well. The other characters are also quite believeable and have their own unique personalities. The mystery is good as well though I figured it out before the end.It is odd to think that Gilman was incorporating one of her other books within this story especially since the author of the book is murdered. And she does it so well that you want to read \\"The Maze at the Heart of the Castle\\" soon afterward. It is a good story on its own, I'd love to see an illustrated version. And I'd also love to know if there really is a sequal. Perhaps someday the Maze will be back in print again. It really does go hand in hand with this story, for Amelia goest through the same thing Colin does, though in slightly different circumstances.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good mystery with good character development and scope for thought."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it.

All of us have experienced some of Amelia's horror in the world. We all know what it is like when you forget you are on a tightrope, and look down! This would be a compelling film. The right screenplay could make this exciting, touching, and scary. Imagine the possibilities for the female lead! Please, Dorothy Gilman, write a screenplay."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"This book was wonderfully written, filled with suspense. The plot lines are excellent, I definitely recommend this book for everyone tto read"},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"I read this book again recently. I'm not much of a mystery reader. This is a mystery, but there's a lot of other things going on, too. There's a love story, Amelia's search for peace and confidence, some really interesting side characters like Daisy, and most of all, what I think the book is really about. I think that at its heart The Tightrope Walker is about the relationship between an author and a reader.***Spoiler Alert***The book is deeply concerned with a book Amelia read as a child which she became deeply connected to, and which essentially saved her after her mother's suicide, The Maze in the Heart of the Castle. Dorothy Gilman actually wrote it after writing The Tightrope Walker. It's out of print now just like the book Amelia read. Reading some of the reviews it's obvious that many young people were just as moved by Gilman's book as Amelia was by Hannah's. I read it as an adult, and thought it was a good read. I think it might have been a more profound experience if I'd read it as a teen.We've all had books that moved us, that we might even credit with changing our lives, but the relationship between us and the author of such books is generally one-sided. They've given us a great treasure, we've given little or nothing in return. Maybe we paid a few dollars for the book, but if we bought it used or found it somewhere free on the internet, the author hasn't benefited at all. They likely will never know the impact their words have had on us.In The Tightrope Walker through some bizarre coincidence, or more likely fate, Amelia finds a note in a Hurdy Gurdy which leads her to solve the murder of her favorite author. The murder itself was chilling in its callousness,so much so that it makes me wonder a little about who I can really trust. The impact of Hannah's book on Amelia's life is inspiring to me. As a writer for young people, (Goblin Fruit), I hope to someday write a story that helps someone as much as The Maze in the Heart of the Castle helped Amelia."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"When the heroine finds a note in an antique, she opens the door to a past mystery.

This along with Gerald Durrell's My Family & Other Animals and a few others are some that I re-read about once a year. Amelia is an appealing heroine with her insecurities and bravery.

It may sound crazy to re-read something you know so well, but what the heck.Give this charming book a try."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"I shan't describe the plot of this slim novel that others have already shared so well. Suffice it to say that The Tightrope Walker is a delightful story of great charm, and, like many of Ms. Gilman's books, unexpected depth as well. I never grow tired of reading of Amelia's courage and growth in the face of her fears and return to this sweet book time and time again."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"Not a great thriller but a sweet little book of about 200 or so pages that tells a story of the emotional growth of Amelia Jones while solving a murder that no one knows is a murder. She is a 22 year old sheltered innocent who, upon receiving her trust fund, buys a little shop, meets a young man, falls in love and cleverly solves a murder. The blanks in this scenario are filled in as the pages turn. You will be at the end fairly soon and will be a satisfied customer.This would be a great read for teens because the language is clean and sexual content is minimal. It's message to them, other than a clever little murder mystery, would be -- quirky is okay and there is really no \\"normal\\". Being a little different can be a good thing.One small part at the end was hilarious to me concerning Amelia's long term therapist (three years worth). His reaction to her telling him of what has been going on in her life since they last met was priceless.Written in 1978, it stands the test of time."},{"Title":"Tightrope Walker","review":"It's hard to add anything that hasn't already been said, but this is a very nice book. Better known for her Pollifax series, this book is one of my favorites from Dorothy Gilman.

The early story of the auto mechanic that was promoted to service manager, but continued to tinker with engines rather than run a tight shop says a lot. The book offers common-sense insight, and explains why so much bureaucratic and hierarchal inefficiency exists. Of course, many people in authority dictate rather than listen, mandating to underlings rather than supporting them, with the same typical results.

Peter and Raymond Hull, William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., New York, 1969, 179 pages in paperback. The Peter Principle: In a Hierarchy Every Employee Tends to Rise to His Level of Incompetence. The author provides an insightful analysis of why so many positions in so many organizations seem to be populated by employees who exhibit signs of incompetence. A most disturbing concept since we all tend to all rise to our own level of incompetence. This concept is likely to be ignored by most senior managers and consultants since to admit it is to admit that we may also be at our own level incompetence. Ignorance is bliss? The end result is that non-growing companies are more likely to have incompetent employees at many levels of the organizational structure whereas growing companies add new positions and employees so fast that the inevitable results of the Peter Principle may be forestalled as long as growth continues. &quot;Employees&quot;, as the author points out, &quot;do not want to be incompetent&quot;, but when management offers promotions that put the employees into their level of incompetence, the employees have no way of knowing that ahead of time. After all, if the offer is made it is because management &quot;knows&quot; the employee can do the job competently. Many managers are at their level of incompetence thus they make these poor selections."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS 1946 PUBLICATION IN THE LATE '50S-I HAVE PASSED THIS ON TO OTHERS./THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE READ IT PROBABLY NEV ER READ IT.GUESS WHO?"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"The whole time I'm reading this, I'm thinking, &#34;Jesus, this was written in the 60's and it's more truer than ever today.&#34; In every organization I've worked in, I've seen the Peter Principle in action. It's depressing and inevitable. It's likely the main downfall of modern business and I would love to work for a company that embraces the principle as a practice to avoid by restructuring the hierarchy.While the book is fantastic in explaining the different components and manifestations of the PP, it lacks detail in how to manipulate it. I found that section lacking clarity. I have read a few books on bettering oneself and it seems like there's 2 components: recognizing the problem and fixing the problem. This book leans heavily on recognizing the problem and graces the doorstep of fixing the problem. I suppose it's up to me to figure that out in my organization.I still gave this book 5 stars despite that criticism. It's a classic for business reading and a must-have for anyone looking to climb the corporate ladder based on merit.

Very informative, and done with a sense of humor!"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull's book, The Peter Principle, is an oldy but a goody. First published in 1969, this satirical book explains incompetence in all human organizations with one very simple adage: \\"People always rise to the level of their own incompetence, and then stagnate there, preventing all useful work from being done.\\"To back up their theory, the authors demonstrate time and again how the skills that lead to promotion actually have nothing to do with the skills necessary for successfully accomplishing the job. For example, a great machinist may get promoted for being good with manual and spatial tasks. Seeing his ease and skill in his initial functions, he is quickly promoted to shop foreman. The reality, however, is that the skills required to be a good foreman (organizational, social and so on) are nothing like the abilities needed to cope effectively with work as a machinist. Not only does our company, then, risk losing a good machinist, it also risks gaining a poor foreman.And on and on - Peter and Hull spare no expense in illustrating the principle of promotion beyond ones level of competence.And then their book gets really funny. There are two chapters near the end of the book, enumerating the medical- and psychological symptoms of what the authors term \\"Final Placement\\" at the level of ones own incompetence - a level at which one is doomed to live out the rest of ones career, given that promotion is not longer possible when one blatantly doesn't have the skills to be successful at ones present placement.Hull and Peter enumerate spurious and hilarious syndromes such as \\"Phonophilia\\" (the desire for many different telephones in a vain attempt to remain constantly connected to ones inferiors) and Papyrophilia (the belief that vaste accumulations of paper will somehow protect one from work-related errors).These chapters I recommend reading quietly when one is home alone - if you risk reading them in a public space, prepare for questioning looks. While reading these chapters, spectators at the French unemployment office were wondering whether I was laughing or crying.From my vantage point as a \\"chomeur\\" I now have the time and liberty to contemplate human incompetence from a very safe perch indeed, at least for the next year until my \\"allocations\\" run out !"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"GREAT BOOK EVEN IF I'M READING IT BY THE SECOND TIME AFTER 30 YEARS PLUS.THIS RE-EDITION MUST BE READ BY THE CURRENT CEO'S THAT WERE STILL IN DIAPERS WHEN THE BOOK WAS FIRST PUBLISHED."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"Look at the bell-curve. Not the controvertial book by Herrnstein and Murray, but the statistical bell curve used in grading and whatnot. The bell curve proves two things:1) One half of the people you meet--that is every other person you meet--is below average.2) Only 1/4 of the people you meet are really smart--those of the upper quartile--and in a democracy they will always be out voted.Our hope is in that upper 25%, yet they will always be in a minority, with the lesser 75% of us misunderstanding them, or dragging them down.Now you see how this book makes sense!Keep in mind that a theory is only as good as it's data. Luckily, we can verify the Peter Principle rather easily. Just look around your workplace, and look at what goes on. You will see the Peter Principle in al it's glory.A painfully true book!"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"A brilliant commentary on our civilization. The premise is that human nature is inherently hierarchial - pecking orders are necessarily developed, even in the absence of any clear impetus or demand for such. Hierarchies necssarily breed incompetence, frustration, failure, and doom ... unless coping methods are discovered to deal with these inevitable results.Substantial behaviorial evidence is marshalled up by the authors Peter (the concept) Hull (the book) to defend their claims, and they do with welcome concinnity and power. They unabashedly defend the idea that a great deal more can be learned by studying exteriority as opposed to interiority and use an interesting analysis of Freud to explain this approach. The idea is acceptable, but has not been universally accepted. In fact, there are many who despise the shallow nature of behavioral science and its contents.A number of the reviewers have again confused scepticism with cynicism. Peter and Hull are quite cynical about those who would seek to transcend the current state of affairs. They are in no way sceptical of their findings, their arguments, and even their possible limitations.Also excluded are those who do not exactly seek one-upmanship, at least consciously, but a better world. The ideals of the egalitarians are dismissed even without so much as Nietzschian adieus.On balance, this book is important, full of \\"worldly wisdom\\", admirably svelte, and should be read by all."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"The idea of the Peter Principle is that \\"In a Hierarchy Every Employee Tends to Rise to His Level of Incompetence.\\" When people tend to do their job well, they are eligible for promotion and that cycle continues until they are promoted into a role for which they are incompetent to perform the duties. At that point they have reached their \\"final placement.\\" They are no longer eligible for further promotions because they have reached their level of incompetence.According to Dr. Peter, \\"work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.\\" The many employees who may never realize they have reached their final placement utilize a number of the techniques to stay happily \\"busy\\" without producing anything:1. Perpetual Preparation - confirming the need for the action, studying alternative methods, obtaining expert advise, having the mentality of \\"first things first.\\"2. Side Issue Specialization - \\"Look after the molehills and the mountains will look after themselves.\\"3. Image Replaces Performance - \\"an ounce of image is like a pound of performance.\\"4. Utter Irrelevance - participating in various committees, boards and other meetings and rarely being in their own office performing a job.5. Ephemeral Administrology - serving many temporary appointments, as a substitution.6. Convergent Specialization - becoming extremely specialized in something of little significance.We all know people who engage the above techniques to get through their work day without really doing their job, right? Perhaps ignorance is bliss.I honestly couldn't put this book down. It was just so funny. The fact that it was written in 1969 added another level of humor as Dr. Peter briefly discussed computers and the incompetence of housewives. For example: \\"'Woman's work is never done' is a sad commentary on the high proportion of women who reach their level of incompetence as housewives.\\"The Peter Principle is light and entertaining, but is also very relevant. I would recommend this book for anyone in a position of management."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"This book is great for several reasons.a. Content- the idea that a worker eventually hits a point of incompetence. This can happen to any of us. This book can help you realize that & hopefully prevent you from falling into this age old trap & weakness of man.b. Writing style- Mr. Peters provides the meat of the book, the raw knowledge. Mr. Hull is a witty playwright that spruces up the dialogue & keeps the story rolling. Providing a very fast read. Without Mr. Hull, this book wouldn't be great. You will read this much faster than you normally read a book.c. Illustrations- everybody likes pictures. This has illustrations in the style of the old Punch mag from the turn of the 19th century.

I first read the book over 20 years ago. While starting out as a manager, people noticed that even \\"mediocre\\" workers under me were treated like others. In electronic design, work has to be done correctly and checked to assure absolute specification correct design. It's a kind of job like many where not only accuracy is crucial but team work is what makes a product work. While the basic idea of being promoted beyond your ability makes logical sense, this is not what I was seeing. People with some training in a certain area could keep on \\"going up the ladder\\" and take more responsibility or do different type of work. My sense is that \\"The Peter Principle\\" is a first step in managing careers and people's work. Once you see someone fail at a certain task or area of work, then comes correction. I guess today we are more aware of what Peter has said.A different issue I saw and I still see every day, is the \\"hire me I got an MBA\\" (or an MS in Electrical Engineering, or Finance, etc.) or \\"hire me I have done all the elements of the job in my previous life\\". This is The Peter Principle without history in the same company or department. It's incompetence at the first step of the ladder. This seems to be a much bigger problem as you hire high level executives. I have seen this in CEOs and just today I have seen it in a senior exec at a new start-up. Amazing stuff...

I have had a very successful career and had experienced myself the effect of growing and moving into higher positions without thoughtful analysis of what the consecuences of new jobs will be.The analysis of Hierarchies is interesting and was the first attempt to think of what happened to individuals who had grown to their level of incompetence. I made a research of later writings from researchers who studied the validity of the principle. \\"In a Hierarchy , every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence\\" - in a study made in the 1970's in the UK, reasearchers found that executives which had grown to their level of incompetency, were exposed to a variable component of a new job, without giving the executive any training for the new position, this creates a greater challenge for the executive and this tension and anxiety becomes the fire starter for odd behaviour and mistakes of judgement. If we take for example the great Steve Jobs' case when he was fired from Apple in the 1980's, many people thought he was done, and his companies were silently moving in strategic directions, while the press critiqued and ridiculed his efforts and made people believe he was in a crash course. We all know what happened afterwards, he rose again to greater heights and was capable to lead Apple to what it is today. His abiliy to learn from mistakes is what distinguised him from people who have already arrived to their level of incompetence, we all know examples which really confirm all the findings in the principle. The challenge for us is to study ourselves and make the best of what we were given by nature!"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"This is a serious book explaining how business and government organizations work when it comes to promoting employees. Having worked for government and private organizations, I found the book to be very accurate; Dr. Peter certainly understands how people are shuffled around in an organization. Some folks move up the ranks until they reach a position they cannot handle and in some instances, once the big shots understand that the person is over their head, they are often transferred \\"laterally\\" to other positions where they can do no harm. These lateral transfers often leave them with a title, but no real authority. This makes it look like management did not make a mistake and the employee who received the lateral transfer is happy because he has not been fired or reduced in rank but he still looks like he is doing well in the organization.Organizational structures are facinating in how they work. This book will leave you laughing but it will also give you a great understaning of why and how idiots often end up in management positions."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"Read the \\"Peter Principle,\\" a satire and commentary on why there are so many who are not competent in their jobs.

My first time was while still in the military and it explained to me, a great deal of the things I saw go wrong. It left an impression upon me that lasted throughout my career and which still helps me today. It explained clearly why I was so frustrated with the way things had begun to deteriorate so badly once I was into the second half of my career. And it helped me to make certain career choices that I still believe to day were the most beneficial decision I could have made at the time, and I was glad I had that knowledge to consider.Dr. Laurence and his associates hit the nail right on the head in describing the failing principles, due to the Peter Principle of our Political system, our Judicial System, and much more. On the whole we do promote to incompetence and it is our number one failing.From the military point of view there are quite a few additional contributing factors, all Peter Principle related, which resulted in a decline in the American Military. Which include the radical feminist movement, promoting for gender rather than merit, the radical quota promotions, promoting by race, rather than merit, and our leader's failure to stand firm for core values.The up or out policy is the epitome of the Peter Principle, as is the guaranteed promotion policy, and the reenlistment bonus program which has been a great failure. Of course this book applies to all walks of life and even applies to our Present White House occupant and many of our congressional members. And will apply to many of those running for political office today.The Peter Principle is a must read for the student of our American social, political and judicial decline and what horror is in store for us in the twenty first century if we do not recognize the beast and kill it before it becomes unstoppable, which it may already be.

He provides superb insight into why the hierarchies and bureacracies of the world are so inefficient and are becoming increasingly so, why successful people are often unhappy in their jobs and why the most talented people often proceed through their careers without material reward. Peter's observations are funny, but alarmingly true. An excellent resource for the armchair sociologist - highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"It's interesting yet perplexing, that when I studied Public Administration (yawn), we studied German economist and sociologist Max Weber, but never once, did our courses include the work of Laurence Peter. They should have.The \\"Peter Principle\\" was written in 1969, but you'll realize immediately it's still very accurate and useful today. Many anecdotes and case studies may remind you of yourself, someone, or some people you've worked with. There are illustrations, diagrams, charts, graphs, and the ever-present Bell Curve. There are too many good things in this book to list. It's also a quick and easy-read.The author's background is very relevant to the credibility of this book, which in my opinion, is a true classic. Laurence J. Peter received an Ed.D from Washington State University and had extensive experience as a teacher, counselor, school psychologist, prison instructor, consultant, and university professor. (I don't know much about the other author, Raymond Hull.) Here a a couple of concepts from the many things in the \\"Peter Principle.\\"Push & Pull:Two different ways to \\"move up.\\" No reason to go into detail, but a person pushing upward usually will not get the result of a person who's \\"pulled up from above.\\" My favorite quote in the \\"Peter Principle\\" is on the \\"Push & Promotion\\" chapter on page 63:\\"Never stand when you can sit; never walk when can ride; never Push when you can Pull.\\"Judging the competence of an employee:Outsiders usually don't judge your performance. In general, your superior does. So if you have a:Competent superior:If a superior is competent they evaluate his/her subordinate by the usefulness of work. Performance. Output.Incompetent superior:If a superior is incompetent they will often judge the subordinate by \\"behavior that supports the rules, rituals, and forms of the status quo. Promptness, neatness, courtesy to superiors....\\" This is evaluating input, not output.Creative Incompetence:Most of us have witnessed and perhaps experienced a happy and talented person doing well at what they do in the workplace. Because of his/her optimum performance they're offered a promotion. A raise, yes. But also more stress, more time consumed, more responsibilities, and often new duties and skill-sets needed at the new position.Some employees understand that in their particular circumstances the negatives outweigh the positives of a promotion. When realize they are next in line, or close to getting that promotion they don't want, they have (at least 2) options:One, carefully refuse the promotion, while vocalizing that he/she is still committed and dedicated to the company, etc. This is called \\"Peter's Parry,\\" and is not recommended by the author for most (but not all) employees.The second option for the employee to avoid advancement, is not by refusing promotion but by intentionally doing minor and forgivable mistakes that will cause him/her to never be offered a promotion, but retain the current position. This is ---> Creative Incompetence. The author offers some techniques in the sub-section of this chapter for successfully executing Creative Incompetence. Peter states it's important that one conceal the fact that they want to avoid a promotion.Again this book is almost 40 years old. Some of the individual (worker) values and the corporate climate has changed since then. But in private, public, and non-profit organizations, we see many of Peter's situations today. Too many.HEALTH & HAPPINESS AT ZERO PQ:When someone reaches his/her level of incompetence (called Peter's Plateau) the Zero PQ - Zero Promotion Quotient - 0% chance of a promotion exists. Understanding when one reaches the point of Zero PQ is very important. Many employees don't recognize when they hit it, and sometimes when an employee hits the ceiling he/she thinks it's incompetence, inferier skills, or lack of production, when it might actually be politics. They think they are not working \\"hard enough,\\" or good enough. This person pushes harder by working longer, skipping breaks, and going the extra mile. These are the symptoms of ---> Final Placement Syndrome.Have you ever witnessed or even experienced Zero PQ at work?In organizations (i.e., hierarchies) people get promoted as long as they continue to be competent. Eventually they are promoted to a position in which their skills are not adequately applicable for their new position. Therefore other employees at the same level or below carry out the tasks, because these \\"other employees\\" have not hit their level of their incompetence, yet.The Chapters are worthy of listing because they do highlight the points and topics in the book:1. The Peter Principle2. The Principle in Action3. Apparent Exceptions4. Pull & Promotion5. Push & Promotion6. Followers & Leaders7. Hierarchically & Politics8. Hints & Foreshadowings9. The Psychology of Hierarchiology10 Peter's Spiral11 The Pathology of Success12 Non-Medical Indices of Final Placement13 Health & Happiness at Zero PQ14 Creative Incompetence15 The Darwinian ExtensionThere are numerous sub-chapters within the chapters, as well.

It's a rather short book that consists of made-up stories about administrative and business hierarchies. Some (if not all) of them are based on true events. Mr. Peter has given his characters funny names and the stories make you laugh frequently, but actually the message of the book is very serious. Mr. Peter demonstrates that endless climbing higher and higher is bound to lead your life into a dead end.The book's fun to read and, in my opinion, delivers really valuable knowledge. It helps you to stand hold to the pressure from the environment that is telling you that when you are not successful with something, you just need to keep trying harder and investing more. Mr. Peter helps you realise why this won't work.I have heard that some US government institutions are actually applying Mr. Peter's discoveries in their organization.If you liked &quot;Parkinson's Law&quot;, you'll enjoy this book as well. (And vice versa.)"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"With this simple phrase on p.15 of my edition of The Peter Principle he explained nearly every problem the human species has faced as we have entered increasingly complex organizations in the development of our civilization,In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence given enough time and enough levels in the hierarchyAnd the more I've thought about it, internalized it, experienced corporate hierarchy... the more I've realized that it explains everything.A housing bubble caused by artificially low inflation rates? Some blame Greenspan but the reality is that he was just serving above his level of competence. It makes sense. America's colony in Iraq flubbed? Some blame Bush or his subordinates but the reality was that they were serving above their level of competence. We all do from time to time. We all think we are the exception.As acquaintances enter the work force and through my own witness to the mindset of the low level employee, everyone seems to be focused primarily on ascending to the higher levels. Why? I think it is what we do as a species. It is our fate. I don't mean to dissuade blame from individuals, removing responsibility from personal action. I only intened to explain that we shouldn't expect success, we should expect blindingly stupid failure and then be pleasantly surprised when things aren't flubbed up. That's not being cynical or \\"realist\\". It is just recognizing human nature. Incompetence knows no boundaries of time or place.The Peter Principle when published in 1969 raised a storm because many did not want to accept that they existed at their level of incompetence. Business people didn't take it seriously because it was written tounge-in-cheek with full blown laugh out loud moments. Far different from the bland, dry language they were used to while obtaining their MBAs. I thoroughly enjoyed the book because it is an opportune time for me to examine if I have already achieved my level of incompetence.While the explanations of the Principle could easily be redundant... (the plot is summarized at the beginning as Dr. Peter states the principle) this book isn't redundant, like a Dilbert cartoon with some acute wisdom. Dr. Peter describes, through various case studies and examples, that every perceived exception to the Principle isn't really an exception at all. Complex hierarchies will see its members achieve the ominous final placement. Someday I too can reach this level.I can get stressed out while making poor decisions. I too can wear the badge of administrative \\"success\\": the ulcer.This might all seem a bit pessimistic. A little defeatist. But not at all. The solution is to focus our species on moving forward instead of upwards. We see our cohorts in groups struggling for status on a, \\"treadmill to oblivion.\\" But Dr. Peter clearly states that we can rescue ourselves by seeing where this unmindful escalation is leading us. If we focus on the quality of our situation we can achieve previously ignored success without obtaining a literal or figurative promotion.By applying this principle to our everyday experience, we witness many byproducts. For example, the applied Peter Principle approximates that employees in a hierarchy, \\"do not truly object to incompetence, they merely gossip about incompetence to mask their envy of employees who have pull.\\" ... with pull being the ability to develop a relationship with someone above you in the hierarchy who can pull you up with them. How poignant. We decry good \`ol boy networks but rarely focus on the one thing that could break them up, changing our focus from output to input. I can put in a 40-50 hour work week but would I be more productive if I worked 30-35 hours? We may never know because a full-time job insists that I work 40-50 crushing and life imbalancing hours. Society has focused on input in this situation. Can we think of a better solution to this situation? I'll apply Peter's Bridge to this question: if you can't think of a better solution you have already reached your level of incompetence.Although the observations made in the Peter Principle are obviously applicable to corporate environments, Laurence Peter made some other candid observations of society in these pages. Such as, exposing our modern caste system on p.64 and p.83 of the 2009 edition:...we have a class system, it is based not on birth but on the prestige of the university one has attended. The graduate of an obscure college does not have the same opportunity for promotion... but as college degrees become the prerequisite for more jobs, soon everyone will have access to his or her level of incompetence....with incompetent handling, the test system is only a disguised form of random placement. The purpose of testing is to place the employee as soon as possible in a job which will utilize the highest competence level on his profile. Obviously, any promotion will be to an area of less competence.Brilliant stuff that has played out over the last 30+ years just as Dr. Peter predicted."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"The Peter principle is a small book about hierarchies and how people act within the hierarchy. The peter principle itself states that \\"in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence\\".In the beginning, the book explains the law and it's difficult to actually determine the authors seriousness. The points he makes seem valid, at least according my person experiences. However, the way it's written and the some paragraphs clearly suggest a not that serious undertone.The further you read it the book, the more hilarious it becomes! In chapter 8 the author goes on to prove that Freud had actually reached his level of incompetence. Chapter 12 describes indicators for finding out if you've reached your level of incompetence, all having insane names. In chapter 15 he almost overdoes it when explaining that humans are hard on their way of reaching their level of incompence in the animal hierarchy...The book is extremly funny and well worth reading. I'd recommend that while reading, now and then put it aside and think about the things Peter has to say. It's hilarious and ... has some truth in it?"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"The author hit the nail on the head when he discovered this principle! After years of pondering whether it's just me or if there really is such a thing as companies with huge percentages of incompetent managers, I finally feel relieved to know that I was not 'just imagining' things. The book made me take a hard look at myself and question whether I had reached my own level of incompetence, and based on the case studies in the book I started analyzing what WOULD make me reach my level. One thing I would have like to read more about is how those of us who have not yet reached their level of incompetence, can better manage the struggle with those who have reached their level and make our work days miserable."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"This book is a satirical look at our highly achieving society. Work hard and you end up being incompetant. The authors make up a number of names for conditions and symptoms to attempt to say the choices you have in life are incompetancy or enjoyment through diversions. I started off reading it as a &quot;real&quot; social psychological work with testimonials and cases. By the end, the absurd diagnoses, which all of us show to some degree, made me realize that I believe the authors are just trying to say don't take your career too seriously."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"If you have ever reflected (whether in detached bemusement or disgust) on the sheer incompetence which seems to pervade your world, from your place of employment, to the businesses from which you purchase your everyday goods and services, to the financial and political spheres, you will very likely enjoy this book. Even if you know its basic premise, this little tome is worth a read. Though the work was first published more than forty years ago, hardly any part of it is dated. Quite to the contrary, the arrival of the latest edition in 2009 could not have been more timely. Indeed, some of its insights, for example the power of information technology to magnify the effects of incompetence, astonish, now more than ever, by their prescience. My favorite chapter explains the tendency of our political system to propel to the top politicians with minimal governing skills. You will probably find some agreement with Prof. Peter's observations on this point, whatever your political stripes. Finally, while its nomenclature and \\"case studies\\" are over the top, the book is, in my view, very funny, much as it is meant to be. One tip: read the introduction and the glossaries first; it'll add to the overall experience."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"I read The Peter Principle many years ago, saw the effects, and tell people about it, but some don't believe me!It is really sad that the problem has not been addressed and will only get worse with the resurgence of Socialism and bigger government. :("},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"Everyone should read this book as it will provide serious insight into incompetence. Not just in the workplace but in everyday life. The book details that everyone has a certain competence level at which they might excel but at some point their abilities will not provide what is needed without something additional. Ex; why does a successful high school football coach fail as a college coach. Ex; why does a successful salesman fail as a sales manager. This book can not only prevent you from attaining your level of incompetence but it can provide you with insight on how not to promote someone into their level of incompetence.I read the negative reviews and completely disagree with them. The book does not promote the power of negative thinking, it promotes the power of thinking. It teaches one to understand one's strengths and weaknesses and use that knowledge to determine if one is qualified to move to the next level or whether more learning and/or more skills are required. I would rather be a successful salesperson than a failed sales manager but if I know that I would fail as a sales manager, I can stay where I am at or determine and study what it would take for me to be a successful sales manager.If the \\"Peter Principle\\" were not so valid, why are there not millions of examples available to support it. Simply look around at individual failures of people that were previously successful. And look at those who continued to become successful. The difference will be that those that continued, knew what would be required (personally and corporately) to achieve success at each next level. If you do not understand what is required then you will fail. If you do not have the necessary skills and do not or cannot obtain them, then you will fail. To me that this the overriding tenet of this book.This book provides an outstanding look into the failings of individuals and companies and how to prevent it. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"The darkly humurous Peter Principal itself is easy to understand and witness in life. I mostly agree with the presentation of it. Fine. Write a pamphelt and be done with it? No, append more material and sell books, no matter how forced the extra bulk is. The book really gets tiresome when Peter tries to quantify and name (after himself) almost every aspect of organizational beheavior (real or otherwise). Nothing can be as precisely packaged as this diatribe attempts to do."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"I read this book with great enthusiasm, having heard so much about it.

So even granting that the readers with the motivation and intelligence to read social treatise are more motivated and intelligent, or at least more curious than average, what the data tells me is that the most favorable reviews are most likely from people on the cusp of the median, and that those that found it only amusing or maybe a harmless waste of time are the truly exceptional individuals.The authors have accomplished a great deal in making a social treatise a good read for so many - for myself I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it but scanned the first printing standing in the University Co-op Bookstore when I was eighteen. I must admit that I was idealistic enough then to hope that it was more satire than factual, but sadly I can now from the vantage of my age and experience concur with the authors' observations.

Such cases of management incompetence exist, of course, but in reality, things are just more complicated than that. The book does not even remotely consider the possibilty of people learning or advancing mentally - up to the point that even schoolchildren failing a grade are characterized as having reached their level of incompetence. The same gross oversimplification can be found throughout the entire book. It is an endless repetition of obviously fictitious examples of incompetence that serve to illustrate the dubious principles that it promotes. While the book never stops claiming its own scientificness, it provides little more than &quot;argument by repetition&quot;.The book culminates in praising the &quot;power of negative thinking&quot; and describing clever ways to avoid getting promoted. No doubt it can serve as an excuse for underachievers, but it does nothing to justify the popularity of &quot;Peter's principle&quot;."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong","review":"The Peter Principle is an excellent book, if you want to know the secret to FAILURE.Laurence Peter's self-proclaimed principle that \\"each person rises to their highest level of incompetence\\" only serves to demonstrate Peter's dislike for people and his own failure in life. It has been said that it takes no more than to read the first chapter of any book to determine whether or not the author likes people, meaning that the author is truly interested in telling a story, sharing facts regarding an issue or teaching a new-found knowledge to the reader. Peter on the other hand, begins assuming that people are inherently failures, and it is only a matter of time and effort before they become that. Peter's self-fulfilling prophesy, eeerrr, theory, is no better demonstrated than in his own book, the Peter Principle. It was the transition to his highest level of incompetence.I would not recommend this book to anyone who believes in leadership, success, the trail and tribulations on the road to success and the richness and diversity of people and the endurance of the human spirit.Napoleon Hill wrote in his book: Think and Grow Rich and I will paraphrase: The difference between those who are truly successful and those who are not is this, there are those who fail, fail and fail, then give up; they are the unsuccessful in life. Then there are those who fail, fail and fail, then get up; they are the truly successful. Unfortunately, Peter didn't realize the importance of encouraging people to succeed, instead he chose only to present the scenario that if you've done well, stop at that, you couldn't possibly get any better?!I suggest to the Amazon.com readers to save their time and money from this book."},{"Title":"Federal Bulldozer","review":"In the course of an hour long video taped interview back in 1999, Nobel lauriat economist Milton Friedman recommended this book. The context of his recommendation was during a discussion of the efficacy of the federal government's department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In my opinion, any book for which Milton Friedman volunteers a recommendation has to rate five stars."},{"Title":"Federal Bulldozer","review":"Well for one thing it's dated. It's also a statistical nightmare. And there's is nothing worse that analyzing dated statistics. However, the topic was of interest and so that made it worth it to me.

They aren't above using a few words that will make you scramble for an unabridged dictionary, either! Regardless of understandable errors, they are constantly dropping just the savory tidbits of detail that are so often missing from \\"modern\\" authors who are merely synthesizing what they've read elsewhere.I've read dozens of submarine books, so perhaps I didn't desperately need this one, but the first edition in the bookstore exuded a special charm from the post-WWII period. My edition is 11\\" x 8 1/2\\". I can't tell if the reprint is that big. Also the first edition includes a number of fold-out color maps. The paper isn't the best, but the printing is very good. Both the maps and the photos are on pages with more suitable paper. If you're going to plump to enjoy this period piece, I'd say spend a few extra bucks on this the 1st edition, if that's practical for you."},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"Sue Harrison gains five stars and then some in her novel Mother Earth Father Sky. She has out done even Jean Auel. Mother Earth Father Sky has a realistic style of writing that The Clan of the Cave Bear sometimes lacks.Sue's novel is incredibly well reserched down to every word.

I found this one more readable - even somewhat simplistic, BUT a real page-turner. A light enjoyable read that wisked me away to the past where survival hinged on courage and overcoming limitations - but not without heart. Sue Harrison uplifts the traditional roles of sexes. Chagak seems more human to me than Ayla (who seemed to magically be able to do everything).This book is provacative.

If that sounds boring, don't be fooled.To be honest, I hardly know what to say about this book. At the writing of this review, having just finished reading it I'm barely back to the here-and-now, and the story of Chagak is still fresh in my mind. To say that Sue Harrison wrote an amazing prehistoric fiction novel scarcely describes what she masterfully accomplished. Over the course of nine years she studied, researched and lived in her creative mind the tale of a long ago culture in Alaska, focusing on one Aleut woman's struggle to survive and overcome a very harsh reality. That woman, Chagak, lived in a primitive time consisting of warrior tribes, legends, crude customs, myths, and magic, but also love, family ties, and community. The author made it all come alive through the power of the written word in a very easy-to-read style. I was held from the beginning of this book to its last page - left wanting to read more about the people I had come to know.This book is not newly released but was published in 1990. I was fortunate to be gifted a copy and I'm so glad to have received it. If you come across Mother Earth Father Sky and you are not offended by the cruel reality and graphic descriptions of the belief system of prehistoric man, then do grab the opportunity to read this book."},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"This book is the first in a trilogy about the early native Americans of the Aluentain Islands on Alaska's rugged coast.

Although her life and time are so far removed from my own, I found much of her in myself. And as many have mentioned before, Ms. Harrison is impeccable in her research.

The author does a superb job at presenting both male and female aspects of this topic in a timeframe around 7,000 BC. Its not a 'chick book', but it is written by a woman and is primarily around a woman's point of view in a harsh world. Unlike a good many women authors, her presentation of the male perspective I found so natural that the gender of the author was really not evident in the read.

I give her a \\"thumbs up\\" for an interesting read."},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"Mother Earth Father Sky by Sue Harrison is a powerful book about a young woman who searches for a sense of belonging and ends up finding a whole new family, and, more importantly, she discovers more about her own character; through her journey, she lived through love, loss, and self-discovery. Chagak, of an Indian tribe, had just become a woman. While she was picking berries, her whole tribe was burned and killed; the only survivors were herself and her little brother Pup. After giving each one of the members of the tribe a proper ceremony of death, with her little brother, she decided to go to her grandfather's tribe to seek assistance. She ended up on an Island with a man named Shuganan. On this island, Pup died and Chagak grieved. Shuganan gave Chagak food, water, and shelter and they became friends. They shared their experiences and became very close.A man comes to the beach and claims that he is good, but in reality, he is a killer, which is explained in his name, Man-who-kills. He impregnates Chagak with force and is very brutal toward both her and to Shuganan. The two kill him and are free from his cruelty. She gives birth to the son and he is named Samiq.The story is then intelligently intertwined with the story of another tribe. These two tribes later meet and live amongst one another. The leader of that tribe is Kayugh and his son has not eaten healthy because his mother died and he couldn't be breastfed. Chagak agrees to feed him; she, in the end, saves his live.Chagak, traumatized over her experience with Man-who-kills, never wants another husband for fear of being treated so harshly. Kayugh wants her as his wife. You'll have to read the book to find out what happens next.Through Chagak's journey, she realizes that although she is a woman and is supposed to be inferior, she is still strong. She had the strength to bury her whole family, being raped and giving birth to the child as a result of that, and so much more.I really recommend this book because Sue Harrison really gives all her characters a unique personality. She brings her characters, including the whole book to life; it's like your watching a movie and not really reading. In addition to this, Harrison did a lot of research on the Native American culture, which brings out the richness and virtues of their lifestyle. The story shows how a woman can have strength within and use it to persevere and overcome any obstacles."},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"Chagrak is a young prehistoric girl whose village is massacred by evil foreigners called short ones.. She flees the village with her little brother. Later she encounters an elderly hermit and lives with him until the Short Ones arrive and make trouble. Can Chagrak fight back and reclaim her dignity?I found Mother Earth Father Sky a gripping read from start to finish. It was difficult at times putting it down. The cover itself is nothing much... So don't let it fool you. If you like Prehistoric fiction, you'll like this one. Downsides? The beginning where the heroine's village is massacred is very cliche. Also, Chagrak is only 13, and while I know this was considered an adult back then I had difficulty envisioning her being quite that resilient. Finally, her relationship at the end seemed passionless and uninteresting. I would've liked to see some attraction between the two. There was more of a bond between her and Shuganan despite his age.5 stars.

I feel a bit nostalgic for simpler times....is all our progress in this electronic age really that when we are unable to connect with Nature and feel our contribution to the family and community (as described well in this book)?"},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"I too am spoiled by the great storytelling abilities of Jean Auel in the Clan of the Cave Bear series. However, when I found some early North American prehistory fiction, I have been compelled to read them, one after another.Sue does have an interesting style, a lovely and sometimes terrifying way of describing a situation or scene that makes you feel like you are there. However, I was disappointed that she doesn't follow up on scenes she has created. For example, when one character gets beaten, his rib broken and also his arm, by the time we get to the next chapter, which takes place 3 days later, he is practically well, and can lift his arms and pull and carve and so on.Perhaps it is part of the development of a writer to make these types of mistakes in order to become a better writer. But it lacks believability for the reader.However, I do look forward to finishing her series."},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"The one thing that people look for in a book is suspense andexcitement, right? Well, Mother Earth Father Sky is that and somuch more. I have read a lot of good books, but this one is byFAR the best one yet. It is packed with suspense and will keepyou yearning for more until the end. I never thought that anyonecould write such an exquisite piece, especially a book writtenabout prehistoric Natives. But Sue Harrison obviously proved mewrong. Chagak, a beautiful Aleut Indian, is faced with manydifficult, and sometimes deadly, decisions and conflicts withherself and other people (some of whom she thought she wouldnever meet). This novel is full of rich detail, aiding in thespectacular suspense that is out of this world. This is a storyof trust, parenthood, survival, and so much more. It amazes mehow easy this book was to follow, even with all of its twists andturns. The reader gets a real feel for life in prehistorictimes, which is quite the journey.I would not be saying enoughto call this novel a true masterpiece. I applaud Sue Harrisonfor writing such a moving treasure. Mother Earth Father Sky canbe cherished by all teenagers and adults alike. It isdefinitely worth your while to go and read this book. You willnever regret that you did. Thanks, Sue!"},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"Sue Harrison's writing style and content will give you much enjoyment."},{"Title":"Mother Earth Father Sky","review":"Perhaps I was spoiled. I fell in love with Ayla (Clan of the Cave Bear series), and cried when Kwani died (She Who Remembers series). To me, Chagak paled in comparison. The other books seemed to draw me in from the beginning, make me wish I had lived in their time. In this book, I did not find my adrenaline pounding, or the next page screaming to be turned. Don't get me wrong, the book had its moments and was not at all bad. I was just hoping for something more after the reviews and recommendations.

Her love life is shot to hell, she has hypercritical parents, and she can see 40 on the horizon. The unnamed narrator decides to write herself a letter each year on her birthday. They function as a sort of State of the Union address and the novel is structured around these letters. Containing 7 letters in all, we watch a woman struggle to find love and survive her bickering parents for just one night a year.I loved this novel! I laughed aloud so many times as I was reading. It is a fairly short novel, just a little over 200 pages and it read very quickly. The narrator is instantly likeable and easy to relate to. Markoe has a knack for the Chick Lit genre and I will definitely be checking out some of her other work."},{"Title":"The Lenses of Gender: Transforming the Debate on Sexual Inequality","review":"I focused on gender and sexuality in college and I have to say that of all the books I own on this subject, this is the book I'm most likely to lend someone. &quot;The Lenses of Gender&quot; is an excellent work for academics and newcomers to the field alike. It is alos a good read for those of us who are deeply mired in gender studies already. Sandra Lipsitz Bem does a great job of stepping back to provide a nice overview, leaving us some useful concepts and tools along the way. I must also thank her for not writing bisexuality out of the picture...one of the many topics still controversial among otherwise open-minded people, the author manages to be inclusive and positive. She doesn't resort to the kind of blustery didactic arguments that mar the writing of so many cultural critics. This is something that I can't praise highly enough. Perhaps that's the most groundbreaking aspect of this book. Take a look at it. &quot;The Lenses of Gender&quot; is good for a wide audience and offers a lot to think about."},{"Title":"The Lenses of Gender: Transforming the Debate on Sexual Inequality","review":"This is a great book that details the dynamics that may propagate gender inequality.

This English translation, done by Vladimir Morosan, was published by St. Vladimir's Seminary Press in 1980.The author states at the outset of his preface: &quot;The present work is intended as an aid to those who feel the necessity of gaining deeper understanding of the liturgical singing of the Russian Orthodox Church, not only in its present-day practical forms, but also in its theoretical essence and thousand year history.&quot;While von Gardner accomplishes his goal with clarity and scholarly precision, it serves and an excellent introduction to the music of all Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the Greek, and the Arab-based Antiochian Orthodox Church (of which I am a relatively new member). In discussing the establishment of Orthodox Christianity on American and Western European soil the translator states in his preface, &quot;...the parishes established by the Church of Russia have naturally preserved the choral tradition of the Mother-Church, and even parishes from Greek or Syrian traditions of monodic chant have in some instances adopted Russian choral singing under the influence of the prevailing choral milieu of the West.&quot;It cannot be stressed enough, as is stated on the back-cover summary, &quot;the music of the Orthodox Church cannot be understood in purely aesthetic categories, apart from the liturgical context which determines both its content and its function.&quot; That's really what this book is all about, how the music and liturgy are inseparable.Although I have many years of experience directing choirs and leading worship services in Protestant Churches, I discovered that as I began tackling the job of directing our Orthodox parish choir (on a part-time basis), that it was like learning a new language. This book goes a long way toward helping the reader become familiar with that new language, but one can only learn to &quot;speak it&quot; by full immersion in the services of the Orthodox Church.Below are the titles for each of the four chapters:The System of Orthodox Liturgical Singing: Concepts and TerminologyThe Liturgical System of the Orthodox ChurchThe System of Russian Liturgical SingingPeriodization of Russian Liturgical SingingI would definitely agree with those who recommended this book to me, it is an excellent introduction, however if you have no first-hand experience with Orthodox liturgies, I would think that much of this book would be an academic exercise.At times, the reader may feel overwhelmed with too much information, or with unfamiliar terminology, but for someone like me who wants to get to the heart of this glorious worship experience, it's worth the effort."},{"Title":"Refrigerator Repair Under $40 (The No Headache Guide to Home Repair Series)","review":"This book is great for repairing refrigerators, which are quite simple mechanically since you don't really deal with the sealed system which should last 30+ years.

Most of the space travelers lie in suspended animation awaiting the moment of awakening. One of those ships Hope has landed on a planet Ararat that appears favorable for human habitation though the eerie ruins of a great civilization scar the surface.After a murder occurs in the fledgling colony, Matthew Fleury is awakened to replace the victim. Being an ecologist he begins to search for clues as to the identity of the killer fearing he could be next as his position might be the motive for the homicide. He wonders if the killer is a human who wants to leave, one who want to stay, or perhaps a sentient native. Matt begins a journey amidst the strange planet seeking the truth.The fifth in Brian Stableford's futuristic Emortality science fiction series, DARK ARARAT is a cerebral tale with plenty of action and adventure starring a wonderful though egocentric hero. The story line employs a scientific grounded ecosystem based on dual coded genome rather than the earthly DNA. That makes for quite an alien trip as everything appears different to the senses yet seems so real. The mystery adds a twisting depth yet cleverly ties back to the prime plot of exploring Ararat. This novel may be the best story in one of the great series of the last decade, as Mr. Stableford returns to the roots of science fiction by encouraging his audience to philosophize about what is life within a powerhouse of an adventure.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dark Ararat","review":"In the fifth volume of his Emortality series, Stableford awakens his protagonist, evangelical ecologist Matthew Fleury, from coldsleep 700 years into interstellar space and three years into the establishment of a fledgling colony on an alien planet, Ararat, which may or may not be already inhabited by a humanoid race. Matthew's awakening - to take the place of a murdered ecologist - drops him in the midst of a roiling conflict between colonists and ship's crew. In the course of the journey, the crew's view of their mission has evolved and separated from that of their human cargo. They no longer wish to nurture a single colony but see themselves as explorers of the galaxy. The crew is insisting on the colony's success, despite misgivings from the colonists. Matthew, and a policeman awakened along with him, are expected to solve the murder and get the colony back on track.The world itself is a strange place, it's flora and fauna based not on DNA but on a dual coding genome, which, as Stableford depicts it, changes evolutionary strategies and affects everything from feeding to reproduction. Animals with the ability to photosynthesize, for instance. Widespread chimeras.Fleury, reserving judgment as he reviews all factions, explores the ruins of an alien city, beginning to piece together an overview of the ecology even before he and three other colonists set out on a river voyage of exploration, which introduces them to some of the planet's larger and more fearsome inhabitants. Along the way, Fleury also discovers the murderer's identity but it seems almost beside the point, as it is to the other colonists.Fleury is a likable protagonist and the book easily stands alone, while the dual-coding biology is an entertaining brain teaser."},{"Title":"Dark Ararat","review":"Dark Ararat is the fifth novel in Brian Stableford's ambitious future history of an Earth wracked by biological catastrophe, and of human \\"emortality\\". It is sort of an offshoot. At the beginning of the 22nd century as Earth seemed to face certain disaster, a series of generation ships were launched. One of these ships has arrived after hundreds of years at a new planet. Biologist and TV personality Matthew Fleury is awakened to find that things aren't going quite as planned. The crew of the ship, adapted over generations to onboard life, wants to drop off the colonists and continue traveling. But the first wave of colonists is not sure this new planet can be made habitable. And one of Fleury's colleagues has just been murdered. It is his job, along with a policeman revived along with him, to both investigate the murder, and to investigate the biological mysteries of the planet.Not surprisingly it is the scientific mystery which dominates. Life on this planet is organized around a very different encoding molecule to DNA, and one result of this is that most organisms are some form of chimera. There are also hints of possible intelligent life, and there are hints that this chimerization may result in another form of emortality. Fleury investigates all these things, at the same time giving us a neat tour of the strange planet, while he and the policeman somewhat perfunctorily solve the murder mystery. The eventual scientific explanation is rather clever, though on a few grounds I was underwhelmed. One shortcoming may lie with me: I couldn't quite grasp all the scientific details. Another is quite common in my experience of Stableford: his portrayal of human relationships, especially romantic ones, is very distanced, and it is hard to get inside his characters. Finally, the wrapping up is very rapid, and perhaps too convenient. Still, it's in many ways a neat book - good SF for SF's sake."},{"Title":"Dark Ararat","review":"Matthew Fleury had been a prophet of Earth's destruction and the need to flee to the stars to seek a new earth--one that humanity had not destroyed and where mankind could form a new home. As prophet and ecologist, he had been allowed to join mankind's first exploration of extra-solar space. When he awakens hundreds of years after departure, he finds that the ship has found a new world, but the world is not exactly an earth-clone. He is awakened because his counterpart, the ships other ecologist, has been killed--possibly by humanoid aliens.Matthew's search for truth on this strange planet makes up the bulk of the novel. Author Brian Stableford manages hard science fiction with a vengence. The novel is full of information about DNA, evolution, and possible ways that evolution could have gone differently. And on Ararat, it certainly did evolve differently without using DNA.Characters are certainly not Stableford's strong point--and Matthew never really seems to have the motivation and drive to be both a prophet of the old world's end or of a new beginning for this new earth. With paragraph after paragraph of clunky dialogue, I sometimes found myself wishing that Stableford had internalized the old writer's cliche about showing-not-telling. Still, the subject matter of DARK ARARAT and the obvious importance of both first contact and what Stableford refers to as emortality make this novel worth reading--and worth reflecting upon."},{"Title":"Dark Ararat","review":"Its a must read !

The two books differ in several ways -- Salgo also focuses on aspirin and an infection that many Americans may harbor, Bernstein on the benefits of ACE inhibitors, etc. -- and I think the Bernstein book is a little more repetitive than the Salgo book and perhaps written on a slightly more casual level. But what's remarkable, to me at least, is that these books agree on the usefulness of statins, in fact on the crucial NEED for them: that is, the need to take them NOW instead of waiting till you've suffered a heart attack (when these drugs are generally prescribed). The two physicians are bluntly dismissive of the conventional wisdom that one should attempt to control cholesterol primarily by exercising more and altering one's diet. They don't say that these are bad choices, simply that they don't help very much; exercise and diet are relatively ineffective because 80 percent of one's cholesterol level is genetically determined and is not amenable to lifestyle changes. Salgo and Bernstein are, I think, rather courageous in advocating a solution so unfashionable; indeed, they are &quot;thinking the unthinkable&quot; -- that there IS a sort of pharmacological &quot;quick fix&quot; that happens to be safe and inexpensive; that swallowing some pills every day will actually lengthen our lives; and no doubt there are many well-meaning souls who will try to shout them down. I suspect, though, having read both books and having found them both persuasive, that Americans might well live significantly longer if they followed these doctors' advice."},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","review":"You don't need a medical background to know that a healthy lifestyle will prevent heart disease and help reverse it if you already have it. One of the reviewers praised this book because it doesn't focus on diet, but having a healthy diet is good for the heart. I am always supicious of &quot;quick-fix&quot; approaches to complicated problems and this book falls into that category. I think we are far too quick to rush to instant solutions instead of doing the hard work we need to do in order to maintain our health and correct our problems. Who knows what information will come out about statin drugs in the future, just like doctors are now worried about resistance to antibiotics because antibiotics have been so overused. Old-fashioned approaches like diet and exercise should be the foundation of a heart program. Then if that doesn't work, maybe you need medicine."},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","review":"This book is deeply problematic. The authors recommend a cardiac care program consisting essentially of three components--statins, aspirin and chlamydia testing. There is increasing evidence that statin drugs are linked to muscle wasting conditions, fatigue, memory loss and other problematic symptoms, even when liver enzymes are normal. Too many people who complain of these symptoms to physicians are told that these are just &quot;normal signs of aging.&quot; That's not true! There are excellent, responsible, integrative methods that can reduce cholesterol and cardiac inflammation without such dangerous means. At least they should be tried, before statin treatment is initiated. Exercise, dietary changes, stress reduction and other means are de-emphasized in this book, and these should form the mainstays of a good cardiac care program. As a medical social worker who deals with cardiac patients, I work with many physicians, including cardiologists, who were appalled."},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","review":"I found &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; extremely interesting, thought provoking and hightly believable because it was so well documented with a bibliography with listed source materials from respected national journals less than four or five years old!

What do I plan to do with the information - don't know yet - I'm still thinking Wow!"},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","review":"I was lucky to stumble across an advance reading copy of Peter Salgo's book &quot;The Heart of the Matter,&quot; written with Joe Layden. I love Joe Layden's books, he is an expert at every kind of expository writing, and he's very good at translating the language of public figures into a sturdy prose tailored to each figure he's ghosting for. He's the one who wrote the Rock's autobiography. But now that he has worked with Peter Salgo he has actually done something of a public service.Salgo's three-pronged prescription may be controversial--and indeed so simple that you could condense the message of this book into 10 words or less, like an old time telegram--but I feel confident that he is on the right track. And so does my own cardiologist. Maybe in the future we will all be learning a pattern of dependence on statins as a daily thing, the way we learn to brush our teeth. And keeping chlamydia at bay is bound to be a good thing in the long run. Good work, Salgo and Layden."},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","review":"This book is an easy read and very informative. The information in The Heart of The Matter is real breakthrough knowledge on curing heart disease and heart attack. This is not just another useless diet book. Dr. Peter Salgo works in an intensive care unit and sees first hand what's going on with hearts. He knows that merely eating lettuce is not going to lower cholesterol and cure heart attack the way the statins and the three step plan he outlines in this book will. This is an important read for everyone, especially those with a history of family heart disease. This book could save your life. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Heart of the Matter","review":"All I can say is how great this book is.It is written in a simple to understand language.It made me think about my own life and how I live it.I made an appointment to see my doctor after reading this book.And, I'm bringing Dr. Salgo's book with me.I reccomend this book highly."},{"Title":"Wonderful Nature, Wonderful You","review":"I bought this book because I was meeting the illustrator.

The text uses a compare/contrast format throughout, so can be referred to often to reinforce this important comprehension skill. Written in rhyme, it is useful for word study, as well as for writing style lessons. The large humorous illustrations and brief text on each page made this a popular book for the reluctant readers in my 3rd grade classroom to revisit at independent reading time. For any elementary teacher, I recommend this book as a worthwhile and motivating reading resource.For further resources for intermediate or older students exploring a cultural unit on Japan, try \\"Japanese Celebrations\\" by the same author. It's chock full of information about festivals in Japan."},{"Title":"Tokyo Friends","review":"This book is so cute!!! I love it!!! And it's so helpful!!

Thanks again Amazon!! The book is great!!! And was in terrific condition! &lt;3"},{"Title":"Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy","review":"Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy edited by Len Sperry, Edward P. Shafranske (American Psychological Association) Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy is the first book to critically and coherently survey how spirituality can be incorporated into a range of psychotherapeutic approaches, including psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, humanistic, interpersonal, transpersonal, and others. Volume editors Len Sperry and Edward P. Shafranske, both well recognized as outstanding scholars, bring together a stellar group of contributors to describe the theoretical and clinical basis for their approaches and to illustrate their clinical application. A uniform structure across chapters and an integrative final chapter allow for easy comparison of the approaches. The volume editors examine current and future issues as well as the legacy of the psychoanalytic and Jungian foundations of spiritually oriented psychotherapy. This volume demonstrates the utility and accessibility of examining the spiritual dimension in therapy. It is likely to become a vital resource for the experienced clinician and the standard text for graduate programs in clinical, counseling, and consulting psychology and clinical social work.Excerpt: Our basic intention in compiling this book was to invite creators or prominent advocates of the best known and regarded spiritually oriented psychotherapeutic approaches to share both the theoretical model on which their approaches were based and compelling case material to illustrate these approaches. Our primary goal was to make this book as reader-friendly as an edited textbook can be. To this end, we charged contributors with presenting their approaches in an engaging style and follow a consistent framework to foster the reader's journey within and across chapters. To assist readers in comparing and analyzing the difference among these approaches, we believed that a separate chapter should provide a side-by-side, point-by-point comparisons of these major approaches. We also believed that it was important not only to situate the trend toward spiritually oriented psychotherapies in its historical context but also to provide the reader with some sense of the future context, that is, theoretical and clinical developments, opportunities, and challenges. The book consists of three parts that are briefly described here.Part I, \\"Theoretical Foundations,\\" introduces the reader to the basic issues involving the integration of spirituality in psychotherapeutic practice. The first chapter addresses the spiritual dimension and its implications for psychotherapy, and chapters 2 and 3 delineate the foundations of spiritually oriented psychotherapy as they evolved from psychoanalysis and Jungian-archetypal analysis.Part II, \\"Contemporary Approaches,\\" describes and illustrates 10 con-temporary approaches to spiritually oriented psychotherapy: psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, existential-humanistic, interpersonal, transpersonal, experiential focusing, forgiveness, theistic, soul care-spiritual direction, and integrative. The structure of each of the chapters in Part II follows a common outline. As noted earlier, a common outline structures the description and illustrative case material so that the reader can more easily follow and compare the various approaches. Each approach provides the following theoretical information: The historical and theoretical basis of the approach includes a description of both the historical circumstances and the professional(s) who created to the approach, as well as the main theoretical constructs that undergird it. The nature of the relationship between psycho-therapy and spirituality is then explained and articulated with regard to its clinical implications. The therapist's skills and attributes necessary for effectively utilizing the approach are then discussed. Indicated are the professional requisites in terms of skills, training, and experience, as well as the personal attributes that a therapist should possess to utilize the approach effectively. Next, the strengths and limitations of the approach are briefly addressed, including theoretical and practical strengths and weaknesses and the appeal of the approach for certain groups of psychologists and therapists.The indications and contraindications for the use of the approach are then addressed-specifically, which diagnostic conditions and spiritual and religious issues are most appropriate and effectively addressed by this approach, and which are less appropriate. Next, cultural and gender considerations that may affect the therapeutic process are briefly considered, particularly those that might influence therapeutic process and outcome. Finally, future developments and directions of the approach are briefly noted. These include theoretical and research developments, as well as cultural trends, that are anticipated to affect the approach in the near future. Some approaches have considerably more empirical support than others, and this is not surprising given that some approaches are relatively new. A revised edition could conceivably update both theoretical and empirical developments.Each approach provides the following clinical information in terms of an extensive case example that illustrates its clinical application: The case begins with client demographics, history, and presenting concern. This section describes relevant client data (i.e., gender, age, religious history and upbringing, current affiliation, spiritual practices, level of devoutness and orthodoxy), relevant client history (i.e., family, social, physical health history), and presenting client problem(s) and concern(s). Next, the relation-ship of therapist and client is discussed. This includes the nature of the therapeutic relationship (i.e., the therapist and client as collaborators, the therapist as expert and the client as learner, the therapist as spiritual director and the client as directee, the therapist and client as fellow travelers on the spiritual journey). Because of its importance in the therapeutic process, assessment is then considered. The rationale for assessment are discussed (i.e., how it relates to the basic constructs of the approach, the assessment process and methods, and the type of personality and psychological, diagnostic, and religious and spiritual history and information collected). This may include a formal spiritual assessment with inquires about the client's spiritual beliefs and spiritual practices or disciplines. Next is the diagnostic and clinical case conceptualization section, which provides a summary of the diagnostic formulation, usually in terms of DSM-IV Axes I and II, as well as a clinical conceptualization or formulation that provides an explanation for how the presenting problem or concern relates, or may relate, to the client's religious background and spiritual factors in the client and his or her context. Then the treatment goals, process, and intervention strategies of the case are noted, indicating specific goals and objectives as well as psychological and spiritual interventions for attaining those goals. This is followed by a timeline of the course of treatment and frequency and duration of sessions. Here the typical duration of treatment for this approach and the expected frequency and duration of sessions are indicated. Next is a discussion of termination and relapse prevention, which describes indicators for termination and the process of terminating treatment. If relapse prevention is integral to a given approach, it is briefly described in this section. Finally, therapeutic out-comes: immediate and long term are discussed (i.e., the extent to which treatment goals were achieved in this particular case, as well as the client's overall level of spiritual and psychological functioning, at 6 and 12 months following termination).The 10 approaches described in Part II are applicable to the majority of North American and European readers. We are not suggesting that these represent all possible spiritual approaches to psychotherapy, and we recognize that contributing authors have presented case examples that do not rep-resent the full scale of diversity at this time. It would be our intent to include additional and more diverse approaches in a revised edition.Part III, \\"Commentary and Critical Analysis,\\" contains the final two chapters. The first is a comparative analysis that includes a detailed side-by-side comparison of the 10 approaches along with narrative commentary. The second addresses future directions in spiritually oriented psychotherapy and speculates on various theoretical and clinical developments as well as issues such as training, scope of practice, and related ethical and praxis issues."},{"Title":"Spiritually Oriented Psychotherapy","review":"But I am glad that it was, because I may not have bought it otherwise, and would have missed out on awesome work. For anyone who recognizes the value of integrating spirituality with psychotherapy, this is a wonderful volume that addresses different approaches to working with clients holistically."},{"Title":"Russia's Life-Saver: Lend-Lease Aid to the U.S.S.R. in World War II","review":"The long-time observer and analyst of the Soviet Union, Prof. Weeks documents an important chapter of US and Soviet history during World War II.Based on the latest research from Russia, Weeks presents new findings about the vital importance of US aid to the Soviet Union of Dictator Joseph Stalin. Under the Soviet Regime, especially during Stalin's life-time, it was a rule to ignore or at least downplay the significance of any foreign aid to the Soviet victory in World War II. But the facts that Prof. Weeks is able to present to the Western reader demonstrate the opposite. Weeks cites a recent statement by President Putin, who officially acknowledged the vital importance of US Lend-Lease deliveries for the Soviet victory in World War II.Weeks uses research by post-Soviet scholars in Russia that clearly shows crucial importance of Lend-Lease deliveries to Stalin's USSR. There are many facts and statistics about the amount of American aid to Russia that will be new to most readers. But Prof. Weeks doesn't stop there, he also paints a lively picture of the political developments leading to the decision of President Roosevelt to come to the rescue of the bloodiest Dictator of the 20th century, Joseph Stalin, in his fight against his opponent and recent collaborator, Hitler.Prof. Weeks also demonstrates that Stalin was actively working through the channels of his espionage agencies to influence the US administration to deliver material aid to the USSR (he cites the Venona decrypts and material from Russia, most notably the NKVD's \\"Operation Snow\\"). It becomes clear that the large-scale infiltration of various US government branches by the Soviet espionage agencies played an important role in the speedy decision to send vast amounts of military and civilian goods to Stalin's Soviet Union. Stalin also ordered his agents to obtain military secrets from the US, both before and during the war, even when the Soviet Union was a nominal ally of the US.At times, aid to the USSR was given priority over aid to Britain by President Roosevelt. Roosevelt's dubious and na?ve role in his dealings with Stalin is presented in some detail as well.Weeks also shows that Stalin always rightly understood the might and potential of the American economic potential. US technical assistance had already played a major role in the mechanisation of both the Soviet agriculture and the Red Army. Stalin has been able to use the huge \\"tractor factories\\", built with the help of Ford, among others, to establish the necessary industrial base for the mechanisation of his huge tank forces before the outbreak of the Second World War.The excellent mastery of both Russian and Soviet history allows the author to put the history of Lend-Lease into the wider context of American-Russian and American-Soviet political and economic relations, starting in Tsarist times.After presenting Stalin's offensive war plans against Hitler in his equally superb book \\"Stalin's Other War. Soviet Grand Strategy 1939-45\\", Weeks again delivers important historical facts and puts them into proper context.Despite the amount of data (quite rightfully) used in the book, Weeks' writing style makes reading about this often neglected aspect of history easy.For any serious student of US-Soviet war-time relations, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Russia's Life-Saver: Lend-Lease Aid to the U.S.S.R. in World War II","review":"Every student of 20th-century history knows that the Marshall Plan reconstructed Western Europe after World War II, but not so many know that America's Lend-Lease aid played a comparable role in winning the war itself.This is because the main recipient of the aid, the Soviet Union, consistently downplayed its significance, not wanting to acknowledge the weaknesses in its system of government. Every Soviet leader, from Stalin toGorbachev, pretended that American aid was just something extra, almost a trifle, while state historians assigned it an arbitrary figure of 4 percent of the Soviet war production. Those historians abroad who accepted Soviet statistics perpetuated this myth. Now Albert Weeks sets the record straight.After the collapse of the Soviet system, Russian historians were able to look into the archival files and total up the real figures. One study, by M.N. Suprin, calculates the caloric content of Lend-Lease foodstuffs sent to the USSR, divides the total by the caloric needs of the Red Army and arrives at a stunning conclusion: \\"The foodstuffs provided by Lend-Lease to the USSR would have sufficed to feed an army of ten million men for 1,688 days, that is, for the course of the entire war.\\" Another study, by Boris Sokolov, which translates as THE TRUTH ABOUT THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR, estimates that the US supplied 92.7% of the USSR's railroad equipment, including locomotives and rails, and from 15% to 90% of production in all other categories. Weeks, who reads Russian, surveys these recent studies and cites them to show that Lend-Lease was indeed \\"Russia's Life-Saver.\\"Beyond the raw figures, Weeks also explains the politics and inner workings of Lend-Lease, which President Roosevelt called the US \\"arsenal of democracy.\\" As a longtime expert on Soviet Russia, he is able to explore the special relationship that FDR thought he had with Stalin, to sort out the Soviet spies operating on US soil and to look into such interesting topics as Armand Hammer's role in US-USSR relations. As an engaging writer, he handles the historical material with a modern sensibility, raising the questions of \\"trusting and verifying\\" and \\"the gratitude factor.\\" I particularly liked his chapter on the USS Liberty Ship John Barry, which was sunk in the Arabian Sea by aNazi U-boat in August 1944. Its cargo included trucks, jeeps, steel rails and other standard provisions, but also 750 boxes of silver coins and, it is believed, $26 million of silver ingots. Was the ship headed for Iran, a transfer point for goods to the USSR? Was the bullion a gift from FDR to Uncle Joe? It's one of the many fascinating questions raised by this book. (See also STALIN'S SILVER by John Beasant.) The book concludes with some valuable tables of the standard Lend-Lease shipments.RUSSIA'S LIFE-SAVER, in short, is another first-rate study by Albert Weeks. If you are interested in World War II, you will want this book. The publisher has set a high price on it, so if you can't afford it yourself ask your library to buy it. Every library should have it for today's readers and for future reference."},{"Title":"Russia's Life-Saver: Lend-Lease Aid to the U.S.S.R. in World War II","review":"\\"Russia's Life-Saver\\", the paperback, sheds a little light upon the intrigues of Pre-World War 2 and the assistance America gave to Stalinist Russia during the War. The disconcerting aspects of this paperback edition, are the misspelled words, which might reflect negatively upon the publisher or editor. Overlooking the obvious errors, the information assisted with my research, especially the tables of information. Overall, valuable for historians of World War 2 and family members who served in the military and merchant marines dealing with the Lend-Lease program products to Russia."},{"Title":"Russia's Life-Saver: Lend-Lease Aid to the U.S.S.R. in World War II","review":"\\"Russia's Life Saver\\" does a superb job of showing just how vital American Lend Lease was to the victory of the U.S.S.R. during World War Two. Two items in particular were of gret help to the Soviets - the American made winter jackets and Studebaker trucks. American radios also enabled the Soviets to coordinate their tank operations on the battlefield.Tremendous quantities of American foodstuffs fed the famished Red Army. Over 90% of Russia's locomotives and transport to fuel the war effort came from America.One point on which Week's can be challenged is trying to trace the origins of Lend Lease back to 19th century Russian-American relations. Those surely existed but more probably it was the product of Roosevelt's insane pro-Communism - a point that Albert Weeks does not deny.The book is extremely well-researched and shows the crime committed by America in supporting the wrong side in WW2. Without America, Stalin might well have gone down."},{"Title":"The Secret Ways","review":"\\"The Secret Ways\\" is Alistair Maclean's well-written novel about a British secret agent on a mission inside Hungary at the height of the Cold War. Many readers have forgotten how hard-fought the Cold War was for the United States and its Western Allies; very few ever knew how much more desperate it was for the inhabitants of countries under the thumb of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe in the late 1950's.Michael Reynolds, Maclean's protagonist, is no superman. He doesn't have any fancy technology but he is well-trained and resourceful. His biggest advantages against a cruel and efficient Hungarian Secret Service are an ability to make commonsense decisions and the heroic help of dedicated friends in the Hungarian underground. The plot has the twists, turns, and betrayals in which Maclean specialized. Maclean's characters are often cynical and without illusion about the causes they serve, yet they are sympathetic and interesting people. The suspense is good to the very last page as Reynolds scrambles to complete his mission and escape to the West.This book is highly recommended to fans of Cold War spy fiction and to fans of Alistair Maclean."},{"Title":"The Secret Ways","review":"Maclean knows how to write a story. He takes you along, fast, with a man deep in enemy space, on a vital mission at long odds: yet you can tell right away that this is the kind of man you'd want by your side in such circumstances.

I found the book being slightly boring until I was two thirds through it, then the action picked up rapidly and didn't stop until the very end - a very typical MacLean end with the hero and the beautiful lady happy and safe. The book is a great read, if only for the way he shows the life in a Communist country and for the highly pacifistic views expressed by one of the main characters"},{"Title":"The Secret Ways","review":"Alistair MacLean combines psychology, action, history, sociology, and intrigue into a wonderful spy story. The hero potrtays a tried and true James Bond without the condescending attitude. There's none better."},{"Title":"The Secret Ways","review":"One must wonder if Alistair MacLean ever served as a British Secret Service agent (he did serve in the Navy during the Second World War); his tales are so plausible, and characters so purposefully flawed, they seem to be a re-telling of real-life events.Michael Reynolds is not Robert Langdon. He doesn't produce miracles from his back pocket while falling from 13,000 feet. Our hero in The Secret Ways is a well-trained, conditioned-to-kill secret service agent who is extricated from complex situations countless times by peers (and enemies themselves!). He relies on unimpaired judgment, common sense, and possesses a faculty of wit and courage.The title, though somewhat awkward in my opinion, references the clandestine techniques utilized by both sides of the story. The Hungarians have their \\"secret ways\\" of propelling propagandistic motives and the British have their ways of countering and annihilating such tactics. In a sense, the title is a direct reference to Michael Reynolds.MacLean takes a subtler approach to this novel. Reynolds character reminded me of a more subdued version of Philip Calvert, hero from When Eight Bells Toll. He questions himself consistently, makes errors, and saves lives.The writing style (told in the third person) is different. Rather than focusing on the action of the story, MacLean leans into the landscape and describes the surroundings with more attention than he has in previous novels. There are lengthy discourses between characters regarding country reformation and politics in general. There are moments when MacLean purposely slows the story down, explicitly describing a state or emotion a character may be experiencing.The Secret Ways is probably the most realistic book of his I have read. Due to the heavy (albeit significant) nature of politics in areas, it is a slower read. The action sequences, of which there are countless, quickly make up for this. But the variety of characters and their camaraderie here will keep the reader from feeling isolated. And Reynolds's touching episode with a handkerchief filled my eyes with tears, something I didn't expect from a MacLean novel.I read the 1959 Fawcett Gold Medal edition. My dictionary dash included concomitant (33), mulct (68), percipience (46), perspicuity (123), and intransigence (151)."},{"Title":"The Secret Ways","review":"I've enjoyed Alistair MacLean's books for decades. That's why I set up AlistairMacLean.com, a site where I review all his thriller books and many of the movies based on them.MacLean wrote some good novels, some fair-to-mediocre ones (near the end of his career), and a handful of downright great ones. The Secret Ways tops my personal list. The action is realistic; the characters, powerfully drawn and memorable. Even the romantic angle (often a weak point in MacLean's writing) plays well here. And the final showdown scene is an epically drawn, multifaceted gem.Not every moment is dramatic. One of the main characters spends a few pages lecturing the protagonist about the worldwide political situation (particularly as it relates to communism). You can skip this if you choose; I found it a welcome real-world connection of the type that's missing from too many novels.While a couple of scenes do strain the bounds of believability, overall this is a taut page-turner you won't soon forget. It gets my highest recommendation.

Oxford has a compact KJV out that is nice, but now that we're almost 400 years out from when King James was published in 1611, nothing is lost with the New King James Version. In fact, it seems a more accurate read, since this version corrects some of the inaccuracies in the KJV that were inaccurately translated from the Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew back then.Although it's a paperback, the cover is made of very thick cardstock and lightly laminated, so it should be both resilient and durable for a good number of years under heavy use. The translators for this version include their footnotes at the bottom of the page; the words of Christ are actually in maroon instead of red, so it's far easier to see, especially if you're an older reader; the chapters have in-text subject headings; and finally there is a select concordance and dictionary at the back - all this in a book that fits neatly into your hand or pocket and is only 1.1 inches thick!

With pages four-by-six, and its light weight, it is a very convenient and &quot;carry-with-able&quot; publication of the Scriptures.Are there quibbles? The reviewer deplores the absence of the Apocrypha from most paperback mass-market Bibles, and finds two or three aspects of the translation less than pleasantly resonant (&quot;compact&quot; in Psalm 122; &quot;weaned&quot; in Psalm 131; &quot;most assuredly, I say unto you&quot; instead of &quot;Amen, amen&quot;). But the New King James Version -- theeless and thouless -- remains among the best of modern translations; it has fluent cadences that do not militate against the familiar and the traditional. It is comparable in its solemnity, in its seriousness, in its respectfully poetic renderings to the Revised Standard Version (RSV) and the New International Version (NIV). Readers who need the Jacobean pronouns and verb-forms may disagree.The words of Christ are printed in red, or a kind of off-red, that is pleasantly emphatic without assaulting the eye. In the very back, there is a chart for daily readings, and a glossary of terms (both familiar and unfamiliar). Allow us to provide the NKJV version of Psalm 8, so that the prospective buyer might better discern if this be the aptest translation :&quot;O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth, Who have set Your glory above the heavens!&quot;Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger.&quot;When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained, what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him?

This &quot;life-force' for lack of a better term is what drove his musicianship to such heights that he is the most revered American musician of the 20th century. While this is no scholalry biography it is written with the feel of an oral history and reading it is much like having Satch relate these tales over a few drinks. Not only does it shed much light on the real person that Louis Armstrong was but it also reflects an era in old New Orleans that is absolutely fascinating to read about in the words of someone who lived there.

The book also gives insight into another culture, musicians, pimps and prostitutes and the sporting life, as well as the unfailing positive spirit of Louis Armstrong.This is more about the times of his youth than an in depth understanding of the development of his musicianship.

Armstrong, defending his decision, says to his mother, \\"You must realize that I didn't go any further than fifth grade in school myself. But with my good sense and mother-wit (sic), and knowing how to treat and respect the feelings of other people, that's all I've needed in life.

With a palpating heart I gave a big sigh of relief and said: 'Oh, thanks, mom.'\\" (page 160)Adding some additional information, such as notations explaining some of the other characters and some of the background to the colorful scenes he describes, would make this a great book.

No need to apologize in advance that your story is bound to offend some.That is followed by forward that is ascribed the Coyne (Main Character/ Boston Attorney.) It tells of a law being passed banning the sale of 17 specific automatic weapons, and Coyne's belief that events that he was involved in two years prior may have had an influence on the law. What purpose does this have in telling the story? It suggest that the story is important and that because of the coming events laws were changed. Nothing dramatic, no real tease, or hook.Neither of these openings draw me in, rather they set me up to be looking for a polemic on gun control. And maybe because that is what my subconscious was looking for, that is what it picked up. I think it would have better to not had those lead ins.As one reviewer here states the momentum is not here in this book. The real momentum of the book, I think, is caused simply by short chapters. There are, for me, other minor problems. But in the end, if you are a Brady Coyne fan (as I am), there is a lot to like. Not every story can be a wow. On his own (as in separate from any given story) the character Brady Coyne is an interesting, self reflecting kind of guy, and his observation, his lifestyle and the complications of his life- keeps me seeking for more of his titles."},{"Title":"Baltimore Beauties and Beyond: Studies in Classic Album Quilt Applique, Vol. 1","review":"I am very happy with my purchase.

Is the person hiding behind the curtains responsible for the recent events? Or is another of Laura Avian's secret admirers driving her career forward without minding the cost? Will Batman be able to solve the mystery in time to prevent more deaths?Its emotional, suspenseful and action packed plot, and excellent characterizations make Masque a very enjoyable and entertaining reading, but its wonderful details are what make it a especially delightful tale: the old fashioned language used in the dialogues, the choice of historically accurate clothing (including the design of Batman's costume), the period settings (Batman's Batcave looks like a combination of Frankenstein's laboratory and Dracula's castle). Moreover, its unconventional, sketchy art style resembles the type of illustrations fashionable during the time in which the story's set and gives the narrative an air of authenticity, and its choice of colors and utilization of shadows perfectly captures the ominous atmosphere of the era and the supernatural aura of the original story.This is a very pleasing, brilliantly illustrated, exceptionally well-written tale and an outstanding homage to Leroux's novel. Enjoy!--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"When I was single and about to leave college some 15 years ago, a semester-long private study of this book and the book of Genesis itself filled me with a new sense of meaning concerning my existence as a man in this world.Blocher argues on the basis of the elaborate literary structure of Gen. 1:1-2:3 that the original readers would have read it figuratively. The 7 days of creation represent neither 24-hour periods of time, nor long epochs of natural history, but are instead a literary structure that conveys meaningful and true content about the relationship of God, humankind, and the creation. No chronological significance was intended whatsoever, Blocher believes, nor inferred by the original readers. The literary phenomena he explores include the repetition of certain key words 7 or 10 times (numbers with symbolic value to the ancient Hebrews), the symmetrical correspondence of creation day 1 (light and darkness) to day 4 (sun, moon, stars), day 2 (sky and ocean) to day 5 (sea animals and birds), and day three to 3 (land) to day 6 (animals and humankind), etc. Moreover, the parallels--or rather deliberate contrasts--between Gen. 1 and other ancient Near Eastern creation stories, show how Gen. 1 served as a pointed polemic that exalted a higher concept of the utterly transcendent/immanent God to whom we are accountable, over and against polytheism. Even the reader who retains some kind of chronological understanding of the days of creation will be enriched by an exploration of these literary phenomena of the text. (A fascinating article, \\"Space and Time in the Genesis Cosmogony,\\" by Dr. Meredith G. Kline of Westminster Theological Seminary in California and Gordon-Conwell Seminary, argues similar conclusions, and makes good companion reading to Blocher concerning Gen. 1.Blocher sees the story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2 and 3 as a depiction in mythical terms of a genuinely historical fall of our first human ancestors from fellowship with God. The &quot;seed of the woman&quot; promised in Gen. 3:15, Jesus Christ, restores our access to the &quot;tree of life&quot; (see Rev. 22:2,14,19) of which human sin deprived us. The whole Bible is God's revelation about real historical realities, even if some of those realities (such as our remote origins and distant future) are more aptly and naturally described to us in figurative terms, while others (such as the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ) are more appropriately narrated in a literal manner.Blocher's book has pastoral value that goes far beyond its relevance to these particular issues of biblical interpretation. The chapter on Man and Woman is worth the price of the book. I was left with a deepened appreciation of the significance of our earthly lives and their activities (marriage, family, work, etc.) in the context of God's plan to call out for himself a redeemed human community that is restored through Christ to be the image of God, and that will enjoy communion with God and one another forever."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"First, i come to this book as an extended directed self study on the issues involved in the Creation-Evolution-Design debate. This book i rate as one of the 5 most significant books for a conservative reformed Christian who wants to come to reasoned and faithful conclusions in the CED debate. It is conservative which i define to be conscious and considerate of the traditions of the past, to take them seriously, not simply accepting something because it is new. It is Biblical in the way the author is very careful to allow the Scripture's Words to speak for themselves, being very careful not to read into the words his own cherished beliefs, but to allow the Word to speak to him, authoritatively and reliably. To this end he is not infected by the liberal J-P-D documentary interpretation so often evident in exegesis or interpretation.Second, the book is significant on two levels, the first is the exegetical level, the principles of understanding that the author explores in the first few chapters. Second is the line by line study that forms the bulk of the book, roughly chpt 3 on.The structure of the book is that of Gen 1-3 but the way he writes is interesting and worth a moment of reflection here. The chapters are more like consistent essays than the usual exegesis bound to the text. He takes a major theme in the next section of Genesis then expands it to cover this issue through the past interpreters and links to other related Scripture. It roughly follows the systematic organization of reformed covenant theology.pg 26 has what i think is the best analysis of the human writers relationship to Scripture. &quot;That rule follows from the humanity of Holy Scripture. In the act of inspiration God did not turn his sookesmen into robots; his Word became their word, under their signature and their responsiblility. Thus we have no right to go over their heads in order to set forth a 'divine' meaning which they would never possilby have imagined-even if those men did not grasp the whole import of what they attested God in his condescension has limited himself to their instrumentality; our interpretation must conform to the corresponding discipline.&quot;If the church would hend this advice much of the CED debate would be solved, for we would cease to search Genesis for the equivalent of quarks, trying to query the first few chapters of the Bible and mine it for scientific truths. Rather we would, as this author does, submit to the authority of Scripture to speak to the way we do science, to the ideas that we bring to the universe as we question the master workmen's creation that we are a small part of.The book is literary framework in its approach to Gen1-3, M. Kline being the best example of this in the english speaking world. Anyone familiar with the CED issues would be advised to read the first 2 chapters of this book simply to see a careful analysis of exegesis and the result of allowing Scripture to speak for itself rather than being pushed out of shape by young earth creationists whom would interpret the 7 days too literally. Or by scientific reconcilationists would would try to find modern science confirmed in the light appearing before the sun(ie the big bang).The first principle he outlines carefully is to allow Scripture to speak to its first listeners, their culture, their history. His exegetical task doesn't end there but extends to teaching what these things mean to us in our place in space and time. But this application, this preaching follows critical-historical interpretation not prior to it as so many would desire.Thanks to the author for this excellent book and i hope to read more from his pen."},{"Title":"In the Beginning","review":"Henri A. G. Blocher is a French evangelical theologian who is Gunther Knoedler Professor of Systematic Theology at Wheaton College Graduate School and is Professor of Systematic Theology, Faculte Libre de Theologie Evangelique, Vaux-sur-Seine, France.

He has also written books such asOriginal Sin: Illuminating the Riddle (New Studies in Biblical Theology)andEvil and the Cross: An Analytical Look at the Problem of Pain.Here are some quotations from this 1984 translation of the 1979 book:\\"One point ought to be established. The alternative of all or nothing rests on purely arbitrary grounds. The use of figurative language by no means determines the main question, that of the connection of the narrative with the events that are located and dated from the beginning. The acknowledgement of symbolic elements hardly weighs at all in favour of a symbolic interpretation of the whole. Conversely, those who favour the literal historicity of the content have no reason to demand the same literalness of the language. Scripture... abounds in examples of mixed genre.\\" (Pg. 37)\\"One must be sure that the text DEMANDS the literal interpretation. It must not be adopted out of loyalty to the past, out of sheer habit, or from a reflex hardening before the possible threat of apostasy. Might that in fact be the case?\\" (Pg. 48)\\"The literary interpretation takes the form of the week attributed to the work of creation to be an artistic arrangement, a modest example of anthropomorphism that is not to be taken literally. The author's intention is not to supply us with a chronology of origins... He wishes to bring out certain themes and provide a theology of the sabbath... To put it plainly, both the genre and the style of the Genesis prologue, as our introductory chapter saw them, provide strong grounds for presuming in favour of the literary interpretation.\\" (Pg. 50)"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Midnight In Ruby Bayou by Elizabeth Lowell is another great book in the Donovan series.

Wounded from past relationships she trusts nobody but she is required to work with Owen Walker to get the high class rubies that she needs to make the jewelry that she designs. She and Owen lead each other on a wild dance, scaring each other off when the passion that is brewing comes to the surface. This is a dramatic work that shows to us the talent that Lowell has.

Maybe not vintage EL, but certainly a good read."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"It's hard to believe that anyone can maintain the level of excellence that Elizabeth Lowell had maintained in the Donovan series, but she has done it again with Ruby Bayou. Wow is about the only word to describe just how good this book is. By the name, you will guess that this book focuses on a mystery about the ruby trade (the others in the series focused on amber, jade and pearl trades). Though Ms. Lowell has written other books on the fine gem industry (Diamond Tiger and The Ruby (both under her Ann Maxwell pseudonym)), she still manages to bring new information to blend with sizziling sensuality and a great mystery. Also interesting, she brings Owen Walker (from Jade Island) as Faith Donovan's mate. Seemingly less intense that Ms. Lowell's other heroes in this series, he is a great character who compliments the hurt Faith. I always enjoy Ms. Lowell's male characters, as they are always very strong and genuinelly interesting... they aren't a copy of anyone! I think her husband's influence (she used to write with him under the pseudonym A.E. Maxwell) gives her books both strength and truth. This is a great stand alone-book, but it is even better if you read the others. Good reading!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Elizabeth Lowell (aka, Ann Maxwell) contributes another intelligently written, enthralling novel. The dialogue is snappy and clever, the plot is well thought out and holds some intriguing surprises, while returning to the Donovan family is like welcoming an old friend back into your home. The topical information on rubies is fascinating and instructive. However, the issue which changed my rating from &quot;5&quot; to &quot;4&quot; was that the relationship didn't sizzle for me. The romance was tepid. Although this book was an enjoyable read and one I will certainly read again, I don't believe this installment in the Donovan saga is up to Ann's usual standard for romance. She normally produces sizzling romantic tension/resolution that is completly engaging -- the reader becomes emotionally engaged in the relationship as it evolves. Ruby Bayou, however, didn't evoke the same emotional connection for me...the Faith and Walker relationship took a long time to develop and then quickly transformed from passion to love to permanence in an implausible way -- Walker does a romantic 180 and the transformation seems forced. It seems clear that as romance writers are elevated to &quot;mainstream fiction&quot; by their publishers they lose some of the romantic heat which is so appealing to romance readers. For diehard romance readers: before you pay hardback cover prices for this, just know that while its a great suspence read and offers a welcome return to the Donovan family, Ruby Bayou may leave you romantically wanting."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Once again, Lowell saves a tired plot with clever banter and one likeable character. Owen is, for me, the best male character of the series. He is warm without being mushy, savvy without being hard like Archer. Even with his recent injury, he manages to be extremely tough to kill.Too bad he wasn't paired with a more memorable female lead, but Faith lacks spine. Recovering from a very weak chioce on her last boyfriend, I began to wonder halfway through if she didn't deserve him. There was just something missing in her character.The plot itself is pretty mundane, missing gems, bad guys, eccentric southern family with a history of abuse and other weird stuff. The resolution of the conflict also lacks sizzle. Faith, proving once again what a flat character she is, caves competely, without even an attempt at assertiveness.There wasn't as much information on rubies as I have come to expect, either. I missed the soundbites of lore and legend, coupled with the gemacological tidbitsThe improvement I would suggest is for Owen to leave Faith, meet a woman with a bit more oomph, and have a rough and tumble courtship that doesn't involve steroetypical bad guys (The Mob, come on!). Now that would be a book worth keeping. This one, I fear, is defintitely one to recycle."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Donovan International is a multi-conglomerate, but the heart of the company is the Gems and Minerals division.

I just wish the love story could have been as lovingly rendered as the details given the ruby business. The love scenes were certainly passionate and thrilling, but the romance part a little lacking. Best things about the book were more visits to Donovan family, fun Bayou location, and sizzling attraction between characters. Weaknesses include, why was the pregnant lady crazed about gaining weight? Honey, your'e eating for two! Have some more pasta! There were a few blips in logic like that which I found really jarring; the sudden introduction and then focus of the secondary family, I just spent the first half of the book investing in a whole world on international bad guys, and then I was thrown a more domestic and not really connected group of secondary charaters half way through that i didn't really care about. And finally the very quick resolution keeping the hero and heroine together was not very emotional or satisfying. If I am going to read hundreds of pages of stuff about rubies and murders and ghosts and rape etc. in my ROMANCE novel, then the romace better pay off in the end and not give me the sense that the writer went, whew! case solved, and lovers...poof!...in love!

If you loved her past books, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"After reading books such as Pearl Cove and Jade Island I found this book to be dull and uninspiring. Elizabeth Lowell's books generally keep riveted for I connect with her characters so much that while I am reading one of her books I feel as if i am right there witnessing it. I found this book to be vastly annoying, contrite and utterly disappointing. After having heorines like Honor I could not understatnd how she could write a book in which her character fell flat. The storyline never stays consistent and keeps bringing in new characters that are unexplained and have no place in this story. She draws the book out with the tale of this ghost walking the shores and then ends it abruptly with some simpered tale of a stillborn child. Sorry Elizabeth, but definetly not your best work."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This was the perfect ending to the Donovan series. Faith and Walker both had to overcome past hurts to find love within each other. I loved the way that the entire Donovan family from all 3 previous books were woven into the plot. I loved hearing about Honor &amp; Jake's daughter, Lianne and Kyle's twins, and Archer and Hannah's pregnancy. Having read all of the other books prior to this one I could appreciate every aspect of the plot.I am enthralled by the way that Lowell uses characters from different backgrounds, like Seattle and South Carolina and makes them fall in love and they each cherish their culture and learn to respect the others.I have already read each book in the series at least a dozen times each and I will keep reading them for a long time to come. I do wish that Lowell would write about Justin and Lawe though. I feel like part of their family is missing not knowing about them.All in All... a MUST HAVE for your romance collection."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This book starts off really smoothly with an intro to the plot and all and we are able to seen and experience the chemistry all in all it was really captivating except for the rushed ending"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I have read all of the books in E.L's Donovan series, and although I loved the early ones the best, I found RUBY a great read. It was quick paced for the most part and I really enjoyed Faith and Owen. My only complaint is that E.L. is not finishing out the Donovan family. What about Justin and Lawe. The were mentioned in all four of the books , but we never got the chance to see them. I would think E.L. should finish what she started. There are still other gems to be discovered."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Once again, Lowell saves a tired plot with clever banter and one likeable character. Owen is, for me, the best male character of the series. He is warm without being mushy, savvy without being hard like Archer. Even with his recent injury, he manages to be extremely tough to kill. Too bad he wasn't paired with a more memorable female lead, but Faith lacks spine. Recovering from a very weak chioce on her last boyfriend, I began to wonder halfway through if she didn't deserve the weenie after all. There was just something missing in her character.The plot itself is pretty mundane, missing gems, bad guys, eccentric southern family with a history of abuse and other weird stuff. The resolution of the conflict also lacks sizzle. Faith, proving once again what a flat character she is, caves competely, without even an attempt at assertiveness.There wasn't as much information on rubies as I have come to expect, either. I missed the soundbites of lore and legend, coupled with the gemacological tidbitsThe improvement I would suggest is for Owen to leave Faith, meet a woman with a bit more oomph, and have a rough and tumble courtship that doesn't involve steroetypical bad guys (The Mob? Come on!). Now that would be a book worth keeping.

But, the Heart of Midnight a giant ruby is lost and a Russian is trying to find it and murder anyone who gets in his way and Faith may be next. I really enjoyed this one. I would like her to write about their twin brothers and the Emerald trade,but I highly doubt it. Looking forward to reading Color in Death by her and all about Sapphires. Read this book it's highly recommend."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"As series books go, I usually enjoy full length ones. However, with this one I was put off by all the details in Jade Island especially and let this one linger forever in my pile. I shouldn't have put it off, as this one was actually my favorite in the series.Though there is a lot of detail about Ruby's included, they don't encompass the story so completely as to take away from the romance as Jade did. The characters were well developed and I enjoyed watching Faith and Walker's interactions.The only thing I didn't like was it seemed to take them forever to act upon their attractions to each other. But still a very good book and as far as I'm concerned, the best of the series for action rather than details!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"The fourth in the Donovan tales ... it is a real shame that Lowell didn't stop at 3.Faith Donovan finds herself in a jam when the bad guys think she has the big ruby. And get this --- for most of the book Faith is too stupid to realize that she is in danger and her brothers don't want to upset the fragile girl by telling her. Give me a break.Our southern hero Owen does little to excite. I guess that it is a good thing that Faith hasn't enjoyed sex for her first 29 years ... because Owen certainly doesn't heat it up. Perhaps that is why Lowell stuck in Hannah and Archer having sex every time Owen calls home ... but how hot can sex be when you are talking to someone else on the phone?The mystery aspects are non-existent ... you will know the thief from the second that she's introduced. Unfortunately you will be left spending the next 200 pages wondering when everyone else in the book will get it.Not only will your heart not speed up ... you won't be able to stay awake.Lets hope that the real Elizabeth Lowell returns with her next book."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This is my third of her gem novels, and as in the other two, I came away with a new appreciation and understanding of the jewels that are the book's subject.The story wasn't bad either. Exciting at times, it carries the reader along effortlessly from the basement of a Russian museum to a jewelry artist in Seattle, to an ancient low country family in South Carolina. The love story, a staple of these novels, is at times somewhat tiresome rather than sensual.The fact that it's interesting, that it doesn't tax one's mental faculties, makes this a good book for the beach."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"The Donovan saga continues with Faith and Owen Walker. This is just another example of the talented Elizabeth Lowel. Faith, who is untrusting of herself and her heart learns to love and accept love again from the man who grew up in the bayou, Owen Walker. Their story is one of trust and love that takes you from Seattle to Savanah. There are murders and danger at ever corner and yet Faith and Walker still manage to find a love they never thought to have. This is a great story about two people who think themselves unworthy of each others love yet manage to accept it and cherish it. I can't wait to read about the twin brothers yet to be romanced. Elizabeth Lowel shows again how love can come to those who least expect it."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I loved the series and hated to see it end.

I would love it, if she would write about Justin and Law"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"The fourth (?) book of the series. This family of characters occurs in other Lowell works. Lively and interesting, well developed plot that is not merely an excuse for extended sex scenes. Lowell is always more than slap and tickle."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I love all of Elizabeth Lowell's books, especially the Donovan Series, and Midnight in Ruby Bayou was no exception. I found my heart going out to Walker, and wishing for a &quot;Walker&quot; of my own. Faith and Walker just complimented each other wonderfully, both vulernable, both hurt by their pasts, a great combination. The chemistry was there from the start and I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see what she does with Justin and Lawe!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I am a huge Elizabeth Lowell fan and have read all of the other books in the Donovan series and this was my least favorite. I don't feel there was as much intensity as in the others; Too many bad guys, not enough romance. However, I do look forward to reading about Justin and Lawe Donovan!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I read this book in a day and did not want it to end (anymore than I wanted the others to end). I hope, no pray that a book on the mysterious Justin and Lawe is on its way. I hate loose ends. I want to hear more about the sibs we've already met as well as the two we haven't. Ms. Lowell, are you listening?"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I enjoyed the last in the book in this series. Elizabeth Lowell is a wonderful writer who always makes me laugh. Her diaglogue with her characters is so very witty, but down to earth. She makes them come so alive for the reader. I don't normally like serial books, but each one of these can stand alone. I've enjoyed getting to know all of the Donavan clan and individual stories and personalities. I had hoped that she would also include Justin and Lawe, but can understand that she may be running out of gems. My only criticism of the book was that the ending was somewhat abrupt. Walker tells Faith to go back to the house, which she does and when she returns he has taken care of Ivanovich. Also I would have liked the family to all be together in the final book for a sort of wrapping of and tying them all together. But nevertheless Ms. Lowell never disappoints and I wait for each one her books with excitement. I recommend &quot;Midnight in Ruby Bayou&quot; very highly. If you haven't read any of her books in this series or any other buy them today."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Ok I read the first three books in Lowell's Donovan series, the second two once I discovbered there _were_ more. All in all enjoyable books. I particularly liked Jade Island. This installment (for it is becoming installments) concerns Faith Donovan, and Owen Walker. Yes the same Owen Walker from Jade Island whom I rather enjoyed his camoe appearance.As far as the story went it was well developed for Owen Walker.. Faith Donovan's character was a little less ah.. deep. But that isn't too surprising.. Lowell's men are always more thought out than her female characters.The plot was the usual- mystery surrounding some form of precious stone. I enjoyed the process of getting to the end but I have to say it was not as thrilling or intriguing as the earlier three books. There was more reach.. and the ever present April Joy was back. Do we detect foreshadowing?A good read but not on the level of the first two... or even the third. Recommended but not strongly."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I thought this book was reaaly wonderful. I have read many many titles by Mrs. Lowell. I feel that the stories of Justin and Lawe need to be told. I hate to leave stories and hanging!!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"It was a pleasure to revisit the Donovan family, and watch Faith finally meet her match. With each book in this series, I've learned something about the international jewel trade too. I'd love for this series to continue, maybe with the youngest boys story next? Please Ms. Lowell? It's so much fun to check in the Donovans that I just hate for it to each book to end."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I loved it! I am a huge EL fan. I could (and have) read her books over and over again. Her stories are so sensual and just plain hot! When Walker first came on the scene in Jade Island, I hoped he would be the next Lowell hero! Are we going to hear from Justin &amp; Lawe next(even if we've never met them yet...)? Elizabeth Lowell rocks!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"If you enjoyed the previous Donovan's - you will also enjoy this story. Well written and a continuous read. Didn't want to put down. Have enjoyed all of Elizabeth Lowell's books and found this book to be no different. Can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou is the one of the best by Elizabeth Lowell! The other Donovan books have been awesome and this is fitting for the series. I have waited a long time for this book to come out and to see how the series has continued. Faith deserves happiness. She has it now! I can't wait to see if Ms. Lowell makes stories about Justin and Lawe Donovan, the twins!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I thought the premise of the book was very interesting, and I liked the characters a lot. However, the plot had a little trouble moving forward, since we had to learn so much about the ruby business (not that it wasn't interesting, but it could have been a little neater). And, I got a little confused as to where all these bad guys were coming from. But, it was a light easy read, so it would be good beach reading. I would have liked a little more suspense, though."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I really liked this book. The Elizabeth Lowell books in this series are really good. I like the warm family relationships between the Donavans. I also like the information about the gem (in this case, ruby). However, I felt this book was a little tacky. I grew tired of details of incest and domestic violence, I know it's a fact of life, but my work is with abuse survivors, and it was just hard to read in my free-reading &quot;escape&quot; book. Also, I grew weary of the oral sex analogies and comments, come on, we get it, they have a raw oyster eatting contest of sorts and it's just tacky. Overall, a good book and well worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Faith Donovan is a talented jewelry designer who is in the process of creating a ruby necklace for her college roomate, Mel. Davis Montegeau, Mel's future father-in-law has sent the rubies to Faith to fashion a necklace as a wedding gift for Mel.After Faith's shop is burglarized, her older brother Archer, head of the Donovan empire, assigns Owen Walker to be her bodyguard as she travels from Seattle to Savannah for a jewelry show. Trouble seems to follow Faith and Walker everywhere as burglaries and muggings become an everyday occurrence. When Faith and Walker make the journey to the Montegeau's family home for Mel's wedding, truth becomes stranger than fiction as strange secrets of this old southern family come to light.Elizabeth Lowell has written a atisfying romantic suspense novel, complete with a fascinating description of the qualities present in exquisite rubies. Though Faith is a little weak as a heroine, Walker more than makes up for her inadequacies, as he is the perfect combination of strength and sensitivity without having an enormous male ego.Lowell cleverly combines the attraction between Faith and Walker with an emerging trust that finally allows them to overcome their fear of loving someone again. For a mystery with some romantic spice added, this is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Faith Donovan had immersed herself into the creation of exquisite jewelry since the breakup of a disappointing relationship. An important commission has come her way, and now Faith must see to it that she obtain rubies of the highest quality. That quality comes with a very high price. Owen Walker knows what that price is but won't tell her for her own sake. Faith suspects Owen may be hiding a secret, but would that secret come at the expense of her very life? This reviewer, and perhaps the audience, has come to expect more from Elizabeth Lowell. There's also more information about the geology and precise mathematical cutting of rubies than there is romantic suspense. The big disappointment comes when we find the previous books in the Donovan series superior to this letdown of a conclusion."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Although not as bad as many novels I have read, I felt that Midnight in Ruby Bayou lacked the pace, character development, action and romance of the previous novels in the Donovan series. Yes, there was some pace, etc., but it was as lacklustre as the plot. Usually a Elizabeth Lowell book is edge-of-seat reading, but this one I found a struggle to finish. What kept me from giving up was the information on the rest of the Donovan family - and this is why I awarded it three stars in the end. Not bad, just not up to Ms Lowell's usual standard."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"While Ms. Lowell has written an enjoyable book, it is not close to being her best work. This is the fourth book in the Donavan story and it is very much formula writing. Ms. Lowell has not bothered to flesh of the lead charactures as carefully as she usually does, and her attempts to catch you up on the earlier books lead characters are stiff and obvious ( how many times do we need to hear that Lianne, from PEARL COVE, can throw Kyle and Archer on their butts). I think that Ms. Lowell became bored with these charactures and it shows. Having said this, this author's average work is better buy far than most authors' best work. Next time, I hope Ms.Lowell resists the urge to write a forth book in what was obviously ment to be a trilogy."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Once again Elizabeth Lowell has swept us into the Donovan family. The latest in the series is just as compelling as all the previous ones have been. As Faith Donovan is dumped into a struggle between the Russian mafia, the US mafia, the US government, and the Donovan clan, her only hope is Owen Walker the &quot;guard&quot; assigned by her brother. Walker is not interested in staying on the good side of any of the players but only in protecting Faith. The hunt for a stolen Russian ruby leads them from Seattle, WA to the bayous of South Carolina. Another great read from Elizabeth Lowell."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I enjoyed reading &quot;Midnight in Ruby Bayou&quot; the continuing saga of The Donovans. Ms Lowell grabs you in the first page and holds you until the last page, and than leaves you wanting more. In each of her books about The Donovans she chooses a precious stone and makes it the center of her plot. She than builds her story and characters around this precious stone (In this case Rubies). The story and the main characters are than tied together with the history of the stone. Add to the mix romance, suspense, and murder and you have a read that's impossible to put down. If you are fan of Ms.Lowell you not be disapointed in this story. If you're not a fan you will become one after reading &quot;Midnight in Ruby Bayou&quot;. Ms. Lowell is one my favorite authors and I look forward to reading more about The Donovons."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Ms. Lowell has written another novel in her series of the wonderful Donovan family. However, this new release had me flipping quickly through all the information on the rubies that are the focus of this installment. The story, slowly, (and I mean slowly), unfurled to a novel that did improve in suspence and characterization. At least, the wonderful Archer made another appearance. That in itself was a saving grace."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms. Lowell's; I probably have every book that she has written. I could not give this book a 5 star rating because I feel that the job of this book was not complete. I compare it to a 3-hour movie that producers have cut down to 2 just to draw more viewers, and in doing that leave the viewers feeling cheated. The suspense was 5 star, the story line a 5, but when I got to the last 10 pages I kept thinking...'we've only got a few pages left and a lot more left undone'. I feel that Ms. Lowell could (and should) have added another chapter to this book to give it the ending it deserved, why she didn't is yet another mystery to all of the other unanswered questions I had when I was finished. I also had to wonder why we had so much of Archer and Hannah, and nothing of Kyle and Lianne (Ms. Lowell barely hinted to the twins). I hope that if she continues with the Donovan's that she gives us a little more at the end of the story to make it complete, instead of leaving so much left undone."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I've read Amber Beach, Jade Island, Pearl Cove (in that order too) and recently I completed Ruby Bayou.I must say I am rather disappointed by the story.I wonder whether this is some sort of trend - coz the stories of Kyle and Archer (Jade Island and Pearl Cove, respectively) were so well-written I read it more than five times EVERY DAY. Amber Beach...rather bland, coz the focus was too much on the amber and less on the romance. Ironically, Ruby Bayou is also the same. The talk on rubies was too much I simply skipped the pages. It's ironic that the stories of Faith and Honor are more-or-less the same.The book is also rather overdone. Russian Mafia, US mob, US government, and family secrets intermingle together, vying for space and attention in the book. It's too much. Overcrowded. And furthermore, I was rather disappointed by the fact that Faith should get somebody who is shorter than Jake (her twin Honor's husband), smaller than Jake or the Donovan men, and with no education. Okay, not having an education doesn't necessarily mean Owen Walker is stupid, but still..... it puts him down a level from the intimidating Donovan men, and also Jake Mallory.Furthermore, Lowell didn't furnish the book with HOW the whole Donovan family would react to a match between Faith and Walker - employer's sister and employee. I was DYING to know their feelings on that and was vastly disappointed that Loweel didn't even put that in. In addition to that, so little of the other Donovans lives were put in. Example, in Jade Island, Kyle brought Lianne home to meet the family, and we were entertained with various family pranks and all that. In Pearl Cove, Archer brought Hannah home, and we were again presented with all the pleasures of the Donovan family life, with special note to the then new addition to the family, baby Summer, her cute antics, and the fact that Lianne was pregnant with twins. I din't see a similar thing in Ruby Bayou - well, a snippet of Summer and Robbie and Heather, but not much to satisfy the curiosity. All this time, I awaited the arrival of Ruby Bayou with bated breath, simply because I wanted to see how Faith turned out, yes, but also to see how Lianne and Kyle are faring with the twins, etc etc etc. We simply want to catch up on the family, but in Ruby Bayou, there was not enough of that.So, all in all, the book &quot;Midnight in Ruby Bayou&quot; is really disappointing. Too twisted, too crowded, too less of what we want more of. Okay, maybe one can argue that since this is about rubies, it SHOULD talk about rubies. But don't forget, this is a romance first and foremost. If I want to know more about rubies, I can always go to some other book totally dedicated on rubies and rubies only.So, Elizabeth, are you planning on writing about Jude and Lawe?"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Lowell just doesn't let her readers down with the lovable Donovan clan. Recommendation: Start with \\"Amber Beach\\" and then work your way to this one. See her complete book list and the order in which they go at: www.elizabethlowell.com"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This is the 4th book in EL's Donovan series, and like the other 3 this is a book that is hard to put down. It has plenty of action and the relationship between Faith Donovan and Owen Walker is developed slowly but tantalizing enough to keep you turning pages to see what will happen next between them. I liked Owen a lot. I don't think it mattered that he was a less educated and a smaller man than the other heros in the first three novels, namely Kyle, Jake, and Archer. He was just as smart, just as intelligent, just as sexy,just as honorable, and just as deadly. It says a hell of lot when Archer Donovan trusts you to take care of his little sister. Archer's trust was not misplaced as we find out in the development of the story as he comes to Faith's aid again and again. One of my most favorite scenes was when he met up with Faith's obnoxious and much larger ex-boyfriend. It was hilarious and very well written.As far as heroines go, Faith was somewhat lacking when compared with the other Donovans. However, she was intelligent, gifted, and sweet; not quite a hot head as her other siblings. However, I think that rich girl Faith did very well for herself with Owen. A guy that put her needs first, in and out of the bedroom. Cudos to EL for bringing us a heroine who needs a little help in achieving fulfillment in the bedroom. After all, I think that most women do.Why this one didn't get 5 stars you may ask? Mostly, because I didn't like the way EL ended the love story between Faith and Owen. Owen felt very strongly about being reponsible for others; also, I think that he had some reservations about his much lower socio-economic background. I would have liked EL to take them back home and let us in on some real soul searching for Owen before he came to the conclusion that he was ready for being responsible for a wife and family.The rest of the Donovan guys could have helped him along.It would have been a perfect ending to an otherwise great story."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Once again, the Donovans win your heart. I can't say enough about Midnight in Ruby Bayou. I have read it 4 times and loved it more each time. Faith is strong, intelligent and very talented. Walker is strong, gentle and the kind of man every woman would want. Together they take on &quot;Uncle&quot; and the maffia (with the help of the other Donovan's of course).I love the entire Donovan series and hope that Ms. Lowell will continue the series with Justin and Lawe's stories."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I read the first three in this series and absolutely loved them. This 4th book was just as good as the first three. Loved the mystery combined with the love story. Men never know what's good for them, do they?"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou continues the saga of the Donovan family, presented in Amber Beach (1997) and Jade Island (1998). Faith Donovan, jewelry designer, has created a necklace containing $1 million in rubies which, it turns out have dubious ownership. Her plan is to exhibit the necklace at a jewelry show in Savannah, Georgia, before turning it over to the owners, the Montegeau family, at the wedding of Jeff Montegeau, family son, and Faith&#65533;s pregnant pal, Mel. Owen Walker, ruby expert employed by Faith&#65533;s brother, Archer Donovan, is called upon to guard the necklace when Archer insures the rubies in transit. Mysterious accidents begin shadowing the designer as bloodthirsty Russian Mafia and local mobster thugs, attempt to steal the jewels. Walker, recovering from injures suffered in Afghanistan while seeking rubies for the Donovan family, becomes Faith&#65533;s capable bodyguard. Local FBI agents add their twists as they follow Walker and Faith.The plot thickens at Ruby Bayou, ancestral home of the Montegeau family, when Lowell introduces Jeff's father, Davis, a descendant of pirates and owner of a missing Blessing Chest reported to hold a fortune in gems, Davis&#65533; sister Tiga, and the family hound Boomer. Montegeaus dark secrets of the past and present begin unfolding and deranged fantasy world of Aunt Tiga offers clues to why the bad guys are after Faith and the secret of the long-lost Blessing Chest. Even CIA agent April Joy from the other books reappears to add spice to the tale. Through clever banter and the unmistakable sexual tension spiral that Lowell is so well known for, the romantic attraction between Walker and Faith merges into trust and commitment as each overcomes their fear of loving someone again. Lowell builds one of her best male characters in Owen Walker causing Faith Donovan&#65533;s character, through well defined, to pale in comparison. The fascinating, informative descriptions of exquisite ruby qualities and lessons on the ruby trade skillfully blend through the story line.I&#65533;m a long time Elizabeth Lowell fan and I found Midnight in Ruby Bayou a completely entertaining read that kept me engrossed in both the relationships between the characters and the outcome of the plot. Reading the other books in the Donovan series probably adds to the enjoyment of this installment because you have all the previous Donovan family character background. However, for a completely entertaining read, this romantically spiced mystery is quite enjoyable on its own. If you haven&#65533;t read the other books in the series, you probably will once you finish this one!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Once again, Lowell saves a tired plot with clever banter and one likeable character.

At first the book started out awesome. What could be better than a midnight robbing of a Soviet musuem, followed by a greedy theif who lifts something he isn't supposed to, then two dead bodies and the list goes on. I felt the action of the book moved right along and the sparring between Faith and Walker was wonderful. Right up until the last few chapters. Then things started to get really slow. For one thing, for a Russian mafia to not show up the whole time Faith and Walker were at Ruby Bayou was just not believeable and then for him to show up at the end. Well, it was almost like Ms. Lowell just remembered that he was a central character. Then the whole part where Walker disappears into the Bayou is just a great mystery. All we know is that two went out and one came back....I think the ending of the book could have been spiced up with a chapter regarding the struggle on the skif in the middle of the swamp. I was also a little disappointed in that all of a sudden Walker decides he wants Faith in his life permanently and some of how he reached that decision would have been helpful. All in all it was an entertaining read and I will be looking forward to Ms. Lowells next book."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This book was almost as good as I had anticipated. The plotline was fairly straighforward without being boring, the action was well paced, and the characters were very much worth spending time with. Ruby Bayou was definitely one of the best books I've read in a while, but it just wasn't quite as riveting as the other books in the Donovan series. Faith was somehow a little less engaging than the other heroines, the cloak and dagger stuff was a little less dramatic, and the sexual tension between Faith and Walker was just a little less, well, tense than expected. I was also somewhat disappointed to see so little of the rest of the family, especially the never-met Justin and Lawe. CIA agent April Joy is a great recurring character; she deserves her own book. Ruby Bayou, by the way, might be a little rough going if read on its own, without the rest of the series. Still, I enjoyed every minute I spent reading this book. Ms. Lowell is one of only a few authors for whose work I am willing to buy a full-price hardcover, and I don't regret a penny."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I love Elizabeth Lowell but I've been kind of disappointed with her latest series, this book included.

I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Elizabeth Lowell's latest installment in the Donavan series is like the rubies she describes so lovingly: interesting, sexy, and full of fire, but not flawless. The story focuses on Faith Donovan, the talented jewelry designing twin of Honor from _Amber Beach_. Faith has recently dumped her abusive boyfriend and is understandably wary of men. The hero is Owen Walker, a valued employee and trusted friend of Archer Donovan, Faith's overprotective older brother. Walker has commitment issues of his own, but has always been attracted to Faith. These characters both carry emotional scars from events in their pasts that inform their actions and reactions. The plot that surrounds these two as they fall in love (it *is* an Elizabeth Lowell book, after all!) is somewhat convoluted, involving the Russian mob, aging Jersey wise-guys, and the local Southern gentry from Walker's youth. Despite the implausibility of the plot, I enjoyed reading about rubies and revisiting the Donovan clan. I also really liked Walker. Often Lowell's heros are hard and bitter and the heroine has to prove herself time and time again. In this case, Walker is kind and open to Faith from the very beginning, and it is her reserve toward men that has to be overcome. Overall, the book kept me interested in both the relationship between the characters and the outcome of the plot. I'm looking forward to the next two books about the mysterious Justin and Lawe, the other Donovan brothers."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"As I said above if you like 'TELL ME NO LIES' then you'll love MIDNIGHT IN RUBY BUYOU. A well told story about the Donavan sister I always worried about, Faith. The jerk Tony is out of the picture, but a southern swamp rat with a passion for rubies is in. I also enjoyed the discussions of rubies, she places through out the book. Not only an enjoyable read but I learned some things as well!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I enjoyed this book but not as much as Ms. Lowell's other Donovan family books. The story moved along briskly and the romance between the feature characters was as expected. However, I was bothered by the apparent indifference of the hero to the innocent victims who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. As in the other books in this series there was a great deal of detail about the lore of rubies. I find this detail a definite plus. Accurate details in the background of a story makes the difference between an adequate story and a good or great one."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Like countless others, I have loved the Donovan stories from the first book. Midnight in Ruby Bayou was a fitting end to this great series. The book kept you hooked from the beginning. The story line flowed and the interaction between the two main characters, Faith and Owen, was great. I loved both characters. The pain from past mistakes was evident in the relationship yet the romance kept building! I also loved the glimpses into the other Donovan siblings and the introduction of the next generation of Donovans. The book was the perfect blend of government plots, assasins on the loose, family secrets and romance. If you have not read this series by Lowell go out and get it. Start from the first book, Amber Beach, and let yourself fall in love with this family. I hope sometime in the future Ms. Lowell considers finishing this series with the stories of Lawe and Justin. But I look forward to her next book in a whole new series."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This story centers around Faith Donovan, who, despite a recent bad relationship, seems much more emotionally healthy than her brother Archer (star of Pearl Cove). When she receives a commission to design a necklace for an old friend's wedding, she is thrown into company with Owen Walker, whom she had previously admired from afar.Owen has had an eye on Faith for a while, but she has sworn off men. Plus, she views him as less imposing than her huge brothers. He is able to use this to his advantage, however, as he guards her and her gemstones. No one thinks he could be dangerous, including Faith. Being in her constant company, he finally manages to get her attention--and chemistry takes it from there.Be prepared to get a little weepy at times; although Faith and Owen are fairly normal, tragedy has a tendency to strike around them."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"&quot;Midnight&quot; is standard Lowell writing. The author spends a substantial amount of time educating the reader about the history of rubies and the world gem market before digging into the plot, which was predictable to anyone who has read any of the earlier Donovan family novels.The three stars indicate that I enjoyed being updated on the lives of the other Donovans (and hope to see the stories of the two remaining brothers) and enjoyed the book in a general way, while not being terribly impressed by this effort. Unless you are a rabid fan, I would recommend waiting for the paperback...or (though amazon.com won't like this) checking the hardback out at the library."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This was a typical lowell/donovan book in a lot of ways. Same super, alpha-male and &quot;sassy&quot; outspoken, yet vulnerable female. Same roses and puppies ultra-happy family gatherings. But I liked &quot;Midnight in Ruby Bayou&quot; a little better than the rest becuase a few times it actually showed a slightly tarnished side to the Donovan family. subtle jealousies and insecurities that real people might actually have, reared their heads in the donovan clan in this book."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"One of the better romances I have read. Not quite on par with some of the other Donovan series books, but still head and shoulders above most romance novels. I love learning something with my romance so all of the info about rubies and the south is great, but the book might annoy those less interested in real-world background. I agree Faith is not the most fascinating Donovan heroine, but I loved the mob/old family entanglements and she's still pretty funny."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"It took me a week to finish this book. Usually it takes me three days max. The ending was boring, alot of questions were left unanswered and no loose ends were tie. I got the feeling that Ms. Lowell realized that she wrote 300 pgs. of nothing and she had a page cutoff and rushed to the ending. I could have done a better job and I'm no writer."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I loved this book! After reading about Archer &amp; Kyle and Faith, I was waiting for it for a long time. I was very excited when I finally got my hands on a copy. I hope she comes up with a romance for the male twin Donovans. EL books are some of the most satisfying in contemporary romance. If you like your books hot, thrilling &amp; on the move, you'll love this book. Don't miss her other fantastic books under the name Ann Maxwell."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I must be in a minority of one, if E. Lowell's books are so very popular. What does she or her readers have against a female protagonist with strength, depth or any kind of character? Granted, these books are fantasy and can't be taken as anything other that fantasy, but do women really fantasize about being morons with no spine? Is there a heroine in any one of Lowell's books who doesn't have a phobia due to one incident in which they were in danger in their past? Honestly, do most women really dream about being weak kneed, lily livered cowards? I guess they must, since books like Lowell's seem to be all the publishers will toss off the assembly line.However, I'm writing this review (and giving the book 2 stars) because there was one bright spot in it. For once, Lowell has written a hero with charm, humor and appeal, unlike the cardboard cutouts in the other books in this series. Man, was that guy sexy and cute. Of course, it wouldn't be a Lowell book if the hero didn't protect the heroine without her knowledge (because, every one knows women are not to be trusted to protect themselves, they don't have the brain power and are too emotional to deal with a stressful situation with any kind of toughness). In spite of that, I like Walker and wish Lowell would try to flesh out other characters as well. And please, if you're reading this, Elizabeth, please try to get beyond the damsel in distress syndrome. It's so very tired, and surely you and your publishers realize there are women like me in this world. Women who actually fantasize about a man who can fall in love with a strong, skilled and confident woman."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Very good book higlhy recommend buying it. Dissappointed that shes not writing stories for Justin and Lawe the last two donovan brothers that are twins I might have to boycott buying her books until she comes out with stories for the last two Donovans."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"No suspense, no tension and not much sizzle. Not really up to the other &quot;Donovan&quot; books, Amber Beach, Jade Island and Pearl Cove. Owen Walker steals the story. He is the best thing in the book. However Faith is lacking in so many ways. She just doesn't light up the pages like all the other Donovan's. There is not much of the Donovan family in this book. Like most series, after the first 3 or so the plot gets weak and the characters start to fade."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I enjoyed reading Faith and Walker's story, which was entwined with histories about rubies and mysteries, like all of the previous books in this series. I thought that Ms. Lowell brings in the characters from her previous books, makes its so much more interesting to read. Although you could read this as a stand alone; knowing Archer, Kyle, Honor, et al., brings life to the story. We know that the Donovan clan is a close knit family who looks out for each other, and it is good to see this follow through in all the books, and not just dropped or hinted at here and again. We see just enough of the family that it is not overpowering, but thorough enough to keep us informed about what is going on in the siblings' lives.I am not sure if it is because I am getting to know Ms. Lowell's style or it was \\"simplistically\\" written, but I thought the mystery was a little on the weak side. I figured it out pretty early on, but the writing is so well done, that the predictable plot did not bother me over much (but which kept this to a 4 star rating). I like the details Ms. Lowell put into her other books about Amber, Jade and Pearls, so the lessons on Rubies does not bother me in this book. Actually, there was a lot less about them, than the jewels in the previous books.The characters (both primary and secondary) are well defined and a pleasure to read about. We see and understand the leads weaknesses and how the other pulls their love towards a commitment. The Montegues were an interesting bunch, though I thought a little more depth to them would have been appreciated. They are the core of Ruby Bayou and we do not really get to see them until the last to 1/3 of the book. All in all, this was a good read."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"I'd never read any of Elizabeth Lowells' work before I bought this audio cassette. I thought her plot moved along well and had a few nice twists. Unfortunately Laurel Merlington has no talent for the various moods and accents required. I first found myself grinding my teeth in discomfort as she mangled the main characters in this book and then wishing I had time to read this as a paperback instead of listening to a deplorable attempt in audio."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"As another reader observed, it is hard to maintain a level of excellence in writing a series, but Ms. Lowell has achieved that task admirably with Faith's story. I finished the book in one day and loved every page. Even the history lessons on gems in this and the previous books don't weigh down the story, they make them more interesting. I have truly enjoyed all four Donovan stories, my only disappointment was in finding out that Faith's was the final story. With all the teasing us about Justin and Lawe, who we never met, but were mentioned frequently, I was anticipating their stories. Please Ms. Lowell, don't leave your faithful readers hanging, finish the Donovan saga with Justin and Lawe. After all, you haven't touched on diamonds, emeralds or sapphires yet!"},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"&quot;Midnight&quot; is a good beach read, especially if you are a Lowell fan.The plot was predictable (business and international intrigue that required a little too much explanation). As in other Donovan family novels, there was a substantial amount of education about the world jewel market and rubies. Although the explanations in both cases were well done, the book would be better if more time was spent on character development.Looking over this review, it reads as if I did not enjoy the book. That is not the case at all. The dialogue was good, the plot did not drag and the characters were likeable. Anyone who has read earlier Donovan family books will enjoy &quot;Midnight&quot;."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"A good, old fashioned mystery a la Hercule Perot with just enough romance to make it interesting. . . Faith and Walker find themselves caught in the web of an international tug of war over a spectacular collection of rubies. . . Along the way, we meet a collection of characters, both sweet and cruel.Walker and Faith have a fantastic chemistry, and a witty, back and forth bantering that's fun to read.The mystery is exciting and new clues are dropped at just the right time, so you figure out the solution just as Faith and Walker do. There aren't any major surprise endings, just a good, involved story."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"This fourth book in the gemstone series is a good read, but not quite as gripping as the first two. Here we meet Honor's twin, Faith, and her quest for recognition as a jewelry artist and her search for love. She and Owen Walker ( a bit player in Jade Island) are caught in the middle of a treasure hunt by the Russians and the U.S. for the &quot;Heart of Midnight&quot; ruby which was accidentally stolen from a Russian museum. The Russians have been informed that Faith has the ruby, and murder and mayhem follows her from sea to shining sea, which is why Archer insists that Walker accompany her to Atlanta and later on to Ruby Bayou where Faith is to deliver the ruby necklace she made for her college roomate's wedding. The final confrontations are a bit contrived and rushed, but all in all, this book was well constucted and exciting.The plot is good, the characters interesting, and the history of the gem excellent! I am becoming a jewelry expert reading this series. The only thing I disliked in this book was the fact that Archer was too much in control of the story, and all the husbands, wives and children being accumulated by the Donovans were overpowering and unnecessary to the plot.I am looking forward to meeting the twins, Lawe and Justin, and learning more about the search for gemstones."},{"Title":"Midnight in Ruby Bayou","review":"Elizabeth Lowell's newest addition to the Donovan family series, Midnight in Ruby Bayou, covers very familiar territory. Like Amber Beach, Jade Island and Pearl Cove, RB pits a hero and heroine who are extraordinarily wrapped up in the lore, history and technical chemistry of a particular gem-- in this case rubies-- against the Russian mafia, the US Government (whom Lowell refers to annoyingly as Uncle), and a variety of violent and shady characters. In Ruby Bayou, the remaining single Donovan sister, Faith, a jewelry designer, and trusted Donovan employee and right-hand-man, Owen Walker, join together to protect Faith's latest creation-- a magnificent ruby necklace-- on its way to its destination in Savannah for Faith's best friend's wedding. I guess Elizabeth Lowell is trying to go more maintream in her writing, but this story could have been much better if there were more attention to the devloping romance and less attention to the ruby-coveting conspirators. Frankly, the combination of the Atlantic City mob, the Russian mafia, batty old Southern ladies, and hush-hush government operatives was a bit over the top. The story wasn't a bad one through and through, but I hoped for more."},{"Title":"The Philosophical Imaginary","review":"This was the first of Le Doeuff's books (Recherches sur L'imaginaire philosophique, 1980) to be published in English (The Philosophical Imaginary 1989). Those with a feminist interest may have come upon only her more recent work, L'etude et le rouet (translated as 'Hipparchia's Choice', 1991) and Le sexe du savoir (translated as The sex of knowing, 2003).What Le Doeuff did in 1980 still comes across as very fresh and to the point of controversies about the possibilities of philosophy. She goes right to the heart of our doubts about and derogation of the status of images -- and more importantly, operative systems of imagery - in philosophy. The title (The Philosophical Imaginary) itself is a milestone if you are looking for an alternative to philosophy as a mill-stone. You find here some of the makings of a precise and rigorous philosophy that works in counterpoint to analytical philosophy's ideals of the 'literal', 'explicit', 'no-stone-unturned' and 'no-word'unsaid'. (It is set at an even greater distance from the hermetic 'profundity' of a Heidegger or Levinas.)In contrast with the inbred culture of analytical philosophy you might read something 'deconstructive' about the way the text works by close reading of one kind of text against another. She could hardly be further from Derrida, however, when it comes to the way she works. The style is terse, quick and economical. You can't stop a broad smile at the title of the preface piece - 'The Shameful Face of Philosophy'. 'The nerve of the woman!' blurts the traditionalist exposed in its sexism. But surely traditionalism made to laugh at itself while being coloured in with new shades and moods is traditionalism being transcended in the act.Le Doeuff's work is 'beyond (the) good and evil' of moralising, and yet nowhere near nihilism or cynicism either. She is intelligent - canny with a sharp jibe. What she shows is that with spirit, fine thought and a free vocabulary you can go right into the den of the past tradition, paint sketches, bring back trophies and adventurers' tales and write in a way that is free of the past while being informed about and by it."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Otranto Straits: Controlling the Gateway to the Adriatic in World War I (Twentieth-Century Battles)","review":"In most histories of the naval conflicts of the First World War, the emphasis is primarily - if not exclusively - on the maneuverings and battles in the North Sea and the Atlantic. While this area was indeed the site of many of the important maritime struggles of the war, such a focus overlooks the many other areas in which the war at sea was fought. One of those areas was the Adriatic, where the Austro-Hungarian navy battled the combined naval forces of the British, the French, and the Italians. In this book, Paul Halpern, the preeminent naval historian of the war, illuminates this often-overlooked front by focusing on the key battle waged there, the battle of the Otranto Straits.Halpern begins his book by providing the background to the battle. He notes that many people often overlook the proud naval history of the Austrians, who triumphed in the battle of Lissa in 1866. While primarily a costal and regional force, the Austro-Hungarian fleet was involved in the naval armaments races at the beginning of the 20th century, and had a number of battleships at the start of the war. Their use was restricted by the geography of the region however, which favored conflict by smaller craft. As a result, the most effective and oft-utilized weapon was the submarine, and the ports of the Austro-Hungarian empire played a key role in basing German and Austrian submarines that attacked Allied supply lines in the Mediterranean.Though the British and the French easily outmatched the Austro-Hungarian fleet on paper, the demands of the conflict meant that their superior forces were usually deployed elsewhere in the war. While the Italians added to this superiority upon joining the conflict, their reluctance to risk their capital warships - a risk illustrated by the sinking of two armored cruisers early in the war - meant that a rough stalemate existed in the Adriatic. Halpern is especially good at describing the challenges faced by the multinational Allied force, with political tensions often defining plans and operations inhibited by the difficulties in communicating across three languages.Nowhere was this better illustrated than with the barrage the Allies tried to establish across the Otranto Straits, an effort that was often hindered by disputes over contributions from the various sides. Halpern is dismissive of the efficacy of the barrage in stopping submarine transits through the straits, yet it provided a useful target for the Austro-Hungarian navy to attack. On May 15, 1917, three cruisers attacked the drifters manning the barrage, sinking fourteen of them before heading back to base. The Allies attempted to intercept the cruisers, prompting a midday engagement from which the Austrians escaped with some damage. Though Halpern credits the Austro-Hungarian force with the greater success in the battle, the success proved difficult to replicate, and in the end could not prevent the empire from going down to defeat the following year.Halpern does an excellent job of reconstructing this engagement, an effort complicated by the conflicting accounts of the battle. Yet the greatest strength of the book is his use of the clash as a window into this often-overlooked theater of the war, demonstrating how it embodied many of the elements the various sides faced while fighting in the Adriatic. Though marred slightly by occasional repetition within the text, this is a great account of an often neglected battleground of the First World War and a must-read for anyone interested in the war at sea."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Otranto Straits: Controlling the Gateway to the Adriatic in World War I (Twentieth-Century Battles)","review":"I have enjoyed Paul Halpern's works over the years and this is an added must. In it he gives a very detailed and tactical account of how the battle in 1917 unfolded and by this he shows how many of the tactical convoy and naval battles would be like in World War II.So unless you read Italian or German, this is the best account in English and is well put together with maps and wonderful and well produced photographs."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Otranto Straits: Controlling the Gateway to the Adriatic in World War I (Twentieth-Century Battles)","review":"It's an otstanding account of one of the most unknown naval battles of the first world war.

The battle is very obscure in the West, where the WW1 naval interest revolves around Jutland and the North Sea. However, it was an extremely interesting affair and the book presents it in a very readable and exciting manner.One of the most fascinating aspects of this battle is the amount to which aircraft participated on both sides. Remember, this is WW1. This is emphasized by the large number of illustrations in the book created during the battle by these aircraft: photos and position diagrams."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Otranto Straits: Controlling the Gateway to the Adriatic in World War I (Twentieth-Century Battles)","review":"I knew little about Adriactic operations in WW1.(Still don't know much more!) However, the operation described in this book is a classic lesson. A small, homogeneous force departs on a specific mission. The opposition is much larger but its leadership is disjointed and its task gets more and more complicated. Before it's all over we have an idea of what will follow in the next war... in the Pacific! Surface action galore supported by effective submarine action and somewhat effective intervention, and participation, by aerial forces! How's that for a tempest in a teapot!The book is fairly short, long on facts and action, and a 'dashed good' quick read. Read it as history, as a good sea story, or for inspiration for a war game.

But what is this doing to our children? The Media has so permeated our lives that it seems there is no way to protect \\"childhood innocence.\\"\\"Saving Childhood\\" offers parents hope and practical tips on how to encourage security, a sense of wonder and optimism in the life of a child. This book will empower parents and give them hope for the future.The first part of the book has been written to make parents aware of the realities of the situation and explains the \\"Assault\\" on innocence. The second part is the \\"Defense.\\" Michael and Diane explain that the Assault is coming from Media, Schools, Peers and Parents. They show how statistics have proved that the problems in our society are getting worse at a rapid pace and back this up with scientific evidence. They also explain many points with examples from the raising of their own three children.The Medveds explain how we live in a land where sex education has failed to reduce teenage pregnancy, children feel guilty for existing, parents push their children to grow up too fast, children have a lack of moral values, and parents have taken a passive role.So who is educating our children? It seems an inadequate school system and the TV!Television is well known for programs which contain high levels of violence. I have long been a believer that TV violence causes aggression. Michael and Diane prove this point and I found it interesting to read about how the crime rates increased soon after the introduction of TV into various towns.I grew up in South Africa for most of my childhood and remember very few people having TV's in the early years. TV was apparently banned until 1975. In fact, my father never purchased a TV and so I grew up basically TV-free! Perhaps that is why I can still enjoy a movie like \\"Runaway Bride.\\" Most of my friends are so jaded, they can't appreciate movies which I find to be very enjoyable. In fact, most movies are new to me.The Medveds also show how TV promotes impatience, self-pity, superficiality and gives us all a harsh view of the world. With all this negativity, how are we balancing our lives and promoting a positive view of the world?There are now three books I consider \\"essential reading\\" for every American: \\"America's Real War,\\" \\"The American Paradox,\\" and \\"Saving Childhood.\\" These three books are brilliantly conceived works which explain America's present predicament and give excellent solutions. After reading all three books, I am now convinced of our nations need for:1. Responsibility to a Higher Power. (90 percent of Americans believe in God) 2. Renewed respect for life and authority. 3. The teaching of personal responsibility, patriotism and honesty. 4. Parents that stay together and live what they teach. 5. The teaching of moral values. 6. The reading of inspiring books instead of a diet of negative TV reinforcement. 7. A revamp of our Education System. 8. Holding our Media responsible for programming. 9. Teaching a sense of gratitude for life. 10. An all-out effort to protect the remaining innocence of our children.In order to promote the efforts of parents, Michael and Diane devote chapter seven, eight and nine to explain how parents can promote \\"security,\\" \\"a sense of wonder,\\" and \\"optimism\\" in the lives of their children.\\"Childhood is perhaps the only phase of life when innocence can flourish. But to allow this, parents and others responsible for children's minds need to construct a protective shelter against the painful and frightening facets of life. They need to stand guard at its door, to let the harsher truths of reality gradually unfold for the child, in a way and at a pace that allows the child to maintain a positive outlook. Honoring innocence is incompatible with assuming that the earlier children grasp all the worst aspects of the world, the better prepared they'll be to handle them.\\" -- \\"Saving Childhood\\" page 195To this I add one of my favorite poems for children:May tree and plant and shrub be soundless through the night and stars and moon be dimmed to shut out all the light. So when you sleep in peace, no bird will move in flight, and angles guard your sleep. Goodnight, my love goodnight. ~James Neill Northe~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"What a novel concept! Michael and Diane Medved have decided that parenting is not only important, but actually worth the time and effort required to rear happy, well-mannered progeny. While this book is rife with suggestions about issues such as schooling, vacationing, and the evening meal, perhaps no social convention is confronted so adamantly as the television. Supplying solid statistics and reasonable examples, the authors make a convincing argument in the idea of eliminating one's TV altogether.But this book is not an attack on America's social system. It's a call to regain control of one's family by exercising wisdom, temperance, discipline, common sense, and optimism in an age when examples of such qualities seem to be difficult to find."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"For all parents and those concerned about the effects of popular culture on the minds and hearts of their children, this is an essential book. The Medveds point out the perils of the &quot;preparation&quot; paradigm currently in vogue. According to this way of thinking, children must be prepared for the worst, in order to protect them. In realilty by telling children that the world is an evil place full of danger the &quot;preparation&quot; advocates are frightening them needlessly, destroying their innocence, and making them prematurely cynical. Sex education in kindergarten, distribution of condoms in junior high, debunking of religion in public schools, bad examples set by politicians including the president, are just a few of the topics which are explored in this timely and important book. SAVING CHILDHOOD succintly demonstrates that children's happiness depends upon optimism, innocence, and a sense of wonder The Medveds give practical tips and pointers on how to provide these three qualities for your children. I highly recommend this book.."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"I was quite receptive to the premise of the book, as I have been decrying the growing move to make &quot;little adults&quot; out of children, and I am struggling to insure some sense of childhood for my own two children. The Medveds are well intentioned, but they try so hard that it undermines some good points included in their analysis. To use a baseball analogy: they came up with the bases loaded; rather than simply trying to put runs on the board with a solid single, they loaded up for the grand slam, resulting in a pop to third base.The book is quite &quot;over the top&quot; in its included examples of our culture and the manner in which to counteract the at-times negative influence of the media, peers, school, and parents. As other reviewers have noted, some of the Medveds' examples of their reaction to certain situations are downright chilling. One example: their local librarian had (innocently) recommended a particular Judy Blume story to the Medveds' 7 year old daughter (a gifted reader); the Medveds were shocked to find that it included a discussion of menstruation. The parents' reaction was to take the book from the child, tell the child the topic was off-limits until they were older, and then to forbid the child from checking any book out of the library that was written since 1960. Geez! Why not pull the librarian aside and say that you would appreciate more age-appropriate recommendations, rather than a &quot;young adult&quot; level Judy Blume book? Why not have a simple talk with the daughter about menstruation? Would it really corrupt her &quot;innocent&quot; childhood that much?Although the tone can seem &quot;holier than thou&quot;, I believe the Medveds are well-intentioned. The problem is that the evidence cited tends to be the absolute &quot;worst case&quot; situations, and the proposed solutions are a bit extreme. (E.g., the Medveds don't own a TV; somewhat ironic given that the only reason anyone has heard of Mr. Medved is his TV work.) I think the book would be more useful if it were &quot;toned down&quot; and the essential message were allowed to come through - that in today's culture, with the sheer volume of messages rebounding that are not appropriate for children, it requires CONSTANT vigilance by parents, who must be willing to step up and exercise guidance and, yes, discipline to insure that their children are able to have a true &quot;childhood&quot;."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"Cracking the cover of Saving Childhood is like spreading a napkin across one's lap prior to a Thanksgiving feast. Michael and Diane Medved set the reader's table with a bountiful array of fascinating - sometimes disturbing statistics and quotations surrounding the many influences on childhood. Like a fly buzzing around the stuffed turkey however, is the Medved's consistent opinionated and judgmental interjection.The book systematically addresses \\"the assault on innocence\\" by media, schools, peers, and parents with a barrage of statistics and quotes by specialists in related fields. Few are spared by the accusing Medved finger. Refreshingly, the targets of attack are not limited to one aspect of society, but rather proposes that the most ignorant entertainer is perhaps no more guilty of this assault than the permissive parent.Educators, parents, caregivers, and just about anyone interested in social analysis and criticism will find Saving Childhood an entertaining, worthwhile read. However, these very same readers may also find themselves eventually rolling their eyes over the repeated, cutesy tales of the authors' own family. For those of us with children that walk in dirty sneakers rather than fly on angelic wings, the Medved's personal life may evoke mild nausea. Similarly, those that indulge in occasional tasteless humor may become defensive when they find the Medved finger pointing directly at them.Nonetheless, the book's social and personal value far exceeds its minor quirks. The average adult reader will find the writing light and approachable, and will undoubtedly walk away with at the very least a new perspective on the subject; perhaps, the reader will even walk away a better person."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"Written with the meticulous research and keen insight for which Michael and Diane Medved are rightfully noted, this is an excellent book. Citing the many negative influences of our modern culture, the Medveds stress the importance of saving childhood innocence, something which we of the older generation possessed, but sadly, children of the present generation often do not. Loving and caring parents themselves, Michael and Diane give parents hope and practical information to enable the rearing of happy, independent, and emotionally healthy children."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"This is an important book with some desperately needed themes in this society that is antagonistic toward childhood: In an effort to preserve the innocence of children, otherwise good information is not appropriate for children. Example: It's good to talk with your pre-adolescent about the changes her body will soon undergo, but that information is not appropriate, nor necessary, for younger children. Dovetailing this is the theme that popular culture is at odds with protecting the innocence of children. Example: Children should be encouraged to dream about becoming pilots when they grow up; they should not be encouraged to make actual cross-country flights at an age when they should still be believing in the Tooth Fairy.But I do have reservations: This book would be much more effective if it were more subtle. It is not necessary to throw in anecdotes about how their daughter was frightened to the point of hysterics by a news report of the Lorena Bobbitt case; or, at the other extreme, how their other daughter reported that a certain book was not appropriate for her to read. Showing that their own children are not isolated from the invasive childhood-destructive agenda of popular culture is important; it is admirable that their daughter is obedient, knows right from wrong, and feels secure enough to let them know when something she reads is upsetting. But, the dramatics with which the stories were told was unnecessary and could have been related through more discreet means.I also took exception to the Medveds' presumption to offer suggestions on how Christians should celebrate two of the most important and holy feasts of the Christian liturgical year. Their point about preserving the wonder of childhood fantasy is well-taken, but to suggest that Christians should preserve belief in Santa and the Easter Bunny (especially when the Medveds themselves are not likely to do so with their own children) and incorporate fantasy into two solemn (albeit also joyous) religious feasts borders on arrogance. Would not the Medveds bristle at Christian suggestions as to how they ought to observe Jewish holy days?All in all, SAVING CHILDHOOD is important and timely, but could have been improved with discretion and subtlety."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"It's refreshing to hear someone finally espouse an idea that's been clear to me for a long time and that seems to have been completely lost in today's society:Children need to be introduced APPROPRIATELY to \\"reality\\".Does it make for easier parenting? Not by any stretch. It takes diligence and effort to make intelligent decisions about what to expose your child to.The idiotic idea that it's somehow better for a 5 year old to \\"see how things really are\\" is borne of lazy parents, both intellectually and physically.If you want easy, don't have kids.Thank you to the Medveds for writing this book- I hope some of the people I see writing reviews here have the sense, for their children's sake, to heed some of the advice."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"One of the most impacting parts of this book for me is the main thesis.page 16QUOTE:\\"...the three components of childhood innocence: security, a sense of wonder, and optimism.At the moment, our society seems to be obsessed with the importance of \\"self-esteem,\\" but we argue that as significant as it may be for children to believe that \\"I'm a great kid,\\" it's even more crucial for them to believe that \\"It's a great world.\\"If feelings of gratitude and hope and appropriate awe at our astonishing universe aren't instilled in childhood, chances are they will be denied for a lifetime.\\"END QUOTE.When did we as a society become so determined to \\"prepare\\" kids for the terrible world??

The brilliant and wise and refreshingly counter-cultural things they say within its covers should be shouted from every rooftop -- or at least shared enthusiastically at every place where parents gather. Read this book and tell other parents about it. They will thank you, and someday their kids will thank you."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"Whatever happened to the innocence of childhood? The Medveds do a great job showing how that innocence is being stripped by the media, by the schools, and often by parents themselves in an attempt to \\"prepare\\" children for the real world. Instead, we are rearing frightened, cynical children, who are actually less able to handle the pressures of growing up, and who are less likely to become psychologically healthy adults.I highly recommend this book, and plan on buying an additional copy for a pregnant friend."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"I bought this book after hearing a radio interview with the authors in which he cited a number of the problems and concerns facing children today. His concerns are valid, but the logic in which he makes his arguements is flawed. Examples cited often use &quot;worst case&quot; anecedotes or studies and sometimes the detail behind his assertions makes no sense. In one instance, he complains about obsense lyrics in an album that I don't recall ever hearing about, then he states that children will be harmed by a discussion of the controversy. On the same page, he laments the youth of certain musicians such as the Hansons and a 16 year old blues artist. No complaints here about the content, just a concern that the artists are too young. (Doesn't he remember the Jackson 5 or Partridge Family?) Another section I found almost laughable was the story about his 8-year old saying &quot;This is a bad book&quot; about the Girl Scout Junior Handbook, because the child had come across a discussion of menstruation. Couldn't she have just skipped over it? How are they going to explain to this child when she is 12 that this is now a &quot;good&quot; topic? I would like to read a book by the daughters in about ten years as they describe their upbringing in retrospect. Especially the one that says she is picky about her friends and would never have a friend her parents didn't approve of. Talk about children who have been programmed to say the right thing! In summary, I did not disagree with many of the points mentioned. I would have liked to see more emphasis on the influence of media of females' body image and a more balanced look at sex education."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"Michael and Diane Medved's new book &quot;Saving Childhood&quot; operates on the premise that the key elements of childhood innocence: security; a sense of wonder; and optimism are birthrights that elude many of today's children. Protecting these basic rights is the prescription the Medveds offer to counter the everyday assault by the media, schools, peers, and even parents themselves, that interfere with healthy development. This book offers solid, if somewhat idealistic advice for parents who feel they are parenting upstream. In this &quot;age of enllightenment&quot; today's children view wars on television, read about children killing other children, and develop dangerous eating disorders as young as the age of nine. It is difficult to argue with the Medved's assertion that children receive more information than they can process and still feel good about the world at large. I would recommend this book to any parent trying to shelter their children from the barrage of adult information aimed specifically at children. In our family, no day is ended without each of us thanking God for his blessings; an American flag flies in front of our house. Security, a sense of wonder, and optimism are worth fighting for for our children."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"The Medveds insist that the media is launching an all-out assault on childhood innocence. However, their solution is to place blinders on children so that they can't see anything. Part of the book's failing stems from the fact that it was released in 1998, so a lot of the information contained is outdated.I should point out that I agree with the Medveds on four points that they refer to as the fundamental bases of childhood: (1) adults are responsible for kids; (2) kids should respect their elders; (3) there are some topics children do not need to know about until necessary, which can be presented gradually and with sensitivity to the individual child; and (4) the world can be a friendly place. However, I vehemently disagree with the Medveds that demonizing the media somehow protects children.At one point, they write that \\"anecdotal evidence doesn't mean much.\\" Okay, then why put anecdotes from your own family into each chapter? If it doesn't mean much, then provide better evidence for your claims.They also state that Hollywood's message to kids is that \\"the world is an evil, ugly, scary and dangerous place, full of peril and deceit.\\" Yes, and? I seem to recall reading that the world was a bad place in the Bible, specifically at Matthew chapter 24 verses 3 through 14, and 1 Timothy chapter 3 verses 1 through 5. This isn't anything new.They repeatedly commit the fallacy of questionable cause throughout the book, insisting that television and the media are the source of all problems, without taking into consideration other factors. And, hey, if the media and Hollywood are the problem, then why is Michael Medved, the co-author, working there as a producer? Isn't that a bit hypocritical?I remember hearing a speaker state that for parents to instill moral values in their children, it was important to insulate them, not isolate them. In other words, mention to them that the world can be a bad, scary place but let them know ways of dealing with problems and issues that come up. Communicate regularly with your kids. Insultation breeds well-rounded kids who can deal with peer pressure; isolation breeds ignorance, as shown from the Medveds statement on page 56: \\"When we inadvertently allow contradictory messages to slip into their ears, they protest, or simply run away.\\"Their defense of childhood contains three components: security, a sense of wonder, and optimism. I would argue that it's possible to have all three but in a realistic manner. We don't prevent kids from hearing about bad things (a man robbed a grocery store, for example), we then explain to them why we believe it's bad (stealing is wrong) and why punishment exists for people who do these things. Pretending they don't exist is naive and silly. I'm not suggesting parents sit down with their 5-year-old kids and watch \\"Law & Order\\" reruns and debate the fourth amendment. I'm suggesting that parents communicate with their children openly and honestly."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"Medved follows his book on Hollywood vs America with another look at values; this time with children as the focus. Highly recommended.After recoiling to having to hear the &quot;f&quot; word in the first 4-5 scenes in Titanic, I was thrilled to know Medved was noticing the same thing: an onslaught of images that are antithetical and hostile to my values as a parent. You didn't notice those scenes in Titanic? Exactly the point. Many such attacks (is there any other word?) are getting under our radar.Medved explores how our responsibility as parents can be fortified, and the well-being and development of our kids can be enhanced. This is not a gloomy book with nothing but a litany of examples from our &quot;sick society.&quot; That would be too easy, you need go no further than the White House!Medved loves popular culture, teachers, and parents. You will find yourself inspired to take up the leadership role you may have let slip in your hurry to get your career on track, or to make sure your kids got some &quot;head start.&quot; This is a book that will leave you exhuberant, if wary of the forces that would love to fill any moral vacuum you leave in your child's heart.Bill Eberwein"},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"This book was at best okay. I agree that it is important to allow children to grow up slowly and preserve their sense of wonder and awe. Most parents will do the best that they can. This book goes over the top with trying to scare you into implimenting its suggestions. I think any engage parent understands most of what this book has to offer(Unfortunately we live in a time where there are a lot of parents that don't engage their children) and deals with it as best they can. It's another call for no more television, blah, blah, blah. Again, I feel that good parents are doing the good things that this book has to offer and the bad parents probably aren't going to even pick up this book.

While it has the standard commentary on the problems with modern society (schools, media, peers, etc) it also exposes how the news media makes us believe things are worse than they really are. Regardless of the latest sensational teen murder sprees, most families and most communities are quietly passing on traditional values of self-control, childhood wonder and beauty, and religious morality. We liked the glimpses into the Medved's home life. We may even throw out our television.... maybe! :-) Don't watch the evening news, read this book and then go plan a day at the zoo with your kids.

Unfortunately they are over-the-top in sharing their own lives in a nauseating self-congratulatory way. Dr. Garbarino's &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; was a much better read, and I am optimistic that some sort of primer incorporating his and the Medved's points will be made available to the general public."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"This is the most frightening book I have read in a long time. The Medveds are raising their children in a completely unrealistic way. For example, they are upset when their seven-year-old daughter asks about menstruation, saying this is a 'bad' thing. They don't allow this same daughter to read anything published after 1960. In another anecdote, they recount how another daughter repeatedly asked a babysitter intrusive and inappropriate questions about her pierced nose - and then blame the babysitter rather than the rude child! Still another problem - they complain about businesses that are open on Sunday, but what other day would a Jewish family have to do the weekly shopping? These parents should be arrested for child abuse. I am by no means a religious person, but tonight I am going to thank God that these people aren't my parents."},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"While any rational parent would agree that today's children are confronted with an astonishing array of influences that wittle away their innocence, the appropriate response to this cultural phenomenon is far more complex than the Medveds analysis. There is a lack of distinction in the book between what is merely age-inappropriate, versus what is just plain over-the-top &quot;bad&quot;. Discussion of menstruation in a Junior Girl Scout Handbook? Hardly the end of civilization as we know it. Environmental curriculum creating unnecessary &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;anxiety&quot; about the well-being of our planet? No; becoming a good steward of our earth begins young. The Medveds miss the point in their many anecdotes: it is the responsibilty of the parents to screen the media their children are exposed to; to discuss curricula with their schools, and make informed decisions about whether or not what is being taught is at odds with their beliefs - and use these opportunities to reinforce with your children WHY, as parents, you believe what you do. This book is infuriating because the authors respond in a sensational and hysterical way to the most innocuous things, and fail to logically address their basis thesis!"},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"Michael Medved, the patron now attempts to convince America that the key to our collective survival lies in the need for cookie-cutter, complacent, conformity-minded children. How does a parent strip all individuality from a child? It's in here. How does a parent raise a paranoid, naive, utterly unprepared child? It's also in here. Remember parents, the enemy is reality, and it's best to tell your children that sex, independent thought, intellectualism, and complexity are all evil and must be avoided at all costs. Is there a national assault on innocence? Perhaps. But is it a better alternative to declare war on sanity?"},{"Title":"How to Protect Your Children from the National Assault on Innocence","review":"The idea of childhood as an idealized, golden time of sweet innocence is actually relatively new, culturally speaking, and it was invented by adults. Anyone who actually remembers their school days without glazing them over in sentimental nostalgia knows that children are not little angels untroubled by the sins and cynicism of their elders. Kids are basically little animals that, hopefully with the careful guidance of loving parents, may someday develop into responsible, moral human beings. If you don't believe this, go observe the kids playing at your local elementary school when they don't think the teachers are watching. Listen to the things they call each other, watch them push and shove and show off. There's your \\"innocence\\".Not that kids are little adults, either. They haven't yet formed some of the necessary cognitive, moral, and emotional constructs to understand the complicated issues that adults must. But they're human beings, and are fully capable of all the worst of human nature. The catch is, it's only by facing that side of ourselves that we learn not to be ruled by it. Otherwise why did God bother to burden us with the ability to choose wrongly?--because without knowing what you reject, choice is meaningless. What the Medveds are preaching is not the preservation of innocence--a comforting illusion dreamed up by adults--but a doctrine of willful ignorance.I am not surprised that their daughter was so upset by troubling news reports. Their attempt to shield her has apparently made her sense of security and optimism that much more fragile, easily broken by the merest intrusion of the rest of the world. As those children grow, they will either have to continue to shut out anything that disagrees with their tunnel-vision view of the world, or completely restructure their thinking. I would rather teach my children to face this world's trials, eyes wide open, in compassion and love, then teach them to hide from it in fear masquerading as \\"innocence\\"."},{"Title":"Early Man,","review":"Early Man is a great book to inspire children about paleoanthropology and the evolution of humans.

The photograph on page 17 shows a Neanderthal skullcap. The skull drawings on the right side margin of page 33 show the changing forms of the primates Plesiadapis (60-55 million years ago), Smilodectes (50-45 million years ago), Aegyptopithecus (30-28 million years ago), Pliopithecus (23-12 million years ago), and Proconsul (20-10 million years ago), showing the trend as time went on toward the shortening of the jaws and the increasing size of the cranium. The tooth drawings on the right side margin of page 35 show the four cusps of the baboon and the five cusps of the chimpanzee in what is known as a \\"Y-5\\" pattern that only apes and humans have. Pages 41-45 (with pages 41-43 as an attached fold-out) feature drawings of and the time ranges for Pliopithecus, Proconsul, Dryopithecus, Oreopithecus, Ramapithecus, Australopithecus africanus, Australopithecus robustus, advanced Austalopithecus, Homo erectus, early Homo sapiens, Solo Man, Rhodesian Man, Neanderthal Man, Cro-Magnon Man, and Modern Man. The drawings on the right side margin of page 51 contrast the pelvises of man and Australopithecus, both of which have short, broad blades and significant flanges, with the pelvis of the gorilla, which has long blades. Page 57 features a portrait drawing of Australopithecus robustus having thick brow ridges, a flattened gorilla-type nose, and projecting large jaws. The skull drawings on the bottom margin of page 81 show the inverse relationship between jaw size and brain size for the chimpanzee, Homo erectus, and man. Pages 90-99 feature art images of a Homo erectus group involved in hunting along with photographs of fossil finds. Chapter 5 -- The Tools Of Stone Age Man (pages 100-121) features drawings and photographs of various fossil tools. There are a few perception errors that show the different views in the past; Ramapithecus is now viewed as Sivapithecus sivalensis, which was a small species of Sivapithecus; the fight scene between two Australopithecus africanus males and an Australopithecus robustus group on pages 74-75 may not have actually happened in the past as Australopithecus africanus is now viewed as having lived 3-2.5 million years ago, while Australopithecus robustus lived later at 2-1.3 million years ago; Neanderthal Man is now viewed as a separate evolutionary line that was not ancestral to modern humans.

I absolutely loved The Silent Sleep of the Dying, and I was chagrined to see McCarthy stumble on this mired tale of slashings and slayings.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD--> If you've ever read Agatha Christie, you will almost certainly recognize one of her plot designs; a la ABC Murders. Coming across it here made me think there was a contractual deadline that forced the book to flower too quickly.Why do authors think one or several of the main characters must be the last victim in a series of horrible torture-type crimes? It seems predictable and smacking of one trying to prepare a novel that could still pass off as a Hollywood screenplay.Lastly--there is no character development. None whatsoever. Eisenmenger and Flemming stay almost exactly the same, in essence. I just can't believe these purportedly attractive, successful, and professional individuals would have no relationships (either with each other or with other people).

Harris starts at the beginning, tracing the development of social theory which would lead to the birth of anthropology. This is something that few book do any longer, and it is very helpful. Harris cannot be said to be objective though, and he tells you this is his introduction. He is out to show the history of anthropology as a develpoment of his theory of cultural materialism. This isn't really a setback though, at least he is honest with what he is doing. Overall, the RAT is more far-ranging and comprehensive than any other history of anthropology I have come across, and I have looked."},{"Title":"The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture","review":"This book is at once a history of anthropological debates from Spencer to Levi-Strauss and a plea for methodological rigor. So it is very different--and I think far more useful for students of anthropology--than theoretical surveys like Moore's that give a succession of self-contained descriptions of famous anthropologists under their respective research programs.It is also quite polemical. Theories seem to be evaluated based on their proximity to historical materialism, so it is unsurprisingly that Durkheim and Levi-Strauss do not fare well in Harris's ledger. But even if one doesn't agree with his conclusions, Harris deftly leads the reader through each debate. It is to his credit that we see what is at stake in each argument. This is the book's greatest strength.Some may avoid the book because it stops before poststructuralism and thus thought to be outdated. But there are many good books on poststructuralism in anthropology (Ortner, Ingold's \\"Key Debates\\", etc.), and I have not found a better book than this one for understanding so many key debates over such a long period of time. An excellent reference."},{"Title":"The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture","review":"This is one of those books that transformed the way I saw the world. I came to anthropology late as an interest--never even took an undergraduate course in the subject. I've spent the last few years devouring anthropology, and this is the book that puts it all together--lets you see the whole field (at least up to roughly 1965) and where everything fits in it. This is the single best intellectual history I have ever read.It's also the most important statement of cultural materialism that's out there; especially if read in tandem with Harris's Cultural Materialism. Harris makes a forceful case for the scientific possibilities of anthropology."},{"Title":"The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture","review":"A good book for advanced students of cultural anthropology. The author, Dr. M. Harris, presented a critical review of the rise of theories of culture from the 17th century to mid twentieth century. The book also reads like Who's Who in anthropological theories.The author used too many jargons and big words (where plain english could have sufficed) that make the book a little bit difficult to read and understand, which is why the book is for graduate students. One needs to read recent books in theories of culture to balance the author's often one sided argument and also to bring the debates to date.A fine collection to have."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Into the Darkness (1999) is the first novel in the World At War fantasy series. This storyline can be considered an allegory of World War II, but with magical instead of technological weapons. As one result of this difference, there is much less variation in weapons and equipment, for everybody mostly uses the same magical repertory. Also, the animal equivalent of vehicles has much less variety. Thus, strategy and tactics are much more significant than the hardware per se.During the Six Year war, Algarve lost the Duchy of Bari and highly resented the loss. However, other neighboring nations are determined to keep Algarve from recovering the Duchy. One of the background factors in international relations is the Kaunian Empire, long fallen, its descendants often despised, yet still influencing the culture of many of the belligerents.In this novel, a generation later, the Duke has died and King Mezentio sends his troops into Bari. Valmieri, Jelgava, Forthweg and Sibiu then declare war against Algrave. Unkerlanter and Gyongyos are fighting in the Elsung Mountains. Gyongyos and Kuusamo are fighting over Obuda Island. Zuwayza is playing off Unkerlanter against Algrave, but is mainly focused on her border with Unkerlanter. Lagoas is presently remaining neutral in this war.All this fighting and diplomacy is told in terms of the participants. Although the Kings and high ministers have their say, so do the farmers and scholars and other people of little import in the war, but of great significance to their families and friends. There is the Fortwegian lad and Kaunian lass who are lovers, the Jelgavan marchioness, the Lagoan mage, the Unterkanter peasant, the Algarvian constable, and fighting men of every nationality.As with his other war novels, the author dwells more upon the results of war than its causes: the death and suffering, the injustices and sacrifices, the rhetoric and consequences. The changes in names and geography help conceal the nationality of the participants, so that the reader can look at the situation with clearer vision.Highly recommended for Turtledove fans and anyone else who enjoys tales of human characters trying to just carry on their lives despite great hardship and tragedy.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Harry Turtledove's \\"Into the Darkness\\" begins the series of a world at war, almost identical to World War Two, except this war is fought with magic, where dragons and unicorns collide for supremacy.Turtledove offers his usual blend of characters, from all walks of life, thrown together with circumstances beyond their own control. Initially, the large number of viewpoint characters is distracting and confusing, but the readers quickly adapt.Some of the problems with the book are its parallels with what happened in the real world, and the reader tries to visualize what happens next. This is clear with the Algarvian/ German, Forthweg/ Poland, Underkant/ Russia analogies. However, you get no idea why the Kaunians are so hated, or the history of the world.Also, some of the characters too closely resemble characters of other books. The Krasta/ Anne Colleton parallel were strong for me. And we still get too many of the redundant phrases and descriptions."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"As said in the above review, Setabul is a real city in Portugal. So what? A little known fact is that the names Sibiu and Tirgoviste are names of towns in the Romanian provence of Transylvania. I doubt this was what the the author wanted Sibiu to represent. I belive that Lagoas does represent Britain. Think about it. A battle against Algarve (Germany) in the Land of the Ice People (North Africa). It makes a lot more sense than Lagoas being Portugal, for Lagoas does not stay neutral through the entire war, but declares war when Sibiu is attacked. Also, the Duchy of Bari, I think, is the Sudentenland (forgive the spelling) region of then Chzechoslovakia, which was annexed by Germany before conquering the rest of the country, which almost got the war going. This makes a little more sense, I think. This leaves Kuusamo as America (Manhattan Project?), Unkerlant as Russia (crazy dictator ruler, impressors, Suligen or Stalingrad), Ortah as Switzerland (neutral and mountainous), Sibiu as Greece, Valmieria as France, Forthweg as Poland (split by Russians and Germans in WWII), Zuwayza as Sweden (hot, not cold like Land of the Ice people is cold, but N. Africa hot), and Gyongyos as Japan (warrior race, island war with Kuusamo). If anybody sees any faults with this, please e-mail me."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"As a long-time Turtledove fan I liked the book. It is great fun to trace the parallels with the nations of World war II, which are sometimes obvious and sometimes not so much: Algrave=Grmany, Valmiera=France, Unkerlant=Russia, Forthweg=Poland, Zuwayza=Finland, Sibiu=Denmark, Lagoas=Britain, Kuusamo=USA,Gyongyos=Japan, Kaunians=Jews, unifying the laws of magic = Manhatten project etc. What is strange and not entirely convincing is the very backward political structures of all the nations involved, all ruled either by absolute monarchs or by degenerate hereditary aristocracies. None of these nations seems to have a parliament - even one with a limited franchise; there seem to be no political parties of any kind; nobody - not even dissident intellectuals or outlawed radical groups - offers any idea of a different kind of regime; there is nothing more than an incoherent grumbling by commoners at the rule of the aristocracy. This is very implausible in what is described as quite modern nations, with big cities, good communications, thriving press and even an equivalent of TV. Also, in our history modern nationalism started with the French Revolution; where does the very rampant nationalism in the world of &quot;Into The Darkness&quot; come from, with noting of the kind in its history? Nationalism is basically a capitalist ideology rather than a feudal one. It might have been plausible if Turtledove had depicted a world in which most products are produced by magic, so that no urban working class developed. But there is no indication at all that this is what Turtledove has in mind. In fact, it is clear from his description that mages in this world fill roughly the place of scientists and engineers, but that most things are done by mundane workers (the sticks which soldiers use are magiacllay charged, but are probably themselves produced in a factory; caravans and ships move along ley-lines, but seem to be themselves produced much as our means of transport are produced; etc. Given that, this world should have developed such things as revolutions, democracy, mass political parties and trade unions long before the starting point of &quot;Into The darkness&quot; - though, to be sure, the presence of magic may modify them considerably.A possibly related point: the character of Krasta is plainly intended to be negative, a representative of a degenerate aristocracy which deserves to be toppled from power; even so, could she not have been made a bit more believably human? It is a bit tedious to have a character who appears quite often along the whole length of a book and which NEVER ONCE takes any single action which is not despicable, ridiculous or both. Certainly, Turtledove can - and does - create convincing characters, in this and other books. It seems to me there is some obscure connection between creating this aristocracy, in an incompatible historical setting, and having such an unbelievable character represent this social layer."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Ever since reading the Misplaced Legion books, I've been a big Turtledove fan. Unfortunately, it seems like he's finally hit a wall. Into the Darkness is mediocre, at best. The problem may be that Turtledove is currently in the middle of three different trilogies. It may be that after 20 or so books, he's running out of original things to say. Whatever the reason, this book is a paint-by-numbers work. The characters, story-lines and politics are a re-hashing of his better efforts. Unfortunate, really. I had high hopes for this book. The setting is certainly novel. Maybe Turledove should focus less on volume and more on quality. However, Into the Darkness is one of his weaker works."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I thought \\"Into the Darkness\\" was a very well thought out and executed story. This book roughly parallels WW2 where magic holds sway instead of technology. Many different characters take center stage as the story is told from their point of view; this added a lot to the plot and helped move the story line along. No longer is each side in the war just the good guys or bad guys; now each side is populated with real people that the reader can identify or empathize with. Harry Turtledove wove a masterful tale in \\"Into the Darkness\\", and I definitely recommend this book to any and everyone."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"No Into the Darkness is not a fanstasy novel. Rather its historical fiction, WWII deftly put onto another stage. It has engaging characters, the suitably epic background and best of all 2 more far superior sequals now availible. Don't pick this up expecting fantasy, for it isn't. Of course Harry's goal is to help understand our world and what war means, not envelop us in his own, but he did it all the same. Think of this as Great War: American Front, but with better pacing (6 year war, 6 year series)."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I personally like in my books a combination of action, politics, and how things go in daily life so I can get into the book on a personal level. This book goes through multiple story lines as well as giving you the whole story. You find yourself in the begining of a war, then you go through the war from the soldiers perspectives on each side, the daily people from commoner to nobility, and you get to see how to politicians are doing. Also in this book you get alot of magic and many mythical creatures which keeps readers motivated to read it. This is a must for all readers who love to be entangled with story line of the books they read."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"While I have long been a fan of Harry Turtledove's alternate history, I find this newest series (of which this is the first book) to be a big disappointment. When Turtledove works within the known historical quantity of our own world and its major conflicts, his ability to provide twists and spins on what happened and allow major historical personages to interact with his characters makes for a fascinating read. In this case, he does none of that. In _Into the Darkness_, we are presented with a fantasy world where magic \\"works\\", and onto this world is projected (as a rather dully restrictive template), the basic framework of our World War II, with all of its innovations, people who parallel actual historical figures, array of combatant nations, blunders, and atrocities. The problem with this is that this world is too much like our own. The magical technology mirrors with excruciating exactitude mid-twentieth century innovations (such as stasis boxes for refrigeration; ley line caravans for rail and motor transport, energy sticks for rifles and artillery, and oh those awful \\"eggs\\" for shells and bombs). We of course also have our Stalinist Unkerlanters, our Nazi/Fascist amalgam Algarvians, and the poor hated Kaunians as victims of a potential Holocaust.All these similarities make for what is, in my opinion, a poor pastiche of a complex time in our history, and even moreso a pastiche of some of his own better written novels. If Turtledove had instead spent more time creating a unique magical world and system, rather then having the magical version of panzers and Stuka Dive Bombers, and also created original crises and political realities that did not simply seek to parrot our history (leaving the reader to of course wink broadly and exclaim...\\"so Forthweg is Poland, etc.\\"), it could have been a masterful work. Few fantasy novelists deal with the impact magic has on mass warfare...the idea of a magical armageddon for instance...and wouldn't a society with thousands of years of magical training come up with a more ingenious way of dealing death than casting energy bolts from a stick. There is a lot of uncharted territory here, but this series fails to map any of it out, instead simply seeking to create a Bizarro World image of our own tragic history. If you are a fantasy buff, this one is not going to satisfy, and there are lots of other alternate histories out there that work a lot better than this one, including several written by the author of this big disappointment."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I have long appreciated those authors who are willing to write fantasy works in worlds that are not stuck at a medeival level of development. There aren't many of them, unfortunately. Brust's Jhereg series comes to mind as well as Turtledove's own &quot;The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump&quot;.When I picked up &quot;Into the Darkness&quot;, I was intrigued by the notion of a world where the magical &quot;technology&quot; was roughly at a level of development equivilent to our own world in World War II. Indeed, the first portions of the book had wonderful examples of this. Instead of planes, one has dragon riders; instead of submarines, one has leviathans; instead of tanks, behemoths; instead of bombs, magically destructive &quot;eggs&quot;; instead of guns, there are magically charged &quot;sticks&quot;; and so forth.I eagerly devoured the first third of the book. Even when there were direct echoes of WW2, such as research into the deep structure of magic theory that would allow the construction of devices of immense destructive power, I wasn't overly bothered. Alas, it became painfully clear that, rather than narrating a world that was going through a similar conflict as our world had in WW2, Turtledove was simply describing WW2, right down to specific campaigns and political events, in fantasy terms.I confess that I really don't see the point. It's rather like that horrible sub-genre of science fiction where a hack writer, who only knows how to (for instance) tell westerns writes a book where horses are called &quot;Blurgs&quot;, indians are &quot;Rubnars&quot; and six shooters are transformed into laser zappers. The shame is that Turtledove *isn't* a hack writer. He's written some very good alternative history and some very good fantasy. I suspect that his passion as an historian got the better of him.The thing of it is, WW2 is interesting in and of itself. If I want to read about the actual events of WW2, there are plenty of books out there that talk about it. Turning tanks into behemoths and so forth, just to get people to read about WW2, seems to be a pointless exercise in sugar-coating that which does not need artifical sweetening. At the best, it seems misguided; at the worst is comes across as an insult to the intelligence of his readers.As it stands, if you are an absolute fan of Turtledove and don't mind reading a, more or less, direct account of WW2 cast in fantasy terms, there's no reason not to pick up this book.

I love reading his stories.That being said, there is a fundamental flaw in his attempt to retell World War II as a fantasy story. Other reviewers here have already provided the mapping between HT's countries and the WWII protagonists. These parallels are interesting but the whole concept falls apart because these fantasy countries do not/would not have the population, infrastructure, and industrial capacity to wage war in a way similar to what happened in World War II.Even with magic, HT's socities would lack the capability to field armies with tens of thousands of men, with hundreds of tanks (behemoths), and planes (dragons). The logistics are inconceivably bad.Just one example: in these societies there is next to no mechanized agriculture and apparently no chemical fertilizers. That means that people and hungry animals have to provide the labor to plant and harvest every year. Those people can't go off and serve in a large standing army. And without mechanized, *fast* large-scale transport of material, how are these armies getting fed and resupplied?Magic, in this case, does not seem to serve because, unlike engineering, very very few people in HT's world can perform magic at all and apparently it cannot be used to provide large-scale quantities of goods - at least he didn't talk about that much - where are all those laser sticks coming from? Thousands of them are enchanted by whom and delivered to the field how?The questions can go on and on - what is the replacement time for a behemoth or a dragon? Do they not have to be fed while they are growing up, unlike tanks and planes? How can these society grow huge crop surpluses to support the war effort?Without similar capabilities and capacities, war would be waged in a far different way than it was in WWII.That being said, reading fantasy requires suspension of belief. HT has shown he is a master of minimizing the amount of belief you have to suspend in his alternative history stories. Once you buy into magic, the rules change a bit but he is still just as good.In this book though, I had these questions come up from the start and didn't get truly satisfactory answers. I enjoyed the many story lines and overall sense of the story, but I can't rate this as one of his best works."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I have read most of Turtledove's work and while it's true that the book is more crowded then most the characters are excellently done.

I had trouble deciding. It looks suspiciously like Mr Turtledove took a pretty poor WWII history book and simply changed all the names, and then added a bit of repetitive chat between the many minor characters. How many times did I read 'We've beaten them' and then in the next section someone on the other side say 'They've beaten us'? I found myself laughing out loud at some of it, not just at the intentionally funny bits. Epic fantasy? Dont think so. More a rehash of Harry Turtledove's favourite subjects: the various conflicts of the twentieth century. What next, Vietnam with rabbits ala Watership Down? No, forget I mentioned that.

From page to page it's okay, but it's a draft -- there's little plot unity, with lots of battle scenes that don't really advance the story. I had hoped for a lot of clever and creative magic use, as in the &quot;Toxic Spell Dump&quot; series, but that never really materializes. The one subplot that revolves around magic is marginal to the story. Note to Turtledove: You have a great talent, so don't waste it on second-tier projects.

We've seen this all before from Mr. Turtledove and are seeing it again in Colonization and the Great War.To be fair, this book and Darkness Descending are page turners. Nevertheles, he has a bad habit of endlessly repeating certain catch phrases (E.g., &quot;Old King Cole was merry, so of course everyone had to be merry&quot; -- over and over again throughout the book.) I'd like to see something new, with a fresh approach.Note -- I'm not a professional reviewer and thus don't inconsiderately reveal plot details. I will however cast my &quot;vote&quot; on one &quot;substitute country.&quot; (Most real WWII participants have their &quot;Derlavian&quot; equivalents; most of the fun of this book is figuring them out.) I think the &quot;Land of the Ice People&quot; represents Arabia, not Africa as another reviewer has suggested, based upon the conditions and presence of vital mineral wealth and a &quot;British&quot; colony."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Harry Turtledove has attempted to create a fantasy world roughly equalling our own. A world in which a world-spanning war creates incredible devastation, and magic begins to spin out of control.Unfortunately, he should have read &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; or &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; at least one more time. His technique is so flawed that what could be a promising idea descends into tedium.The first problems arise as the war begins in full force by page 18. Rather than develop his world so that the reader understands what is going on, he dashes right into the war, leaving the reader wondering why these events are occurring. He states that Algarve is a hated nation, but it isn't until the book is half over that one can even begin to understand why. Had he taken a couple of hundred pages and developed the world and characters, it would have worked.More difficulties arise with his construction of magic in warfare. He has not actually come up with anything new; absolutely every piece of magic has a World War II equivilant (magic staffs for rifles, dragons for bombers, etc.). Turtledove hasn't done anything here that Tom Clancy hasn't done at least twice. Had he actually researched Medieval warfare, or at least invented something without a WW2 equal, the combat would have been much more interesting.Then, finally, he has so many point-of-view characters that the narrative is hopelessly scattered. Sixty or seventy pages can go by before a character appears again, and absolutely none of them arise as a major character. Although the characters are well constructed, they simply do not have enough room to shine. Unfortunately, the scattered narrative sends the book into a tedium that it cannot recover from, and the reader quickly stops caring about the characters or the plot.The only redeeming aspect of the book is its skill. Turtledove is a skillful author, and he is able to write intense and beautiful prose. If only that skill had been applied to the overall structure, the book would have been worthwhile."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I really enjoyed this book when I read it. It is the first book in a six book series that tells the storry of WWII through a fantasy theme, airplanes are dragons, tanks are behemoths guns are sticks thatt fire lightning and speacial weapons are magic spells. This book (book one of six) tells you about how the war started and the early stages of the war. From what I know about WWII (which isn't very much I will say) is accurate but the story of the characters is what really grabs you to keep reading. A full map of the fantasy world is included with a list of characters with an asterix by the characters from whose lives you will be reading. This book is a great begining to the series and I don't see how anybody could absolutly hate it."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"\\"Into the Darkness\\" presents an intriguing concept. After a generation of peace, the world of Derlavai is on the brink of yet another global war. In this world Magic takes the place of technology and magical beasts functions as weapons of war. Airplanes are replaced by dragons, submarines by leviathans and tanks by behemoths. Mr. Turtledove is basically present World War II in a fantasy context. Unfortunately the result is far less than the promise of the concept.Mr. Turtledove tells his story from no less than sixteen different viewpoint characters and dozens of secondary characters. With such a cast no one character stays center stage for any length of time and as a result there is little or no character development. There is very little to distinguish one character from another and one setting from another. The result is that every few page the POV changes and one has to stop reading and try to figure out just who the character is and where they are before one can continue reading. The characters and the landscape would have been easier to follow if M. Turtledove has used a real world map and historic characters plugged into a world where magic substitutes for technology. Instead we are left to figure out that Algarve is a stand in for Germany and Valmiera is there in place of France and so on.\\"Into the Darkness\\" is the first novel of a projected six-book series but I cannot see how any sort of interest could be maintained for five more books like this one."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"It looks like most of my review got deleted somehow, so I'll try again:\\"Into the Darkness\\" starts with an awesome idea, and there are some points where it almost delivers on its initial promise. The strengths that Turtledove is famous for, namely warfare and battle scenes, are clearly evident. However, we should expect better writing from an author of his caliber.This concept behind this novel is to have a major war that takes place in a fantasy world, where technology is at a low level, so magic is used in place of high tech weapons. This idea is intriguing, and Turtledove devotes a lot of attention to describing the available weapons and the ways that magic is used to control them. After reading \\"Into the Darkness\\", you'll know how to feed and train a dragon and how to find a ley line from which to draw magical powers. For those who enjoy that sort of this, Turtledove provides some fascinating explanations of battlefield tactics, and his actual scenes of warfare are almost always suspenseful.Unfortunately, the novel falters whenever it moves away from the war that constitutes its central plot device. Part of the problem is that Turtledove decides to tell the story from no fewer than sixteen points of view. To accomplish this, he divides the book into sections of about five pages, and skips abruptly from one POV to the next. Since each character in the novel receives a grand total of about thirty pages, it's difficult to care about any of them. If half as much time was devoted to characterization as to the endlessly repetitive descriptions of food and clothing, this could have been a much more memorable work. To make matters worse, the authors employs every imaginable stereotype, including the evil king, the spoiled rich girl, the corrupt policeman, the absent-minded professor, etc... All of the soldiers in the story (there are at least ten of them) have exactly the same personality, making it nearly impossible to tell them apart, and Turtledove does a remarkably poor job of showing the suffering undergone by servicemen in wartime.Then there's the quality of the writing itself; it has every mark of a novel that was rushed into publication without enough rewriting or editing. Turtledove makes tons of minor mistakes, such as writing \\"east\\" when he means to say \\"west\\", and there are ridiculous sentences such as, \\"Those boys can hide a six-course supper hiding under dead leaves.\\" There are endless cliches (\\"He did not know how his wife was. Not knowing ate at him; it left an empty place where his heart should have been.\\") and annoying attempts to sound authentically old fashioned, such as placing the word \\"Aye\\" before every line of dialogue. The conversations rarely last more than a page, as if the author can't wait to wrap up this scene and move to the next one. The dialogue itself is often poorly written, since the characters never seem to do anything much besides talk about war and politics. Finally, there's no attempt to break from the novel's dreary tone with any humor, unless you count the hilariously inept attempts at sexual innuendo, of which there are far too many. Lines such as, \\"And after supper, would you like to get you own eel stewed? I have a room upstairs.\\" are thrown in on almost every page, apparently for the exclusive purpose of appealing to horny adolescent boys.In the end, I only awarded this book three stars by a very narrow margin. Turtledove didn't put enough time and effort into it to make it truly worth reading, unless you're bored and have nothing better to do. If you'd like to read a much better blending of high fantasy and war story, I recommend George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Fire and Ice.\\""},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"It's huge. It's interesting. It's tough to keep track of all the characters. It's so much like the real World War II you can find the Winter War and the Manhattan Project in it. It's not as good as Guns of the South, Case of the Toxic Spell Dump, or even WorldWar. It's a good buy for Turtledove fans. It would be wise to buy it in paperback, not hardback."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I remember someone telling me years ago that Harry Turtledove hated tales that involved magic. He must have gotten over it, because this tale has magic aplenty. A World War Two fought in another Universe, where magic and magical beasts take the place of technology. The geography is different, the players have different names, but the outcome is much the same. Turtledove does a splendid job of keeping the spirit of the real war in this work of Fantasy. This is the start of a series, something that Turtledove specializes at, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire thing, and highly recommend this start to the war."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Like many others when I started reading this book I found it hard to get into. It was much different than other fantasy novels I have read but I quickly realized that Turtledove has his own style and it started to grow on me. I found myself enjoying this book immensely. I always liked reading about the history of other countries and this was like reading about the history of an entirely new world, although it paralleled ours very closely. I enjoyed the battles very much and the creature creation. I did think that there were too many characters to remember at first but after making it to the third book of the series it was like remembering an old friend.If you like war and large scale battles than this is the book for you, especially if you like them with a fantasy twist."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"This was the first and last Turtledove book I ever picked up. I came into it not knowing what to expect, but hoping to discover something new and exciting. I was very dissapointed. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages, and I'm not one to leave books unfinished. I read books for characters, to get into their heads and go through their adventures and their agonies with them, and when I'm 100 pages into a book and still don't know who the main characters are, or even who these people with all these unpronouncable names are, then I just can't take it."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"In this book the author brings out the stratigy and charecter development more than the grusome detiales.

Based on his reputation, I picked the book up and waded through it hoping for something - which never materialized. The characterization is shallow and the descriptions are poor. It did not even have the redeeming feature of a creative plot or inventive view of magic as a weapon of war. If you take the two world wars of our century, change the names to protect the guilty (and in this book everyone is guilty) and then make endless references to dragons, behemoths and spells - You have this novel.

I wanted to like it, but after reading about 200 pages of mindless ramblings, I just had to stop. I think the book was a good idea, but the author tried to do toom much. Also, since he has apparently written about 100 sequels, reading the books will most likely take longer then world war upon which it bases itself. Maybe Harry Turledove is really Robert Jordan in Disguise."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I only read the first chapter in this book, so I can't comment on the story. But the names that Turtledove came up with are horrible. Its like he picked letters out of the alphabet at random and slaped them togetther. I could not tell if what the characters where talking about was a person, town, or country. He has over 100 major characters in just the first book, and about10 - 15 viewpoint characters. WAY too much for my tast, especially when you can't tell them apart. Another thing that turned me off was that this is a planned 6 book series, and if he is like everyone else out in fantast land, it will be more like 8 or 10. Save your money and go out and get something by Robin Hobb or George R.R. Martin."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"It's hard to imagine history and fantasy working together, but Harry Turtledove pulls it off. Fantasy provides the setting, history provides the action. At first, this book did not excite me as much as Turtledove's other works. It sounded a little to weird. But once I started reading, I knew I had nothing to fear. I have come to recognise Turtledove as one of the most reliably entertaining novelists out there, and this one is no exception. As you might have picked up from the earlier reviews, this novel is a very faithful retelling of World War II with a &quot;spells and dragons&quot; fantasy world for a setting. Although the plot, by definition, isn't very original, the world is quite fascinating. It's interesting to see all the creative ways in which the presence of magic makes up for the absence of technology. Many previous reviewers have speculated on who represents who. Here are my guesses, along with the reasoning behind them:Algarve is Germany. This is fairly obvious. It is the large, powerful country which everyone is afraid of. The Behemoth Blitzkrieg is another big tip-off.Unkerlant is the USSR. Again, fairly obvious. It is another large, frightening empire. Even Algarve tries to avoid them (at first), just as Hitler avoided Stalin until he had the rest of continental Europe pacified. There is also a cruel Stalin analogue in charge.Forthweg is Poland. It is the first country to fall, and ends up being divided between Algarve and Unkerlant.The Duchy of Bari is Austria. The Algarvians march in to a hero's welcome.Yanina might be Italy, but is more likely one of the Balkan countries. It is a much smaller but still potentially significant ally to Algarve. They also serve as a buffer against Unkerlant (which suggests the Balkans).I can't be sure, but I think Sibiu is the Netherlands. Just as the Dutch were caught off-guard by paratroopers, the Sibians are caught off-guard by a carefully-organized sea attack.Jelgava and Valmiera are France and Belgium. They fight bravely against Algarve, but are defeated fairly easily. I am not sure which is which, but am inclined to say that Valmiera is France, due to Krasta's aristocratic snobbery.Zuwayza is Finland. It puts up effective resistance against Unkerlant, but is overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers. They also negotiate a revenge alliance with Algarve, just as finland did with Hitler.Lagoas is Britain. As an island nation, it is the only anti-Algarvian country able to escape invasion.Kuusamo is the United States. They have remained out of the war with Algarve so far, and seem to be on the brink of discovering a magical A-bomb (M-bomb?).Gyongyos is Japan. They are fighting an island war against Kuusamo, and are constantly referred to as &quot;Gongs&quot;.The Land of the Ice People is Africa. The rest of the world considers it very unpleasant, but builds colonies there for economic reasons (sure to offend the heck out of Afrocentrists).Siaulia hasn't really been introduced to the story yet, but I'll bet it's Australia. The map makes it out to be a large but sparsely populated (no major cities) land mass.Ortah has likewise not been introduced, but would appear to be Switzeland. It's small, mountainous, neutral, and in the middle of the continent."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"As a general rule I Read the Amazon reviews starting with the lowest rating before making a purchase. Somehow I glean a lot more out of people advising me against reading a book. Into the Darkness had plenty 1 and 2 stars reviews but it had intrigued me so much I've decided to give it a shot anyway. I'm glad I did and I'll use this stage to answer some of the bad reviewers main points.The main argument against this book and series was weak predictable characters with no development. Another common complaint was about the sheer number of them (about 15 viewpoint characters) which was confusing and didn't allow any of them to arise as a major character. I think anyone using this argument is missing the point entirely. This book focus is on EVENTS not on people. Turtledove is telling his version of imagined history. Read the rise and the fall of the third Reich (Shirer) or Stalingrad (Beevor) for comparison of historical text. Turtledove uses his characters eyes to describe events, for that matter he could have used a hundred different characters. The story would have been as good as his story telling is excellent. If you want character development during wartime read one of the masters (War and peace, Doctor Zhivago), this book style and pace is entirely different. Another point raised was that the similarity with the 2nd world war made it too predictable and boring. That is like saying that \\"every novel based on historical events is boring due to predetermined ending\\". A book doesn't have to be entirely fictional to be good. Another common complaint dismissed the feasibility of the magical and the social system. Hey guys, this is after all a Fantasy genre. I bet none of you said anything when Gandalf used his tricks.So why only three stars?* Turtledove sees the Soviet Union through western eyes. Stalin was in no way the idiot buffoon bent on whimsical decisions as depicted in the story. Cruel, Shrewd and paranoid, yes, but not an idiot.* Turtledove somewhat removed the sting and humanized the Algarvians (The parallels to the WWII Nazis). As a Jew that is always hard for me to accept.* The teeth breaking names Turtledove chose for his countries and characters were tough to remember which caused me a lot of annoying browsing to the legend pages.Summery: Great military fantasy, I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I am a fan of Turtledove's formula of alternate scenarios, and this isn't the first time he has written on the theme of societies where magic does the job of technology. I think this worked better in 'The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump' and 'Thessalonica' than it does here. In these other two books Turtledove treated the idea with humour and it worked. In this book he takes the idea altogether too seriously, and it just gets to the point where you are left wondering what difference it makes? This book might as well have been a tale of World War Two, and nothing more has really been added to the story by making it on a different world and using magic instead of technology. What difference does it make if you are flying on a dragon having dogfights and dropping bombs, or flying an aircraft? The only thing that I found interesting about this story was trying to place who was who (eg which state is Russia, which is Germany etc.) and I'm afraid it wasn't all that hard to spot. If you are going to write allegory, it ought to be a bit more subtle than this. There was, for example a small state which fought a war with the alternate 'USSR' and it was a desert nation, but it was pretty obvious that it was supposed to be Finland. There is even a minority people all set up to play the role of the Jews...I've just been rereading Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' and I think Turtledove would do well to read his comments in the preface about the role of allegory in writing a story, and how he expressly denies trying to parallel it to the war, despite writing much of it during those years. 'Lord of the Rings' works better for it, and if Turtledove is going to write of fictional worlds I wish he would really do that. This was just too close to WWII, and he's already treated the WWII theme pretty thoroughly in his 4 books series of alien invasion."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Alternative history author Harry Turtledove turns his considerable powers of story-telling toward a fantasy world where magic allows people to have more \\"modern\\" type weapons (ie. - guns and bombs)and more complex national relations. In a story that roughly paralells the events of World War II, Turtledove's magical world is plunged into war after the death of a duke allows one of the major powers to take back land that was taken from them after the last war.It is certainly entertaining trying to discern which of Turtledove's countries are meant to parrallel the acutal countries involved. Turtledove does a decent job of making the events of WWII work within a magical setting. As always, his storytelling is up to par.Turtledove's story does suffer from too many characters. Each country involved is represented by a host of characters that soon leaves the reader bewildered and flipping back to the beginning of the book to see who is who. The number of characters portrayed as soldiers also bogs down the book with mulitple points of view on the same event. Turtledove also never offers any kind of explination behind the magic involved - he offers a partial explanation at some points but never enough to truly understand how these magical weapons work and more importantly how their scientific laws operate with each other (I have a feeling this is going to be more important in later books). Further Turtledove doesn't bother to discuss how an entire mobile armies are supplied with the magic they need to operate. While it is certainly interesting to see the events of WWII from a fantasy perspective, I was left with a so-what feeling? Besides having creative ways to parallel the events of WWII into a fantasy setting what difference is there between this book and any other detailing the events of WWII. Truly, there isn't. It would have made for a more interesting read if the events in Turtledove's fantasy world mirrored the events of our own - perhaps the nations involved in Turtledove's war don't make the mistakes of our own. What would have happened if Turtledove's \\"Germany\\" decided not to attack \\"Russia\\" before it had finished off \\"England?\\" This would have taken the story beyond merely another WWII story.In the end, I would still recommend Turtledove's fantasy WWII. While certain changes would have certainly made the book more enjoyable, it still has a lively, readable story line and some of the usual engaging Turtledove characters. It just could have been so much better."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"One of the masters of the alternate universe brings us the \\"Darkness\\" series, a six book journey that takes us through six years of the world of Derlavai at war. There are multiple plotlines and points of view, characters too numerous to mention, triumphs and tragedies, drama, suspense, and surprise. Magic is a physical law on Derlavai, and is the subject of study and experimentation much like physics is on Earth - anyone can \\"perform\\" magic, as long as you are properly instructed. Magic is the primary source of energy, used for transportation, heating, lighting, and also for weaponry.It didn't take long for me to realize that this entire series is an analog for the Second World War. Rather than guns and cannons, soldiers fight with magically-charged \\"sticks\\" and \\"heavy sticks\\". Dragons take the place of fighters and bombers, equipped with heavy sticks and dropping magically-charged explosive eggs. \\"Behemoths\\" (think a cross between an elephant and a rhinocerous) take the place of tanks. Rather than artillery, heavy sticks are mounted on wheels and pulled by horses or mules. Leviathans (large sea creatures roughly the size of a killer whale) are controlled by a rider and ply the seas in the place of submarines and destroyers. Mass transit vehicles travel on a magical grid of \\"ley lines\\" that provide locomotion, while individual carriages are still horse-drawn.At the beginning of the series, Algarve (the analog of Germany) \\"reclaims\\" the Duchy Of Grelz under the pretext of \\"liberating\\" its largely Algarvic population. Forthweg (the analog of Poland) declares war on Algarve, who then conquer the much smaller Forthwegian army and procede to invade Forthweg. Unkerlant (the analog of the USSR) doesn't want an Algarvian presence on its border (which they share with Forthweg), so they invade Forthweg from the west, essentially splitting Forthweg in half. A large percentage of the Forthwegian population happen to be Kaunians, descendants of the original, ancient inhabitants of Derlavai, displaced from much of their land and culture when Algarvian tribes invaded Derlavai in ancient times. Kaunians continue to be a persecuted people the countries inhabited by descendants of Algarvian stock, and when modern Algarve invades modern Forthweg that persecution is taken to extreme, and thus begins the Kaunian Holocaust.One by one, most other countries enter the fray - Gyongyos is the Japanese analog, Kuusamo is the analog of the United States (and is also the home of a secret superweapon project), Valmiera and Jelgava are countries of Kaunian rather than Algarvian stock, and are roughly analogous to France and Spain. Lagoas plays the part of Great Britain, while Yanina is roughly equivalent to Italy.Many Turtledove fans find this to be a weak series, but I thoroughly enjoyed it the two times I read it. Lots of action, romance, espionage, and traitorous activity for any fan. I recommend it."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I read some of the other reviews, and at first I DID have some trouble keeping track of the different characters, but slowly I realized all you have to do is just remember which kingdom they're fighting for and everything slides into place.This book is VERY cool, showing how the war is fought and taking different prespectives on the battle from the warrior to the dragon-flyer attacking the warrior's regiment.I'm really interested to see if Algarve (the Kingdom that is flattening all of the others) is going to win, but there's another Kingdom called Kuusamo that has just developed the equivalent of our 'Splitting of the Atom', basically they've figured out how to manipulate magic from the bottom up or something, I don't know it's pretty detailed, but you get the drift?If they get involved in the war the whole place could sink into the ocean and end with this all being a story about Atlantis. lol So you see it can go any-which-way!

Where his previous well known works have focused on alternate history, this novel takes a different spin on World War II by insinuating magic in place of technology. An engrossing and entertaining read with intersting characters and intrigue."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"\\"Into the Darkness\\" is the first part of Harry Turtledove's six-volume reworking of the World War Two story set on a planet where technology is based on magic rather than machines.Dragon riders replace aircraft, Behemoths replace tanks, East and West have been transposed, Eurasia has been moved to the Southern hemisphere so that Scandinavia becomes equatorial, and names and superficial national characteristics have all been changed. But this is real history, not alternative history. Again and again the terrible events of the book are based on real historical incidents.Some of the changes to racial characteristics are impishly amusing, such as the fact that the people who correspond to the Finns live in an equatorial climate and look like Zulus, while the Saraha Desert becomes \\"the land of the Ice people,\\" the Gyongyosian people who correspond to the Japanese are physically large, and the Kuusamans who correspond to Americans have epicanthic folds.Other changes are rather more biting - the \\"Kaunians\\" who correspond to Jews are tall, blue-eyed, and blonde.What Turtledove appears to be trying to do with this series is to study how different people responded to a time of great evil. Some people were sucked into taking part in that evil, some fought against it, others just tried to live through it. The changes to the names and characteristics of the participants seem to be intended to give the reader an opportunity to leave behind some of our emotional baggage about the holocaust so that we can try, not to justify the wrongs which people did in terrible times, but to understand how it could have happened.All but two or three of the characters in the first few books books are fictional - Hitler is King Mezentio of Algarve, Stalin is King Swemmel of Unkerlant, and Marshal Rathar gradually morphs into Zhukov. This actually makes the story more exiting, as the characters are presented well enough that you care about them: we all know how World War II turned out but the readers has no such certainty about the fate of the fictional characters.The six books of the series each corresponds very roughly indeed to about a year's real historical events. The first book, \\"Into the Darkness\\", mostly covers events corresponding to those between the start of the fighting when Hitler invaded Poland to the fall of France in 1940: the last few pages of the book are mostly filler taking the story up to set the scene for Operation Barbarossa, Hitler's attack on Russia in 1941, which is covered in the second book, \\"Darkness Descending.\\"The series is best read in the correct sequence. All the books of this series have the word \\"Darkness\\" in the title, but the publishers refer to it as the \\"Derlavi\\" series, this being the name given in the books for the great continent which corresponds to Eurasia. It is sometimes also described as the \\"World at War\\" sequence. The full set of six books in their correct order is:\\"Into the Darkness\\"\\"Darkness Descending\\"\\"Through the Darkness\\"\\"Rulers of the Darkness\\"\\"Jaws of Darkness\\"\\"Out of the Darkness\\".Bottom line: the mood is as black as the titles indicate, but the series is a very exciting read."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"This is the first Harry Turtledove book that I managed to finish. Once I got into the flow of the story the book reads very well. Turtledove shows remarkable ability to write a complex story without losing the reader.The book follows the exploits of about 15 to 20 (I lost count at about seven) mostly unconnected characters during the beginning of a fatasy war based on WWII. The book spends the first hundred pages or so introducing characters, and then it turns up the pace, this story may many things but it is never dull.The glaring problem with this very entertaining book is that it is missing a purpose for its existance. The book doesn't have anything important or insightfull to say about WWII or its characters for that manner. What is the point of writing an alternate history novel if not to try to put at least some insight into the history. As it is the book just plagerises from history books to create a storyline for the author to sell. I'm sure there is a much better story to be told by a book such as this one, but this one isn't it."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I've always been a fan of Turtledove's more &quot;realistic&quot; fiction (The Two Georges, How Few Remain, Great War, even Guns of the South) as opposed to fantasy. This book won me over, though. Turtledove replays World War Two (sort of) in an alternate universe, where magic holds the place of technology but human nature remains very much the same. He is not bound by the original analogy; his Kaunians are more akin to Romans than Jews, for example, and actually run two of the warring states. Most exotic names, however difficult to pronounce, are actually real - lifted from maps of Portugal, Jordan, Finland, Rumania. Neither is this exotic and elaborate stage wasted on sub-standard characters. Quite to the contrary, Turtledove's Derlavaians are a splendid cast of warriors, farmers, nobles, mages, refugees and statesmen, who help bring war and its horrors to life. As always, Turtledove's work is highly addictive. Even if you're not a history buff, Into the Darkness (and its sequels) are definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Into the darkness was one of the best written books i've ever read.

The intense plot captures the reader's attention, and Turtledove portrays everyone's reaction to the war, which is very different from each different point of view. There is fast-paced action and suspense, and you get the feeling that the characters are quite human--vulnerable and realistic.This was an excellent book, and I look forward to reading the rest. I highly recommend this book to fantasy-lovers."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"with so many characters and countries it is difficult to keep track of what is going on throughout the book. it seems that the story is told by basically going down the list of characters (at the front of the book) in the same order over and over again telling brief portions of events. since there are so many characters.. by the time you get back to see what is going on with one specific person.. you cant remember who they are and what they are doing. other than the confusion, the plot and imaginary world he creates is interesting. i just wish he cut down on number of characters to develope a few allowing you to become interested in them instead of so many that you dont learn or care much about."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I'd been wanting to read this book for a long time so when I saw it sitting in the library while I was waiting for my daughter I grabbed it. The basic premise is cool. WWII fought with dragons instead of airplanes, sea monsters in stead of submarines, etc. But the end result just wasn't very interesting. Harry Turtledove is known for writing alternate history and that is pretty much how this reads, like a history book. He seems far more interested in the events than the characters or their stories. And I realize that he is trying to cover a lot of ground but any time a book has a cast of characters listed in front and it is longer than three pages that means trouble. Between the huge number of characters and the fact than none of them were all that interesting it took me more than half the book before I could figure out who belonged to what side. For me the bottom line is that this book just wasn't that interesting. I finished it but I won't be reading the second in the series."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I'm getting a bit sick of the Turtledove formula. Turtledove likes to generate 20 or 30 point of view characters, put them in the same milieu, and recount their struggles for day to day existence. It worked in the first 3 World War books (which is about all that was required to make that series work), but it doesn't work here. I found myself identifying with nobody in this story, and thus forgetting who was supposed to be whom.... not that I cared. After a while, the parrallels to World War 2 start becoming obvious (as mentioned by another reviewer) and then the book becomes slightly interesting. You have to have patience to get there."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"The only reason I didn't give it one star is it had its moments - not many, but a couple. The characters are spread out too far to keep straight. Obviously from the reviews, this is a story about a world at war and it never ends or seems to have a point... perhaps that is the point. I have a VERY bad taste in my mouth after this book. Beware!"},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I think Harry Turtledove studied WWII very carefully and has put in is book several insights in obscure and less know aspects of it.For instance, Lagoas is not Britain, as one reviewer said, but is Portugal (Setubal is a city in Portugal and the names of the Lagoans are derived from portuguese ones). Portugal as Lagoas stayed neutral in WWII and negotiated with both Britain and Germany.Also, Algarve is a region in Portugal and is said, in the book, that Algarve, Sibiu and Lagoas have common ancestors. Since portuguese derived from latin and has many words with greek origin (because I think Sibiu is Grece)and Algarve would be Germany but also Spain and Italy, the three major fascists countries at the time of WWII.I think Turtledove used several aspects from each country directly or indirectly involved in WWII and mixed it around.The invasion of the Duchy of Bari is simultanesly Poland (because it's invasion started the war) and Austria because it was like it's anexation."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I am a huge fan of alternate history and nobody does it better than Harry Turtledove. The World War series was great, the Colonization series quite good, and his Civil War series is outstanding. Unfortunately, Into the Darkness stands as one of his lesser works. The premise is ok--a world war fought in an alternate universe in which magic works. But the execution is faulty. Indeed, if one did not know better, one might take DARKNESS as a parody of Turtledove's style. Dozens of plot lines, hundreds of characters--too many to keep track of and far too many to care about. Worse yet, the plot line is totally derivative of the Second World War. Only the names have been changed (to unpronouncable ones). The sex scenes are even more embarassing than usual. As a result, this was the first Turtledove book I decided not to finish--quit at about the 2/3 point, skipped ahead, realized it was a series, and punted. In sum, not recommended. Harry ought to wrap this series up quick and spend the resulting free time on the Civil War series."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"As a total fan of all prior books by this author I was very happy when this book came out. But it really fell short. First of all, there are way too many characters, which prevents the reader from getting to really know or care about any of them. There are also too many different sides and none of them are clearly good or evil. Maybe this is supposed to be some deep philosophical message about the pointlessness of war, but it makes for a pretty pointless story. I regret the time I wasted trying to read through this. Even more, I regret the time that Harry Turtledove, probably my favorite author, wasted writing it, time that could have been better spent writing something interesting and exciting like the WorldWar series!"},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Sorry Mr. Turtldove, but taking history of WW2 and replacing airplanes with dragons and guns with wands DOES NOT make a fantasy novel! What it makes is a mess of contradictions.First, there is way too much magical stuff. The wizards are few and far between - there are simply not enough of them around to make all the \\"sticks\\" and \\"eggs\\" all the armies are expending in such profusion.Second, if you really want to make a fantasy (or any other) equivalent of WW2, you must look at logistics, not just at battles. And there is no mention of how or where weapons are made, or where dragons or behemoths are bred and raised - all such facilities should be prime targets, but they are just swept under the rug.Third, why is everyone so fired-up patriotic? Every country in the book is run either by an absolute monarch, or by a degenerate aristocracy - and commoners clearly have no love for either. So why do they fight so hard? In real world what we call patriotism appeared only when industrial revolution gave \\"common people\\" some measure of power. Before that, kings fought each other with mercenary soldiers, who switched allegiances easily.Finally, all characters are wooden and predictable. All soldiers (and there are at least a dozen of them) have exactly same personality, and are completely interchangeable, which makes Turtledove's usual POV switching rather pointless....This book seems intended strictly for 13-year old males. A desert kingdom where everyone is naked is particularly ridiculous. There is a good reason people in deserts dress from head to toe! It could have been made a jungle just as easily, and the nudity would be at least plausible.All in all, if I did not know better, I'd have thought someone wrote a bad parody of Turtledove's formula."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"This book has taken some flak (pun intended) for being predictable, having too many characters, and some other things.I for one loved this book and look forward to the next. I enjoyed reading how everything was suttle in a sense of how similar all the people of each nation really were. It was a good look at how aside from clothes, language (and even that is similar between the nations), and how they flavor their sausage, the nations really are all in the same mindset. The peasants want to be left alone, the soldiers want to be away from war and in bed with women, and the nobles want to rule the peasants.I also like how you get to see how some characters, who were left out for a while, got along through the eyes of others that run into them by happenstance.Through all of these things I also enjoyed finding the similarities to reality. Matching countries, aircraft carriers, etc.If you look at this book as predictable on a War stance, it will be, but if you look at it only in the storylines of the characters and not the bigger picture of war allegory it makes for a fantastic read."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"As the first volume in the massive World at War series, INTO THE DARKNESS successfully draws the reader in to Turtledove's very well-developed alternate reality. Here we get our first glimpse into the vaguely familiar, but starkly unique, world that is meant to mirror our own, but in a fantasy setting. Loosely based on our own history's World War II, this story may be more enjoyable for those with a greater familiarity with the major events and figures of WWII. That being said, this is still an enjoyable story even if you are ignorant of -or simply ignore- the connections between it and our own history.The greatest complaint that this book has received has been the overabundance of point of view (main) characters. With each chapter being broken up into 5-10 short segments representing the view from one of ~16 primary characters, this book can be confusing at first. However, as you become more familiar with the terms, lands, and characters, you'll find yourself becoming comfortable with this style. One thing it does lead to though, is very slow character development. If each chapter was dedicated to a single character, most characters would only have had a single chapter all told. That doesn't leave very much room for really getting to know the characters. I at least hope that Turtledove stuck with the same POV characters throughout the series.Another interesting aspect of this book is the complete lack of 'good' and 'bad' characters. Each of the them are cast as being very 'human' with good and bad qualities, and with unique perspectives that cause them to act and believe in certain ways. Soldiers on both sides of a war typically think that they are on the side of justice, and Turtledove manages to capture that aspect of war very nicely. You may like some characters over others, but you can't really pinpoint which characters are the heroes and which are the villains.Overall, I enjoyed this read. Not as much as I had hoped for, but I look forward to continuing the series. Recommended for fans of fantasy, especially those with a good grounding in the history of WWII."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Into the Darkness was a very good book. I have stayed up really late at night to keep on reading. I have read the book twice and enjoyed it both times. The book takes place in an old wizardly kind of world. There is a lot of magic in the book other than mages. People are shunned because of of the color of there hair and what they wear. People are captured, but they still fight on to overthrow the empire. Kings, soldiers, mages, and petty farmers come together in a book of exciting adventure."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"&quot;Into the Darkness&quot; has great potential--what would happen if the known world went to war? What if the Blitz was fought with dragons? What if tanks were replaced by behomoths, and motorcyles with unicorns?Good idea, but very poor execution. The structure of the book is a series of glimpses into the life of various characters, ranging from farmers to generals. Every time I became interested in a character, the vignette was over, and the plot moved on. There were too many characters--over 15 &quot;viewpoint&quot; characters, and a host of supporting characters! This technique might have worked in a story set in the &quot;real&quot; world, but I found it difficult to keep track of so many characters and so many locations. There were at least 10 factions or nations involved in the war, as well as the ancient Kaunian Empire. Enough already!This could have been a much stronger book if Mr. Turtledove had focused on a smaller group of characters. Good examples of a small group of characters against a larger backdrop include Guy Gavriel Kay's &quot;Tigana&quot; or Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Mr. Turtledove has a lot of ideas, but if he wants to sell books they must be broken into more manageable pieces!"},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I read it in two days! It was a little hard to keep the characters straight, but if you can read any of the Wheel of Time series or Terry Goodkind you should like this book! I can't wait to read the next book."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"Not bad at all. However, it seems a bit redundant with all Turtledove's other works. The quality of writing per se is very good. And for someone, unfamiliar with WW2 it's more than great reading. Nevertheless, it follows WW2 too closely to be perfect :). Still, I bought and enjoyed it and I also got the sequel, which I loved too. Bottom line: If you like Turtledove get it. If you are unsure of Turtledove and are not too familiar with WW2, get it. If you do not like Turtledove and know your WW2, don't get it, go for Worldwar instead."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"This is not the easiest book to read. The multiple story lines are sort of a two-edged sword. They do make the story a bit harder to follow. I found myself frequently referring to the list of characters in the beginning of the book. The plus side is that all the characters were interesting, each in his or her own way. There is a certain amount of analogy between this war and our own World War II. There is Algarve as Germany, Unkerlant as Russia, Forthweg as Poland, and so forth. There is even magical research similar to the Manhattan Project. One analogy that isn't there, is I don't see who corresponds to the United States, as a major power that sits out the early part of the war, then play a decisive role in the final outcome. Perhaps that will happen in later volumes. Others have commented about how you cannot really tell who are the good guys, if there are any. I forget who said it, but I remember a quote that said something to the effect that everyone is a hero in their own story. All of the viewpoint characters are convinced that their side is the right one, thought a few are slowly learning otherwise. This story is definitely worth reading, alhough I would like an explanation of a few things here and there. For example, the &quot;eggs&quot; are referred to early on as dragon's eggs, but as many of them as there are, it would seem they would have to be artificially or magically created rather than laid by dragons. All in all, I would say this is a notch below the Worldwar/Colonization series, but still well worth reading. I look forward to future volumes in this series."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"I have long been a fan of Harry Turtledove and purchased Into the Darkness with great eagerness. Although the book is rater entertaining, I think it has some serious flaws. First, Mr. Turtledove has continued in this volume to use his customary technique of having many different story lines, giving each a few pages before proceeding on to the next story line. I found this mechanism annoying and confusing in the context of this volume. Perhaps my reaction was partially due to the fact that this work is set in a fantasy world and the characters have unusual names, but I frequently found it difficult to keep the storylines straight. Second, the pace of the work struck me as plodding. This is the first volume in a trilogy, and I fear some unnecessary padding was tossed into the work. Third, the sexual content in the book was fairly strong and graphic. Although this is a matter of taste, parents considering purchasing this book should be aware that there are scenes in the book that are completely unsuitable for children. Having written several negative comments, let me hasten to add that the work does have its strong points. Setting World War II in a fantasy setting is fascinating; I found it amusing to draw comparisons between events that occurred in World War II and the events depicted in the novel. Also, the concept of warfare being made much more deadly by &quot;modern magic&quot;, is a compelling reflection on technology and war in the century now ending. Turtledove is a great story teller, and if he can avoid some of the problems outlined above in the future volumes in the series, I will eagerly purchase them."},{"Title":"INTO THE DARKNESS.","review":"As with most harry Trutledove's books, Into the Darkness is an excellent read and keeps the reader entrapped with its fast-paced story. The characters are well-developed and the plot meshes very well with the overall concept. Additionally, if one looks closely, the different countries of Delavria have real world comparisons with European powers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Unkerlant is easily seen as a combination of Tzarist and Stalin Russia, while Algarve, the other major empire, has the same military precision and styloe as the early Prussian and German Empire. Additional correlations follow, with the Algarvians rounding up Kaunians and putting them in &quot;concentration camps&quot;. Overall, the book is very well written and seems to allow Turtledove to explore what military powers would do in set situations. Although the technology is changed, the tactics (the Behemoth Blitzkrieg)and the army development is not, making INTO THE DARKNESS a must-read for any fan of Turtledove.

So when the Duke of Bari disappears, the Kingdom of Algarve invades with the objective being to bring the lost territory back under their control.However, several other countries have signed protective treaties with Bari and see this as an opportunity to wreak havoc on their enemy, Algarve. On the other side, friends of Algarve join the fray too. War spreads quickly as the world seems to have plunged INTO THE DARKNESS. Fighting impacts everyone from the upper class to the lowliest of peasant. This war is deadlier than any before because magic has become even more powerful than before. Dragons are destroying cities with fire bombs and sea creatures are eradicating ships. The darkness has spread across the continent.Readers of alternate history tales recognize Harry Turtledove as one of the grandmasters of the sub-genre with his epic novels. His latest tale will enhance his reputation among his legion of fans. The story line never slows down as Mr. Turtledove passionately pleads his case by describing the horrors of \\"modern\\" war with its weapons of mass destruction that impact on everyone. No one is immune from the strife. Anyone who relishes a world at war plot that uses magic as a major force of power will gain much pleasure by plunging INTO THE DARKNESS.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Disney's Ten Minute Crafts for Preschoolers","review":"This is a great book for preschoolers and older kids.

The focus of the book wasn't clear to me when I picked it up at an airport book store (which is a criticism, by the way), but it turned out to be an unexpectedly inspired choice, because Leonardo's study of anatomy was linked directly and indirectly to so many of his other pursuits.Because of that, the first 2/3 of the book are background that touch on most of Leonardo's disciplines in chronological order, giving what amounts to one of the better overviews of the original Renaissance Man that I've come across (and I've read several). Only at the end does well-regarded author Sherwin B. Nuland tie it together by examining issues related to anatomy in more detail, at which point I admit I began to lose interest -- not because of any fault of the book's but simply because I get a bit queasy when the conversation turns to things like filling a human eye with different substances so it can be cut open and examined without it collapsing.I give the book good marks for readability, no doubt inspired in part by Mr. Nuland's obvious passion for all things Leonardo. And the unusually thoughtful bibliography was a nice surprise.But it would have been improved by an index and most of all by more illustrations, illustrations of all kinds: maps to show where places are relative to each other; examples of some of Leonardo's artwork which in parts is discussed and described at some length; perhaps a photo of Leonardo's unusual handwriting, which is examined and interpreted; reproductions of Leonardo's diagrams and drawings that illustrate the points being made, whether about the design of cities or war machines or of the anatomy so central to the end of the book. As it is, the book carries only four illustrations (all somewhat related to anatomy), and one isn't even by Leonardo."},{"Title":"One, two, three ... infinity: Facts & speculations of science","review":"Gamow does a great job of teaching all the subjects that were so difficult to learn in school."},{"Title":"One, two, three ... infinity: Facts & speculations of science","review":"I found my first hardcover copy of this book in a library wastebasket!

The style isn't anything very absorbing and I was afraid the choppiness was indicative of a thin emotional plot. But, I just had to find out if the alley cat would be okay or not, so I kept reading. And I'm glad I did :)\\"Miranda and the Cat\\" is a story about a top dog (er, cat) who has won so many fights that he doesn't even need to fight anymore because all the other animals know to steer clear of him. And Cat (as he's referred to) knows to stay away from humans.Miranda, on the other hand, LOVES cats, and doesn't know to stay away from ones she doesn't know. So, when she sees Cat she wants to be friends with him. Cat, for his part, runs away, but ends up scratching Miranda in the process.What I love (and can 100% empathize with!) is that Miranda isn't offended or mad that she got scratched, instead she still wants to be friends with Cat and wonders why he \\"hates her.\\" Miranda's mother explains that Cat doesn't \\"hate her\\" but might be afraid of her, and allows Miranda to take Cat food scraps in the hopes that maybe this will win him over.But, when Cat gets hurt, Miranda takes in onto herself to help him, and her family can't help but join in.What I realized is that this story is not just about the bond between a human and a cat, but also learning how to love an animal and also learning how to love selflessly.After living with cats for a good portion of my life, and now volunteering at a cat sanctuary where part of my job is to \\"win over\\" the feral cats that arrive, I had utmost appreciation for the way Cat was portrayed as well as how Miranda had to go about working with him. Even though the text was a bit choppy, Smith's evident love for animals and working with them seeped into the story and left me tearing up by the end.Of course, a part of me wants to caution about the dangers of petting feral cats who might not have all their shots, etc., but I feel the rest of the story outweighs it. And what I loved is that this story has a happy ending! Happy tears indeed! :)"},{"Title":"Strategies for Successful Writing","review":"I had to get this book for class, not really one of my favorite books, but I did learn a lot and it has helped me both in class and at work.

It helps us to realize that there were helpers (angels) here to assist man and tell the many ways they betrayed God. Many more revelations are included in this book. The Book of Enoch re-enforces the hope and promise christians look forward to in the world to come. I applaud Mr. Brown for his efforts.C.

Anyway, you already know if this book is for you, don't you? If you want to get closer to God, I'd think this will help your cause. I was concerned maybe something satanic had to do with this book, but I've had it in church and there was fire falling from heaven burning up the book of Enoch. I thought maybe because it has the names of demons, but the bible names satan several times and refers to hell many times, so it's okay to speak of these things. Anyway, I'm rambling. I like the book. If I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 in bible books, with the book of John and Acts being a 10, I'd call it a 7 I reckon.The reason I got into this book is because of Genesis 6:4 \\"The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.\\"I wanted the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth on the prince of darkness, fallen angels, nephilim, and the life of Enoch.

Ronald K. Brown has presented the reading public with something wonderful and very readable. It is a breath of fresh air. This volume is a noble addition to the right library, to any person who is interested in the history of the Book of Enoch. &quot;Believers&quot; and church study groups will find it useful and informative, as will critics, skeptics, scholars and humanists. Certainly there is nothing to fear here, unless one is afraid of a good story.Written, refined and compiled over a period spanning at least 800 years (approx. 250 BCE-650 CE, from Qumran through the Hellenistic and Roman periods), the Book of Enoch, or Henok, is one of the finest non-canonical writings produced in the apocalyptic tradition, and is referenced numerous times in canonical books. It certainly influenced the OT and NT. Ironically, Enoch was once (and in some places, still is) part of the canon. The reader will at once see that Rev. Brown has compiled and edited a version of the Book of Enoch from purely Ethiopic sources, though he does not cite which manuscripts he referenced and studied for this compilation of a truly &quot;African&quot; edition of Enoch. Whatever the reasons Rev. Brown speaks only broadly of his studies of Ethipoic texts (and the questionable, dated, 1906 translation by R.H. Charles), this book is compiled from the only known complete works of Enoch dating from antiquity.The most complete texts of Enoch have been preserved through the Ethiopic Christian Church in a language known as Ge'ez. Ethiopic (Ge'ez) is an African writing system designed as a meaningful and graphic representation of a wide array of knowledge, including, languages. It is a knowledge system that is organized to represent philosophical features like ideography, numerology, syllography, astronomy, and grammatology. Furthermore, Ethiopic is not only a cultural agency: It is a foundation to a great literary tradition in Ethiopia. This rich literary tradition, too often overlooked in the past by many Western scholars, is evident in this book, though it is still arguable whether Ethiopic was the original language of Enoch. In fact, no one is certain what the original language of Enoch was; some feel it was both Aramaic and Hebrew. Others think it was Ethiopic because it is akin to the ancient Egyptian (Mirzraim) Hamitic language family. In this case it hardly matters because Rev. Brown has chosen some of the finest renditions of the Ethiopic for readers, and this IS a Book of Enoch based on that literary tradition. In fact, the finest translations of the Book of Enoch I have read have all been structured on the Ethiopic sources (e.g., Kebran 9/II, Princeton Ethiopic 3, Abbadianus 55, EMML 2080, 4437, 4750, the Chester Beatty papyrus, et al). Admittedly, Rev. Brown's compilation has a somewhat compressed Astronomical book (the Book of Heavenly Luminaries, probably the oldest preserved Enochian book), and though taken from Ethiopic texts, the Book of the Similitudes appear here though they were decidedly a later, Christian addition from the common era. 1 Enoch is, after all, a composite that represents numerous periods and writers. One may wonder how the Book of Enoch was shaped, polished and edited over time, how later Christian insertions became a part of the story. There is no Book of Similitudes (Book of Parables) in the Qumran corpus, but rather fragments of the Book of Giants, or men of renown and power.I do beg to differ with Rev. Brown's assertion that the Book of Enoch is an &quot;inspired&quot; work that only further bolsters claims of biblical prophecy, as well as Dr. Yefru's contention that the Book of Enoch dates from 4000 BCE. The foundations of Enoch may very well have existed in several places around the Mediterranean and Northeast Africa before 300 BCE; in fact, it is quite likely. The genesis material that became the Book of Enoch almost certainly predated the written word, circulating as oral tradition, traveling from East to West. At some point, the elements of Enoch coalesced, but no one knows when. The current body of evidence cannot support the contention for a 4000 BCE inception.To his credit, Rev. Brown has included, for those married to the KJV of the Bible, an exhaustive concordance. His remarks in the preface aside, Rev. Brown has compiled/edited a very neutral, unbiased Book of Enoch accessible to any reader, and it is, in my opinion, a fine contribution to the investigation and reconstruction of ancient African historiography. This little gem of a book should not be ignored."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"I became aware of the Book of Enoch during a recent sunday sermonat church. I was curious as to why the Book of Enoch did not appear in either the King James version of the Bible or thecurrent Catholic Bible. I looked forward to receiving this bookfrom Amazon. It is hard cover, and very nicely presented. Itssomething I can add to my book collection. The author very carefully footnoted everything. I learned a great deal. But oneoutstanding fact came to light. Both the Catholic Church and all the Protestants ripped out this book from the Old Testament, even though the Book of Enoch was in the Bible for over 500 years.Some preachers say that the Book of Enoch was not \\"divinely\\" inspired. However, the author's clear presentation of thisancient scripture shows that Enoch, the great grandfather ofNoe, foretold the Great Deluge. Chapter 84 is devoted to \\"Enoch'sPrayer\\" which asks God to not destroy all persons, but to atleast leave Enoch with survivors in his family. The Book ofEnoch probably came under political scrutiny because it talksof all the interactions between angels (both good and bad angels)and human beings. There was also some astronomical data presentedwhich probably contradicted offical Church positions during the eras of Cupernicus and Galileo. I was quite impressed by the volume. I came away from my complete read of the volume with theattitude that it should be considered a legitimate book of theBible. Enoch's prayer in Chapter 84 is on the same level as theLord's Prayer of the New Testiment. Now I am wondering what elsehas been either left out or removed from the Bible.....? I shall definitely be purchasing other volumes from Amazon to try toanswer that question."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"I have read this book several times. Written over a period of several years by my good friend Ronald K. Brown. This carefully detailed work will amaze you. It is one of the few of books of God's word on the mysteries of the universe, and wonders of our ancient world. The Book of Enoch, ties in the prehistoric origins to our modern times. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about this amazing prophet, for Enoch's story is far from over. He is destined to be one of the 2 witnesses (Elijah is the other) to come back in the end times."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"1.If this book is as old as Brown says, or is even just older than Jesus...2.And the text is translated fairly accurately...then I believe that this text is the real deal. There are many reasons to believe this. First of all, it is referred to in the book of Jude 14,15. This leads me to believe that the text was probably important all the way to around 65-70 A.D.According to Brown, the only complete original text is written in Ethiopian script, and dates to being older than Job (the oldest text of the bible).Keeping all this in mind, when you actually grasp what's in the text, you may be quite shocked.ENOCH 48:2 and in that hour the Son of Man was named...ENOCH 48:4 ...And he shall be the light of the Gentiles...ENOCH 50:3 ...through His name they shall be saved...and check out this verse that ties to Rev 12:1-6...ENOCH 62:4 Then pain shall come on them as on a woman in travail, and she has pain in bringing forthWhen her child enters the mouth of the womb,And she has pain in bringing forth.(62:5) And one portion of them shall look on the other, And they shall be terrified, And they shall be downcast of countenance, And pain shall seize them, when they see that the Son of Man Sitting of the throne of his glory.Wow! And that aint the half of it! This book looks to me like it is the brige between Genesis and Revelation. I didn't even get into all of the fallen angel business in this review. Buy this book.

Astrology alone was enough to be burned at the stake in the middle ages. The understanding of why the judgement of these same angels are essential to humans in not following these same teachings today.Enochs naming of the Angels, Michael and Raphael's conversations and most importantly the description of God Himself is worth the read.This is a book that should be an essential in the library of every sincere seeker of truth. As well the lover of His-tory!"},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"According to the biblical narrative (Genesis 5:21-24), Enoch lived 365 years, far less than the other patriarchs in the period before the Flood. Enoch allegedly walked with God who turned him into the archangel Metatron.He called the people back to his forefathers' religion, but only a few listened to him, while the majority turned away. According to the Talmud Selections when the people went astray, Enoch who lived a pious life in seclusion was given prophethood. He came among the people and by his sermons and speeches made the people give up the idolatory and obey the Command of God. Enoch ruled them and during his reign there was peace and justice.Prophet Enoch and his followers left Babylon for Egypt. There he carried on his mission, calling people to what is just and fair, teaching them certain prayers and instructing them to fast on certain days and to give a portion of their wealth to the poor.Enoch was the first to invent books and writing, much like Thoth the scribe.The ancient Greeks declare that Enoch is the same as Mercury / Hermes Trismegistus writing the Emerald Tablets of Thoth.Enoch taught the sons of men the art of building cities, and enacted some admirable laws. He discovered the knowledge of the Zodiac, and the course of the Planets; and he pointed out to the sons of men, that they should worship God, that they should fast, that they should pray, that they should give alms, votive offerings, and tenths. He reprobated abominable foods and drunkenness, and appointed festivals for sacrifices to the Sun, at each of the Zodiacal Signs.Enoch's name signified in the Hebrew, Initiate or Initiator. The legend of the columns, of granite and brass or bronze, erected by him, is probably symbolical. That of bronze, which survived the flood, is supposed to symbolize the mysteries, of which Masonry is the legitimate successor from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths, unknown to the world at large, and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition, embodied in symbols, emblems, and allegories.There was a substantial Zoroastrian Influence on Judaism when Jewish exiles were exposed to the Persian religion during the Babylonian captivity. Some Jews adopted Enochian tradition in Babylon during the Exile and brought it back to Canaan when Cyrus gave them leave to Return. The Enochian Jews were detested by the priesthood in Jerusalem, and they were forced to flee into the desert before 300 BCE. Naturally, they supported the Maccabees during the uprising of 165 BCE. The Enochians at Qumran 'updated' the text to include Judah the Hammer in the big story.The last of the Essene stragglers buried the secret book in Cave IV at Qumran c.70 CE. The urban Christians and Jews of the Near East rejected it. The authors of the Apocalypse rewrote and retitled it, but they didn't understand the heptadic structure of the original lines, the arrangement of sevens. Only the students of the Merkabah in Babylonia possessed the key to the Enochian mystery.The Book of Enoch is a pseudo-epigraphal work that claims to be written by a biblical character. It was not included in either the Hebrew or most Christian biblical canons, but could have been considered a sacred text by the sectarians. The original Aramaic version was lost until several Dead Sea Scroll fragments were discovered in Qumran Cave 4 - providing parts of the Aramaic original.The Book of Enoch was first discovered in Abyssinia in the year 1773 by a Scottish explorer named James Bruce. In 1821 The Book of Enoch was translated by Richard Laurence and published in a number of successive editions, culminating in the 1883 edition.Enoch acts as a scribe, writing up a petition on behalf of the fallen angels, or fallen ones, to be given to a higher power for ultimate judgment.Christianity adopted some ideas from Enoch, including the Final Judgment, the concept of demons, the origins of evil and the fallen angels, and the coming of a Messiah and ultimately, a Messianic kingdom.The Book of Enoch was removed from the Bible and banned by the early church. Copies of it were found to have survived in Ethiopia, and fragments in Greece and Italy.Enoch is the supposed author of 366 books, collectively termed Enochian literature. The most famous writings bearing his name are the First, Second, and Third Books of Enoch, ranked among the large body of literature termed apocryphal and pseudepigraphical, meaning that they are noncanonical (not accepted into the body of recognized books of the Bible) and are-in the case of the pseudepigrapha-attributed to some person of note and written in the style of genuine biblical books. Most interesting of all the legends is the one in which Enoch was transported to heaven and there transformed into the angel Metatron. Once there, he was, with the divine flourish, made into Metatron, the angel of the face, high priest of the heavenly temple, and one of the supreme angels in all of the celestial hierarchy-not to mention the tallest of angels, with 36 wings and 265,000 eyes.The three so-called pseudepigraphical works were allegedly written by or under the influence of the antediluvian patriarch Enoch, who was taken up to heaven by the Lord, an event described in the Book of Genesis (5:24); pseudepigraphical writings are those that are noncanonical (meaning not accepted into the body of biblical books) and were composed in a style intending to resemble or appear as authentic biblical literature, often assuming the title of some personage known to the audience. In the case of the Books of Enoch, the actual writers or compilers chose a figure who was the source of many legends and tales, the most notable being his transformation by God into the truly powerful angel Metatron. While decidedly uncanonical, the three books remain fascinating and colorful reading, as well as treasures of detail and fanciful images concerning angels.1 ENOCH-Known also as the Ethiopic Book of Enoch from the fact that the only surviving complete manuscript of it is in Ethiopic , this is the oldest of the three Enoch books, dating to the mid-second century B.C., although it actually comprises various sections, each dated differently: \\"The Book of Noah\\"; \\"Similitudes\\"; \\"The Dream Visions\\"; \\"Apocalypse of the Weeks\\"; and \\"The Book of the Heavenly Luminaries.\\" Aside from material on Gehenna and heaven and the nature of evil, the text is full of stories and accounts of angels. The writer covers the fall of angels, the names of the archangels, and the fire of the luminaries of heaven. The reader thus encounters such angelic personages as Raguel, Uriel, Gabriel, Raphael, Michael, and Saraqael.2 ENOCH-Known also as the Slavonic Book of Enoch because the only extant version is a Slavonic translation of the Greek original text, this specific edition dates to the seventh century A. D., although it is based on a much older Jewish text of the first century. A.D. While similar in some ways to the first book of Enoch and perhaps using it as a source, the Slavonic Enoch details Enoch's journey through the seven heavens, the life of Enoch's successors, especially Methuselah, and then gives a forecast of the Great Flood that encompassed the world in later generations. There are descriptions of angels residing in the heavens.3 ENOCH-Also called the Hebrew Apocalypse of Enoch, this is a Jewish writing dating probably to the second century A.D. It was allegedly written by the noted Rabbi Ishmael, a brilliant scholar of Palestine during the early second century A.D. He reputes to recount his journey to heaven, where he beheld the very throne of God, along with the hosts of angels. His information was granted to him by the archangel Metatron, the onetime patriarch Enoch. This work remains perhaps the single greatest compendium of angelic lore, including a comprehensive assemblage of angels, archangels, and holy creatures, such as the watchers and holy ones."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"The Book of Enoch will open your eyes to some questions you've been asking.

The best thing to do is to compare specific parts of the book that is referenced to specific parts of the Bible. After doing so, then you can make a determination as to whether it is valid."},{"Title":"The Book of Enoch","review":"There seem to be three sorts of book on Enoch available these days.The first kind would be texts of the relevant material (Ethiopian 1Enoch, Slavonic 2Enoch, Hebrew 3Enoch, and Jubilees) including out-of-copyright reprints of editions and translations of R.H. Charles and other late 19th Century scholars, as well as newer versions such as the standard Old Testament Pseudepigrapha edited by Charlesworth.The second kind would be commentaries and analysis from modern scholars, such as George Nickelsburg and James Vanderkam.The third kind, which in terms of both number and sales probably make up the majority, are written by enthusiasts for the Enoch story per se.The Rev. Brown falls into the third category, about which there is nothing wrong in itself. After all, everyone is entitled to accept or not accept the authority of ancient texts and traditions, and the sections of 1Enoch found among the Dead Sea Scrolls prove that this tradition is older than the Christian New Testament. The Coptic Orthodox Church in Ethiopia has long accepted 1Enoch as part of their canon, and during the 19th Century as translations of Ethiopic 1Enoch appeared in English many American denominations have made some use of Enoch traditions.However if one is going to present &quot;Enoch: A Cross-Reference Exegesis of the Holy Bible&quot; there should be critical analysis of the texts so &quot;cross-referenced&quot;.For example it is not enough to point out that Jude 9 is related to 1Enoch 9, one should also ask how and why. In 1Enoch 9 Michael accuses the leader of the rebel angels, but in Jude 9 the writer, using material drawn from Zechariah 3, contradicts this and says Michael would not even rebuke. The same goes for the other quotes of 1Enoch in Jude.Another example : anyone can see that there is a correspondence between &quot;angels&quot; and &quot;sons of God&quot; in Luke 20:36 and the angels marrying in 1Enoch 1, but we need to ask this: Is Jesus agreeing with 1Enoch or disagreeing?I'm sorry but anyone wanting a book about Enoch would be much better served by 'Enoch : A Man for All Generations' (Studies on Personalities of the Old Testament) written the head of Hebrew at University of Notre Dame, James C.

Some things have to be accepted in faith, and then sometimes the truth is mixed in with personal perceptions or interpretations. Say for example someone might argue that perhaps Aaron, Moses' brother in law was of Asian descent instead of Midian because Asians worked in the area or lived near by, and that some how this would tie into a reaching argument proposing that GOD came to Asians first with an attempt later to hide information or change History. I know that this is far reaching but in fact some people do these things. The truth is these sorts of things do not matter. We are all esteemed by GOD and He justifies us. So it isn't necessary to get caught up in such issues. It doesn't matter whether or not Aaron was Asian or who GOD came to first. What matters is that He came and made it so all people can know HIM.

It was only in the twilight of his life that this political giant was accorded the respect he deserves."},{"Title":"Goldwater","review":"This book is spectacular...it gives an in-depth view into the life of Barry Goldwater, one of the founders of conservatism in America.

At times his generalities about Hannibal's (contrasted to Rome's) political philosophy and psychology are confusingly vague. However, he does provide a solid account of the likely cause and course of this almost legendary war-leader's doomed struggle to break Rome's challenge to Carthaginian supremacy in maritime trade.The descriptions of strategies, battles, outcomes and options are well done. Baker's numerous biographies of ancient emperors and empires usually gave an informed critique of military probabilities.I prefer this book to that of Leonard Cottrell, its closest competitor. Cottrell is rather disjointed and discursive, trying to blend travelogue with history. Baker sticks to the chronological narrative and is easy to follow, thanks to the now outmoded (but useful) technique of providing topical sub-headings in the margins of each page.If you are looking for a strictly military account, then try John Lazenby's _Hannibal's War_, now available in a paperback version. If you want a reliable introduction to Hannibal providing good background as well as a review of the military action and diplomatic effects, then Baker is a cut above the others.He provides sufficient footnotes to elucidate issues where Baker quibbles with his ancient sources, Polybius and Livy or where the two sources can't be reconciled. He shows that he is conversant with the scholarship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a work of popular history, the lack of access to scholarly debate since 1929 is not too troubling.Baker, for example provides and interesting discussion on the way in which Rome most likely managed to build up a fleet to challenge Carthage in short order.Recommended for high school and college undergraduate collateral reading in courses on Ancient History."},{"Title":"Christmas Stories (Standard Literature Series)","review":"This printing by General Books is unreadable.

Dunlap uses William James's definition of religion (and the Hebrew Thought approach), though Websters defines religion as:1) man's expression of his his acknowledgment of the divine; or2) a system of beliefs and practices relating to the sacred and uniting its adherents in a community; or3) something which has a powerful hold on a person's way of thinking, interests, etc. (is beer my religion?)To Dunlap, &quot;religion is how we make (ultimate) sense of our lives in the context of the universe&quot;, and he seems to support the possibility that any ideology or world-view can be thought of, and even benefit from, a religious approach. He uses sources from his own (devout) Catholic background to selectively define words such as &quot;spirituality&quot; (why not just use the dictionary), and litters the text with loaded language (preach, spirit, scripture, sacred, beliefs, etc.) that does nothing to justify assertions (because they can be inserted in critique of any ideology, movement or cause). For example, without adequate explanation or clarification, he says &quot;people hung prints (of Ansel Adams)....in much the same spirit and...fervor as immigrant Catholics placing the Sacred Heart of Jesus...&quot; (why was it similar, and why is this different than hanging a picture of MLK, or any other &quot;honored&quot; person, place, or thing), and states that action was needed to incorporate a quest for &quot;scriptures&quot; that expressed (environmentalism's) deepest convictions (as if there was a call to an environmental saint to write it all down). To his credit, he uses numerous endnotes, quotes, and references (though many are dubious in relationship to what environmentalism really &quot;seeks&quot; or how they support any but the broadest assertion).As a limited historical documentation on the origins of the American environmental movement alone, this often disjointed account might be worth a read, and a few valid &quot;similarities&quot; between religiosity and environmentalism are presented; however, the fundamental assertion that &quot;environmentalism is a religion&quot; is not backed up by any significant compelling evidence (perhaps only if one is *very* loose with what constitutes religion). In his flawed analysis, Dunlap subscribes to notions such as &quot;faith in science&quot;, a &quot;Marxist faith&quot;, and even says that Steven J. Gould (among others) &quot;argues&quot; that &quot;science is all we need&quot;, something that was certainly not SJG's position at all. He states that there was the need for an &quot;environmental myth&quot; (to form a coherent vision to counter incompatible modern environmental enlightenment and blind consumptivism, and because of some of the movements failures) that was played out by things such as exclamations about our bodies feeding the earth's cycles, the Good of saving the plant, and Evil destruction of nature's processes.In short, his knowledge of American environmental history is deep, while his conclusions are forced. He asserts that environmentalists seek to answer ethical/moral questions (OK), and environmentalism is a religion because:-*certain people* involved in the movement *have used* religious terminology;-*some* view wilderness (as a state or place) as sacred, and the real connection (ecological, evolutionary, etc.) we actually have to the natural world is manifested in some as a &quot;spiritual&quot; connection;-some seek to evangelically educate people and influence public behavior to change habits known to be detrimental to the biosphere; and-most say humans are not the only important thing on the planet, and challenge anthropocentric assumptions.Apparently to Dunlap, all of these &quot;ideas&quot;, and more, prove that environmentalism seeks to find answers to basic religious questions (we came from and are a part of the earth), holds a belief in the sacred (i.e. wilderness as a temple) that results in worship of nature (road trip in the fall to &quot;wild&quot; New Hampshire to pray before the multi-colored maples), and tries to &quot;convert&quot; those that don't agree.Worst of all, the book is &quot;Amerocentric&quot; in it's focus (barely touching on Europe and nothing about any other part of the world where environmentalism is a significant force), glosses over such fundamental complex issues such as those apparently confused religious environmentalists (Buddhists, Native Americans, Rev. John: Greenpeace member), fails to provide a coherent explanation as to what prayers, ceremonies, codes, scriptures, etc (all basic to any religion) Environmentalism as religion is based around, and does not even discuss his fundamental assumption (or methodology in religious analysis) as to why Marxism, science, atheism, capitalism, (ad infantum) may also be viewed on as religions (because this is critical to the analysis and his conclutions).Though the book is pretty flawed and jumps around quite a bit, it's worth a read for anyone interested in religion, philosophy, and/or environmentalism."},{"Title":"Faith in Nature: Environmentalism as Religious Quest (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books)","review":"Robert Dunlap has attempted to write a book \\"suspended from academic judgments\\" in order to establish a better understanding of the roots of environmentalism. Whereas much of common literature has linked environmental degradation to Christian ideologies of improvement and dominion over the natural world, Dunlap has hastily supplied the notion that Christianity actually nurtures environmental roots. Dunlap declares himself a longtime Christian, and argues that Christianity played a major role in the growth and evolution of environmentalism.Just as many other scholars have done before him, Dunlap outlines the beginnings of environmentalism with nineteenth century ecology movement. Early ponderings of the natural world and ecosystems were done by religious men and therefore hold within them not only religious characteristics but religious jargons and lessons. John Burroughs may have written and cleverly titled his book The Gospel of Nature and John Muir may have transplanted every religious idea to fit grandeur of the Sierras but the fact remains that Christianity played a much larger role in the destruction of the natural world than in the preservation of it. That particular point has been argued much more successfully by Carolyn Merchant in her many works.Dunlap spends the second half of the book attempting to relate the efforts of post-industrial humanity to get back to its natural roots with some sort of a religious quest. The half developed argument is that humans (though he truly only focuses on Westerners) have for one hundred years or so been developing environmental and natural experiences into religious experiences. To supplement his argument Dunlap touches up on well known environmental histories like Rachel Carson's rise to fame, and the ecology movement of the 1960's.Faith in Nature takes an awkward twist towards the end when Dunlap begins suggesting a dozen different ways the environmentalists can improve their methods by observing a religious model. It becomes clear to the reader that Dunlap's scant attempt at remolding environmental history was to set up this proposed partnership between environmentalism and religion in the modern world. Crinkled eyebrows, chuckles, and the realization of lost time accompany the reader in the concluding chapter.Aside from my discrepancies above, there are many flaws in Dunlap's scholarship. Firstly, Dunlap misrepresented the intentions of a few major scientific figures of the past (Sagan and Darwin come to mind). His argument could be more convincing if he used more evidence and less rhetoric. Dunlap was overly blatant in his use of selective vocabulary. Whenever possible, he used words like prophecy, hymn, sacred, disciple, faith etc. He always used these sorts of religious words in reference to ecologist, environmentalists, or environmental ideas. Even some of the chapter titles are suspicious. Chapter 1, \\"Newton's Disciples,\\" suggests that Newton is like Jesus. Chapter 2, \\"Emerson's Children,\\" suggests that Emerson is like God. Dunlap ceases to use this sort of word placement during his long examination of William Cronon's contribution to environmentalism. (It should be noted that Cronon wrote the \\"Foreword\\" to this book and placed Dunlap on pedestal while doing so.)Dunlap typically would begin and end a chapter with a humble tone of shared exploration between author and reader. However, the content of the chapter was tattered with useless comparisons and selective vocabulary in an attempt to convince the reader of a distant argument. Supplementing these comparisons were many choppy, and short quotes that more resembled tabloid headlines than academic analysis."},{"Title":"Faith in Nature: Environmentalism as Religious Quest (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Books)","review":"No time to read over Christmas, but a quick look through the book confirms my interest in reading this approach.

The poetry of Lord Byron is still widely admired and many collections exist. For example, The Poetical Works of Byron, Cambridge edition, is more than a thousand pages despite its use of a moderately small font. Byron was clearly a prolific poet.How does one create a small gift edition of Lord Byron's poetry? This little edition, titled Lord Byron, offers a small sampling of Byron's poetry that is quite good. It is a thin, hardcover book of sixty-one pages and is slightly taller and wider than a standard paperback. Twelve pages are devoted to paintings appropriate to the individual poems. The font is large and easy to read. The format is attractive and suitable as a small gift.The editor, Peter Porter, argues that much of the longer poetry of Lord Byron is actually his best. Accordingly, Porter offers short selections from Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, The Island, The Vision of Judgment, Beppo, and Don Juan. The smaller poems include Adrian's Address to His Soul When Dying - She Walks in Beauty - So, We'll Go No More a Roving - Martial, Book 1, Epigram 1- On This Day I Complete My Thirty-Sixth Year.In a three page introduction Peter Porter provides an intriguing look at the fascinating life of Lord Byron. It can easily be argued that Byron's remarkable, and sometimes notorious exploits, have come to symbolize English Romanticism.Explanatory footnotes are not provided, but are seldom needed. A few references to Greek mythology and a few archaic poetic terms may not be familiar, but most readers should not have any particular difficulty with the poems in this short collection. This attractive, little book can serve not only as an introduction to Lord Byron's poetry, but also an inducement for the reader to become more familiar with English Romantic Poetry."},{"Title":"Can This Child Be Saved?

Reading this book was a wondrous SOUL experience.Why unusual? You breathe freedom in his words. They soar high and reach into untold heights without carrying the weight of labels. Even though his poetry is infinitely spiritual, it is not linked to any religion in particular, but embraces the core of wisdom that resides in all of the different ways mankind tries to connect with the ultimate truth, God, the Creator. He finds Him in every dancing molecule, transforming into a dancing molecule himself in order to touch the Whole. It seems to me that his approach to the Divine is the fruit of an uncommon intimacy with what binds our human nature to our Source. He knows something about the reality of ONENESS. Reading Eric P. McCarty's poems means to travel far, to a higher level of consciousness, where the air is pure and where there are no limits to transparency. He gives emotions that convey purity, beauty, harmony, peace, LOVE. The Author, seeing the sacredness of life in all things and creatures, combines masterfully the yearning for Divine love and its fulfilment with our human exigencies of tangible earthly warmth and love, conferring an incredible touch of overwhelming sensuality to his poems. This amazingly appealing mixture of the Divine and the Human reaches results that I do not hesitate to define absolutely irresistible. I enjoyed the dance and my horizon of perception of the Divine has widened, thanks to this inspiring book. In my opinion Eric P. McCarty's poems are masterpieces and as such they will conquer the world."},{"Title":"Trauma and Survival: Post-Traumatic and Dissociative Disorders in Women","review":"This book is a little intimidating at first.

Frankly, the only part of the book that did not ring true to me involved the sections where E. G. imagines being a leader for a gay paramilitary group.

If you are looking for a good introduction to the conflict, this is a possible starting place, but take it with a grain of salt and realize that you are reading a pro-Palestinian author. As you probably know, both sides are guilty of horrendous crimes, but the author bends over backwards to justify those committed by the Palestinians (e.g. acts of self-defense) while not extending the same courtesy to the Israelis.

It's easy to take it as unbiased on the surface, but anyone who does research into the entire conflict and its history can see that the author leaves out many of the Palestinian horrors that contribute to it. I recommend the book for anyone that is searching for information regarding international law and Israel's offenses of such laws, but beyond that, I caution anyone looking for an unbiased perspective.

The intentions (we historians are always cautious about professing certainty about intentions) of the Israelis are always to oppress Palestinians and seize their land. Bennis ignores the role of the Palestinian leadership and the Arab states after 1967. Her eulogy to Yasir Arafat is strange. Much of the book is about the sufferings of the Palestians in the territories. Many of the facts are wrong or given peculiar interpretations. For example, the British ended the Mandate in 1947 (p. 12), the \\"remnants of the ancient Jewish kingdom, which was conquered by Rome in 70 CE\\" (11); many of the author's \\"facts\\" prior to 1947 are actually propaganda (eg, pp.11-12), not undisputed events. The author even manages to turn Oslo into a polemic against \\"Israel\\" (always a faceless abstraction, as if there has always been a unified Israeli policy since 1967; the \\"Palestinians\\" are always humanized in the plural).

She does not seem at all interested in engaging those who disagree with her, and it will not likely change anybody's opinions of the conflict. There is no merit in this book as a literary work, yet it also fails as propaganda because she has confined her audience to the already-converted.

The many photographs and drawings add to the scenes, but it is his articulate writing style that reveals an excellent writer sharing the world he knows. Robinson is a pseudonym for a man who served with the British Army and in overseas forces.For the writers:If battles are part of your story whether modern, fantasy, science fiction, history, war, romance, every genre, then seeing real heroes in action adds to your knowledge base and will make your warriors and their fights believable.Suppose a highly trained SAS agent who is caught by time finds himself in the midst of the &quot;French and Indian War&quot; or &quot;The War of the Roses.&quot; Imagine the great advantage for the &quot;Redcoats&quot; if a team of specialists happened to cross the Bermuda Triangle and find themselves in the midst of American war for Independence. There is no limitation for imagination.As I read this book, I felt as if I were a miner plucking nuggets with every shifting of the sand. I hit the golden mother lode. Though I had purchased this book as a reference for my own creativity I found myself absorbed and involved -- Mike Robinson has crafted a masterpiece.The book:The SAS was formed in Africa over 50 years ago. The Regiment still wins most of their confrontations. Why? To become a member a man must overcome a wide range of training that includes physical, mental, weapon, equipment, paratrooping, medical, analysis, and more. The consistent training means that every member knows what to expect from others, and they build on a bond of absolute trust within each four-man Sabre Squadron.Robinson's dedication in the Preface is a profound statement of his respect for these heroes: &quot;For the cornerstone of their success has always been, and will always be, the individual SAS soldiers themselves. It is they who win, because they dare, often against impossible odds and at the cost of their lives. To these men this book is dedicated.&quot;Overviews of the chapters:* Joining the SAS -- volunteers must pass challenges that include navigation by compass and distance in areas that do not provide visible landmarks; jungles, deserts, mountains, or any place where weather has limited the visibility. Additionally, to become a member of the SAS each man must endure exhaustion and pain in their effort to reach the next rendezvous.* Weapons Skills -- beginning with a day in 1972 when 250 guerrillas attacked nine SAS soldiers who, with a few local gendarmes and tribesmen, defeated the attackers this book documents weapons, skills, and uses including: snipers, battles, armament, intrusion defensive positions, and more.* Explosives and Sabotage -- with knowledge and training SAS four-man patrol can cause damage that brings aggressive enemies to a stop.* Counter-Terrorist Tactics -- terrorists are analyzed and a group of no more than 50 full-time soldiers are on call to defend and defeat terrorism tactics. This section includes descriptions of a warfare kit, dress, weapons, and exercises in the &quot;Killing House.&quot;* Fighting as a Four-man Team -- each regiment consists of four four-men troop specialists: medic, communications, linguist, and demolitions expert; also each man has at least one specific patrol skill. As their experiences with the SAS increases, so does the variety of these skills.* Silent Killing Skills -- to survive when behind enemy lines each member is trained to kill without being seen. Various tools and methods are described.* Medical Expertise -- trained to use what is available in the locale and in a med pack, these men help their comrades and friendly causalities.* Civil Disorder Control -- in the midst of civil unrest extremists often use the turmoil to further their own ends. The Regiment have skills to &quot;surgically remove&quot; the subversives.* Observing the Enemy -- camouflage and concealment skills allow a patrol to move into &quot;hot spots&quot; and strategize for victory.* Signals and Radio Skills -- all soldiers are trained in the art of using communication equipment, hand and body signals, and Morse code.* Behind Enemy Lines -- this includes destroying enemy communications, rescue missions, and survival.* Staying Hidden -- trained to remain hidden even in the most boring or difficult conditions is the difference between success and failure. The SAS has embraces Risk.* Operating in Hostile Regions -- SAS troops work and battle in the freezing arctic, hot humid jungles, barren desert sands, islands or on the ocean.* Specialist Insertion Methods -- heavy transport aircraft, parachuting from high or low altitudes, helicopters where troops rappel down from the fuselage, canoes and other water flotation devices and stealth are only part of the skills used to reach the mission location.* Booby Traps -- these devices are designed to maim rather than kill, and defeat the enemy's morale. The loss of morale creates carelessness, fear, and suspicion.* Glossary -- of the weapons and equipment used by the SAS.Five stars -- for the excellent writing, photography, drawings, and information this book. It is not only an excellent reference book, it is an incredible history."},{"Title":"Fighting Skills of the Sas","review":"Talk about getting a &quot;two for one&quot; deal!

If you are trying to rationalize the new system to your coworkers, you will need this book (and much more). If you don't know anything about metadata in the creative arts, this book is a decent place to start. It is practical education and the information is generally accessible. the topic gets esoteric quickly, though; DAM is a narrow field of database development and using DAM for television systems adds another level of specialization.The authors present valuable lessons in the fundamentals of DAM usage, benefits from real world applications of DAM, metadata creation and entry, and descriptions of existing controlled vocabulary systems and taxonomy structures. However, this is only one piece of the metadata and digital asset management puzzle. You will need much more information and research to design, purchase and build a system that works in your facility or company.What's missing? In-dpeth product evaluations and suggestions on how to select a decent solution.

Dr. Feinberg describes a political scandal as &#65533;anything in a public official&#65533;s professional or personal life that defies the code of conduct Americans set for themselves.&#65533; She astutely notes that since morals change, so may the behavior thought sufficient to reach scandal status. She excludes scandals that do not involve political or personal morality (although many early scandals such as the &#65533;Peggy Eaton Affair&#65533; seem to fall outside this scope), and does not discuss unverified accusations. Thus, she mentions (in Chapter 1) that there &#65533;is no mention&#65533; of the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings or the charge that the release of hostages in Iraq was timed to influence the 1980 election.For the most part, the book focuses on egregious and important scandals, along with a few of the more vivid episodes (e.g., the beating of Senator Sumner in the Senate Chamber, and the Hamilton/Burr duel) to keep things interesting. Dr. Feinberg categorizes the many scandals into &#65533;Violent Political Quarrels,&#65533; &#65533;Controversial Election Returns,&#65533; &#65533; Affairs of the Heart,&#65533; &#65533;Political Office for Personal Profit,&#65533; &#65533;Public Displays of Personal Misconduct,&#65533; &#65533;and &#65533;Abuse of Power.&#65533; Unfortunately, the book predates the impeachment of Clinton, and the 2002 election irregularities, although there is an excellent section on the abuses of Iran-Contra (although the defense position is not discussed). She wisely concludes, &#65533;although the government is not scandal proof, it is not permanently scandal-ridden,&#65533; and she reminds readers of the governmental and journalistic checks against scandal. Although limited by its brevity, Dr. Feinberg presents three theories about the prevalence of scandal in the Grant, Harding, Nixon, and Reagan eras. Teachers and students will be pleased with the book&#65533;s bibliography, glossary, six pages of source notes, timeline, and index."},{"Title":"Divine Sovereignty and Human Freedom: Seeing Both Sides","review":"I have read several books relating to predestination, election, free will..etc. In my opinion, this book is the best on this subject. It offers references from many different commentators and scholars not just the author's own bias. The first half of the book deals with an overview of the topic. It is very helpful in getting up to speed on the history, views, terms and issues involved. The second half of the book deals specifically with verses in the Bible relating to these issues. As for someone who has been on both sides of these issues (Calvinism vs. Arminianism), this book is very convicting because it spends a great deal of time in looking at the key Bible verses involved. And that is the most important aspect - what the Bible actually says not what our Theology thinks that it should say. I am amazed how many Christians put into Scripture their own personal view or bias instead of taking out of Scripture what God is actually saying. This book is a must read for anyone who is seriously interested in learning what the Bible teaches concerning predestination and election. It is a serious study on the subject. It is concise with the focus being on Scripture and it is without all of the fluff, emotion, and bias from other sometimes larger books. It seems every Christian has a passionate view on this issue. This book will challenge your view from a Biblical basis.

This is an excellent book on the issue of electionand free will and is a potent tool against Calvinism.

Huss, Wycliffe, and Calvin held to the same position as Luther, that the unregenerated man is a slave to sin and thus has no ability to \\"choose\\" God. Regeneration first, then faith exists. I've read Luther's Bondage of the Will and find it refreshing compared to Erasmus' position. I was disappointed when I read Fisk's take on Romans 3:11 \\"There is none that seeketh after God\\" and I found Fisk giving a classic aguement given by Erasmus. Why wont Erasmus and Pelagius stay dead?"},{"Title":"The future of conservatism,","review":"First published in 1968 and revised in 1969, this book provides a snapshot from within the thick of those controversial times which according to Evans the demise of Liberalism occurs. This is a period in time when those events swirled above my head beyond my immediate concern, my focus being entirely occupied with my dealings with my local draft board and imminent induction into military service.I hadn't consciously thought about it until I read Evans, is that conservatism is not the bailiwick of the GOP but the GOP is a place where conservatism can more fully develop its roots. Stanton defines those roots (pp. 3) as unifying themes: \\"insistence on the primacy of the individual, a resulting desire for effective restraints on the exercise of political power, and a consequent antagonism to the overblown establishment in Washington.\\" He then summarizes these themes as a resistance to \\"the extension of Federal power.\\"The advantage of reading Evans now is that I have the benefit of the outcome of history by which to judge his words. In particular, his view of the support for the war in Vietnam (pp. 85-86) seems to be a litmus test of conservatism. The conservative's point of view was that support for our involvement was standing up to the global threat of communism but this seems to be at odds with the overreaching definition of conservatism given above. In retrospect, history judges our involvement in Vietnam, whether liberal or conservative, as misguided. However, the ascendency of conservatism over the past forty years has justified his primary thesis regarding its viability in our age.One aspect of Evans' writing is his commitment to ideas communicated by the written and spoken word. He believes that the conservative abounds in these talents whereas the liberal, vies a vie the bearded campus rebel, lacks the focus necessary to convince the public at large. Now here is where I must interject my thoughts on ideas because I believe ideas evolve out of a desire for change. A conservative would seem to be committed to status quo and thus ideology; so therefore he would rework his historical arguments rather than develop a fresh approach.John Dewey, at least in the field of education, is one of the preeminent liberals that Evans says is currently held in disrepute but he is silent on Dewey's reputation in the field of ideas in general. Thus, Evans is to be commended because he is careful to reference other liberals and statistical poles for the support for his statements rather than engage in a blind ideological polemic as do modern commentators.Antother very interesting aspect that Evans mentions in passing are a few of the then conservative theoreticians such as, Forrest McDonald, Russell Kirk, etc. but the emphasis of his work is on the nuts and bolts of moving the conservative ideology into the mainstream of American politics. His analysis of the Goldwater's 1964 Presidential campaign in capturing the GOP nomination to the surprise of the liberal wing of the party by making inroads to Southern conservatism is quite persuasive and further; had JFK not been assassinated, Goldwater may well have been elected.The GOP's appeal to Southern conservatism i.e. the \\"Southern Strategy\\" as coined by Kevin Phillips in his 1969 book The Emerging Republican Majority is still much in debate today. This debate centers around the underlying factors, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the rising socio-economic status of Southern whites post WW-II that were in play at the time, that made the strategy successful. Evan's deals with Goldwater's appeal to Southern whites (pp. 152-154) visa vie Goldwater's vote against the Act as being consistent with the principles of conservatism rather than an alleged appeal to segregationist as liberals would have tarred him with. Scholars today, such as Byron Shafer and Richard Johnston in the recent book The End of Southern Exceptionalism, believe that they have statistically factored out the aforementioned factors and can show that race was only a secondary factor while others such as Dan T. Carter, the author of The Politics of Rage, argue otherwise.Evans offers a perspective in Chapter 17; The Power of Negative Thinking, which addresses my earlier concern: conservatism's lack of ideas and their \\"resentments against the burgeoning costs of the welfare state.\\" His response (pp. 204) to the liberal wing of the GOP is that \\"The proper course for those who believe such things are wrong is to oppose them, not to invent some half-wrong to put in their place.\\" This certainly makes sense but where do politics and compromise come into play? It would seem that the result of such dynamics would also result in a half-wrong.I don't consider myself a conservative but Evans has provided a reasonably fair and balanced point of view so lacking in today's political dialogue."},{"Title":"Getting Control: Overcoming Your Obsessions and Compulsions","review":"This book is an essential read for those with OCD or those who want to learn more about OCD.

Material on pigments also was relevant to watercolor (something in which I dabble) and pastels (one of my major areas).

It would have been nice to get a slight discussion of materials not \\"professional\\", such as wax crayons."},{"Title":"The artist's handbook of materials and techniques","review":"I am an amateur artist with some very serious questions about the painting process.

I am embarassed that I only recently became aware of this amazing tome. As I scanned through the chapter listings, I was excited and delighted by the fact that it appears to address every question that I have... and then so much more. When I started skipping through the actual content of the book I was awestruck by the comprehensive and thorough treatment that it gives every aspect of the craft of painting. I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the most exciting book that I have put my hands on in a long time. This is my bible. My religion is paint."},{"Title":"The artist's handbook of materials and techniques","review":"This book is absolutely essential for any serious artist's bookshelf. I always find it helpful to just browse through or use it to look something up in particular. The glossary is pretty detailed as well as the index so it's fairly easy to find what you're looking for if you know the specifics of the material or technique.I love that it gives various options and reasons for using various techniques depending on your needs. For example, in the priming section, there are examples of how you should prime wood vs. canvas as well as various myths that go along with preparing surfaces and why some work and don't for archival purposes. This is such an interesting book! It goes into great detail as far as pigments go. What someone should be mixing as far as oil, watercolor, tempera pigments go and toxicity levels of them. This book is also really helpful as an introductory level book to as it goes into proper technique for basics like stretching canvas. I only warn that the text can get pretty dense if you don't have enough experience so travel with caution. I definitely feel that this is an essential for every artist whether you work in paint, sculpture, or digital.

I had no idea what they were because they are called something different in the US, plus many other newer materials weren't mentioned. The book was quite dated, and it made me wish I'd sprung a few extra dollars to get the 5th edition.But still, this book (perhaps the 5th edition rather than the 4th) IS essential reading for any serious oil painter. (If you can understand all the very technical and long-winded information!)I wasn't taught MOST of the technical information on oil paints at all at art school! It is great to have a bit of information on how to make your paintings last for many years. (I hate the thought of putting all that work in only for them to warp or crumble or peel in time!)This book is not suitable however for beginners or amateurs who only want to know the basics about materials and so on. (This is a difficult read and very technical, in my opinion. I don't mean to say it isn't necessary and useful information though, it is.)A great book that does that is Encyclopedia of Oil Painting Techniques by Jeremy Galton which is suitable for beginners and serious painters alike (and has a LOT of pictures in it as compared to this book which is 500 pages or so of all TEXT!)."},{"Title":"The artist's handbook of materials and techniques","review":"If you are searching for a book that will explain materials and tools for the artist this is the first book you should turn to. I have been referencing this book for a decade now and still have a lot to learn from Ralph Mayer, a man who spent his life investigating various techniques of painting.If you open this book up, you will come across just about any question you might have. For instance, I recently used Mayer for egg tempra painting. In his book he has a few pages regarding the subject, not many, but enough to fully explain the basics and get you started properly. He covers brushes, pigments, paints, from the obscure to the most basic.One section of the book that I am keenly interested in is his break down of a massive number of pigments where he goes into more detail on each than any other source I have come across.This is not exactly a how to paint or draw book. This book is intended for those who want to make a serious study of process practices in the correct manner for archival purposes. This is a must have book that should be in any painters studio.One last item of note: If you have used this book before and found it of interest, I highly suggest that the next time you are around New Haven CT that you visit the Yale 'Ralph Mayer' center. Yale itself has many museums and buildings worth visiting and the Mayer center is just one small highlight. Its staff was very kind when I visited. When I showed an interest in Mayer, they were eager to share some of the more interesting aspects of the collection."},{"Title":"The artist's handbook of materials and techniques","review":"If this text were to reside in EVERY artist studio, and was referred to often, the world would be a better place. This book has been a standard reference, and in many instances a required text, for ages and for good reason. Get the revised 5th ed. but when you see earlier editions cheap, snatch them up as well. Information on things like older pigments has in some cases been dropped to make way for later additions; the handy oil index chart disappeared from the 3rd edition, that info is now included in the pigment descriptions and not near as handy; you get the idea. All this is understandable from an editor's pov but a loss non-the-less. Get the newest edition and refer to it often but don't neglect the older editions. Just because some info has been dropped doesn't necessarily mean it's obsolete or no longer relevant."},{"Title":"The artist's handbook of materials and techniques","review":"If I could recommend one book to artists looking for a serious reference to materials, materials handling, and how to produce work that will last through the centuries, this is it.One reviewer complained that it's just so much paper--&quot;a publisher's dream.&quot; Yes, but what great paper it is!"},{"Title":"Broken and Battered","review":"I found this book after just coming out of an abusive relationship which left me reeling because of the way that everyone I knew from church seemed to have turned from me and embraced my abusive husband. This book helped me to see that abuse definitly IS wrong in Christian beliefs too, and it had many statistics and issues which were very supportive to the battered woman. There were sections for the woman's friends, her pastor(and how the pastor could deal with the whole situation-even with the male), her church, and even some parts geared towards the abusing male. There were 2 main case studies which went throughout the full book, starting each chapter, which draw you in to the women's lives, but also make the battered woman reader not feel as though she was the only Christian woman who lived this life. There is a safety plan at the end of the book, which is something that every battered woman needs to have, and also contacts in the Domestic Violence arena. This is definitly a book that each church should have in it's library, and it also provides a good resource for everyone to be able to use when faced with this in their own lives or a friend's."},{"Title":"Broken and Battered","review":"After reading Broken and Battered, I felt I had to run to every Abuse Shelter for miles around and inform every woman there that there was help for her and why should she be in this situation; depressed, angered, and bitter when she could find a way out.This book is a Blessing and a real must for women in abused lives. Every Pastor should read it so that he or she might reach out to members of their congregation to spread the Word that Help Is There. I highly recommend that you read Broken and Battered and then pass it on to others who need to know that there is a way out and that others care about them."},{"Title":"Broken and Battered","review":"This was an awesome book! I also was in an abusive relationship, beaten by a Born-again Christian husband. The church was aware of what he was doing. But because he was successful, no one said anything. And he was singing like a saint in the choir. I was counseled to try and be more submissive and not get him angry. I was negated and made to feel like his beating me was no big deal and life at church went on as usual. This book tells it like it is in many churches. Havens for absusive dominant sucessful men."},{"Title":"Broken and Battered","review":"By Barbara Roberts, author ofNot Under Bondage: Biblical Divorce for Abuse, Adultery and Desertion.I read this book twice and each time it brought back vivid memories of the abusive relationship I suffered years ago. The author recounts the stories of two Christian survivors. The stories these are compelling, totally believable and compassionately told. The narratives are interwoven with discussions about scripture, doctrine, church responses, psychological consequences to domestic abuse, etc.If you are a survivor, be prepared for triggers when reading this book. But getting triggered can help us process and deal with the traumatic memories that lie behind our mental veils.Recommended to help any victim survivor who wants to work on her recovery and make the slow, painful journey towards healthy, abundant survival."},{"Title":"Broken and Battered","review":"This book is a must have for any one in an ausive relationship.

In an effort to improve my diet, I bought this cookbook.Having never been much of a cook, I did not know what to do with vegetables, how to pick them, how to cook them. Wow. This book changed everything. I learned when each vegetable was in season, how to pick the best one, the best way to cook each vegetable to bring out its flavor. The recipes are simple. The vegetables are allowed to shine, not drown in some thick sauce. They are not the second thought but the star. I never liked carrots or broccoli until I tried the recipes from this book.

The flavors are never the same for each recipe. They are uncomplicated, have easy to purchase ingredients, but the resulting flavors are complex and exotic and best of all, healthy.The vegetables are arranged by name and all the recipes from all over the world follow after each vegetable (how convenient for someone in a rush or for leftovers in the fridge!) and gives foreign equivalents of the name, descriptions, seasons, important science information on how to keep it fresh, how to detect the good ones from the bad ones, etc. for each and every vegetable. The format is in outline form which is so convenient. No lengthy, time-consuming paragraphs which I really hate.It is NOW A VERY IMPORTANT MEMBER of my cookbook library. No fancy recipes with hard to get ingredients.

But the best part are the recipes. I have lots of cookbooks that I keep for only one or two recipes, but this one has tons of good ones that I keep going back to, and many more yet that I still want to try. It's also changed the way I shop for veggies.

Written by Jack Bishop, who is featured on America's Test Kitchen, and knows his stuff. Good reference for on-the-fly cooking, great reading before a trip to the farmer's market."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I joined a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) where each week I get a portion of what ever the farmer grew which is ripe. This deliberately put me in the path of vegetables I had never cooked. The recipes in this cookbook are wonderful! I was pretty convinced that I hated turnip greens, but I gave them another shot using a recipe from this book. They were good! In fact I've liked or loved every recipe I've tried in the book and given that its the end of summer I've tried a lot.Each vegetable has a brief introduction, including the harvest times, how to choose, how to store (e.g. refrigerate for up to a week) and how to get it ready for cooking. Each vegetable has 2-10 recipes. The recipes have around 2-6 ingredients. In about 30% of the recipes, the extra ingredients are things you'll have around if you cook from scratch -- stuff like onion, garlic, spices, oils and nuts. The other recipes may require more planning ahead.I can't recommend this book enough. I'm going to get my food co-op to offer it for sale."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I use this book an average of once a week. Each chapter, arranged alphabetically by vegetable name, describes in detail what to do with that bok choy or dinosaur kale that looked so interesting when I decided to buy it and bring it home.The recipes, if you would rather not run with Mr. Bishop's helpful preparation suggestions and try something on your own, are for the most part vegetarian-friendly, and many are quite useful for vegans and others who would rather not eat peas with their butter, and so forth.A detailed, clear, and interesting book. My diet is so much more interesting (and delicious!) since buying this book."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"You know you should eat your vegetables every day, but you've run out of ideas for how to cook them? Jack Bishop to the rescue with &quot;Vegetables Every Day.&quot; This cookbook includes over 60 chapters, each devoted to a different vegetable - ranging from the &quot;ordinary&quot; carrots, broccoli, and squash to the &quot;exotic&quot; calabaza, malanga, and taro. Within each chapter there is a brief introduction including helpful information on availability, selection, storage, basic preparation, and best general cooking methods. The introduction is followed by several diverse recipes, representing a variety of flavors and cooking techniques. The vast majority of the recipes are for side dishes (and most of the others are soups or appetizers), making this book ideal for meat-and-potatos cooks looking for more variety in their veggie choices. There are very few vegetarian main courses. Most of the recipes are simple to make and use readily-available ingredients, making this a cookbook you can really use every day."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This book is completely not what I expected and hoped for after reading its description and reviews. I had been looking for a book that is a guide to how to buy, and more importantly, how to cook the many vegetables that are out there that I didn't grow up with in my meat-and-potatoes family. I've been branching out to include many many more vegetables and much more variety than what I was raised with, but there are so many vegetables that I see at the store that I have no idea what to do with. I wasn't looking for recipes so much as techniques and information. The description of this book seemed to fit, and all of the other reviewers loved it, so I bought it.I thought that this book would have detailed instructions on how to cook all of the different vegetables that he describes, but in fact, for most of the vegetables the cooking descriptions are limited to \\"boiling,\\" \\"grilling,\\" etc. How long? How hot? What size should you cut the pieces to to ensure throrough cooking? No idea...the author certainly didn't bother to say. I've got more information in the 2-or-so page cooking chart in the vegetable section of an old cookbook I have lying around than this author includes in his entire book.What I had hoped for was a book that told me HOW to prepare each vegetable and what sort of foods each vegetable complements. I thought that the 350 recipes were simply an added bonus. Unfortunately, it turns out that the recipes were by far the focus, and the vegetable descriptions are almost useless.I gave it 2 stars instead of one since it does have recipes for many unusual vegetables that other cookbooks neglect. That is a definite positive. But this book is definitely no \\"Definitive Guide\\" to anything."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"As one of those people whose idea of a heavenly four-course meal is starch, fruit, chocolate and starch, I am always trying to get more vegetables into my diet. To that end, I bought copies of Bishop's Vegetables Every Day as well as Chez Panisse Vegetables and Greens, Glorious Greens. But I only use one of them and that's this one. Chez Panisse Vegetables has great general info, but the recipes tend to be a bit fussy and complicated. Greens, Glorious Greens focuses on just what the title suggests, and might be the way to go if you want lots and lots of recipes using green, leafy vegetables. But even when I want greens, I end up using Bishop's recipes more -- his simple recipes make even bitter greens taste good and trust me -- I don't really like broccoli rabe, kale or dandelion greens or even, for that matter, spinach, but Bishop's recipes make them taste not just palatable, but downright good. Most vegetables are covered (nothing on really unusual veggie such as ramps), from the ordinary such as corn, onions and radishes, to the more unusual such as kohlrabi, boniato (a type of sweet potato) and chayote. There are fresh legumes in here as well -- fava beans and peas, etc., as well as foods that are botanically fruits or herbs but used like vegetables, including avacado and arrugula. Not everything is vegetarian, so if you like pancetta with your greens and whatnot, those recipes are here as well as vegan ones and ones that make use of dairy products.The best part of Bishop's book is his easy-to-use info and buying, storing and basic preparation and cooking methods, all organized alphabetically. The lay-out is great, there's a good index and best of all everything I've made in here, from the aforementioned bitter greens to sweet potato oven fries, has been really good. There are no pictures, but do you really needs pictures of spinach and carrots?This is that rare book that works both as a reference guide and a cook book."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I cook a lot and buy a lot of cookbooks, and this is definitely one I keep at the front of the shelf. I've never had one of the recipes fail and it's been a fantastic resource for getting everyone in the family to get out of the broccoli/grean beans rut. It's fun to go to the farmer's market knowing anything I buy I'll be able to find a way to cook!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"this book is for you! If you eat vegetables...this book is for you. In my case, I'm a vegetarian who was sick of cookbooks that use agar, seaweed, lentils and tofu ad nauseum. Vegetarians are supposed to eat vegetables but I found myself becoming a carbo-tarian - until Jack Bishop's book. It is in alphabetical order...and it is an excellent reference for every vegetable you can imagine. However, it is the fact that every single recipe is been fabulous. He makes vegetables taste like a true indulgence. Bon apettit!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This is a fantastic and beautiful cookbook. If you are looking around for recipes that can help you cook vegetables in a tasy way, look no further. This book is the answer to your prayers. It is: well-organized, EASY, delicious, varied, and just crammed with wonderful recipes. So many cookbooks you get you never make half the stuff in it. This one doesn't have a single clunker yet and they are all interesting and can be made with things you have around the kitchen. Examples: Broccoli with a Lime-Cumin Dressing, Roasted Green Beans with Garlic and Ginger, Moroccan Spiced Carrots. I am making a list and just going through the book methodically because I don't want to miss a single delicious recipe. After looking and looking for a good veggie cookbook (since I am terrible with coming up with recipes on my own), I am so happy with this one. Congratulations and thank you to Mr. Bishop!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I find myself turning to this book quite often to get some inspiring recipes with vegetables. From the best way to prepare broccoli to how to peel an artichoke - it's all in here. Tonight I made his beet salad with goat cheese. I had never made beets before - I can't believe how easy it is. Tomorrow night I'm going to prepare his baked sweet potato fries and see how that turns out. If you're in a vegetable rut - look no further. This book will help you. My one and only complaint would be that there are no helpful pictures. But that's it. I'd still highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I originally borrowed this title from the public library, but am here to purchase a copy because it is such a fabulous resource. I have tried about a dozen of the recipes and found them all to be simple to prepare, often with ingredients already stocked in my pantry, and always delicious. The information offered about each vegetable is clear, concise and very helpful. I've been surprised at dinner by my family raving about the kale or mustard greens. This book has made adding more vegetables to our diet pure pleasure."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I bought this for my mother who was trying to incorporate veggies in our family's diet. It read well and gave her lots of different ways to get my unhealthy father to eat his greens."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This book is great! I belong to a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture), and I get lots of vegetables every week, some that I've never eaten before. This book is a life-saver on telling one how to select, store, and prepare many vegetables, from the common ones to the ones I've never heard of. I use it to know a basic way to prepare each vegetable, to help me find new ways to cook common vegggies, and to know good spices that go with each vegetable. I've cooked many of the recipes, and have loved most. I don't always like everything Bishop suggests - for my taste he overprocesses some vegetables (e.g. peeling celery for cooking, de-seeding cucumber). But I still enjoy the suggestions. Try Roasted Asparagus, Braised Carrots with Orange-Honey Glaze, and Maple-Braised Turnips and Carrots. This book is not particularly a low-fat book (some cooking with butter and cream, for example). Also, it is not particularly a \\"vegetarian\\" cookbook, in that it is mostly about cooking each vegetable as a side-dish, rather than cooking full vegetarian meals. But, I still highly recommend it for helping us all to eat more veggies and make them GOOD!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I never liked vegetables as a kid. My best memories are of the canned vegetables they would serve at the cafeteria at school every day. Yuck. I thought that's the only way they tasted. Even as an adult, they were only a second thought to my meals. In an effort to improve my diet, I bought this cookbook.Having never been much of a cook, I did not know what to do with vegetables, how to pick them, how to cook them. Wow. This book changed everything. I learned when each vegetable was in season, how to pick the best one, the best way to cook each vegetable to bring out its flavor. The recipes are simple. The vegetables are allowed to shine, not drown in some thick sauce. They are not the second thought but the star. I never liked carrots or broccoli until I tried the recipes from this book. Nice book, I highly recommend it for vegetable novices like me."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I use this book at least once a week and have owned it for quite a few years. When I joined a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) I started receiving veggies I had never cooked before. Turnips, Fava Beans, Beet Greens etc. I know regardless of what is in my box, this book will have a recipe for me. There will always be at least one recipe that I will have the ingredients on hand for as well. It also had some interesting ideas for old familiar veggies - I now roast my green beans with ginger and garlic quite often especially if they are a bit old. The recipes are usually pretty straight forward and end up tasty (although my kids still haven't warmed to chards and kales). There are some fancier recipes as well - usually a range for each vegetable listed. This may be my favorite / most used cook book out of my 6' or so of cook books."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"If you love to cook and eat vegetables, this is the book for you. This book does an excellent job of teaching the basics of vegetables, including selecting, cleaning, storing, and preparing. The best way to prepare vegetables is presented, and the recipes are designed to teach the reader how to cook vegetables without having to rely on the book while in the kitchen. I've actually taught people how to roast asparagus spears with olive oil and kosher salt based on what I've learned in this book. The book will also confront some misconceptions about particular vegetables - cucumbers can be cooked! As noted by another reviewer on Library Thing, the vegetables are side dishes, not the centerpiece. But any user will find that the vegetables, well cooked and seasoned, can make a good meal great."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I just love this cooking book, because the vast majority of recipes are SIMPLE and healthy. I have a lot of other cookbooks but I almost never follow any recipe on those, for several reason: sometimes they require too many ingredients (and I have a microscopic kitchenette without any cabinet for storage, only 2 shelves), or too much prep time, or the dishes are just unhealthy.This book instead presents usually no more than a handful of ingredients and no more than a handful of steps for each.No photos, but there is no need for those.Granted that there is always some recipe that does not meet the taste of some people, but for every veggies there is ample choice and I loved those that I have tried.Also the organization is excellent, you get veggies on sale and then you go to the section for that specific veggie... so convenient!"},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I received this book as a gift from my son. This is now my go to book for vegetables. Without exception, all the recipes I've tried have been wonderful, and it has encouraged me to try vegetables I normally would not have bought (kohlrabi, for one). I couldn't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"I use this book almost every week, to check how to buy, store, or prepare particular vegetables, especially those that are so seasonal that I don't cook them that often: okra, for example. I like this book a lot for the advice it gives on Availability, Selection, Storage, Basic Preparation, and Best Cooking Methods for each vegetable. That section, at the beginning of each vegetable (the veggies are in alphabetical order, starting with Artichoke, ending with Zucchini), is two pages long. Following this basic information are 4-6 pages of recipes for that vegetable. These recipes are almost always, as another reviewer pointed out, for veggies as side dishes, not entrees. These recipes are okay, but not that exciting. Still, I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"The book details information about almost any vegetable you can think of and how to cook it. While I found the information on the different vegetable and the catagories they fall into very helpful and informative, the book does not contain as many exciting and interesting recipes as I had hoped for. I'm sure I'll use it as a reference tool since we now belong to a CSA and get vegetables that I've never cooked or eaten before but will it become my go to vegetable cookbook that I can't live without, probably not."},{"Title":"Vegetables Every Day: The Definitive Guide to Buying and Cooking Today's Produce With over 350 Recipes","review":"This is a very good book on vegetables that is informative and easy to follow.
